Like I've seen a few talented OC's around the levels of Bill and Percy Weasley but they're always called 'overpowered' and 'too talented'. But it's quite boring to read about an OC who's only just average. I don't have a problem with it.

If you're opposed to the idea, then why? I'd like to know.


** OCs are tricky because most people read fanfic to read about characters they like and are familiar with and most view OCs as interlopers, so to speak. They also have a bad history in various fandoms and being thinly-veiled stand-ins for the author or the author using them to fix everything the perceive is wrong with the original work. They have knowledge that other characters don't or possess skills that make then uniquely suited to saving the day and tend to shove the canon characters aside.

When you have a character like that, even a canon character with few flaws, they become very boring. You use Percy as an example of a canon character that's too talented, but he's deeply flawed--yes, he's powerful and talented, but he's also a total dick. We don't see Bill as much, so it's okay that he's crazy talented because he's not much of a presence and isn't chewing up the scenery like an overpowered OC.

I'm not opposed to the idea of OCs. I have quite the stable of them myself and at least one of them seems to be pretty well-liked. Your OC doesn't need to just be "average", but they do need to have some aspect of personality the reader can identify with, especially if they're going to be a main character in the story.

*** Yes, for example, my OC is almost as talented as Hermione but too arrogant, vile, and cruel with their talent. They use it for bullying and their overt arrogance in their talent leads to their downfall eventually. And it's not a 'heroe' s death'. They're basically a more talented version of Draco Malfoy. They also lack spine and never use it for good as a result, they're too afraid for rejection so they basically do anything the crowd asks of them, for fear of being ocstarized. A blackmarket of illegal potions is run by them and they eventually get expelled from the school, etc.

***** As I said, it's their fear of rejection. They basically grew up as a muggle, always believing in fairytales and desperately wanting to be part of their own world. So when they discover that it's all true, they want to fit in as much as possible, and to be part of the world they're suddenly a part of, but they're a muggleborn slytherin. Because of the environment, they start having the same ideals, slowly and steadily increasing by the years until they're part of the future death eater gang full of self loathing for his blood status, and too idealistic and ambitious. So he basically enters his own world but he wastes it by being too afraid of rejection which is his fatal flaw that leads to him working for Voldemort and eventually getting killed by the death Eaters, who he worked with. He was betrayed on a mission. It was just a cruel plan to exterminate him. He's selfish and doesn't want to expose himself to the muggle world, as he sees himself as 'special', will all the power. Then it turns into power hungry thoughts and he joins a minor Grindelwald cult and then abandons them and joins Voldemort.

He was blind to how they truly viewed him and started thinking the same stuff as them even though he, deep down, never believed it. He just wanted to live his fairytale and he paid for it. He betrays his parents, whom he dearly loved. He betrays the muggleborns of his school and he keeps bullying people of his kind, eventually starting to kill them after getting expelled in his sixth year, getting betrayed by a flew future death eater, who just wanted to get rid of him. He was used as a tool and it wasn't by magic, it was because he didn't want to be ocstarized from his own world. He's not tragic, just a spineless coward who's blind to his origins how everyone walks all over him. He thinks he's happy this way, but he's really not. He's basically what a Slytherin muggleborn in the height of the 1st war is really going to look like. He serves as a story of what NOT to be.

** It's not about how talented the OCs are, it's about the reactions to them. Most people won't care if your OCs are talented if the other characters react naturally to that and don't start randomly praising their abilities ("Oh Chad, your potion was perfect, you must have an enormous /magical core/"). But a lot of stories with strong characters (canon or OC) fail in that regard and constantly point the strengths of a character out.

The other issue I can think of is that the OCs aren't believable. No one will bat an eye if an OC duelling instructor will wipe the floor with Harry. But if Lord Habsburg-Black duels Voldemort at age 12, that won't fly.

** I don't know about "people" in general, but as far as I'm concerned it's because I've never read a well written OC Hogwarts student. Even the stuff I often see recommended around here generally sin of making the character a not-so-hidden self-insert, glomping to Harry&co without a real reason to, and generally intruding into the canon plot without actually changing it.

I mean I actually agree with you that it's boring to read about slackers and untalented characters, and I'd love to read good stories about OCs, but I just haven't /found/ any. Which I think implies they are a hell of a lot harder to write than you're making it out to be.

Not that OCs have to be average, but that authors have a habit of not just letting their OC be a person, but the bestest, most special person. While I was very annoyed that JKR stopped emphasizing (and even downplayed) Harry being a powerful wizard after PoA, it's better than making him so good he's not relatable. Just make OCs be good at some things and not good at others, people get tired of OCs used as panaceas for problems in virtue of being just naturally amazing.

*** I wouldn't call them geniuses. Dumbledore and Voldemort are what I consider geniuses, neither Bill nor Percy. I think we're using different scales but let's just say they're slightly less talented, and it's not even the focus, which happens and even in well-written fan fictions, where there not the bestest best, like for example, they're great at charms and crap at potions, but their talent in other fields is above average, just not outstanding, there are others better than them, some people consider it 'overpowered'. Like, it's how muggles work. My sister is good at English, particularly good at Chemistry and then Biology, but just not THAT good at Physics, and is above average but not outstanding in history, maths, etc. Like, I consider her smart and talented as she applies her good subjects to use, but is she a genius? No.

Bill and Percy weren't just good at things, they were so good that they were made Head Boy in their years (Head positions appear to go to those at or very near the top of the class). They're both indicated to be very, very talented. Dunno if they're literal geniuses, but really my point is just OCs don't always have to be a cut above the rest.

Head Boy is different. While it's never really elaborated on in Hogwarts specifically, in some schools, Head Boy and Head Girl are actually elected by their classmates.

They're representatives of the student body as a whole.

Head Boys are not required to have been Prefects--James Potter to name one example. Remus Lupin was Prefect, James was Head Boy.

Dawlish got top marks in all his exams, and he was a pathetic Auror compared to Tonks, let alone Moody or especially Kingsley. I don't know why you think that getting top marks in exams and immediately getting a government job makes someone a genius. All exam results prove is that Bill and Percy are good on tests, and the Ministry job can be somewhat attributed to their father also working at the Ministry.

Bill and Percy were intelligent students, but they were never geniuses. I'd even argue that Hermione was more capable than they were at her age. Whether it be making Polyjuice in her second year, the DA coins using the Protean Charm in fifth year, or basically every display of magic she did during the events of Deathly Hallows, Hermione is easily equal or better than they were at her age. I just can't consider Bill a genius given the fact he lost to Fenrir Greyback in HBP, whereas if he were an actual genius, he would have defeated Greyback with ease.

Hermione isn't a genius either, but I'd argue she's just as talened as Percy or Bill were when they were her age, especially during their younger years. I just think people give too much value to trivial things like academic performance on exams, especially since Hogwarts grading is arguably very similar to real-life regarding the ratio of grades per class.

In HBP, Slughorn's Potions class had 12 students in total. If you exclude Harry and Ron who got Exceeds Expectations, the remaining 10 students in Slughorn's class all got Outstanding on their Potions OWL. Given that Harry's year had 40 students, it means 25% of all the students in Harry's year got an Outstanding -- the wizarding equivalent of an A* grade -- on their Potions OWL. That 25% of all Potions students getting an Outstanding on their OWLs actually reflects GCSEs, where roughly 33% of GCSE Chemistry students got an A or A* grade back in 1996 (the year Harry's year took their OWLs), and even as recent as 2016, a massive 41% of GCSE Chemistry students got an A or A* grade.

Based on this, I wouldn't call the likes of Percy and Bill geniuses since even as relatively recent as 2012, 12.5% of all A-Level students get three A or A* grades on their A-Levels. Meaning one out of every eight A-Level students would have got top grades. I don't know why people get the impression that getting an Outstanding on OWLs is a mark of being a genius, as if other students wouldn't achieve similar results to Hermione, Bill, and Percy on their OWLs.

To me, a genius is in the top 0.1% or better. Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald were geniuses. To a far lesser extent, so were Snape and the Marauders, but they were never in the same league as Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald at all. But Hermione, Bill and Percy? They weren't geniuses at all, they were just the in the top 25% of students in their year. They were very academically capable but to be honest, every school in every country across the world gets at least a dozen students of comparable intelligence every year. Basically every school has at least a dozen or so students each year who get top grades on their GCSEs and A-Levels, but do you really think every single one of them are actual geniuses? Especially since getting good exam results simply means a person can do well on tests, but tests are not real indicators of intelligence.

There is a difference between getting the top grade in Computer Science or Business, and actually making a website like Facebook or a business like Microsoft. Harry got an Exceeds Expectations on his Charms OWL yet he could perform the Patronus Charm in his third year, a feat far more impressive than the like of Bill or Percy who would have got an Outstanding like Hermione. Even Harry, who got an Outstanding on his Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL, lacked the talent needed to learn Occlumency when Draco, a student of comparable ability, was able learn it from an arguably less qualified teacher (Snape being an actual professor, being better at Occlumency than Bellatrix, and being a far less cruel person compared to her).

*TL;DR: Bill and Percy were talented students, but they weren't geniuses. Hermione was just as talented, and she isn't wasn't a genius either. Getting top grades isn't as impressive as you think, whether it be at Hogwarts or in real life exams such as GCSEs or A-Levels, or an equivalent to either one.*

**** There's no evidence Dawlish was below Tonks in skill, Dawlish usually lost to, ya know, people like Dumbledore who never lost. And nearly anyone is subpar compared to Moody and Kingsleys; the latter was even able to (with McGonangall and Slughorn) not be instantly defeated by Voldemort in a real duel.

​

Also, the fact that the wizarding population is so small means any attempt to do the math to disprove them being geniuses is ridiculous. It's extremely unlikely that, even in a larger population, that Hermione would only be in the top 25% (and besides which, we know for a fact (HBP) that Hermione is the very top of her class, Percy likely was too). So trying to downplay it by that means is just silly. I'm obviously not saying everyone in the top are geniuses, but at least 2 of those were in fact the top of their year (if not the most intelligent in the school) and to be exceptionally intelligent (and, generally speaking you don't ascend the ranks in the government so quickly unless you really have something going for you). And as a matter of fact, JKR has referred to Hermione as "borderline genius", which for all intents and purposes just is a genius. Bill and Percy, anyway, didn't simply do well on tests. That they performed well against far more experienced people (Percy defeated Thicknesse in a duel with Human Transfiguation, for instance) is pretty clear indicator of high aptitude. Whether or not they're literaly geniuses is, anyway, entirely irrelevant to the point I made in my original post.

​

Harry performing a Patronus had more to do with his aptitude in specifically DADA, not in Charms. Harry not being any good at Occlumency has been confirmed by JKR (and even Snape in the series) as relating to his personality not being suited for it, it had nothing to do with talent. He wears his heart of his sleeve, he can't easily throw up a true facade of who he is. And anyway, Occlumency isn't really part of DADA anyway so I don't see how that's relevant.

​

Saying that "genius" would apply only to the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort is just stupid. That's like saying only Hawking-level intelligence makes one a genius in physics. Dumbledore and Voldemort are without question the most intelligent and most powerful wizards in the world, they are not simply geniuses.

Dawlish lost a duel to Augusta Longbottom, *a woman who notably failed her Charms OWL.* That would be like if a English teacher had to be corrected on a spelling error by someone who spoke very poor English, or if a unqualified criminal knew their nation's legal system to a greater extent than a judge or lawyer. I'd expect literally any Auror in his position to win pretty easily given that, as Neville explained to Harry, it was just Dawlish vs Augusta.

Dawlish also lost a duel to Dirk Cresswell who was killed by a group of Snatches. The Snatchers were, at best average wizards and Ron's escape of them was any indicator, I'd say all the Snatchers were below-average wizards with the exception of Fenrir Greyback. Remember that Kingsley managed to escape a group of actual Death Eaters after he triggered the taboo, whereas Dirk was killed by cannon fodder.

So Dawlish lost to a man who was killed by fodder wizards, and also lost to a woman who failed her Charms OWL. Those two things alone either imply that Dawlish lacks the magical talent to actually duel and subdue his opponents, or that every unnnamed Auror is even more incompetent than Dawlish. Neither scenario paints a pretty picture of the Auror office. His failure to capture Hagrid in Ootp despite bringing five other Aurors with him speaks for itself, really. Even if Hagrid resists most spells, its still five Aurors (who are each supposed to be elite wizards with top-class NEWTs and three-years of Auror training) against one wizard expelled in his third year. I couldn't see someone like Bellatrix having five other Death Eaters as back-up and failing to kill Hagrid in that same scenario.

The only understandable loss that Dawlish had were his loss to Dumbledore in OotP since any Auror in Dawlish's position would have also immediately lost. When I call Dawlish incompetent, its due to all of his losses after his loss to Dumbledore, especially the loss to Augusta.

I wasn't trying to downplay Hermione. I was saying that 25% of Hogwarts students achieved an Outstanding, and given the way Snape's class is ran, its very likely that the other subject have equal or higher percentages of students getting Outstanding. I never said that Hermione was "just in the top 25%" but rather that in any given Hogwarts subject, roughly 25% of the students in Harry's year would get an Outstanding on that OWL exam.

What I meant is that Hermione, Bill, and Percy all getting top-grades doesn't make them geniuses, nor does it make them exceptional if each Hogwarts subject has roughly 25% getting the top grade. What it means is that Bill, Percy, and Hermione are very capable and work hard to achieve the grades they do. Hermione, for instance, is undeniably the most skilled with magic in Harry's year. Bill and Percy would similarly be the best in their own respective years. However the gap between Hermione/Bill/Percy and the average Hogwarts student is a smaller gap compared to the gap between Snape/James/Sirius and someone like Hermione/Bill/Percy.

Yes, Hermione/Bill/Percy were the best in their respective years, but none of them are as good at any subject as Snape was at Potions as a student.

Sure, the likes of Bill are the best in their year but none of them could be considered special in anyway. Snape had his Potions corrections and spell creation, whereas James and Sirius did most of the work in making the Marauders Map (an impressive, one-of-a-kind item that lasts beyond the deaths of all four Marauders). Nothing that Hermione, Bill, or Percy ever does could compare to the Marauders Map, or to Snape's spell creation/potion improvements. Even Fred and George did more impressive things than the likes of Bill, Percy, or Hermione did and they put in basically zero-effort academically.

******* I'd say Lupin is more talented than Moody but less talented than Kingsley. Definitely significantly above the likes of Bill or Percy based on how underrated Lupin is compared to someone like Snape or Sirius. Lupin definitely has a lot of underrated feats, such as his wandless magic in book 3, or how his reflexes were faster than Harry's in DH (and Harry had comparable speed to Dolohov, one of Voldemort's more talented Death Eaters), or the fact that he also contributed to the Marauders Map too.

In my opinion, it would be like: Snape > Sirius > Bellatrix > Kingsley > Dolohov > Lupin > Moody > Crouch Jr.

Even though Lupin was killed by Dolohov, it doesn't take away from him since Dolohov was skilled enough to almost single-handedly beat Harry, Ron and Hermione despite being outnumbered and Harry being under the Invisibility Cloak.

Even on the Pottermore article that Rowling wrote about Lupin, she seemed to imply that if Lupin hadn't been rusty for several weeks/months, he might have have fared better against Dolohov. But the fact that Lupin could hold his own against Dolohov shows just how skilled he really is, especially since Dolohov beat Moody in OotP. Even against the Trio, Dolohov took down Harrry and Ron, and would have taken down Hermione too if he wasn't already off-guard.

Though I think even in his prime, Moody wouldn't be able to beat someone like Kingsley, Bellatrix, Sirius, McGonagall, or Snape just because of how skilled those individuals are.

Especially Dolohov's reaction speed was equal to Harry's in DH, and Lupin's reaction speed was faster than even Harry's. Most of Moody's best accomplishments would have been in his prime, when he was younger and faster, but I couldn't see a rusty Moody defeating someone as skilled as Lupin. Especially since Rowling implied that if Lupin wasn't rusty in DH, he would have fared better against Dolohov.

Either way, Moody would still be one of the Ministry's best Aurors even if he was rusty and not as quick as he used to be. I'd say rusty Moody is still significantly above someone like Tonks due to his life experiences, and further above almost every single other Auror the Ministry had.

*TL;DR: Moody could probably beat Lupin or Dolohov when he was in his prime, but wouldn't stand much of a chance when he was rusty and nowhere near as quick to react to their spells.*

****** You seem to be forgetting that we were told Dawlish was still Confunded when he lost to Augusta and Dirk. You don't get selected to be the Minster's bodyguard or assigned to tail Dumbledore by the proceeding Minister if you're not skilled (which Dumbledore says he is). Otherwise we basically can't trust canon to make any kind of sense. And unless I'm misremembering, Tonks loses all the duels we see her in as well.

The problem is that Lupin - who undoubtedly had a good idea of how skilled Sirius and James were - noted Hermione to be exceptional even in his eyes ("brightest witch of her age" comment is hard to read as anything other than "you're a genius"). And as for the Snape at potions, well, we have no reason to think any of the Marauders were as good at any subject as Snape was at Potions, which would (by your logic) mean Snape is a head over them. According to Sirius, he was a freak at DADA in Year 1 as well. That aside, we never hear of Snape doing NEWT potions as a second year but surely that doesn't mean Hermione was better at that age than he? I don't count the twins simply because they were doing something that specifically required some ingenuity to do, the others are never really in that situation and so existing objects do the trick. Heck, the Marauder's Map was created using the existing Homunculus Charm, and while impressive it's not as if we know it to be more difficult to cast as compared to, say, the Undetectable Extension Charm or using Human Transfiguration in a duel.

​

Dumbledore never invented any spells or objects that we're aware of (maybe the Deluminator? not sure if he invented it or just created the one he had) but he's obviously the most intelligent wizard in HP. Not saying Percy and co. are Dumbledore's level, but these ways of determining who is and isn't a genius are kinda silly, especially since, as I said, JKR has already more or less answered this about some of them.

*** Also when I say talented I don't mean gets the spell perfectly right off the bat. No, they have to work hard and they struggle sometimes but possess a natural talent for most stuff. Like, they're talented but not 'Mary Sue' talented. So for example if hermione is the main character but you want to introduce an OC around her levels (but not exactly) so she can have some competition in class as it can get boring for her. The OC isn't even the Mary Sue or main character, it's hermione and introducing OC is going to have her have a major development in her character as she's not the only good one around now. OC is meant as an enemy, not Mr Gary Stu. They're not even central and don't possess any of the typical Mary Sue traits. They're even arrogant about their talent, underestimate others, etc.

I'd much rather read that rather than Hermione not having a rivalry in class that'd add to her development as a character. Why just bring in an opposing classmate rather than another Neville or Harry or Ron or lavender or Parvati. Do you get what I mean? And yet it's still heavily disliked despite not being a flawless Gary Stu.

You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star. Otherwise, even if it is well-written in all other ways, your story will suck because the reader will know to expect an unending string of easy victories, leading them to neither wonder or care about what happens next.

For example, if you drop Harry and Hermione into Game of Thrones after Roberts Rebellion and have them industrialise the North with the help of magic, that is very overpowered and unbalanced. The Lannisters will have their armies torm apart by artillery, machine guns and magic, Littlefinger is brought down with Veritaserum and the White walkers eliminated by an armoured division. Hermione then takes the Royal Northern Navy to Slaver's Bay and introduces them to the Dreadnought.

That story, despite being a completely one-sided affair, can be very enjoyable because you see the bad guys get thoroughly fucked for once.

***** It's a WiP on my GDrive. My biggest issue is that it has lots of narrative and little dialouge while simultaneously being rather technical when it comes to ships.

My basic outline so far can be summarized with:

- Harry and Hermione find themselves in Westeros shortly after Robert's Rebellion. They had a run in with Snatchers and a stray curse had a catastrophic reaction when combined with the space expansion charm of their tent.

- After running into a patrol, they are taken to the local lord, which happens to be Howland Reed.

- At this point, Hermione realises that they are in a different universe, one which she knows from the novels (GoT was released in 1996, I'm not sure if I want to limit their knowledge to book 1 or maybe also include 2 and 3).

- She introduces herself as Witch and gains Lord Reeds favour by inventing simple things like the printing press or a hot air balloon. Creating those is easy with transfiguration.

- Position secured, they use magic (transfiguration and duplication charms) to build the base for an industrialisation (modern pumps for mines, modern steel works, a factory for agricultural tools, a factory for fabrics and clothes). Steam engines are introduced. Hermione is the mind, Harry the muscle.

- Hermione introduces the "Wood witches" (folk healers) to basic optical tools like the microscope and telescope of a decent quality. With a few pointers, they should figure out the basics of astronomy and biology in a few years. Also, antibiotics. Similar for physics and chemistry. I'm pretty sure that a complete copy of the encyclopedia Britannica would be a good stepping stone for that purpose.

- Given that the expansion needs to be paid, Hermione concludes that a merchant fleet will be needed. With the help of magic, she and Harry build a simple steam ship (basically a pre WWI freighter). Hermione wants to learn more about the world so their first journey takes them north, where they fill the holds with wood and whatever trade goods (pelts, amber, ivory) they can get. Canned meat could be used as currency.

- A shipbuilding program is launched, Hermione makes several more journeys while Harry stays behind and starts a magical school for people who show signs of accidental magic. Given that they know nothing about wand crafting, the lessons are somewhat limited.

- On one of her voyages, Hermione runs into pirates and realises that the small defense weapons (basic two pounder/40mm) are insufficient and an actual navy is needed. Several ships similar to WWI destroyers and light cruisers are built. Since her grandfather served aboard HMS Rodney and loved to tell sea stories , she takes to this task with glee.

- Hermione's journeys take her to slavers bay, where she starts a campaign of cruiser warfare t9 disrupt the slave trade. Liberated slaves are taken back to the North, where they become integrated in the ever growing industry. When people start to flee from the far north, they get an option to be taken south after an intensive screening (Veritasserum, mind reading). A ten year old Ygritte is eventually included there.

- King Robert gives her a letter of marque, believing that Lord Reed was thinking about a few galleys, not a squadron of cruises. The slave trade by sea is stopped by force.

- When Balon rebels, the northern battle fleet (heavy cruisers/pocket battleships) annihilates the ironborn. Pyke becomes the first example of shore bombardment.

- When Hermione first sees the horrors of the Unsullied (they just stand still in the artillery barrage as well as the rituals their training includes), she snaps and, after evacuating women and children, razes the city with Fiendfyre. She apparates back home and has a breakdown.

- More industrialization and overall improvements to quality of living (electricity lights and heating, public schools, land reclamation)

- After Robert's death, she advocates for Northern Independence. Jailbreaking Ned shouldn't be difficult with magic. And the neck can be held indefinitely with modern weapons.

The thing with crossovers is that there are elements from both universes in play, not one being relegated as background. If there is no conflict, it doesn't make for good reading as the reader knows there's nothing in that's going to surprise them. A steamroller festival is hardly enjoyable reading.

As for whether HP and HG would win against "medieval weapons" as you call them, they're human, not gods. They will die, very quickly, when faced against an army. A army of 2 will never win against an army 10,000, no matter how futuristic they are, unless they're gods. And don''t bother with the Fiendfyre route, neither of them know how to cast Fiendfyre, let alone control it. Unless, of course, you're making them OP - in which case, it'll be yet another yawn filled steamroller festival.

Also funny how HP and co didn't bother with the imperius curse on the dragon either, in spite of HP being quite skilled with the curse.

Not that an imperius would work against something as primal as a dragon, especially one as old as Balerion or Meraxes. If a 14 year old can resist it, a 200 year old dragon would be easily able to shrug it off, especially one that Visenya had bewitched with her dark spells.

/It's an Unforgivable/. It may not be illegal to use it on nonhumans (note that Fake-Moody does this very thing to demonstrate it, in /Order of the Phoenix/, so clearly it /works/ on animals), but it's still cause for very, very serious worry about anyone's character if they're seen successfully casting something as evil as the Killing Curse. Therefore, not only do most people steer well clear of learning it, but it would probably have been a death sentence for that contestant's popularity if one had tried using one publically in the Tournament as a way to win.

That the Imperius might not work on the /ASoIaF/ dragons is a better point, though I was working under the assumption that Bellatrix's curse would be much stronger than Harry because she's a far more wicked person (even if her impulses drive her more towards the Cruciatus than the Imperius).

********** The last tournament before the one in 1994 was in 1792. It would hardly be a stretch of imagination to say that what is illegal in 1994 needn't have been illegal in 1792.

According to wiki, the rampaging cockatrice killed all 3 contestants, all 3 heads of the schools and a bunch of spectators as well. If anyone (be it contestant, professor or spectator) used a oh so evil curse to stop something like that, they'd get an Order of Merlin award, not a prosectution committee waiting for them. I wasn't saying that a contestant ought to have tried it out - a professor could have, as could any of the spectators. But they didn't. There's also the fact that Durmstrang, wherever it is, clearly works under different laws and ethics compared to Hogwarts (as HG says on the train, they specialise in Dark magic or something similar). This is the case in 1994, and it would definitely have been the case earlier as well. If a school that specialises in Dark magic had its headmaster killed, that's kind of a big hint that magical creatures really aren't so easy to kill.

It might even hold true for things like giants. The Death Eaters didn't kill Grawp by firing killing curses at him. If it were that easy, they would have done it, and thus given their giants more time to spend fighting the human combatants in the battle. LV and co also didn't bother with controlling the giants with the imperius curse - they sent envoys instead. Not much point in sending multiple envoys if you could just control their minds with a rather simple spell.

Keeping people under the Imperius forever is cumbersome and risks a big revolt if the guy holding the Imperius on a particular group of Giants has a heart attack someday and dies before someone else has renewed the curse. /If/ it's possible to actually, mutually pactise with the Giants it's a far more reliable solution in the long term.

Well... that's a good idea to minimize the number of Imperiuses you have to cast, but still falls victim to the risk of the person Imperusing the Gurg to die and the Gurg ordering all his subjects to squish the Death Eaters who feloniously hypnotized him.

Don't know where you're getting /that/ from. Common wisdom is that [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley%27s_curse_(book][Molly Weasley's curse]]) was of a different nature than the Killing Curse, though it probably was rather Dark --- rather than instant death with no obvious cause, it appears to target the heart, and causes the victim's eyes to bulge out for a split-second before they die.

Also, I've said this before, it's misinterpreting the Molly/Bellatrix duel to assume it means Bellatrix was nerfed for that scene. Rather, it's a plot-twist that despite her housewife occupation Molly /is a very skilled duelist/. If the series were nonmagical this would probably be rendered as her grabbing a pistol and proving herself an expert markswoman, or producing a sword from inside a sweeping-broom and showing that she's a professional-level fencer.

I say it because it's canon. Dementors are canonically described as "amortal non-beings", who cannot be killed not because they have actual /im/mortality but because they aren't technically alive to begin with.

As for what that /means/ in concrete terms --- because your objection is certainly a fair one --- well, there's several meanings of "alive". /Magically/ alive is apparently a different concept to the definition you're using; probably something to do with whether something has active organic processes or if its existence is simply sustained by magic (never mind what abstract "feeding" that magical existence might entail).

Skills atrophy very quickly without constant and continuous practice. A shooter who doesn't shoot often will lose a contest against one who does, no matter how talented they are. Before the last fight, the only battle Molly presumably takes part in after Book 4 is during her son's wedding - and she would not have fought very much, lest strong resistance invite more reinforcements for the death eaters. Compared to this, Bellatrix would be fighting all over the place, after she was broken out. Constant exposure to situations when you're fighting builds up - conscripts are never as good as regulars. It isn't so much as fighting equals (i.e. Aurors or whomever) that matters, but the action itself. Molly pretty much sits at home, while Bellatrix is either fighting the Ministry or leading raids on muggles or other enemies of the state once the coup is done.

Then there's the fact that Molly is hysterically enraged when fighting Bellatrix - if they were fencing, an angry fencer would be prone to wild and erratic moves which would ultimately (and quickly) end in their defeat.

But this is a children's book, so...

Apparently, Dementors can't be killed, but they can dissipate like mist if their foodsource is too low (which is what the Ministry tries to engineer when they decide Dementor-genocide is a good idea, post-DH, by locking off Azkaban so they can't escape and putting all the prisoners elswhere until they're all gone).

**** That is why Hermione is not a genius, she is studying FOR school. Developing something new, reading deeper is completely different to studying for school. The sky is the limit with everything, but we do not see anyone reaching for it in canon except maybe Tom Riddle with his horcrux craziness or Snape, because he developed new spells in his youth. I think Dumbledore and Flamel are supposed to be geniuses as well. Hermione is clever and diligent, but that's it.

Do not forget that Hogwarts is a school for everyone with magic, it is not some super prestigious college (and even in those the real geniuses do not have to study). People like Goyle and Neville attend (and pass!) as well.

As for Hermione, well, if she could not evenhave a hobby (like reading Hogwarts: A History), because she was too busy studying while being enrolled in a completely average school, I would have problems seeing her as even remotely intelligent. I am not sure how clever Snape is supposed to be. He was a creator and that really does set him apart. I think he is believeable as an outstandingly intelligent character, as well as as someone who is not extremely clever but creative.

I think the only character we read about that is an actual genius is Tom Riddle before his horcruxes. This is now purely my opinion, but I also think that Harry is not powerful, I think he gets a massive boost of power from the Horcrux inside him.

I personally don't think his actions in the book are inconsistent with him being a genius (you can easily be a genius in theoretical magic and alchemy and be extremely bad at tactical warfare, methinks), but if it helps you reconcile things, there's always the fact that the Dumbledore of the books is /over a hundred years old/.

I said he probably suspected it was some sort of magical snake.

Re: no social skills. Dumbledore feared that Tom might turn out to be another Grindelwald (...he wasn't wrong) and decided to Scare Him Straight, persuaded that a firm, controlling authority would be what /he and Gellert/ would have needed back in the day. From his point of view it would even make sense --- the period that he and Gellert ran wild as teens corresponds with the time where Gellert was living basically without guardian in England while Albus's father was in Azkaban, so you can see why he'd think a stern authority is what they were missing.

We must not forget that Dumbledore was at least socially skilled enough to make the entire "light side" follow his lead, he must be able to manipulate people pretty well or he would not be where he is. I honestly think Dumbledore was meant to be wise and good, Rowling wanted him to be a positive guiding force and a mentor, but he turned out to be a Machiavellian leader, who let's children fight his wars and makes them suffer without even telling anyone why.

Not necessarily. Dumbledore is obviously, famously, conspicuously a living superweapon. He is also of a very /friendly/ disposition, from an outsider's point of view. I don't think it's unreasonable that, as soon as he proves himself to be on the side of good as a matter of personal belief, other good-inclined people would rather side with him than not.

(It's my and other people's belief that the Order of the Phoenix kind of founded itself around him without him consciously trying to recruit anyone, let alone manipulate them. It seems more consistent with his "run away from power and responsability at all costs" policy, anyway.)

I don't think we've said anything about his sense of justice. I think he definitely has one --- it's just that it's the theoretical sort you'll find in philosophy books, and he can't quite handle the /practical/ applications. Rather like what Rowling has explicitly said is the case of Remus --- great wisdom in his words, but cannot always bring himself to abide by his own principles.

Nor is it claimed he is a universal genius (at least by me). I think he is a genius at magic and a great many other theoretical fields, but by no means is he fantastic at /everything/.

From what we see in canon, there's nothing to suggest it's a position of significant power --- it's rather a mediator's position, the man in the center of the debate between warring political sides who tries to get everyone to sit down and talk calmly rather than hex each other, without actually getting into the debate himself.

I dispute the notion that Dumbledore is "horrible with children". If you're basing this on Tom, don't --- Tom was a set of special circumstances. It's still no credit to Dumbledore's character that it happened, but other than that one instance, he seems ideally suited to a teaching position: lots of knowledge; a love for the material, a love of sharing it with interested pupils; a friendly, childlike disposition; an ingrained repulsion to abusing of his authority to the detriment of others. I may yet talk for the other two, but as far as Hogwarts is concerned, I have no doubts that he took the job because he likes being a Professor and is good at it, /not/ because of how influential it makes him in the bigger picture.

That's a behavioral fallacy, not a lack of sense of justice. Put in simpler terms, you're confusing /application/ of justice with sense of justice. Dumbledore is terrible at the former, but that doesn't mean he lacks the latter. He keeps making mistakes, yes, but in hindsight he recognizes that they are mistakes and is remorseful for them (which I think rather aptly demonstrates that he /has/ moral beliefs).

Let us start with one of the worst things he did: Leaving Harry with the Dursleys. That is horrible, so so so horrible. He actively ruined Harry's childhood, you only get one of those. It is a miracle and of course obly for the sake of the books, that Harry turned out the way he did. Then he let Snape teach at Hogwarts, who is probably the worst teacher one could imagine, which is very damaging for students, especially at boarding schools. He lied to Harry, he lied to him all the time. He is the one who let all of the DADA teachers in. He thought it would be cool to set up a few riddles instead of really protecting the philosopher's stone. He let Harry participate in the Tournament. When he died he left them with a few stupid clues instead of TALKING to them before. He let the marauders run wild. Like really, releasing a werewolf on the school grounds, because haha friendship? He ignored open bullying and favouritism - from and students alike.

Then about justice, if he has any feeling for it at all, why would he make Gryffindor win the house cup the way he did? Why would he appoint a deputy head mistress from Gryffindor, when he himself was a lion and this house bullshit is apparently soooo important in the wizarding world?

Yes, it is about the application of justice, because it shows your sense of it. If you are in a position of complete power and neither option inconveniences you and you still go for the option that is unjust, that either shows blatant stupidity or a lacking sense of justice. I do not think Dumbledore is stupid. I think he tells himself that what he does is right.

About turning down the position of minister, well, you can only be headmaster or minister. He had to decide which one he wanted and opted out for the one with less people to argue against him and more people to influence.

***************** Leaving Harry with the Dursleys is mostly a question of narrative convenience, but the intention, I think, is that Dumbledore didn't know that the Dursleys were that horrible. As for why he didn't check on them, that's a plothole/Idiot Ball moment, not something meant to reflect his larger characterization.

Snape is largely at Hogwarts for reasons related to the War, and I really don't believe Dumbledore would have done such a thing if he'd been Headmaster in a time of peace. Snape thus falls under "Dumbledore is bad at making war-related plans", not "Dumbledore is a bad teacher", in my book.

Uh, yes, he let the Defence Professors in, but it's not like he really had a choice. Hogwart's /got/ to have a Defence Professor, and the appalling quality of applicants is a natural consequence of Voldemort's curse. Heck, hiring bad or incompetent people was kind of the lesser of two evils in this situation, because if he did hire someone good and competent he might have unwillingly gotten them killed through the Curse. (Besides, he couldn't know Quirrell had turned evil, or that Moody was an impostor; and Lupin was actually a qualified teacher. Considering Umbridge and Carrow weren't hired by him, that basically just leaves Lockhart and Snape as his responsability.)

The riddles, if you haven't figured that out, are a /decoy/. Let Voldemort/whoever think that all the protections are of this feeble caliber, then get to the Mirror, which is a genuinely hard protection. Then Voldemort would spend much too long trying to figure out what obvious, first-year-level trick he was missing, and meanwhile Dumbledore would be coming. And yes, the more questionable part of this is that he probably /did/ think it would be fun if the decoys doubled as a fun challenge for his students to beat in their spare time, but that seems more indicative of wizarding mentality in general than anything else.

I don't think he had a /choice/ in whether Harry participated in the Tournament. The Goblet's magic is something even he probably can't mess with without serious risks.

The "stupid clues" thing is fair, very fair, but A) that again falls under "planning a war", nor "handling children"; and B), the 'children' and children anymore by that point, making the whole thing moot.

And the Shrieking Shack set-up actually /worked/, y'know. There would have been no danger if Sirius hadn't been a dangerous imbecile that one time, and Snape a reckless busybody. And I don't know what you're on about with "releasing a werewolf on the school grounds". I would not describe being locked in the Shrieking Shack as "being released on the school grounds".

He appointed McGonagall ostensibly because McGonagall was the only sane person qualified to do the job, aside, possibly, from Flitwick (though really, who knows, his canon characterization isn't thick enough to tell for sure). Overlooking her for someone of a different House purely based on House would have been discrimination in its own right, much more than hiring McGonagall was.

Again you repeat that he became Headmaster of Hogwarts because he wanted to manipulate people through it and I'm... really not seeing it. He may have used his position in some minor ways after the fact, but Professor and eventually Headmaster of Hogwarts really does seem to me like Dumbledore's honest dream job. (For one thing, you do know he was a Professor for years before Dippet retired and left the position to him, right? He didn't just start campaigning to be Headmaster.)

I /am/ kind of saying that. The way I'm looking at it, the author's intent is primary. If Rowling has written elsewhere that Dumbledore is supposed to be very intelligent, and wise in his own way (though sometimes reckless), then let us take this in good faith, and try to interpret what he does in the books based on that, rather than draw arbitrary conclusions from his actions without taking the intent into account. Thus when Dumbledore does something stupid or irresponsible, I'll try and see what in-character explanation there could be for it; and when he does something /really/ stupid (like forgetting to check on Harry), I'll say "plothole", not "canonical proof that Dumbledore is a senile, amoral moron".

I don't think one should fault Dumbledore too much for failing to see through the Marauders' trick there. For one thing, Remus started in the Shack each time, and /then/ he'd leave for the Forest with his friends; presumably Dumbledore checked that he did go where he had to go, and couldn't know he'd slip away later. As for how they successfully slipped away, let's not forget that the Marauders had the Cloak of Invisibility for an unknown variable, not to mention their Animagus forms.

Her personality, first of all --- she's the sort of tidy, responsible, down-to-earth person that is /so very rare/ in the Wizarding World, and essential for a job like Deputy Head.

We will not find common ground here, my opinion is completely different. To me the characters are what is written in the books, that is it. In my opinion having to explain how things were meant to look or asking your reader to see a character a certain way, even though their actions show them as something else, is a sign of bad writing to me and not something I will accept. I will judge a book character for what they do in the books and not for what their creator says about them. I mean, come on, we all know those fanfictions that try to explain everything after a chapter, to make you think or feel a certain way about the characters, because they actually have no idea how to write a story and no one likes those.

I want to add one more thing about Remus that I completely forgot before, you said he was a good teacher.. Remus Lupin thought it would be a good idea to confront children with their greatest fear in front of the whole class. Yeah, that is great teaching right there. Especially cool for those who have for example been sexually abused.

Imposter Moody was a horrible teacher as well and Dumbledore did just let him do whatever he liked, worse even, he was just lile the Moody he expected. The ferret incident? What?! Torturing animals? What the hell?

"did you miss the part about the binding magical contract and the fact that the Goblet of Fire is an ancient artifact of power of which even he doesn't know the precise origins?" Oh-so-powerful Dumbledore knows less about the Goblet than little Barty? Do you really believe that? I simply don't.

Concerning Lupin and Moody... I think it's just a fundamental difference between the Wizarding World and the Muggle world. Right or wrong (that's besides the point), wizards as a whole are way more willing to roughen kids up a little, sometimes to cartoonish extents. It's part of the worldbuilding, I think; it fits right in with the fact that wizards are more resilient to physical harm thanks to their magic, and thus more reckless.

As to the Goblet, Barty didn't particularly have /know/ anything about the Goblet, he just had to be able to cast a /very/ strong Confundus Charm on the poor thing. I think he would have been as stumped as Dumbledore was when it came to trying to lift its binding contract once it was in place.

And even if we accept that there had to be a 4. participant - why not just accept Harry does not really count and make his tasks easier by for example sending an experienced auror into the tasks with him.

************************* I /have/ seen calculations that go as low as 10,000 (my headcanon figure as a writer is somewhere around 15,000 as the baseline number, and 10,000 in the 1990's accounting for the people who died in the two Wars), but yeah, "a few hundreds" is ridiculous.

Concerning the Confundus, I really don't see the problem here. That Dumbledore could or couldn't break it is irrelevant: the point is that he didn't /find out/ until it was too late and the Goblet had already picked Harry, sealing the deal in a way even the Goblet itself probably couldn't undo if it /wanted/ to (which it doesn't; the Goblet appears to be a rather narrow-minded thing).

As for finding out who cast the spell, I don't think there's ever /any/ evidence that you can find out who cast a spell just by analyzing the spell itself, no matter how good at magic you are.

***** I think the amount Hermione studies has a lot to do with her insecurities. She's usually among the first to succeed at a new spell without having to work much for it. She'd probably get an E or better in most classes if she slept through half of the lessons. But we see she's very anxious about marks, so she revises a lot more than she needs to, which on the one hand gives her perfect marks in every subject bar DADA, but on the other hand she puts in lots of unnecessary work.

****** But that's the thing, if you are a genius (I am talking about let's say Aaron Schwartz level here, not just a random clever person), you are not among the first people that learn something, you are far beyond and definitely always the first without even trying at all. Being an E (muggle B) student without any effort is not impressive, not if you are looking for people that are actually outstandingly intelligent.
