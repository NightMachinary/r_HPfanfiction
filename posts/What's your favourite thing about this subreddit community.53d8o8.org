Let's have some positivity. I think even when the bot is glitchy, it's in an endearing way. Long live the bot.

I also love the detailed feedback and advice people here are generally willing to give when asked politely. It can make all the difference, especially for new writers.


** I like that this sub is about both reading AND writing and that there's support for anyone who writes whether they're seasoned authors or people trying their first fics.

And I really appreciate how active it is. For such a niche sub and even though it gets repetitive, I see fics I've never heard of recommended or requested all the time.

My favorite part has to be the threads that discuss "how did this spell work?" "why did this happen?" I guess what I mean is the threads that are a place for in depth discussions that may not be about fanfiction in specific. This sub is a good place for that kind of discussion because everyone is such a big fan and has thought so deeply about characters, spells, plot points, etc.

** Discussion threads with some of the veterans of fanfiction in them. There are some users here who know HP to a degree I couldn't even hope to achieve.

** I love the varying opinions that are present here - so many times, you can fall into an echo chamber, and to have a place where everyone from the most rigid of canonists to the craziest of deviants can gather to share opinions and stories is awesome.

Playing off of that, the lack of maliciousness is refreshing as well - I certainly feel as though I've rarely been downvoted for my opinions on a subject, and there's a lot of really rational discussion that occurs here, and I really appreciate that.

** I like how people mostly stay in their lane and ignore topics or recs that they dislike. Granted there are exceptions sometimes but overall people just skip threads they aren't interested in.

** 1. I love the fanfic recommendations with their summaries. Someone actually read it and a lot of the time they will tell you it's weakness- it makes it much easier to decide if I want to read something. I do wish there were more recommendations from sites other than ff.n or ao3, but I'll work with what I can get.

2. I love that this is a place where people can let their freak flag fly. I like knowing I'm not the only weirdo or the only one still reading fan fiction as a supposedly well-adjusted adult.

** I'm not sure what I can add to [[/u/perfectauthentic]] 's comment! I like that unless the request is very specific or off the wall, someone will have a recommendation. There's not too much trolling. People are pretty nice

** Even though there are people on here with tastes different than mine, I still manage to see another gold mine of a story every couple days that is recommended, which strays from the norm on DLP or what some others recommend all the time. Everyone complains about how often a story like "Emperor," is posted, but just about everytime I see that recommended, I see another great political fic I had never heard of before.

** I like that other people are willing to completely nerd out about Harry Potter and its fandom. It's definitely a universe where the fandom has eclipsed the actual canon by a huge order of magnitude, and that makes it fascinating. It's so interesting to have (and be part of) a community of people who know the Harry Potter universe at least as well as JKR, its creator, probably does.

I would love to be able to ask JK what aspects of the fandom and fanon as it is now she never saw coming. I bet she never expected for example, the Weasleys or Hermione to have a hatedom.

** My favorite thing is that people here seem to have crazy memory and can recall even the most obscure fics, no matter how bad. This also has led to some really great stories reccommended to me.
