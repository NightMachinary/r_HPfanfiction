Hello, I have recently finished Methods Of Rationality, and the Sword of the Hero series on fanfiction.net. I would love some recommendations of Harry Potter fics with Harry as the main character that are complete with Over 100k words. I like the 100k since I can not just sit down and finish it in less than four hours. Thanks for the help!


** I too will recommend three fics, since that seems to be the order of the day for some reason :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] : /AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete!/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] : /COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/The-Resistance-of-Azkaban][The Resistance of Azkaban]] : /It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban/

The first one is the best canon-ish time travel fic you'll ever find, the second is an excellent fast paced mystery thriller and the third is a really good portrayal of what a world in which Voldemort wins the second war would like. All of them are really good, and have my highest recommendation.

** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685][The Firebird Trilogy]]/ (494k words in three stories): A strange but interesting AU, where witches rule and wizards are a lower class.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][Seventh Horcrux]]/ (104k words): A semi-crackfic where Voldemort's Horcrux in Harry takes over his body and decides to have fun reliving school as a Gryffindor.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]]/ (104k words): In the summer after fourth year, Harry goes stir-crazy and (unjustly) starts to suspect Remus, Sirius, and even Fudge of being in league with Voldemort. After finding out that Mundungus (whom he hasn't yet met, and who looks scruffy enough to be a low-level Death Eater) is spying on him at Privet Drive, he panics and, with Dobby's help, escapes Britain and lies as low as he possibly can.

** Seems like a good number of the best fics aren't even completed yet but i'm going to link the best completed fics (imo).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]] A great Harry/Fleur fic that has Harry gaining James' memories. You won't find a better one. Quite old now but still the best one in the genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]] The best comedy fic ever. The comedy is heightened even more by the story having a good plot behind it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]] The first one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856581/1/The-Denarian-Knight]] The second one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord]] The third one.

The Denarian series which is my favorite completed fic or in this case series. Has a darker Harry that you will root for through the 600k-700k words. Also has one of the best original characters.

All in all i recommend you to read these if you want to read quality writing by authors who could become professional authors (one of them has written some of his own books if I remember correctly).

*** I'll second Lie. Jbern is a talented author. His Bungle in the Jungle storyline is well done too. Heck, I bought some of his original published work and enjoyed it.

The Denarian series is excellent as well. Highly recommend it.

** I would like to state that I am a MAJOR fan of dark!/Grey!/Independent! Harry. It makes the stories much better in my personal opinion. I don't believe you can fight a war by stunning.

*** I agree! Would you share some interesting plotpoints, ideas or just random stuff that you'd like to see in such a story?

I'm currently in the process of writing a.. very hard to place Harry story.. Let's just say that the current arc is set jointly in Israel and Germany and involves terrorism and nazi veterans, and I'd love to hear what someone that enjoys dark/grey/indie Harry wants to see in such stories.

**** I really like when Harry is forced to learn darker things during the Triwizard Tournament. Its more realistic. Also, I enjoyed the concept of the sliver of Voldemort's soul teaching Harry magic. Czar of Azakaban was a personal favorite in the Dark/grey Harry genre.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year. They're truly in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny fic. Tons of references to other works, too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made the pairing it involves one of my OTPs. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/19/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a stellar piece of work. It's quite emotionally intense, and can occasionally get pretty angsty, but I would definitely recommend it.

** I have three H/Hr recommendations that might fit your bill in no particular order:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] Summary: Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] Summary: Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] Summary: Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become animagi.

The first is one of the many stories on ff.net that offers a retelling of the entire series, but it doesn't age all that well and has a fair amount of bashing.

The second features several OCs and is fairly AU.

The last was finished six months before DH was published and I prefer it to canon.

There. /That/ is the summary, which is supposed to sell the story to readers. So the selling points of the story are -- Harry spending the summer with the Grangers, and Harry and Hermione becoming animagi. Er....Okay? I have read those things a million times and have no interest in reading them again. I don't like Romances in general, and have no particular love for Hermione.

Now, you tell me. Why on earth would I even read the story?

***** Nah man, I pretty much have to agree with him there. I've never even heard of the first one, but the few paragraphs I just read managed to trigger every bashing alarm there is, and Harry McGonagall is mindless drivel. Vox Corporis is very good, I'll give you that, a true classic of the H/Hr pairing.

** In addition to seconding /Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia/, some recommendations I don't see already mentioned:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][/Harry Potter and the Four Heirs/]] (282k): Independent!Light!Harry Evil!Dumbledore AU with conflict largely through political intrigue rather than combat. Harry and his friends are more powerful than in canon but also have more enemies and more political problems to fix.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][/Following the Phoenix/]] (256k): HPMOR spinoff with full alternate ending and defeat of Voldemort, diverging at chapter 81 of HPMOR. MOR!Harry remains central throughout, and while he is a Light!Harry he has to make some hard choices.
