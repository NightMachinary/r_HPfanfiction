Just a PSA as I imagine any favourites you have on Hpfandom.net will get a lot harder to find on AO3 and that's assuming everything gets transferred.


** I've never heard of that website until now. Have I missed anything?

*** Honestly, I have never frequented the site, but a Facebook group I am part of posted a note of the closure today and decided a PSA wouldn't go astray as I thought if there were going to be users of it anywhere it would be here.

**** I remember reading Corwalch's unfinished stuff on HPFandom, which he didn't post on fanfiction.net. Also the in my opinion rather cute 'Royal Ward' story was posted only there, before the author decided to put it up at ff.net too. Agree with you in general though, it was difficult to find those gems amidst all the slash there.

** Feels like all these sites are suddenly snapping at once.

*** I think its natural contraction of what was a saturated market. Only the ones that got real traction will attract and retain the hardcore/lifelong fans who'll continue to participate until they are old and grey. I doubt HP will ever go away but it will settle eventually into a comfortably cult thing

** Yeah, I actually shared the Ao3 blog post about this and the Hex Files being imported when it was first posted.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4w4rrn/misc_hp_fandom_and_the_hex_files_being_imported/]]

Ao3 is great about importing smaller archives before they fold - usually for lack of funds. And you can still browse imported archives as a collection. I think those stories will actually become more findable, not less.
