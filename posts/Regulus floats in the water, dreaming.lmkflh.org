** I remember a text thread from tumblr using this as a theory/story idea where regulus is still alive and emerges from the water mistaking Harry for James and tries to warn him and starts asking for Sirius, very sad :(

***** Sorry this was something I saw a couple years ago, it was a screenshot I saw off Pinterest but was off tumblr, I tried to find it but I don't use the website much, but if you search up regulus and cave into the search bar it comes up with a couple fanfic options and a whole page that gives regulus prompts

This isn't what I talked about but it's a page that gives loads of prompts about the subject

** I really like this idea, a clever way of getting Regulus into your story.

** Okay, so let me get this straight. You tagged this as Prompt. What does that mean as far as usage rights go? Like, I don't wanna steal your ideas, but this is a really good one. I guess what I wanna know is can I incorporate this in a fanfiction of my own, later down the line?

** This is a really cool concept, and would give some great oppurtunities to have canon characters interact with Regulus!

'as the crow flies' linkao3(60192733) is a story where the destruction of the diary wakes up Regulus in the cave, finding himself in the future. Not exactly the same, but similiar if you want to check it out. It does have a slash pairing later on, but nothing explicit as of yet and I don't see it going that way either.
