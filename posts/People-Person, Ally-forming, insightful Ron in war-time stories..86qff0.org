I made a post in another thread that made me really want to read one of these types of stories. I'll quote the snippet, below:

NOTE: Despite my parting words in the quote below, I don't particular care about what the ship is.

#+begin_quote
  I don't have a particular story in mind, but my favorite characterization of Ron is when he's obviously knowledgeable of Wizarding politics but it only seeps through in moments you wouldn't expect it.

  Like Harry and Hermione are discussing a strategy to convince the Wizengamot to listen to their point of view, and Ron just kind of offhandedly says something profound that makes sense. Why? Because he's smart - if perhaps not in the same way as Hermione - he's just bogged down by the accomplishments of his family and those he surrounds himself with. He's insightful about and understands people, something that Hermione and Harry are both absolute shit at.

  A Ron who slowly comes out of his shell of feeling mediocre to show he's a genuine asset to the trio, who can make allies where the other two wouldn't ever be able to, who can be the strategist not because he plays Chess, but because he knows the world and its inhabitants in a way that Hermione and Harry couldn't.

  I love Neville as much as the next fanfiction reader, but when people shove the "Face" and representative of their movement onto him instead of Ronald Motherfucking Weasley it infuriates me.

  That being said, I hate the Hermione/Ron ship. You can love Ron as a character and still think that he and Hermione would never work as a couple.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] features a Ron you would like, I think. He fits your criteria, so give it a try if you haven't read it yet. It seems to be abandoned though. linkffn(3557725)

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564799/1/A-Traveler-s-Guide-to-the-Multiverse-Earth-001][A Traveler's Guide to the Multiverse: Earth-001]]. It's a Worm/HP crossover in which Ron is a pretty smart guy and capable of forming sound strategies. linkffn(12564799)

  I remember Hermione once telling me that I had a 'saving people thing,' and now more than ever that's evident to me. Three days in this reality, a place I was supposed to only chart for Hermione's possible tourism venture, and I'm already making plans to fixing. But what can I do? With villains and monsters running rampant, and the world barely hanging on?

*** I've never read Worm. Do you have to know a whole lot about it to enjoy the crossover?

**** Things take place in Worm setting, but you get the necessary information about Wormverse and its characters as Harry and the others get to know them.

So, it isn't necessary to be all-knowledgeable about Worm. But admittedly, some terms regarding superpower-related terms might confuse you after the first time you see them. Still, nothing a quick wiki search can't fix.

***** Worm fanfic is usually new-reader friendly. The source material is dense reading, and the characters and setting quickly get bogged down in grim-derp (There is no light at the end of the tunnel)

Most Worm fanfics I've read have all the relevant information explained in the text.
