I'm looking for fics similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13634783/20/A-Different-Kind-of-War][A Different Kind of War]]. Namely, where Harry is a bit more grown-up (5th year and beyond, even post-cannon) and there's a balance between the romance and the plot.


** Def check out "The Half-blood romantic." There's romance but a lot more to it than that, Fleur is great here...she's the badass she really is. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]]

*** I know I have read it, I'm still sad it hasn't been updated, had alot of potential, but what we got was great on its own.

** I've always liked linkffn(His Angel). It starts just around when Harry's 4th year but Harry has the maturity to pull it off.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

** Not fleur, but possibly the best post war fic I can recommend is Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19.

Tbh though I'm commenting so I'll see other ppls answer. Fleur and Luna are my favs.
