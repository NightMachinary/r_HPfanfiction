I posted a Writing Prompt at [[/r/WritingPrompts]] a week ago expressing interest in a story where Ron kills Harry for the Elder wand. The post there didn't get many comments but I was already working on my own short story of such an event. I hope some of you enjoy this.

** I'm conflicted by your description. While I don't doubt that Ron's ambition and history of questionable decision making could make him act rashly when confronted with an opportunity to acquire the Elder Wand, there are two things holding me back.

First, the Hallows are enormously controversial as final act deus ex machina. Even accepting their existence (something many fanfics do not do), you've run into the problem of Ron being able to overpower Harry. While OOtP was very muddled as to explain just how Harry became extremely proficient in DADA, it -and the books following it- didn't do enough to enough to show that Ron had taken similar strides in his magical studies. Many, in fact, point out that none of Ron's habits work towards furthering his goal in PS (Mirror of Erised scene) of being Bighead Boy and Quidditch captain.

In any case, kudos and congratulations for coming up with ideas that are outside of the normal realm of HP fanfic. Even if I have qualms, I suspect many others won't and I hope you get some positive feedback on your fic.

*** I disagree. While Ron was never Head Boy, he did get the Quidditch Cup he saw in the mirror of erised. Ron also held his own in battle, and was proficient in dueling. If you go to his wiki page under skills, it lists different accomplishments he's done (disarming Bellatrix, helping taking down Grayback, stunned a deatheater while flying, etc). Further, with a career as an Auror, his skills against and around dark magic can only grow.

If anyone is going to take down Harry Potter, it's going to be someone who learned magic along side him, and spent a career with him, and gained trust and established family ties with him. Harry wouldn't hesitate to disarm a deatheater, but could he raise a wand to a brother after being an orphan for so long?

**** I agree with all the points you've made concerning Ron's abilities and admit to a rather extreme bias against him. For this and many other reasons I rarely read fics set past GoF. Hence, I view him as a socially stunted wizard with below average magical abilities. In regards to your example of the Quidditch cup, however, it could be argued that Harry's contributions as Seeker lay the groundwork for the majority of his team's successes. Indeed, Ron wouldn't even be on the team if it weren't for Hermione's meddling. While the concept of academic probation isn't mentioned at all in the books, I'm always at a loss to understand how his lackadaisical attitude enables him to remain at school. None of the day-to-day moments we see show him on his way to having the capacity to do any of the things you mentioned. There's a real disconnection between what we expect Ron Weasley to be able to accomplish and what's listed in his CV.

Edit: This phenomenon is hardly unique to Ron and I don't want you to think I'm picking on him exclusively. Molly Weasley's comparatively easy dispatching of Bellatrix still baffles me. A haus-frau who -to this point- has never shown any magical talents outside of basic household charms kills Voldemort's lieutentant?

JKR really painted herself into a corner when it came to the final showdown of Harry versus Tom. The relatively action-filled OOtP was succeeded by HBP's anemic secondary school drama and the aforementioned deus ex machina of DH. Neither of which advance the subplot of Harry advancing his own magical potential. Indeed, Dumbledore's strange plan for Harry to sacrifice himself comes completely to fruition. If Harry becomes too powerful, he begins to resemble the Goku!Harry trope so prevalent in fanfics and the reader is left to wonder why he waited seven years to defeat an elderly wizard. Conversely, an overly weak Harry is boring and difficult to endure.

***** First let me just say thanks to both of you for reading and commenting. I appreciate all the feedback I can get.

In terms of the Deathly Hallows, I have noticed that they tend to be absent in fan fiction but I don't see why. It is not really a particularly difficult thing to believe compared to everything else in the series. And several other objects are similar in being central to one book and not mentioned otherwise.

As for Ron killing Harry... I actually share your bias and this was only made clear to me recently while I was trying to argue that in canon he is below average. It's easy to see him as below average but this has more to do with how many fantastic people he is surrounded by. His siblings are all successful at what they do and Hermione is very smart. His OWL results were nearly identical to Harry's. In terms of the story, I'll point out that while both were Aurors, Harry had long since stopped being active while Ron kept working. It's not impossible that Harry was rusty after years out of work and spent enjoying the time with his children. Just my attempt at making it not seem completely ridiculous. Thanks again for reading and commenting!

****** I believe the DH are largely absent as -in canon- they're seen as last minute tweaks to uncommon objects to help JKR out of a difficult situation. Ron, despite not having enough money for an invisibility cloak of his own, immediately recognizes Harry's Christmas gift. Dumbledore -and later "Moody"- are able to see through Harry's cloak. In every instance the cloak is mentioned in the early books it is rare or uncommon but /not/ unique. It is only in the final act that we're told Harry is /actually/ in possession of a *Super* Invisibility Cloak. It's weak storytelling. Despite its presence in HBP, the resurrection stone is not mentioned or foreshadowed in any way. Finally the Elder Wand's existence throws out the entire panoply of wand lore laid out in the preceding books. All of this is immaterial, though, as without the foibles of canon, there would be fewer fanfics devoted to addressing these troubling problems.

Thanks again for sharing your work with us. I wish more authors would post here on this forum.

******* I just have to say that I find this unfair to JK Rowling. I don't think Rowling was making this up as she went along, but rather had an idea of where the story was going from the start. Of course I can't back this up, but I enjoy her books enough that I have some faith that she wasn't just stretching for something that would allow a happy ending.

******** I'm tempted to agree with you about her not making *all* of it up as she went along. JKR has often said she's had "reams and reams" of unpublished world-building and I have no reason to doubt her sincerity. She's a far better writer than I could ever be, but that doesn't make everything she does perfect (and I know that's not what you were implying).

If there's middle ground to be found, I think it's that she could have greatly benefited from a ruthless continuity editor as so many aspects of the series undergo large scale retconning in the final books.
