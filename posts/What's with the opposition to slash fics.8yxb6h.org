I mean I understand if it's just not your thing - fair enough - but there seems to be a culture of slash fics being inherently bad. Even very good works being premised with "BUT it's slash" etc. Does this extend to wlw pairings? I'm quite confused by it.


** Most slash fics are Dom/Sub fantasies about how a gay relationship works in the mind of a 13 year old child or they have to completly gut a character to make the ship work. Harry turns into a submissive boy to a dominating draco even though the two of them would fucking kill each other anytime before the end of 7th year. Or they are basically a pedophiles wet dream ala Snape/Harry

** Well, in my mind I suppose I've come to the understanding that there is a clear difference between "Slash" stories and "LGBTQ" literature. The latter is of course, perfectly fine as far as characters and stories go, but stories that are "Slash" actually have a lot of problems, as far as portrayal and representation and such, and they're actually for the most part offensive and inaccurate and highly exaggerated harmful fantasies about "gay relationships." Which is itself something harmful, because it's "Gay relationships" instead of "people in relationships who happen to be gay".

And that, I've come to realize, is why "Slash" isn't accepted here, whereas stories that happen to have LGBTQ characters in it are perfectly fine to be read about.

Slash is like if there was a whole genre of fanfiction dedicated to offensive caricatures or stereotyping of black people or something.

** Most slash stories I've seen recommended have the slash as the the actual plot, and most of the time it's right there in your face. No thanks.

  i think it may be as simple as that you've just found yourself in a space where its somewhat understood that most people in this space prefer not to read slashfic, so they warn each other about it
#+end_quote

According to the survey, 40% of the sub reads slash fics. So while it's a minority in this community, it's not a small one.

**** Sturgeon's Law: 90% of everything is crud.

The 90% of bad slash fics are mostly unrealistic power fantasies written by teenage girls (literally, at least in the HP fandom), and the stereotypes tend to stick out.

One major issue for m/m relationships in HP fanfiction is the lack of gay male characters, or even male characters with unspecified preferences. Remus/Sirius is popular because it was a logical pairing and didn't contradict anything major - the Tonks/Remus relationship is fairly background in the books. Conversely, Harry, Draco, Ron, etc. all need to be rewritten to fit in a slash fic, and few writers bother with the effort.

** The main answer I've seen here is that most slash fics are written by teenage girls with no real idea of how LGBT relationships function, which I agree with. However, I'd also say most fanfictions are written by teenage girls with no real idea of how adult relationships work at all. The better fanfics aren't like that just as the better slash fics (or LGBT fics) aren't like that. The whole cliche power dynamics, toxic misrepresentations of healthy relationships etc. are just as prevalent in het fics from what I've seen. Like young girls unaware of their position in a heteronormative patriarchy are just as likely to write a fic where Richy McMalfoy buys consent from Hermione as they are to write a problematic slash fic, if you get me.

*** Take a look at the male characters in the HP series. With the exception of the Weasleys, Neville, Harry and Dumbledore, every even remotely relevant man is a war criminal. The Death Eaters are basically a carbon copy of the Sturmabteilung (SA/Hitler's brownshirts). So writing any pairing with them is like shipping a jew and a SS officer.

95% of slash fics either whitewashes magical Nazis or make Harry completely OOC.

** After reading the answers so far I'm gonna say it's because the Harry Potter fandom seems to have bad slash. I don't read HP fanfic so I don't know, but my experience with other fandoms is not that the slash is always burdened with weird gender roles in spite of both characters supposedly being the same gender. It's probably something inherent to the fandom or the fanfic host. I might guess HP fans are younger than the other fandoms I read, and if you read FFN (which seems to be the primary repository for HP fic?) the people who write and read there also tend to be younger. Young writers -> weird ideas about relationships of all sorts.
