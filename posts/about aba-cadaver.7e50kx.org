iirc(after having read it a decade ago and recently going through a bunch of fics and references that'd muddy this) the killing spell requires hate. you have to want somebody dead, not as a means to an end but purely for the sake of it, and you have to want them dead specifically

is that correct? or did fannon mutate my understanding?

and if it is correct, can it miss and kill somebody else? or does it only work on people you hate(or even just the personal target of the hate used to cast that instance of it)?

(my understanding of why it's so horrible is mostly because of the mindset it requires, and the kind of crazy you'd need to be/make yourself in order to train yourself to reliably cast it on any target you need to (sort of like how crazy you need to be and/or become in dresdenfiles to do the same))

also, it goes through magical defenses, I can't remember if physical nonliving objects can block it(such as ducking behind a pillar)(i don't think they can iirc?), and if if it has any sort of range restrictions as opposed to just traveling until it hits something (fannon seems to change that from fic to fic, how'd it work in cannon?)

mostly I'm asking for a lore clarification on what it is and how it works in general (I'm guessing details are few enough with how wildly it varies between fics and how many additional powers it sometimes has)

edit- followup: how variable is the pain curse, and does it have the same defense-piercing?


** Objects should block it, as the statue Dumbledore animated to protect Harry did.

Bellatrix said "you have to mean it" about the Cruciatus. I think many authors take this to mean that the other two Unforgivables require powerful emotions to work as well. There's no canon confirmation for this IIRC, but it seems logical enough to me.

*** Sorry for commenting so late, but I've always disliked how this was described.

Assuming that Crouch Jr. wasn't lying, he clearly states in his lessons, /"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."/

However, nowhere in canon does anyone ever exhibit anything like magical exhaustion - that's completely fanon.

Because of this, I've kind of just assumed that when Crouch Jr. said "a powerful bit of magic behind it", I figured he just meant an intense concentration or accuracy in feeling/will that he didn't believe them capable of.

Whatever those requirements are, however, were never gone into detail on.

I suppose the /Avada Kedavra/ curse is at /least/ similar to the Crucio/Patronus spells in that pronunciation/accuracy with the wand movements simply aren't enough. You need something more.

Which is, likely, given Bellatrix's statement on /Crucio/ why people draw this conclusion about the Killing Curse: You have to /want/ them dead.

** We see that a lot of the spells described as 'powerful' in the Harry Potter world contain an emotional component. The patronus for example is described as a difficult and powerful spell and requires certain emotions. Given Bellatrix's comments on the Cruciatus we can assume that too requires an emotional component. Fake Moody was the closest to talking about the mechanics of the killing curse. He suggested that a class full of fourth years wouldn't have the power to give him much more than a nosebleed. Either you can suggest that magic can be quantified or you can look at the trend of emotional components. It is highly unlikely the class of fourteen year olds have the mental discipline and understanding of mortality to 'mean it'.

We see missed killing curses causing things to explode in the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of the 5th book. It appears that it can be blocked by physical objects but doing so seems to destroy them.

Though I dislike him Snape provides the best argument that you can kill someone without truly hating them. He didn't want to kill Dumbledore. He may have hated Dumbledore for making him do so but I doubt he truly hated him and yet we see Snape perform the curse with no difficulty. (Something that I hold against him since it appears he's well practiced and given his past as a Death Eater we can see where that practice likely came from.)

** My interpretation of it is more that you have to want to kill, less that you want that specific person dead. To my recollection, the books never go into detail on how much personal feelings come into play, they just say that you have to have a lot of power to put into any of the Unforgivables.

** /Casting/ the spell requires a true desire for the target to die, /for its own sake/, rather than as a mean to an end --- it requires a homicidal maniac, even one with a lot of self-control, to cast. This /can/ take the form of hating the target in particular. However, once the bolt of magic has formed and is out of the wand, it will kill whatever it hits whether or not it was the intended target. Heck, as long as you can work up the right evil mindset, you could cast a Killing Curse in the air with no target at all, just like you can cast the Patronus Charm without any Dementors around.

Lots of fics boil down the desire to kill to sheer hate. /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ had an alternate, thought-provoking idea that while normal wizards would need to work up a lot of hatred to cast it, the most psychopathic of Dark Wizards can cast it through sheer /indifference/, to concentrating on the extent to which they don't /give a damn/ whether anybody lives or dies.

Canon mentions that emotions or no emotions, the Killing Curse is very hard to cast successfully --- it seems to require a lot of control of your magic and concentration, a lot of "nerve" as Snape puts it. You can't just think about wanting murder, point the wand, say the words, and expect anything at all to happen.

Since it concentrates and sublimates hatred and murderousness in the human soul to cast, the Killing Curse is reckoned (although like most Soul Magic it's all a bit up in the air) to do great damage to the soul of the caster, just like the other Unforgivables --- knowingly doing wrong puts a strain on the soul, and if that is like getting slapped in the face once a day, casting a Killing Curse is like concentrating the slap-energy of a whole week into a single blow.

Now onto the effects on the /target/ --- the Killing Curse severs the body from the soul in a very traumatic manner that also causes instant, painless death for the body. The Curse also does not affect the target's soul once it is split from th body, unlike a Dementor's Kiss --- the soul is free to move on into the Afterlife or just stay behind as a ghost.

The backlash of magical energy can cause a sizable explosion when a Killing Curse hits an inanimate target too thick for it to go through, such as a large stone wall or a statue. If one takes the video games into account, certain enchanted reflecting surfaces like the Mirror of Erised's glass can also reflect Killing Curses.

Some creatures are immune to the Killing Curse: dementors (as well, presumably, as banshees and poltergeists) and ghosts are immune to the Curse by virtue of not truly having a /body/ --- their appearance is more of a magical projection, and when you get right down to it the soul is all there /is/ so there is nothing for the curse to sever it /from/.

It is possible that some creatures with thick spell-resistant hides, such as old dragons, can stomach a Killing Curse, though they'd probably sustain injuries from the explosion (see above).

Finally, a Love Protection like the one accidentally invoked by Lily Potter in 1981 will protect the loved one from any harm the caster's killer tries to deal to the loved one --- /including/ a Killing Curse, which will rebound harmlessly on the target while bringing fiery destruction to its caster.
