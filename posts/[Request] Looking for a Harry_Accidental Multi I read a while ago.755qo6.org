So I remember reading a fic about Harry accidentally getting into marriage contract/bond/live debt (don't remember which) with a bunch of the Hogwarts girls thanks to him saving them from something.

Anyone have any ideas what this fic is?

EDIT: What I remember is that it was not a serious fic (to the point that i think one of the bonds formed because Harry save a girl from tripping or something silly like that) , it was a lot of girls not just 3 or 4 (think every common Harry/Fem paring). There was a part where girls started avoiding Harry because they were scared they he would save them and end up in the whole mess and guys were angry because they though Harry was doing it on purpose.

I'm not sure if this part is from this fic or I'm mixing it up with another but I think Draco made Lucius pass a law that started the whole mess.

*** Thanks but its not this one. The premise is similar but the one I'm looking for is a lot sillier and it was a lot faster as well (like a girl per chapter) and I don't think it was this long either.

However this is interesting so I'll definitely be reading it but I still need to hunt for the other one.

***** Awww, its "The Poker Game"... That fic should've known when to stop. It was fun crack at first, but just got awful after the actual poker game was done.

*** This one I love, the plot pretty much packed up and moved out for a new one mid way and is crazy as hell but specially the characterization was done rather nice IMO.

The fic that comes to mind that matches is linkffn(5403795).

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.

**** No problem.

Nope, definitely haven't read a fic like that.

It sounds pretty funny though.
