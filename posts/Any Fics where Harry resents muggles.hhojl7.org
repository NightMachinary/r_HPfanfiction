Honestly I don't get how Harry can easily forgive the Dursleys. He was berated, emotionally abused, etc. He slept inside a cupboard for God's sake. They made him feel insignificant and made Harry believe that his parents are good for nothing drunks. Dudley even played Harry Hunting with his group of imbeciles.

Dudley was a child, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Dudley can be exempt or not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

These so called ‚Äúgrownups‚Äù are shitty people. Dumbles should've blackmailed or at least paid those fat bastards and the horse lady to at least be amiable to Harry. (Only put Dumbledore bashing if it's good.)

I want a fic where Harry gets revenge. I want him to ruin their reputations and do what ever his heart desires.

I honestly don't get how he even wants to help his shitty relatives. I would've left them to die to be honest. The death eaters could mutilate their bodies for all I care.

I want some fics where he resents muggles because no one ever helped him there. No one ever thought that the small little boy who was wearing clothes way too oversized needed help. While his ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù all had nice clothes, Harry is wearing rags.

The poor guy didn't even seem to have friends until he was in Hogwarts. There were so many red flags but the muggles didn't help him.

Don't even let me start on Marge Dursley, the fat lump of tard.

Honestly I kinda get we're Tom Riddle is coming from. He was probably so afraid staying in the orphanage, especially during WW2. I remember in a fic where he was afraid of dying in the bombing in London so it pushed him to create a horcrux.

Creating multiple for failsafes and being conceived by a love potion probably mutilated his soul and made him insane.


** JKR wanted Harry to be a quintessential hero and those rarely seek revenge, or when they do it is as an obstacle they must overcome, heroes are normally superhuman in the way they can forgive like that, making that journey believable is a challenge(see Luke Skywalker mirroring Anakin)

And the Dursley's were caricatures, until the series became made for YA and then they became awkward.

I think these stories have these.

linkffn(8704528) - Here he's basically Tom 2.0 it has a quite believable downward spiral.

linkffn(12867536) - Here he eventually becomes worse than canon Voldemort, and Daphne, who he marries helps him along. It's quite disturbing in many, many aspects. I have only read the first one and the last one but it's well...see for yourself.

There are many, many others but I don't remember them, in many other people take revenge, in others Harry just outright kills them, I recall one where he obliviates them of his existence and some other things and just leaves them there, in others he ruins them.

I prefer the ones where he just leaves them to whatever fate awaits them without the blood wards protecting the house. It seems poetic, their lack of love condemns them.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.
