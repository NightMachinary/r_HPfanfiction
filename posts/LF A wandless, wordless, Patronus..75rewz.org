I can't remember the exact context, but I think Harry was sent to an alternate dimension, or maybe the past. He was sorted into Slytherin. In the exact scene I'm thinking of, he was in DADA and they were learning the Patronus charm. One of the stupider Slytherins bet Harry he couldn't cast it, so he just held out his hand and cast it wordlessly and wandlessly.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
