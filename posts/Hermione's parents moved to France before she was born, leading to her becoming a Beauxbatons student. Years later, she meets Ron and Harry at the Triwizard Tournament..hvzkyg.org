** And they promptly avoid the know-it-all who isn't even popular with the French delegation. Without any friends, Hermione has spent a lonely four years alone. The only way she was able to come while underage was ruthlessly outperforming the older students academically. As a result of being lonely, Hermione has doubled down on her worst traits of elitism and insecurity.

Maybe a dragon gets loose, and they can have a troll incident to become friends. Otherwise, no way they become friends.

*** What would be even more interesting is if without Hermione there, Harry and Ron are better students - studying on their own, finding their own specialties, and not overshadowed by anyone in their House.

But even if they're not, I am kind of loving your take on the prompt. I like Hermione, and Harry/Hermione, but tbh all the Hermione-worship can be....a bit much.

  Without Hermione, Harry was dead by his first Quidditch match, as Quirrellmort successfully threw him off his broom.

Snape was muttering a counter curse.

#+begin_quote
  Without Harry and Hermione interfering, Voldemort was trapped in front of the Mirror and neutralized by Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

What? The mirror was to prevent him from being able to get the stone in the first place, not to trap him.

  The next year, Ginny threw away the Diary on her own as in canon. But without Harry snooping around in that bathroom, it was not found for the time being.
#+end_quote

This is plausible, though another student may have grabbed it causing her to do the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  Weasleys still won the lottery that year, and Sirius Black broke out. Without Crookshanks chasing away Wormtail, Sirius caught and killed Wormtail. Unable to clear his name, he went on the run, vowing to avenge Harry and his own suffering.

  Barty Jr broke free from his dad during the Quidditch World Cup. He went on the run, vowing to find his master and free his comrades from Azkaban.

  Under this pretext, Hermione arrived in Britain.
#+end_quote

And has absolutely nothing to do with events at all. As she's too young, she's not chosen to compete. She sits at the Ravenclaw table, makes a few friends, and has a nice school year year back in Britain before going back home. She hears there's some bad business regarding former deatheaters, but she doesn't think for a second to get involved. How would she anyway? Thank god they moved to France and away from all this pureblood supremacist nonsense.
