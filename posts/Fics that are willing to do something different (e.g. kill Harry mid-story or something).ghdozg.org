** Doing something strange or weird just for the sake of being different is what kills stories. In my opinion, there is no "taking risk" in writing. If it's in the plot you imagined it goes in, if it isn't then it doesn't. Using random twists that don't have to exist is imo very bad for the story.

*** I completely agree. If you want to make the story interesting for a reader, you include little scenes, (fluff, smut, humor) to make it feel more domestic.

Unless of course, you're writing a serious fic. Then you could add a bit of backstory or maybe some internal monologuing. Or just Angst.

About 500k words in this Hinny Soulbond fic, Harry gets petrified by the Basilisk. And that bit was written in 2009. Threw me for a f*cking loop, that's for sure.

** The thing is, it's hard to do the kind of novel things you seem to be looking for well. Mostly because they make bad stories. But, if you're just looking for different then there are tons of fics that use unique or interesting plots. If it's written well then it's sure to become a classic. (Or if it's written badly enough. My Immortal.)
