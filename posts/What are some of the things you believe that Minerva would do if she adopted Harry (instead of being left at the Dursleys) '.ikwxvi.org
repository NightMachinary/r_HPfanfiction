I'm ruminating about an adoptive mother Minerva fic and would love some ideas if you don't mind me using them in my story (if I ever write one).


** Teaching him minor magic like transfiguring healthy foods into chocolate, I'd imagine she'd have a lot of little tricks like that since gamps law allows you to transfigure food into looking and tasting like another.

** I think she'd take Harry to many quidditch games. I am getting the feeling the sport is something Minerva truly enjoys.

She'd be one of those mums who tell you to sit straight, and to dress neatly, and would look rather strict from the outside, but little Harry would soon learn that it is not /that/ hard to make her loosen up a bit, and that she secretly has a soft spot for troublemaker students. He'd get very good on reading small changes in facial expressions, as for example slightly twitching lips when Minerva is trying to scold him.

I cannot see her as a person who shows much physical affection, and suspect she would only initiate hugs in "crisis dituations" (kid has a nightmare, kid hurt himself falling from his broom, things like that). She would not shrug off a hug given to her, though.

*** I imagine she would also tell harry loads of stories about his dad

I always got the impression that minerva really had a fondness for James while she would tell him loads of stories about both of his parents I imagine she would favour James in the stories due to the extra fondness of his pure skill in transfiguration

I imagine mom minerva would be less strict then when she is in teaching mode maybe even more so as she might want to honour James and lilly and raise harry in a way they would approve.

** Something not as many people think about is that McGonagall is a SAVAGE. So I think there would be a lot more of sassy Harry (which is always great). Also she would be extra hard on him in class because she knows he can do better and so he'd be a lot better at transfiguration

** I think there would be a learning curve for her at times, discovering you can't treat your own child the same as you would a boarding school student. That could be hard to reconcile some days.

*** Sigh, right? Like just bc Harry wants to be able to learn a spell or something right away, that doesn't mean that he will or can. And mommy Minerva will have to balance the mom mode vs. professor mode.

** She would probably have to leaver her job as a teacher (or take a very long sabbatical). Hogwarts' teachers live year long in the school, and I doubt she would be able to raise Harry there while teaching, or even that Dumbledore would agree to that.

Outside of that, I think she would try to be fair when it comes to the House, but couldn't help to be a little biaised toward Gryffindor.

** Get killed or tortured into insanity by Death Eaters looking for Harry.

But seriosly, I'd think she'd be a rather strict mother, though she'd probably encourage Harry's own interests. He'd probably be quite experienced with Quidditch when he enters Hogwarts.

Just a reminder though, her husband would still be alive when she adopts Harry(unless of course you choose to remove him).
