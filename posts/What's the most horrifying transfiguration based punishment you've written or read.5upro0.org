For me it was "She knew for a fact Atum had changed her dad but was now old enough to get away with that kind of talk. If her husband ever tried that, though, she'd transfigure him into a fresh diaper." the thought of BEING the diaper on a child is absolutely terrifying to me, especially after my gran's bout of explosive diarrhea last month.


** one of the darkest stories I've read (can't remember the name) had a part where voldemort after being captured by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, they transfigure him into a tennis ball and give him to kreacher who sings its a small world to him every hour

*** Oh God I remember that one, I think. Spoilers, but is that the one where they accio his limbs first and he's basically just a torso that they use for testing Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes products?

** In one of jbern's stories, Dumbledore transfigures Harry into a footstool, and rests his stinky feet on him. Nothing else comes to mind.

Funnily enough, there's that Oswald the Ottoman story, where the same thing is done to Voldemort. I wonder who had the idea first.

** This is something I want to enclude if I ever write a story. For some reason Voldemort brings baby harry and turn him into an object or a snake. Voldemort keeps him like that as a trophy or a pet.(maybe as a horcrux) Nobody knows for years until some event reveals it. I remember unlike animagi, human-animal transfiguration changes human brain to animal brain, so it would affect harry significantly. Long-term human-object transfiguration would also.

** I believe it was a Harry Potter / The Crow crossover, where he punished Bellatrix by transfiguring her into a dog, and leaving her with a bunch of other dogs, so she'd spend the rest of her life having sex with dogs. I think it was because she was part of the group that killed Harry and had Ginny raped, and that she deserved the same punishment? It's been a long time since I saw that one.

(Actually, I haven't seen any fic like that, nor do I want to. I just wanted to suggest a 'horrifying transfiguration-based punishment' that raised the bar for goriness, ickiness and horror.)
