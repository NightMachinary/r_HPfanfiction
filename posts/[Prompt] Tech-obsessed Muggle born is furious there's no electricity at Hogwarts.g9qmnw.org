Hey all. Here's a plot bunny I've been meaning to let loose into the wild for a while now. It popped into my head an the thought amused me, but don't have the brain capacity to write it myself but it could be fun!

A tech obsessed/gamer muggle-born arrives at Hogwarts and is furious to learn that there is no electricity and none of his/her kit will work in the castle.

It can be an OC or an AU canon character. I imagine their friends from magical families being completely baffled that they'd rather spend all their time staring at a strange square screen whilst fidling with an odd plastic controler when they can literally learn to do magic!

Or alternatively, they're just obsessed with their cellphone before getting to Hogwarts. Or maybe a huge movie/cinema geek and can no longer indulge their hobby.

Be free little bunny, be free!


** Seems to me like they should just do the same thing Colin Creevey did:

#+begin_quote
  *Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?*

  As a vast number of people have pointed out to me in the last twenty four hours (some of them related to me by ties of blood) Colin DID develop a photograph from his camera in 'Chamber of Secrets' (my previous answer stated that he never did so).

  Cameras, like radios (or, as the wizards call them 'wirelesses' -- they're always a bit behind the times when it comes to Muggle technology) do exist in the wizarding world (there's a radio in the Weasleys' kitchen and we know there are cameras because of the moving photographs you see everywhere). Wizards do not need electricity to make these things work; they function by magic, but in the case of such objects the wizards liked the Muggle invention enough to appropriate the idea without adding cumbersome plugs/batteries.

  I have an old notebook in which it says dev sol (potion) magic [indecipherable word] photos move. Adept as I am at interpreting my old scribbles, I can tell you that the original idea was that wizards would use a magical developing potion to make their photographs move.

  SO... as Colin's batteries can't work in Hogwarts, clearly his camera is running off the magical atmosphere and he is then developing his photographs in the magical potion that causes the figures therein to move. All of which goes to show that Colin has a lot more initiative than I ever realised.

*** Cameras need batteries? No, no they do NOT! I had a Kodak Brownie as a kid. No battery needed. In the sixties, I had several simple 126-film cameras. No batteries! In fact, you only needed a battery for flash -- and most flash cubes or bars had their own batteries which had no electronics beyond a battery and a flash that exploded when electricity hit it. The flash was controlled by a simple switch.

The first camera I had the had a battery used it for the built-in light meter. Only later did cameras come with things like motor advanced film, built-in flash, light meters, and so forth.

**** Colin Creevy entered the castle in 1992 though, not the 1960s. And by the 90s, it was definitely common for cameras to have (i) a built-in flash and (ii) an auto-wind feature, both of which required batteries.

***** You're supposing that the Creevy's are too stupid to go into a camera shop and buy a camera that doesn't use batteries, because, after all Hogwarts: A History DOES say electrical items DON'T work. If they were as crazy to learn about Hogwarts as Colin seems to be, it rather beggars the imagination to think they would not have purchased that book. You're also ignoring that he might be using his FATHER'S camera from when HE was a kid. Plus, even today I can buy a camera in a department store that doesn't need batteries. It's not like they aren't made anymore.

Besides, Most of the cameras previous to 1992 worked quite well if you removed the batteries. Self-winding, flash-equipped cameras were generally a lot more expensive than the simple point-and-shoot cameras with a manual wind.

****** Since the above quote from JK Rowling explicitly states that Colin's camera /did/ use batteries, and once at Hogwarts his camera was adapted to work off magic instead, I'm not sure if there's any relevance to the fact that Colin /could/ have obtained a camera that didn't need batteries. He could have, but he didn't.

******* I disregard statements from J.K. Rowling explaining things that happened in the books as she frequently gets things wrong. She far too often contradicts herself and flatly reverses things that happened in canon. For example, she said in Pottermore that accio doesn't work on living creatures and yet in three books she has wizards using accio to summon live animals, including a toad, a salmon, and numerous insects.

I never bought this excuse. Human beings are literally powered by electricity. If technology is too sensitive to work in Hogwarts, then humans shouldn't be alive either.

*** This is a magic system that knows the difference between food and non-food. A magic system that knows the difference between secrets and non-secrets. A magic system that knows the difference between Squibs and Muggles, even though they both have absolutely zero magic and the only difference between them is their social classification. A magic system where bravery is not an opinion, but a fact.

The HP magic system is a system where properties we consider subjective in real life - properties that arise only as a result of human thought and society - are objective parts of the universe.

HP magic can absolutely treat Muggle technological devices and humans differently, even though the same physical phenomenon is at work in both. Magic is not limited to treating the same physical phenomenon the same way - in different contexts, it can respond to the same physical phenomenon differently.

** This plot bunny bit me, but I don't have the necessary backing in science or technology to write the story. What I've been doing is going on a wiki walk to try to figure out how one might conduct tests and experiments to try to quantify the exact effect that the general atmosphere around Hogwarts has on electrical devices.

Let us invent a self-insert character, and just for funsies, let us sort this character into Ravenclaw. How shall this character investigate the strange effect that Hogwarts has on all known electrical devices?

Does anyone else remember a game called Museum Madness? In this game, the player character goes to a museum, and interacts with holograms of historical figures, one such figure being Hertz. In Hertzs' exhibit, the player needed to re-construct a device, which consisted of two orbs that zapped each other. I think that investigating old-timey science experiments in electro-magnetism would be our heros' first port of call in establishing how the background electro-magnetic field differs in the Hogwarts environment.

Our hero could also rub a balloon on his hair to test if static electricity still exists.

Our hero could also take a smartphone playing a YouTube video and walk around the perimeter of the Hogwarts campus, marking out where precisely the phone starts to glitch or lose signal, then get up on a broom and see if they didn't mark a perfect circle around some epicenter of the electro-magnetic disturbance, then go to this eicenter and see what's what.

BRB, gotta go read the Wikipedia article on electromagnetism.

***** I'm not a huge fan of Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres as a person - although he does have a lot of good qualities - but that doesn't prevent it from being a good story. Order of the Phoenix featured one of the most hated characters in fiction, and that didn't make it poor quality.

As for tech, it's true that there's a bigger focus on cognitive science than specific technology. Harry's trying to understand the underlying principles before he goes for a lot of specific applications (spoiler: being merely a bright but socially isolated 11-year-old, he doesn't get all that far).

***** The reason a cellphone would fail is the same reason the an EMP from a nuke would toast anything that had integrated circuits or tiny transistors but leave a toaster or old-time refrigerator, car, or person in perfect condition.

The surge of magnetism back and forth as the EMP passes across the tiny circuit causes it to heat up. On a macro scale, it's too tiny to notice, but in a circuit where the copper trace is measured in how many atoms thick it is, the induced heat is enough to melt the copper, which beads up and the wire trace is no longer a "wire" but a row of non-touching beads.

****** An interesting answer, but it leads to more questions. How does magic generate an EMP? We are supposing that, at any given time, any cellphone brought on Hogwarts grounds will cease functioning. Is something located on Hogwarts grounds continuously pulsating with EMPs? And if it were something as simple as an EMP, couldn't students just bring phones that are shielded against EMPs?

In canon its said that magic is denser at Hogwarts. If so, then it would flow away from Hogwarts, just like in nature where all things that are piled up tend to slowly disperse into the surroundings. Some faster than others.
