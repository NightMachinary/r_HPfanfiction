I find this trope really interesting to read. I'd like to compile a comprehensive list of well written, completed examples of this. I don't mind what pairing, het or slash, I would just like the writing to be high quality and the characters to be believable. In fact it doesn't necessarily need a pairing at all.

I'll list the ones I've got bookmarked to get is started (they're all Drarry I think):

#+begin_quote
  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him.

** Well, Blindness of course.

linkffn(10937871)

It should fit, from how I understood your request. If you mean a character becomes blind/deaf later in their life, then ignore this.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  After the war, Harry Potter doesn't get his happy ending. Instead, he's now deaf and mute and neigbours with Draco Malfoy.Being in love with someone is never easy and sometimes, the timing is just never right. But patience is a virtue and Harry a go-getter - just a little oblivious at times.

  Two worlds collide. Deaf artist Sirius Black works at his best mate's cafe. Remus Lupin is an epileptic student from France who is just looking to get by unnoticed. But the artist sees something he wants in the shy boy, and makes it his mission to see what makes Remus tick.

  What if the road to hell isn't paved with good intentions? What if good intentions that go awry sometimes lift us higher than we would have ever thought possible? After the DOM, Harry bears his soul to Hermione in a letter, provoking the incident that gave them a chance at true happiness. Damn the consequences, because their love is worth it, and who needs that pesky vision anyway?

  Blinded in the final battle and stripped of his wand, Severus finds himself locked in a cell after the dust settles, feeling hopeless and no better than a Muggle. After a seemingly endless wait, he is finally allowed his "freedom" from Ministry incarceration only by, once again, binding his life to another's... but at least Lupin is better than the alternatives. (Canon through The Half-blood Prince, post-war AU after that.)
