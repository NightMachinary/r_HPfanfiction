Pretty much a Harry Potter that can decimate /most/ of his adversaries, notice the emphasis on most, i believe there's a fine line that separates a characters overpowered-ness from entertaining to sheer boredom. Harry taking out 10 death eaters in a matter of minutes? sounds awesome, Harry obliterating Dumbledore in one wand movement? not so much.

I also prefer the "magic" to be simply and kept in wand-to-wand, nothing complex that it requires a full chapter to describe how Harry got powerful. I have a preference for a romance(Hr, Daphne or Fleur) but it's not a must and all other pairings are welcome. The lesser the tropes the better, So none of that soul bonding, goblin friendling, diagon alley shopping lord potter nonsense.

Just a heads up, i've read quite a bit of a fics featuring a powerful harry, so i'd really appreciate it that if you're going to recommend a rather popular fic that fits my request, try to add another as there's a good chance i've read it. Thanks!


** I think that you might be interested in linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure). The plot is that Harry gets all of Dumbledores memories from before his victory over Grindelwald, and, needless to say, he's pretty damn good at magic from that point onwards.

Unfortunately, it's relatively short and seems to be dead.

*** Second this fic. First chapter alone is is one of the best pieces of fan fiction out there. Rest of it is great too.

From what I remember, the author said that he/she had the action climax too early and that continuing the story would destroy the pacing. Possible he/she will return to edit it and extend it but unlikely after almost two years.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** I'm speaking on a purely technical matter. I read the first chapter of each linked story. Nearly all of them had poor punctuation, poor grammar, poor spelling, and unnatural-sounding dialogue.

It's as if the authors do not try to imagine the conversations playing out in real life! At no point in his life, AU or not, would Harry speak like Dumbledore. Of course, that falls into the "Harry lectures everyone" sub trope.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
