OK so I recently did a reread and now have a really dim view of Molly. She believed Rita's lies about Harry and Hermon and punished Hermione for it, she is constantly on her kids backs (they all escape the minute they can, why is that?) but the way she is with Sirius annoys me. Don't get me wrong, I think she has good intentions but still. Her attitude to her clearly smart and already on their way to being successful twins because they're career isn't cookie cutter is ridiculous and the way she is with Fleur is disgusting. But then she's in Sirius' house ordering him around and saying he wasn't there for Harry because he's was busy being looked up. Yeah sirius made a stupid mistake going after the rat before sorting Harry out but come on?!

Also the way everyone is to Fleur really annoys me. It's so catty and cruel, would Harry really be OK with that? It's molly, Hermione and Ginny that are such cows to her.

So I'm looking for Good fanfic where people put her in her place a bit. That doesn't have to be the central bit but just a theme? All the ones I'm finding are poorly written or so over the top and exaggerated.

Any suggestions?


** We had a similar discussion about Fleur last week, and people generally have this take:

At beginning of HBP, Fleur was indeed behaving like a snobbish airhead, and her Veela nature generated negative reactions from heterosexual females anyway. Those in-story characters didn't have the hindsight like we readers do, and when Fleur finally showed her true colors after the Astronomy Tower Battle, they all changed their behaviors toward her immediately.

Canon Harry didn't like Fleur that much either, as he still remembered being called “leetle boy” by her two years ago. He not only didn't take Fleur's side, but actually enjoyed Ginny's mocking of her.

** While I agree there are cases in canon where people are out of line, this is actually a good thing. People are flawed. Molly was flawed. That's real life, and unfortunately, in real life, people don't always get justice. Sirius certainly didn't.

Now, while it was unfair to say that to Sirius, she had a point. You can't really appear out of nowhere and take over a position of authority. Molly took Harry in from the age of 12, and treated him almost like a son. She stepped up to where there was no one else. Sirius, who has very serious issues, pops up and tries to pull the "I'm his godfather" card

*** Molly admitted that she suspected the Dursleys to be abusive in CoS, knew by GoF and did nothing about it but send some food. That is no motherly treatment, that is accessory to child abuse (and failure to rend aid). Molly claiming that she sees Harry as her son is one of the most hypocritical statements in the entire series.

**** And what, exactly, would you have had Molly do? Keeping in mind that she has imperfect information, no hindsight, no disposable income, and Dumbledore firmly on the side of keeping Harry at the Dursleys even though he had full knowledge of what went on there.

Disliking Molly as a character doesn't make her "accessory to child abuse".

  Dumbledore's opinion doesn't matter.
#+end_quote

If you're going to flagrantly disregard canon, you can create a case for or against any character. Fudge took office in 1990 and sent a continuous stream of letters to Dumbledore asking for advice. In 1991 Nicolas Flamel entrusted him with the Philosopher's Stone. In 1992, the Hogwarts governors begged him to return to Hogwarts after Ginny's disappearance in spite of Malfoy's blackmail.

It wasn't until after he started talking about Voldemort's return that some people turned on him, and that only because they didn't want to believe and the Ministry was telling them what they wanted to hear. And even then, Dumbledore still had enough power to keep Harry from being punished by a clearly corrupt Ministry for a Patronus Charm.

Say what you want about these events, but either A) people still respected Dumbledore or B) he had enough power to create them. Probably both.

That's before you get to Dumbledore doing "greater good" things to keep Harry going to the Dursleys.

******** It's not about trust. It's about being actually able to accomplish anything.

Molly could have hated Dumbledore with a burning passion and it would have made zero difference in what she was able to accomplish. She, or at least one of her and Arthur, would know that.

Although Molly does trust Dumbledore, almost implicitly. You're projecting your own opinion onto her when there's canonical evidence in direct contradiction.

And what makes you think that would work?

It's Molly's word, which is second-hand at best, against Vernon and Petunia's word. And they're probably at least reasonably well-respected and have enough influence to convince the police otherwise.

Besides, Dudley is the leader of a pack of thugs and apparently has never been in serious trouble with the law.

And why the hell is nobody preparing a stake to burn the Grangers? Who live in the Muggle world, know Muggle laws, and are bound to follow those laws--Molly Weasley is a witch and is not a British citizen. The Grangers knew Harry was being mistreated; the Grangers only ever sent food.

You cannot condemn Molly Weasley unless you also condemn Hermione's parents.

Dumbledore was the only one who understood how the blood magic protection worked. While it is true that he likely never elaborated on the /why,/ he still had a very, very good reason in-universe.

  his methods do not work since the Order lost, suffered casualty rates considered unacceptable by any army and won due to a fluke
#+end_quote

The Order was outnumbered by ten to one, at the least. They were outmanned, outgunned, and fighting a two-sided guerrilla war. Those tend to be wars that have very, very high casualties.

And their victory was not due to a fluke. A fluke is friendly fire destroying something vital. A fluke is a natural disaster wiping out an army. A fluke is the enemy leader tripping over his own feet, falling on his head, and having a brain aneurysm.

The First War did not end due to a fluke. It was due to Lily's sacrifice. Which occurred due to Snape's plead that she be spared.

There are countless stories throughout all history that have equally implausible stories. In the American Revolution, General Cornwallis chose to take his slave James Armistead to serve him on the front lines. Armistead was a spy and gave vital information the Revolutionaries and their French allies. Had Cornwallis chosen another slave, one who might not act as a spy, then things would have been very, /very/ different.

And common sense ain't exactly common. Tell me, who would have led the Order any better? And I mean actual Order members, not members of the Ministry that pop up in every Dumbledore!bashing fic ever.

The Order was not an organized military organization. It had no government backing whatsoever.

******* Condemning Hermione's parents doesn't need to go further than Hermione herself. Their daughter is in mortal danger multiple times throughout her first three years alone, including an actual petrification that would have stopped her letters home and created questions, and there seems to be exactly no response from them.

Looking at the Granger situation, I'm not sure which is more disturbing - that a teenage girl is deciding what's best for her parents, or that everyone involved lets her get away with it.

********* Which was why I said most disturbing part might be that everyone lets her get away with it. I mean, I know Hogwarts isn't the pinnacle of educational institutions, but I feel like McGonagall at least should inform Hermione's parents of what happened. And if not the troll, then going through the traps before the stone, being petrified by a basilisk, spending an entire year around beings that cause depression and might suck her soul, etc.

Could be that the magical world purposefully keeps muggle parents out of the loop on purpose to 'steal' as many kids as possible, which might be a little /too/ tinfoil hat.
