I prefer Ginny/Harry fluff, T/M ratings, and finished stories, but am down to check out anything!

*** I am currently reading The Unexpected Seventh Year by MichGirl07 on fanfiction.net. The writing style is really good, not 100% on the plot though, but I still plan on reading the whole thing.

**** thanks! btw i've been reading rebuilding life by kezzabear ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4555844]]) and i absolutely love it, have you read it? it's very long and i haven't gotten to the 7th year part but it's good. the interactions can be kinda awkward and the author is australian and they insert TOO much stuff about their homeland but otherwise it's perfect. it can make you both cry and laugh in the span one chapter lmfao
