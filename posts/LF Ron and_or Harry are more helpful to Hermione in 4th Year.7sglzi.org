speaking specificily about when she gets the Threatening Letters after Skeeters Article about her using Harry to her advantage. She goes through Pain by the meals and even Molly shows her "anger" towards her (why is neither Ron nor Harry sharing their stupid egg with her?!). When Molly visits Hogwarts, she is glaring Hermione and only after Harry reassuring she is "calmed" (no Molly bashing, but in my eyes, she is still angry at her...after all it need Harrys "reassuring" to calm her down....well, he could send her a later. On the other Hand, they are 14 for god sake, they handle their Ships in their own way!). The only known Fic where atleast Harry helps her is "Epiphany" by S.M wane ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8017419/1/Epiphanies]]) which is a H/Hr. I stopped reading at Page 2 because it gets to much "offroad", but the first one is really good. I dont mind if its Harmony or not, but the Book passage really makes me angry about Harry and Ron.


** Ah, yes, the downvotes when you call out Molly Weasley on her behaviour. Nothing like butthurt fanboys denying the reality of Rowling's books because Molly is "the perfect mother figure" for Harry. They ignore the fact that she was a dick towards Hermione and Fleur or that she knew about the Dursely abuse but did nothing but sending some food.

******* I think the better theory is that Albus Dumbledore (and the rest of the wizarding world) are stuck a hundred or more years in the past where parents were given a lot more latitude to raise a child the way they wanted to. I mean, Neville's relatives threw him out of a window and supposedly nothing came of that either.

It's the only argument I've heard that softens what Dumbledore does to preserve Harry as a weapon rather than as a child. Not sure how much I'm on board with it, but it's an interesting thought.

******* Is it? The wizarding world split from the muggle world long long before there was anything like a department of child care or even child labour laws or anything like that.

Meaning there is a more than 200 year cultural split. That we know for sure.

And what do we know about what wizards do?

- When they turn eleven they let them walk around with what basically is a fancy gun.

- They let their kids fly around on brooms that go 100km per hour. (child endangerment)

They send them to a school:

- where they brew potions that reguraly go wrong. (child endangerment)

- The school punishes kids by sending them into the forbidden forrest (child abuse)

- they let them face their worst fears with barely any supervision

- when a childs worst fear in the world turns out to be a teacher that seems to be a reason for fun not a parent teacher conference.

Btw non of those things require the parents permission. The only thing that actually requires a parents permission is a fun and safe thing going to hogsmeade.

Wizards having a vastly different cultural than muggles is not a fan theory that is simply canon.

One option is child endangerment, another is a different level of safety and medical features make activities that we consider dangerous to be considered safe in the warring world. Still another is that we only see a fraction of the wizard world through harry's experiences and that what we are shown is incorrectly interpreted by Harry.

Again, not an invalid interpretation, but not the only one.

******** In some points you are wrong. Dumbles always says that the Health of the Students is his highest Priority. My Guess is, that there is a Spell on the Quidditch Pitch, that doesnt allow high Speed. Wands are Weapons, indeed, but you cant kill (not even hurt) other Students with them but only "have fun" with them. Only in the Upper Classes the potential of injuries is higher (also if the Student is willing to hurt the opponent). About the Forbidden Forest thing....yeah, the Teachers gave detentions as MocGonagal said in 4th Year. So why send them to FF in Year 1? Maybe Dumbles managed it from behind.

Potions can go wrong, but i wouldnt say, they can kill you. The worst thing is, you would get a Bruise or something. Nothing a Nurse couldnt heal. And brewing Potions is creating "Medicine", so you or others have to rely on the Brewers skills. Its reasonable, that they get "punished" when the Process fails.

I dont understand your Point about the worst Fear. Lupin was there for Supervision purpose

********* Well he says he has the health of students as a priority. After reading the book you have to ask yourself if priority and health mean the same to him as to normal people.

Considering the severall accidents on the quiditch pitch and the bulger being crazy it seems that if there is a spell it doesnt really work that well.

Yep have fun and also do whatever they want. From tripping people to paralising them and conjuring snakes. That really does seem like a safe enviroment..... (I'm just pointing out that health and safety really mean different things in the wizarding world.

Yep they can go wrong and they do severall times students get hurt some more severly than others. (again wizards have another idea of health and safety)

You mean the fact that children are confronted with their worst fear while other teens are looking on. (that doesn't seem like a bad idea at all. Teens are never cruel nor do they bully people with their fears)

Than there is the privacy issue. Think about it maybe someone got abused by a parent or another family member and everyone sees it.

On a whole in the books you see that wizards have a totally different idea of normal and of safety. This to point out that what hellstrike keeps calling obvious abuse and uses as an example of what a bad person Molly is may not seem like a big deal to her.

Someone is upset and I don't think it's people that are fine with Molly Weasley.

Molly having a personal grudge against girls she sees as "flighty" and unable to throw down with Albus Dumbledore doesn't make her a bad person. If you can find a canonical reference where she's "fine with child abuse", your self-righteous hatred might seem a little less childish.

Otherwise, while Molly is far from perfect, canon firmly establishes her as a mother of five successful adult boys, four of them diverse and well-adjusted, and in multiple instances treats Harry as one of her own even if her actual actions are misguided.

**** I wrote that comment when the thread was at -1 votes because I noticed that trend in this sub.

As for Canon examples, Molly says that she suspected that Harry was mistreated in CoS and that she wanted to get him away from his relatives but the twins broke him out earlier. And she sends him food when he was starved by the Dursleys in GoF after he wrote a letter saying that he was starved by his relatives. He got a quarter of a grapefruit as breakfast. That's around 30 calories when a meal at his age should be around 600-1000. She did not contact the police or the DMLE in those cases.

I am not saying that Molly is a bad mother for her own children but she utterly failed Harry. And she was stupid enough to buy into Rita's bullshit despite previously saying that Rita is a shitty reporter.

***** Buying into Rita's reporting has no impact on whether she is an accessory to child abuse. She also was taken by Gilderoy Lockhart, a fairly hypocritical obsession given how much she seems to dislike women who attract attention as he does. But being gullible (and fairly shallow) is hardly a crime.

Note that as soon as she receives additional information about Hermione from someone she actually trusts, she has no hesitation in reversing her mistake. Perhaps the whole situation could be avoided by someone sending her a letter, something none of the children she had attending Hogwarts were likely to do.

As far as GoF, she corrected the immediate problem (Harry being hungry) and then (as evidenced in Ron's letter) at least approved of, if not motivated, the Weasleys coming to pick up Harry whether anyone approved or not. She and Arthur were also going to personally visit and check on Harry in CoS before they were preempted by the twins and Ron.

Personally, I think she was a bit ridiculous to Sirius as well in OotP, but you can't say she's sitting on the sidelines where Harry is concerned. The only thing you can argue she left Harry out of as far as family goes is the trip to Egypt, which Dumbledore would have forbidden on the grounds that he wouldn't have had enough time at the Dursleys.

Sometimes there's nothing that can be done. Even if the DMLE investigates child abuse (which I highly doubt, but have no evidence), Dumbledore is the ultimate judge of the courts. Even if he wasn't, Molly has no extra income to fund a legal battle both to have Harry removed from the Dursleys', and to get guardianship instead of a family like the Malfoys. It's entirely possible that even more harm would come to Harry if she pushed the issue.

If Molly failed Harry, it's because it's an unwinnable battle just the same as Dumbledore and the First Wizarding War. It's hard to get what you want when you're outnumbered and outgunned. She's easy to dislike, but that doesn't make her a bad person.

******* That's assuming he let the investigation go as far as reaching the public. I think it's consistent with Dumbledore's characterization that he would use his position as the most feared/respected wizard in the world to backroom deal the entire thing. He sees Harry as a weapon before child, and he's dedicated to his "greater good" long before Harry sees it.

And even should he be put into a corner, I hardly think he'll allow Harry to go to the Weasleys who have just directly defied him.

There's also the fact that by GoF, Harry is being treated far better. Vernon and Petunia are afraid of Sirius and I don't think it would be that hard for Dumbledore to point out that favoring one child over another is not a crime, especially for muggles favoring their own over a wizard.

Harry says that the entire family is forced to stick to Dudley's diet, which was created by the his school nurse. One would hope that a school nurse, who is a muggle and unrelated to anything, is not also in the business of starving children. I headcanon that the quarter grapefruit is either omission of larger details or hyperbole because we're seeing life from Harry's perspective, but it's possible that the nurse is also incompetent/malicious.

******** The nurse is dealing with a clinically obese boy who could survive at least a month from his fat reserves given enough vitamins and minerals. The same diet is not suitable for someone who lived through prolonged periods of malnutrition.

And getting that kind of story to the public would be easy. Either tell the Prophet or make a deal with the devil and tell someone like Lucius Malfoy. As someone who was victim of a crime (kidnapping) which was kept quiet and ended with the offender deemed unaccountable, let me tell you that few things hurt as much as seeing the offender go on unpunished.

Nor would I take any sort of chance a child winds up in a situation where his well-being depends on a man whose master murdered said child's parents and is doing his level best to finish the job. Not to mention Lucius himself planted the diary on Ginny knowing full well what would happen, and raised Draco in a way that resulted in his morality being okay with ethnic cleansing.

****** Yeah Molly is a hypocrite. But when Skeeter wrote about the Quidditch Tournament, she actually did believe in her article, or not? After all, that way, she got the information about what happened last night and so were worried abot her Husband. She changed her Opinion (IF you can call it that) after Harry denied his Relationship with Hermione (as i said, its NOT said in the Text, but in my Eyes, she still held a Grudge against Hermione. Its an interpretations thing) and as Diggory blamed Harry, Molly defended him by accusing Skeeter to be foul....yeah, after she was tricked twice before and had the same behavior as Amos.

Anyway, thats why i want to read Fics, where Harry and/or Ron help Hermione during her time. And maybe even giving a "sarcastic" comment on Molly after Hermione joins. Harry may be have had a hard childhood, BUT they are 14. I think, they are old enough to handle they Relationships on their own. After all, Molly (or Arthus) wouldnt come into school and hex Malfoy for any insult, he did to Ron.
