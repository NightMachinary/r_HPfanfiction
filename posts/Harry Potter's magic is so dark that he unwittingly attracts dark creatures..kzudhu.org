:END:
Despite being a little scamp and not really knowing anything about said dark creatures. I remember vaguely that he was "adopted" by his next door neighbors, one of which was the squib granddaughter of Arcturus black, and the other one of which was her werewolf husband.

Werewolf construction companies existed because the labour was cheap, and other things happened too. I'm fairly sure Harry ended up meeting a Griffin while out on a bike ride.

All of this happened before hogwarts mind you.

Any assistance of finding the fic, would be great.

**** Same, same. It's really one of these great fic that meets everyone criteria and just bring about so much fun in the fandom.

But I'll keep faith that maybe one day we'll get another chapter !
