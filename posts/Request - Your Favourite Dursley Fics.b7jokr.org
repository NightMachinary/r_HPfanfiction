Title is pretty self explanatory, I just want to read any stories about the Dursleys.

POVs, nice Dursleys being decent family, evil Dursleys being punished, Petunia has magic, Dudley has magic, Dudley's kids/wife have magic, Petunia marries other people, Harry visits them post war, Petunia and Lily as kids, canon, non-canon, crossover, alt-universe, crackfics, novels, series, one-shots... I don't really care, hit me with whatever you've got, I'll read it all.

Preferably completed stories, I'm far too impatient to wait for updates.

Thanks!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/544680][If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd've Baked a Cake]] linkao3(544680) Dudley rebuilding Fortescue's with Lavender after the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8369495/1/][The Cupboard]] linkffn(8369495) Another great "Dudley coming to his senses" fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14406414][An Unexpected Universe]] linkao3(14406414) Petunia leaves Vernon and ends up on Snape's doorstep with five-year-old Harry and Dudley. A series of oneshots

I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5329223/1/][A Different Dursley Family]] linkffn(5329223), but it's abandoned, unfortunately

Also seconding Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider

A little bit of self-promotion, my witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily oneshot

  Even after seven years in Slytherin, Petunia still believed that ultimately, there was justice in the world. Lily had her beauty and charm, and she had her magic. If they worked hard and preserved, everything would turn out according to plan. Lately though, she isn't so sure.

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

  Getting expelled from Smeltings was probably the best thing to happen to Vernon. Finishing her Nursing degree was probably the best thing to happen to Petunia. In this universe, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of a very different Dursley family.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
