** I fucking lost all the wall of text that I wrote. Fuck reddit app. Sorry Had to say it, anyway back on topic

The legacy is probably the best Hapne out there, it contains a very slowburn but really believable romance between those two. Covers from the 5th year holiday vacations to a few days before the final battle. It avoids the cliches an puts in a good light characters like Molly, Dumbledore, Snape and even the evil Malfoy. It does have action but it focuses on the characters development. a 700k words monstrosity that IMHO is truly worth it. It hasn't had an update in a year, but I haven't lost hope. If you think its too much. Pm me for a full list of spoilers. linkffn(9774121)

The classic Contractual invalidations linkffn(11697407) Harry agrees to 5 dates with the Ice lady before invalidating their contract. There's another worthy Hapne. "The lies that bind", one where she is indeed evil and sold him to Voldemort, but they got together at the end in very unique circumstances... linkffn(6245561)

There are too few Harry/Parkinson, I'm not sure if this fics will comply with the word count: a smutty harry Parkinson as Employees of the Ministry Linkffn(Parkinson's Knickers (or lack of thereof) )

The story of Potter's love for Pansy, and all the suffering that it ensued, borderline crackfic. Linkffn(2925850)

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.
