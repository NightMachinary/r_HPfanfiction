**** haha that's a good thing, right? I mean, it means the author had you attached to that character and caused you to really feel something for them. I've killed OCs in my current fic. I did it for a reason and it was hard, because I liked the character, but sometimes it just has to be done I guess...

******* Considering that she would've spent so much time developing these characters over the years, it would've been such a harrowing thing for her to do. I wonder how many she had planned and how many she kinda just went "Oops, now he/she is dead. Damn." Then again we could all just be like GRRM...

** No, I am the exact opposite. I love it when characters die, OCs and canon characters alike. It doesn't even have to be for plot reasons. I just have to care and that the death is in someway meaningful. This is the reason I like shows such as GOT and Band of Brothers so much, I don't know who will die.

The only time I have a problem with it is when that character was the only reason I was reading the fic, and if that's the case then it probably wasn't a great fic in the first place.

** I stopped reading SDDJ:Auld Lang Syne by AJ Freas (sequel to Same Destination, Different Journey [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8464463/1/Same-Destination-Different-Journey]]) after one of my favourite characters ever died. I know death is a part of life and I'm sure this had a good effect on the story, but I just couldn't continue. I was so shaken by it that I cried for a few hours. The story is absolutely lovely and I do hope I'll finish it some day, but that day is not close yet.
