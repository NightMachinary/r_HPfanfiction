** linkffn(Lesser Evils; Ascended Vices; Circular Reasoning; Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

Circular Reasoning is an league of its own. Gets better upon reread. THE dark!Harry fic. Voldemort's influence spreads across the globe, all the way to Brazil. Some bits feel a bit dated, but fuck it's so good. I'm waiting another few months before I read it again, so I've forgotten more of it.

Lesser Evils has a very iffy start, but gets better. Ascended Vices is much, much better. Both the good guys and bad guys are v proactive; also, shades of grey. Voldemort pulls some very scary, twisted shit here. There's also a really cool bit at the ICW.

Homecoming has been reviewed here quite a bit lately.

There's also linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) for a scary Voldemort, though I'm not sure Voldemort was internationally recognised there.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
