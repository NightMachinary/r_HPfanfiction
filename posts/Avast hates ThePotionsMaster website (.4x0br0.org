Long story short, my version of Avast (recently installed, so it's up-to-date) says thepotionsmaster.net has a virus on it/in it. A trojan, to be exact.

Anyone have any ideas what might be wrong? Anyone know if we could contact the webmaster/webmistress to see about fixing it? Maybe it's a false-positive? Help!


** I get the same problem. I don't know if it's a false positive or not and can't find any information about it.

If you want to take the chance and browse it anyway, you can add

#+begin_example
   thepotionsmaster.net/*
#+end_example

to your Avast exclusions (Settings > General > Exclusions) and it'll ignore it.

*** Thanks for replying! I remember that site being a good place to find long stories, but I really don't want to get a trojan on this computer. :(
