I read a Dramione fanfic ages ago and it was AMAZING, but I can't remember the name of it so I can't find it and it is killing my soul slowly:'(

It's a post-war fanfic and at the beginning, Draco is told that he needs to make amendments for his wrong doings during the war. He meets with Hermione or something and then they start falling in love and shit happens...

At some point, he comes up with a potion to reverse the effects of the spell Hermione cast on her parents. And at the end he buys her a bookshop in Hogsmeade..that's all I can remember really-.-

plz halp


** I can't think of any off the top of my head since that's pretty vague as a description! You should head to dramioneasks.tumblr.com - they're brilliant at this kind of thing!
