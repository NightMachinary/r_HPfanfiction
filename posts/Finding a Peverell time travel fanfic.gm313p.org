I've read this a couple months ago but I forgot it's name and can't find it anymore. Harry Potter goes back in time and (somehow) meets Articus Black, Cygnus Black and Abraxas Malfoy. They scheme together to stop Voldemort but Cygnus Black dies and Voldemort storms Malfoy Manor and Articus Black is killed through an open window (or something similar) and Abraxas Malfoy gives Harry his gringotts vault key before telling Harry to run and activating the manor wards and dying. (I think Harry is Lord Peverell in this but I'm not sure, that scene is all I can remember basically.) (Also Either Cygnus black or Articus Black becomes minister and dies shortly after, the Black killed through the window is the one was not killed before)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
