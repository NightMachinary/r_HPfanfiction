No Weasley bashing. No Stories where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would prefer Gryffindor Harry, but it's not mandatory.

No child politics.


** Linkao3(say a prayer by mad-fairy) once you get past the first 8 chapters it turns into an excellent 5 part complete series

First 8ish chapters are pretty bashing but after that it settles down and is really good

The author (and most likely [[/u/EusebiaRei][u/EusebiaRei]] ) claim this isn't bashing because they are utterly clueless on what is canon and isn't

Then when they're called out on it they play victim, "oH I dId'Nt KnOw It WaS a BaSh fIC!1!!" and get a bunch of Hermione/Harmony lovers to mass downvote comments.

***** Did you even read the fic? I don't know where you got that quote from, but not from the fic for sure. Neville is not perfect there. He's still timid, clumsy and awkward. And Ron's not the worst person alive, nor does his family hate him. It just takes longer for him to reconcile with Harry then it did in canon.

******* Author's views aren't necessary reflected in their work, you know. In that case at least they really aren't, which I would say is a very admirable when it comes to fanfiction.

Now, it was a few months since I read it and I don't remember what exactly twins said (though I doubt it was more than their usual callous teasing), but I do remember that neither Harry nor Hermione ever think of Ron negatively. And as I mentioned they're back to being friends in latests chapters.

********* We'll have to agree to disagree. Personally, I find all the characters to be their canon selves, including Ron who's not bashed and not written as a moron in my opinion. In fact, it may be one of the least ooc fics I've read. But as I'm not an author, nor a fan (I don't really follow the story since I don't like Harmony and fics that are basically a canon rewrite) and haven't read last 4-5 chapters, I don't have any interest in fighting over it.

*********** Someone should get a proctologist so that these Harmony/Hermione stans can get their heads out out of their asses. All of their excuses are nothing new: "I found all the characters to be their canon selves", "Ron's not bashed, he's just acting worse than in canon while everyone else is the same or gets elevated treatment!", "Harry is just thinking more critically (towards Ron and no one else, because that's realistic), it's not bashing!", "Harry's closer friends with Neville, but he and Ron are still friends (even through they only talk once a month, if that)", "Neville's a better friend to Harry, I don't care that Neville was nowhere to be seen during the conflicts of book 2 and 4, I'm going to ignore that bit of canon because it doesn't fit with my headfanon of Neville, the perfect guy friend for the Boy-Who-Lived^{TM.} Wait, Ron and Harry had an argument and Ron distanced himself in book 4? Time to bring out the bashhammer! This bit of canon is okay because I don't like Ron, tee hee!", "Listen, I /know/ it looks like Ron is getting bashed, but really, this is actually canon. Please ignore how I made everyone else smarter/prettier/more knowledgeable than Ron to make him look worse in comparison, you're making me look bad and that hurts my feelings ðŸ˜¢!"

And funny how it's okay for the twins to be callous to Ron, but the second Ron says anything rude to Ginny it's not okay. Double standards at their finest.

**** It doesn't. It's a little critical (as in Harry thinks of them more critically, they don't suddenly start acting ooc) of Ron and Molly, but there's no bashing. The premise is that while Ron wasn't speaking with Harry in GoF, Harry becomes closer friends with Neville. Ron's feeling insecure and pushed out and doesn't approach Harry after the first task the way he does in canon. I read up to chapter 24 and at that point Ron and Harry were reconciled
