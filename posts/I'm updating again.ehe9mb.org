My Life as a Teenage Gladiator has once again been updated!

Sorry for the I think month long (?) break I took. Holidays have been crazy.

I have also posted it on AO3, if anyone prefers reading it there.

*** I was doing really good for a few months there, and updati g every week. But then I had to take a break for a costume I was making, and I think I got thrown off my groove. XD
