I have never been able to finish one. Especially those set in the thick of Vold War One. I just can't get the inevitable tragedy out of my mind, it colours every interaction like black on your entire fucking palette.


** Oh my gosh same. Like I'll look and see some that are written beautifully but then I realise it's not gonna be a fix it or a canon divergence and it's just so hard to keep going! It's like every happy moment, every success or achievement in the story, just serves to remind me of the painful ending for these characters!

I read the 'the marauders' series on wattpad and there is an ongoing theme that james keeps forgetting his wand. And everytime he does I remember exactly what's going to happen.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

*** THE DEBT OF TIME BY SHAYALONNIE!!!!

Sorry, it's one of my favorite fics. It's a novel length (like equal to books 1-4 plus some of OotP iirc) sirimione where Hermione gets sent back in time and lives through the marauder years. It's seriously amazing. Like, I don't even consider Deathly Hallows canon anymore, Debt of Time is my new canon. Just make sure to have a box of tissues nearby because there are some serious cry moments. Shaya (the author) does a very good job of combining canon moments with her story, and honestly her continuity is better than she who shall not be named. Some things will stay the same (James and Lily will still die) and some things kind of change. I won't say anymore, but yeah. It's amazing. I won't link it because there are some incredibly explicit scenes and I'm not 100% on the rules, but there's two versions. The ffn version is the tamer version of the two, and the ao3 version is the incredibly explicit version.

There's also a podcast going on right now called Firewhisky and Honey. The hosts read a chapter every week. Right now they're on chapter 72. So if listening is more your thing, that's an option too! They're reading the ffn version, though I still wouldn't listen to it with younger ears around or in public. You can find it on Spotify for sure.

Edit: put in podcast location

Because of rule 8 I don't think I can link it. While any sexual content involving minors is between minors, I don't want to risk it. If you go to either ao3 or ffn and type in Debt of Time you should be able to find it.

** And that is exactly why I don't read them. Give me an AU with a happy ending and a weird premise/pairing any day of the week and I'm there but I literally can't sit and force myself to read something when I know how unbelievably tragically it's all going to end.

** I just wanted to say, I love how you called it Vold War I. I hadn't heard that yet.

As for your actual post, I agree with your assessment. I still read them once in a blue moon if it seems like the author is attempting to give us their perspective of a character's view or development. I enjoy AU Mauraders' Ear fics though. Especially if it's somewhat canon compliant and you get to question which canon occurrences will be kept.

A /very/ LF I'm writing now, (starts during ME) I killed off Vernon and shipped Sirius and Tuney. I renamed Dudley and put him in Ravenclaw bc Harry barely knows any of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Considering there's 2 or three Gryff girls in his own year we don't know in canon, I figured why not. I'm having fun with it.

Werewolf girlfriend? OC or Lupin m-f transgender? I wrote a fic with Lupin being the main supporting character dealing with identity. I didn't want to write from her actual perspective because I only know that particular struggle on a second hand basis. Some of that story was quoted directly from my friend Michelle telling me how she felt growing up after she received bad news from her doctor. Lupin's identity as a werewolf added to her struggle as well, of course.

** I love these types of fics honestly. I can't enough of good canon-compliant Marauder era stories. I love the Pride and Prejudice element of Lily/James, the coming of age of a group of friends in the backdrop of an imaginably horrible war to come. It really brings home many things that fans often don't really appreciate in the series which is the tragedy of the situation at the start of PS. Basically these kids who lost their lives having just found love in the middle of the war. This tight group of school friends growing apart in the real world and distrusting each other. A kid who's racked by insecurities and jealousy who ends up killing his first real friend. And of course, the baby who never really knew any of it.

‚Äã

I genuinely think if JK was smart she'd stop making new stuff to bolt onto the books and start a proper prequel series detailing the rise of Voldemort and the lives of the kids and make it a similarly aged series of books. It's got many complicated characters. You have a spoilt rich kid growing into a mature and responsible person, a muggle born girl learning to grow out of a toxic friendship, a boy slowly descending into darkness, a werewolf, black family drama and a ton of adventures to tell.
