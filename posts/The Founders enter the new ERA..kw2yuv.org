Can be Golden Trio Era or the Next Gen Era. Either one is fine. Can be OC's or can be "Self insert" Where one of the founders becomes an already established character.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Length/Old or New. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings


** If you're alright with only one founder in the new era (ish) try Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower
