Would he have drained Ginny and be alive again? Because he wouldn't have gotten to th philosopher's stone through the mirror... Or if not in Harry's second year, when would he have returned?


** The Voldemort in the Diary was a different splinter to the Voldemort who attached himself to Quirrell. So his actions would have been the same regardless of the success of the other Voldemort's plan. The better question is, would Harry not being there have had any influence on /Lucius/'s decision to send out the Diary? That, I'm not sure. But possibly.

*** Exactly, I am wondering that, too. My brother argues that Ginny's life wouldn't have been enough, but he did get more solid. Lucius decided to get rid of the Diary, because Arthur Weasley started searching houses... and that had nothing to do with Harry

**** [[/u/InquisitorCOC]]'s point below about how Harry was the one to find the Diary after Ginny chucked it into the loo is a good one. Perhaps it would have stayed lost for years. Or perhaps the Great Basilisk would have stumbled upon it and helped it somehow --- who knows? There's infinite possibilities.

I don't know what your brother is thinking, but there's little doubt that Ginny's life would have been enough to complete Diarymort's body (he was nearly complete when Ginny was nearly dead, after all). The climax makes little sense if he /didn't/ come dangerously close to getting a full body.

Note, though, that there's a big question of what Diarymort would have done afterwards --- some think he'd have sought out the main Voldemort in Albania (it seems like Rowling's intent that the Horcrux-Voldemorts would have been subservient to the original), while others think he'd have just let him be and taken over leadership of the Death Eaters himself (his "my past... present... and /future/" does suggest he intends to /become/ The Voldemort).

***** Rowling also said voldemort would be stronger if diary riddle had come back

so I picture, old tom would merge with diary tom

and you would have the older tom riddle, in his younger body which means he would have way faster reflexes and stuff and he would have his good looks back

and who knows what draining ginny would do for him

****** No, I don't think that's what she meant when she said it "would have strengthened Voldemort considerably". Diarymort merging with Voldemort wouldn't make much sense, since it's established that remerging the broken bits of soul in Horcruxes takes true remorse and excruciating pain. My belief is that the true meaning of the statement is that it would have made the Horcrux Hunt (and thus, killing of Voldemort) /much/ harder if one of the Horcruxes hadn't just been a static, albeit cursed, object, but instead a flesh-and-blood Voldemort clone who could fight for his life with all the magical prowess of the original.

******* its established that one of the ways it happens

but nobody has ever made a weaponized Horcrux that's designed to get its own body

and hell, it could not even be a merging but a swap with Voldemort's soul that's wandering around replacing the diary chunk in the body

the idea of Voldemort with all his power, with the reflexes of youth, is insane and he instantly gets back his charm

you could be right as well

but I doubt Voldemort would want such a visual connection to his past walking arround

******** You need to remember that Diarymort was /not/ meant to get his own body. The way in which Voldemort "weaponized" him was that it was designed so that it could hoodwink, and then possess, people into opening the Chamber of Secrets for him in the future. Diarymort himself says as much --- his original self's purpose for creating the Diary was so that "someday, [Diarymort] could lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work". Draining the puppet of their life-force entirely and building a body for himself was Diarymort's later improvisation, born of his learning through Ginny that his original self was gone and there was a Harry Potter in need of some quality killin'.

** Remember, Ginny chucked away the Diary on her own in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. It was only found again because of Harry Potter, and Ginny only knew Harry had it because of the Valentines Day.

In first year, if the Trio had not meddled, Voldemort would have likely been neutralized by the Mirror.

In a way, Harry's presence SPED UP Voldemort's return.

**** That's up to a fic writer to decide.

It's certainly possible that another nosy student eventually found the Diary within a few years, or after several decades.

Voldemort could take some risks and knock on some of his Death Eaters, they might decide to help him regain a body, or betray him.

But he should definitely NOT return at the end of Year 4.

** I'd also point out that the moment Lucius put the diary in Ginny's cauldron was almost set up by Ron and Draco sniping at one another, and while the Weasleys and the Malfoys don't get on, it's possible that if Draco hadn't insulted Ron on the first day at Hogwarts, and without the resentment Draco holds for Harry 'choosing' Ron and the Weasleys over him, then the Diary may have been given to another student or Lucius could have just gotten rid of it another way.

****** Without Harry, Hermione and Ron most likely wouldn't be friends, and she'd probably be dead, and without Hermione and Ron being friends, Lucius couldn't insult Arthur for consorting with the Grangers. Could he have insulted him about something else? Sure, but that's where your own ideas would come in. It's also possible Lucius orginally planned to take the diary to another Deatheater and have them keep it. Voldemort said 'They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death' So chances are some of those that managed to remain out of Azkaban might know, as they're probably the smarter ones. The fight might just have been a spur of the moment thing.

******* In CoS JKR tells us about Malfoy's motivation through Dumbledore:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜A clever plan,' said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr Malfoy straight in the eye. â€˜Because if Harry here --' Mr Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look, â€˜and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why, -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free will ...'

  Mr Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly mask-like.

  â€˜And imagine,' Dumbledore went on, â€˜what might have happened then ... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. *Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns.* Very fortunate the diary was discovered,
#+end_quote

and:

#+begin_quote
  I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen, because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: *by planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur, have me thrown out of Hogwarts and get rid of a highly incriminating object in one stroke.*'
#+end_quote

â€‹

From what we're told here, it had little to do with Harry and everything to do with Mr. Weasley's work at the Ministry. So if that fight had not happened, Malfoy probably would have tried to find another way to slip the diary to one of the Weasley children.

** First year Quirrel resurrects voldemort, who lays low for a bit to consolidate power.

Second year voldemort resurrects himself off Ginny's life force, then lays low for a bit to consolidate power.

Third year Sirius escapes from Azkaban to go after Peter but makes a pit stop at Grimuald place, is possessed and resurrects locketmort, then lays low for a bit to consolidate power.

Peter, desperately trying to hide from Sirius finds the room of requirement, and finds the diadem, yadda yadda yadda, you get the point.

Fourth year, crouch escapes and finds og voldie. Jailbreaks early.

Bella retrieves goblet for some convoluted reason and somehow spawns another voldemort.

All 5 Voldemorts try to take over the ministry at once. Much toe stepping occurs, they all blow eachother + Nagini up.

Harry, who has been attending a muggle school this entire time falls down a set of stairs and dies.

The wizarding world is saved.

** Well, that is one of the biggest mistakes in HP. Without Harry Voldemort would not have returned during canon time, maybe never. It would have been better for the wizarding world if he would have died of measles or sth. Remember that besides Harry finding the diary, Wormtail would have just stayed with the Weasleys without causing any harm. Sirius only broke out because he saw a picture of "Scabbers" in the newspaper, that was only taken, because the Weasleys wanted to cheer Ginny up by traveling.
