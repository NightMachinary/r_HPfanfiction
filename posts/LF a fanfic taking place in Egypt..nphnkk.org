:END:
Basically I remember the Summary being that Severus and Lily ended up married. They had Harry as well as a daughter. Lily ends up dying. Severus ends up taking Harry and his daughter and fleeing to Egypt.

Spoilers: Arriving in Egypt, Serverus takes the kids to a school. It was described as geabes having marble pillars and smooth flooring. He ends up working for the school, he meets as Oc but she's from a very important family. They remove Harry Scar, the appearances of Severus and the kids are changed to hide from Dumbledore. I believe the OC is a descendant from Anubis, I'm not sure. Oc and Snape get close, they meet her family and get married.

There was a good amount of world building and culture going on. The story is on fanfiction.net but I can't remember the title or author.

If y'all need more details ask me below and I'll try my best to answer.
