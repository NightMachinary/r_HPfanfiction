** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]], where Ron and Hermione both shun Harry after his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. Dark!Harry and Dark!Ginny pairing.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter, Mercenary]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard][Harry Potter, Hit Wizard]] which are fairly humorous Azkaban!Harry stories with het pairings.

** If you don't mind that it traipses off into bizarro land toward the end, then Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/][Rise of the Wizards]] has much of what you're looking for: falling out among the trio, a darker, exceptionally powerful Harry, etc. (It's not slash though).

If you care for slash, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer has an amped-to-eleven-powerful, dark Harry in a same-gender relationship (fem-fem--it's revealed in the first few paragraphs that Harry's time/dimension travel lands him in a female body). The trio hasn't much of a role in it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/Harry_Potter_and_the_Descent_into_Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] is quite good. The trio is split after the Goblet of Fire spits out Harry's name, with both Ron and Hermione thinking he did it himself. That rift closes somewhat over time, but it never fully heals.

During this time of solitude, Harry discovers the Horcrux in his head, and...well, things happen from there, really. Harry is a very Dark character in this fic, and there's an eventual Harry/Voldemort pairing that works well and has logical reasons behind it.

It has an *abandoned* sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness]].
