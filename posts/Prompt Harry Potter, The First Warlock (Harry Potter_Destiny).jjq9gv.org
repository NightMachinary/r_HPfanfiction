So... Bit of a Niche prompt to be sure, but as Destiny Fans know, Guardians are born when they die. So my Question, and the Prompt is... How has no one done a Fic where a Baby Harry dies in 1981 and is reborn in the Light of the Traveler as a Warlock Guardian!?


** This sounds amazing! Though, in my humble opinion, Harry should be a hunter (thats right, I'm biased towards my class. Deal with it. Some actual reasoning is because he played a lot of quidditch, is used to running around from Harry Hunting, and seems like a survivalist from the Horocrux hunt). It would be interesting to see if any knowledge of magic's existence would remain, hidden or out in the open.

*** Oh magic could definitely play a role in the battle between the darkness and the light. And possibly be a way that kept the traveler to remain on earth even with the darkness encroaching.

** God Harry being one of the first guardians. Rallying humanity to The Last City. Or maybe he's Dredgen Yor, with the elder wand becoming Thorn, twisted by all he lost and hating the traveler for reviving him centuries after wizards, witches and other magical beings have died.
