Little to no bashing preferable. It can be either wbwl or Non-BWL fics. Fics where Harry likes to pisses James like praising Snape or dating Pansy. But no Lily/James abusing Harry or Evil/dark Harry.


** I can imagine Harry being like that if he grew up with James/Lily. Just doing stuff to bother them, because he's amused by their reactions. Or even just because he's a teenager and that's what they do.

But I don't know of any fics like that. Honestly, now that I think of it, I can't think of a single fic where Harry is carefree enough to do things like that. I'm a huge fan of James/Lily being alive and have read loads of them but the base of Harry's character is /usually/ BWL or some equally high-pressure arc.

** linkffn(Time to Spare) is a time travel fic where Harry gets sent back to his parents time with Draco, but ultimately decides to ensure he doesn't befriend them because due to his experience in third year, he knows that time is a loop and it would be too painful to befriend them knowing nothing he could do could change their death. So part of that includes making sure James hates him.

** This gives me an idea. So here's a prompt.

A fic relating the first year of harry's life until Voldemort's raid, completely canon compliant.

Must be written funny and over cute (a nice and happy family, where the parents and their friends are all about their little child, somthing really attaching, with Harry already showing a taste for pranks and messing with the adults using accidental magic). Slowly grows darker in the latter parts, but kept in the background. Until, finally, well...

Last scene is Dumbledore putting the basket in front of the Dursley's door.

It seems deliciously underhanded.

** There's one scene in linkffn(The Gates of Azkaban) where the main group of people mocked James by telling him how awful Harry was on a broom. The intention was to keep James from realizing who Harry is (his son, that is), but when it's obvious that he figured it out, they do this instead just for fun.

Harry himself wasn't around in the scene (he was asleep, IIRC).
