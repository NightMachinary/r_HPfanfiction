*** Yeah I accidentally clicked on it and realised it's a complete list of fic recommendations and if you check the thread name that the comments posted on you can even see why it was recommended.

**** I was gonna say you can sort the bot's comments by "top" rather than "new", but then the top "rec" right now is this atrocity: linkffn(Kitten Ears and Lion Hugs)

***** ...

This was in response to one of my comments.

Apparently it's the fic that gets linked if you just write linkffn() and don't put anything in the brackets...

EDIT: It seems I was mistaken. [[/u/tusing]]?

******* I'm so glad that not only does a nearly 300,000 word fic exist about this but also that it's the final of a trilogy...

****** It seems to be random, for now. The next update should remove this issue. For now, use a backslash in the middle of the link\ffn() command like so:

= link\ffn()=

so the bot can't parse the command (it only searches for exactly "link\ffn(...)".
