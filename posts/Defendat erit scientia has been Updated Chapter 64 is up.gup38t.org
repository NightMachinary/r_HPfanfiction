** Got a question, is it worth pulling through? I hate fics with no flow, and the 500-1000 word chapters make it impossible for there to be a flow to the writing. But shorter than required chapters have always been a fic-killer for me, I don't understand why some, luckily few, authors do it.

EDIT: Oh nevermind, didn't realize you were the author. So I guess your answer would be "yes it is worth it" :D But maybe you could explain why the insanely short chapters? Surely updating less frequently with longer chapters makes more sense?

*** That is just my writing style, the chapter length is fine to me but not everyone like that. Everyone has their own personal preference, if you didn't enjoy the fic , I'm sorry about that but the good thing about the Harry Potter fandom is the massive size of it. There is a story for everyone, I'm sure you can find something that you will enjoy reading . Thanks for taking the time to check out my story, I hope you find a good fic that you enjoy reading soon
