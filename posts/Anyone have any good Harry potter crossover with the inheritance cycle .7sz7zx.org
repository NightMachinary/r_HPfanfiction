  Eager for more power, Galbatorix tried to create the first dragon Shade. The spirit he'd summoned, the Master of Death, took pity on the poor dragon and merged their souls rather than simply taking control of the body. Now with a mind to match his rage, the new Shruikan plans to dish out justice while he searches for his new Name. [On indefinite hiatus: Please see Ch28 for details]

  For a brief amount of time, the hermit remembered, and he felt he had to do something... and perhaps he did. But then he forgot, and just returned to his questions.

** there are 3 that i enjoyed, but 2 have fem!Harry/Eragon, and idk if you'd enjoy that. They're also based of one another, with "Slowly" being the "original one". Both authors are friends and allowed this, don't worry. The other one is abandonned, but it was abandonned after the end of an arc, so it isn't that bad.

linkffn(By Courage and Love by najex)

linkffn(Slowly, And Then All At Once)

linkffn(To Train A Dragon Rider) - is the one that's abandoned.

** The only one apart from those listed already I could recommend is linkffn(The last Dragonrider by Zenzao), the update schedule is tortuously slow and there really isn't much there, but I do remember really enjoying what there is. Definitely read the Elder Scrolls crossover thats been linked too, my favourite story from the inheritance cycle by far.

  Crash-landing into the next dimension of his trip, Harry finds himself in the middle of Alagaesia and a struggle much like several others before. This time around, he has the joy of raising a rowdy Dragon while trying to figure out whose side of the stirring war he should pair up with, if either. And of course, puzzling the ins and outs of the local magic system superseding his own
