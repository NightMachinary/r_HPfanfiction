I'm so sick of stories, including canon, where Harry gets this bizarre idea of Snape as a tragic Byronic hero and not the bitter narcissist he is. So what are some stories of Harry is more like “ooh, mad, instead of a sadistic sociopath who works for wizard nazis, you're a sadistic sociopath who betrayed the wizard nazis solely because you were obsessed with my mum. What a hero you are”


** While I think your judgement is a bit harsh ("Lately, only those I couldn't save" and similar strongly implies that he truly turned in the end, even if it wasn't the initial reason he started working against Voldemort), I get what you're saying -- Harry's 180 reaction is extreme in the other direction. I think the main reason it happens is that Harry saw himself in Snape, and what he could have become in slightly different circumstances. I truly do believe it's the most realistic response given how Harry typically behaves, allthough I doubt he'd go as far as to /name a kid after him/ if we're trying to be realistic.

I don't have a fic recommendation, sorry.

******* I'm not a Snape defender necessarily. I can see he's an asshole and I would hate him irl (at least as a teacher). But, he's my favorite adult Harry Potter character, and one of my favs in general, because he is very grey and in the middle of things. He isn't pure and he isn't evil. As a teacher I can confidently say he treated the gryffindor like shit especially Harry. But some of this hatred might have been because he knew Voldemort wasn't dead and that free death eaters had children in hogwarts. If he hadn't played the bad guy he wouldn't have gotten back into Voldemort's favor so easily (if at all)

************* Barty was there under orders to deliver HP at a specific date via the TWT, which he did. Voldemort wanted to let the tournament take place to (through Barty) gauge Harry's abilities, look for anything that might be the "power [he] knows not", and allow the resurrection to take place on a significant date.

And at the time, Voldemort didn't know whether or not to trust Snape. This would have been doubly true if Snape was HP's mentor. However, if Snape had been HP's mentor, and was able to convince Voldemort of his allegiance after the resurrection ceremony, he would have been ordered to bring HP in at some point during OotP. If everything else stayed the same, then most likely during one of the Occlumency lessons. And then my previous point stands.

He started teaching when he was 21, and some of the students he taught at first were there to see his altercations with James and company and probably didn't respect him at all, if any, for it. It's a difficult situation for any young teacher, and chances are he had a choice between either making them fear him or work ten times as hard to earn the respect, and being the kind of person he is he made his choice.

That is not to say I agree with his choice any, no, I don't at all. But he's far from the only person to make that choice in a situation like this.

He was kind of creepy as a kid and watched Lily from the bushes but that's excusable because of his age at the time and his childhood. As an adult he had an unhealthy attachment to a dead woman but he never acted on anything while she was alive. They were initially friends until they had a falling out. He tried to apologize once and after her rejection he doesn't have any contact with her as far as we know. He doesn't try to stalk her or break her up with James.

******* This is a mindset I never really understood. Compare teenage James and teenage Severus. Who is the one that doesn't take no for an answer? James, not Severus. And yet, I've seen this argument done more times than I can count.

Severus tries to apologize after Mudblood, but is rejected (and at this point, their relationship isn't even romantic -- it's platonic). We never see him continue to pursue her afterwards.

However, does that mean Severus deserved Lily? Not at all -- nobody is /entitled/ to someone. They drifted apart, and their inability to talk to each other about their feelings and concerns is ultimately what caused the friendship, and any potential for more, to fall apart. But even if Severus did everything right, or whatever, he wouldn't /deserve/ her romantic affections -- ultimately, it's both of their choices. It's a rather demeaning way of seeing things.

***** We do know that Snape had Lily as a friend, which is at least one more person in his life that cared about him than Harry had. Seriously, the Dursleys wouldn't have pissed on Harry if he was on fire - Marge would have dumped lighter fluid on him. The most positive adult contact he's shown having prior to Hogwarts (other than random wizards he meets on the street) is Mrs. Figg, who states in OotP that she made sure he didn't enjoy his times at her house for fear that the Dursleys would find a more unpleasant babysitter, but she certainly never let him see any concern for him prior to that day.

I read a comment on this very same subreddit which convinced me as to why Harry naming his kid after him is totally within his character, and actually pretty cool:

#+begin_quote
  Even the hated name - Albus Severus - makes sense. Harry is repeatedly shown to be capable of great mercy - he doesn't let Sirius and Remus kill Peter, he wouldn't stun Stan Shunpike, he went back to rescue Malfoy in the RoR, and even at the very end he tells Voldemort to try for some remorse - so his forgiveness of Dumbledore and Snape is totally in-character. And although this is just an interpretation, I think that forgiveness also implies that Harry has learned to forgive himself for the choices he made in the war.

** Never forget that Snape's bitterness got in the way of him teaching Harry a potentially life-saving skill, one which ultimately led to the death of Harry's only father figure in the series and which could have gotten Harry killed too, even though Snape swore to "protect" him in secret.

The sheer audacity of Rowling to have Harry name a kid after Snape in light of that fact makes me sick to my stomach, almost as much as the escape of the child-abusing Dursleys from justice. Harry absolutely despised Snape in HBP and DH, more so than in previous books. That is because of the man's role in Sirius's death, as inadvertent as it was ( we won't get into the argument that he ignored Harry in Umbridge's office because of Dumbledore's words on the matter).

Snape was bitter, narcissistic, entitled, a bully, a man-child and a misanthropic freak. No sane, rational adult would ever name their child after him, especially not when they were abused by the man for years on end, irregardless of whether or not it was a cover (and it wasn't a cover at all - Snape despised Harry because of the James and Lily connection).

This topic pisses me off because it really drives home the notion that Rowling doesn't understand character development.
