What are your opinions on it? Do you have any favourite views on it you've come across in fics?

What we know: Walburga and Bellatrix were definitely mad. I'm no psychiatrist so I can't really describe exactly how, though. Sirius was always a bit unhinged due to his time in Azkaban, and it isn't clear if he had a touch of the madness before then (trying to feed to Snape to Moony could be circumstantial evidence for that I suppose).


** I don't view as the Black madness per se. I think of it as the Blacks being highly skilled and knowledgeable in the mind arts. When I say mind arts, I don't only mean being talented legillemancers and occlumancers, but also the imperious curse, illusions, mind altering charms and substances, astral projections, etc. I think this gives the reason for the madness, as it is only in the overly ambitious of the Blacks that it is found - the ones that would delve too deep and go beyond their capabilities.

That's how I like to see it and it features heavily in the fics I'm writing. I like to think that Harry's talent for throwing off the imperious curse comes from his Black heritage.

*** I honestly had never considered this approach. What is your headcanon on how the mind arts work?

**** Mind magic is very closely linked to willpower and soul magic. Rituals can be done to bolster your willpower/proficiency for mind arts, but they come with great risks of losing yourself in the ritual. If you lose yourself then you will follow your whims/emotions steadfastly rather than making a plan and sticking to it.

Those who are proficient in the mind arts are able to manipulate people with their speech and/or mere presence. They use illusions to shape people perceptions as well as playing with people's emotions.

I don't have it all worked out but that's the basis of it.

***** That sounds really cool so far :3 most of my fanfiction notes are on magical theory in general (it's AU so I've diverged somewhat from Taure's excellent analysis of magic in canon) but I haven't put much thought into the mind arts yet. I just know that I don't want to go down the defensive mindscape route for occlumency.

****** Mind scapes don't work for me either. I think occlumency is more of controlling your emotions, sensing others affecting your mind, controlling what you think about (to fool legillemancers) and force of will to push others out.

******* The only thing I have decided on is that occlumency and legilimency should be only two branches of the mind arts, but that there are other things too (I agree that illusions should be a thing, for instance).

******** Illusions, confundus charms, obliviate, personality affecting charms (cheering charms, etc), and hypnosis style charms as well as occlumency and legilimency. I think there should be rituals about strength of willpower, etc

********* What's your definition of ritual? I think I've taken an odd approach in that I see ritual as being anything which takes existing magical meanings/concepts from the aether/environment to help craft a spell. So as well as what you'd imagine from a ritual, it would also cover incantations, wand movements and potions. I don't think I'm explaining it very well... >_<

********** I think I understand what you're saying and it sounds interesting. I'm using the definition that is that a ritual is a spell that needs more than a wand to cast and requires preparation.

*** Consider Voldemort's insanity, and then remember that Bellatrix is his most loyal lieutenant, and was taught by Voldemort himself.

** I love writing Walburga. I make her cruel and scathing because she's unhappy with the life she's forced into (getting married to the purest, but not being very desirable or being a proper lady, etc) though she's an extreme blood supremacist. So if she's similar to that in a fic, I love it.

I usually like all fics with that generation of Blacks because it was left up in the air in canon. It's interesting to see others' characterization of them. Unfortunately, I can't find many where they're more than mentioned as Sirius' parents.

*** I agree with this, and also fics that redeem Walburga confuse me. Being a blood purist didn't make her a horrible person/painting, being a horrible person did. If she was just a racist classist person who was also a loving mom and a polite person she would be a different character all together.
