I finished chapter 4, that tells of the Yule ball. In which, we find out that after humping and groping Fleur, Harry has had sex with Daphne. Somehow, at 14, they both got hammered (at a school sponsored party with adults), had sex (probably for the first time), woke up naked next to someone they don't really know and considered all of that as normal.

Dumbledore is portrayed as some silly, immature, crazy person.

Ron and Hermione don't really make an effort to make it up to Harry. Harry is being ooc and doesn't even miss them.

The whole speech feels fake and forced, Harry is too sexual and too shameless.

I don't mind an op Harry - but receiving a priceless enchanted artifact (that is not an heirloom) from Dumbledore?! And so early in the story?!

Overall, I'm very disappointed, I was looking forwards to reading this story and I usually last longer than 4 chapters.

Why do people like it so much?


** People have different tolerances for that type of thing. I'm more like you - from the start, it was evident it wasn't for me.

IIRC people tend to say they like the interactions with Dumbledore that pick up after a bit, when they leave Hogwarts.

*** Oh yeah. I disliked the beginning quite a bit, but the later Dumbledore/Harry interactions were fantastic.

No. Nope, I suppose I'm not.

Your comment actually made me laugh.

**** I am the target audience, but I'm with you, I couldn't get through the first few chapters. I'm not interested in OOC wish fulfilment, and so Harry's characterisation had no appeal to me and made no sense.

Then again, I guess I'm not your usual teenaged guy. My brain isn't entirely sexually oriented.

** It's the traveling and learning magic outside Hogwarts that happens later. Feels adventurous and fun.

** The magic was interesting and the library only showing you what you were ready to learn was a neat concept.

I dropped the fic when Harry went overkill during the second task. The author split the celebration and fallout into separate chapters. It really highlighted the issues I had with the fic's pacing. That and it got a tad too wish fulfillment for my tastes.

*** Oh I love it. Harry is powerful, but honestly believably so. His final battle with Tom is honestly my favorite version of any final fight. And the Albus interactions really are amazing. Harry is not so powerful as to just wandlessly destroy folks like a power wank is, but it shows that powerful magic has consequences and that's why I love it.

*** So far he and Hermione were ignored. Harry was a bit of an ass when treating other Weasleys, but tbh, I also felt that way after breaking up with my best friend (and I was 19).

** Because it has interesting fights and like the title said, arcane magic. Like if you watch Jojo it makes way less sense(Jesus tells a paralyzed person and an executioner who uses steel balls to kill the POTUS) but it's still fun

** I enjoyed the story at first because it was different to the other typical "Harry becomes a badass during fourth year" stories. The Yule Ball and the unrealistic relationships eventually made me drop the fic halfway through. Never picked it up again.

Although I did like Harry smoking the pipe, I haven't seen any others in which he smokes the pipe.
