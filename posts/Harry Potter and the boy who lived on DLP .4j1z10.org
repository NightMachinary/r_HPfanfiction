I can't remember where but i read that i could read chapter 13 on dlp.

I registered but I am still not able to read it ? Any idea what I am doing wrong ?

I apologize if this isn't the place to ask.


** You need to make 5 solid posts on DLP before you can read WbA.

*** And by solid he means "substantive" i.e. you actually have to contribute to the discussion.

***** Think about it this way, The WbA section of DLP is for authors to get feedback on their work from others who are active and knowledgeable in writing/reading HPFF. If you can't even be bothered to participate in the community enough to make 5 posts, why should you be given the option to read and comment on the authors' unfinished work?

******* Have there been any updates recently? I read it before they changed it to the 5 posts rule.
