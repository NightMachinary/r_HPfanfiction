Made a comment last night. Exists in my account's comment list but not the thread. Repeated it. Still doesn't exist in thread.\\
Wondering what I've said that needs me being banned if that is indeed the case.


** I didn't see your comment either. I don't think you're the only one - I keep encountering threads where the number of posts stated doesn't match up with the number of posts actually shown.

*** I think reddit sometimes just glitches with the comments or something. On [[/r/asoiaf][r/asoiaf]] a few times I have been able to see a comment in a post history but not under the post itself (as in this case). It normally loads after a couple of hours though.

*** Yeah, I've seen that too. But I like to imagine that they are there when I revisit the thread a few hours later. Because after a certain point it gets to be more of a bother to figure out if the number is correct.

#+end_quote

That happens if you block users. I get that a lot with the "Remind Me Bot".

***** Well, thanks for trying. Can only hope a Moderator stops by and tell me what was wrong with that post then.

****** Best of luck mate. You could describe the post here and continue the thread or pm a mod directly.

** If you were shadow banned, you /would/ see your comment in the thread (but other people would not). Sounds like your comment was just removed.

*** Yeah true. I recalled upon reading your comment that that was how it worked when I'd been in an argument on the StarWars subreddit. They shadow deleted my OP. But still, what about explaining the general workings of Feudalism on the higher level would end up with a mod feeling like my comment was in need of being deleted/removed? And even so there should be a [Comment Deleted] message, shouldn't there?

**** What's weird in this instance is that I saw it in my notifications (it was in response to my thread) but then when I went to read it, it wasn't in the comments thread, though the comment total included it in its count. I went back to the notifications and it was gone from there too. :puzzled:
