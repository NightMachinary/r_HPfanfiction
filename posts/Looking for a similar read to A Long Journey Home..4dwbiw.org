I am looking for a story that reads the same with the same standard of writing. I am know there is one that is similar to this one though I can't remember the name.


** If by "standard" you mean "theme", then you're probably thinking of linkffn(The Wizard from Earth) which is also about a Harry Potter lost in time.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
