  Iris Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived, gets thrown into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Seeing the signs of a storm on the horizon, she sets herself on a new path. Featuring the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful fem!Harry, a new take on Ancient Runes, animagus transformations, five mostly unique tasks, and some humor. No bashing. First of a multi-part series.

**** As in the "LANGUAGE!" stuff? Yeah, I know :P

I've tried editing it to tone it down. Truthfully, through all the edits I made, I don't really remember how much I changed Hermione when it came to that stuff.

What kinda stuff do you not like when it comes to Hermione though, so I can watch out for it in future chapters?

****** My PM? I don't remember sending one.

  In my mind, she's intelligent, loyal and resourceful
#+end_quote

I hope to make her so, especially the loyal part. Iris will be using darker magic later on, and I don't plan on making Hermione too opposed to it. I also agree that she's intelligent, and should act so. Something that bothered in me in book 7 was the fact that she really didn't want to kill Dolohov and the other guy.

I get not wanting to do the killing yourself, but those two probably murdered who knows how many people after that. He did end up murdering Remus. I always felt like Hermione really wouldn't be opposed to using darker magic as long as it's done for the right reasons, like stopping murderers from murdering.

  the house elves
#+end_quote

I hated the house elf thing, so I really don't plan on going anywhere with that. I just didn't feel like completely tossing it out the window. I might just go with a cop-out and say house-elves enjoy being bonded because it makes them feel stronger or whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Barty could have easily stunned him and thrown a portkey at him before he even entered the tournament.
#+end_quote

Would that work though? A portkey in Hogwarts? I always assumed it wouldn't, that only Dumbledore could make a portkey to do so. I also had a little headcanon that the ritual had to be performed near the summer solstice. It makes me feel better.

******** Perhaps. If it didn't need to be on that week, yeah, there could have been a hundred ways to do it.
