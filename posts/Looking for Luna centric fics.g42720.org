I'm looking for fics that are Luna centric preferably longer 100+ plus and she is actually written well as her bizzar self. I'm ok with crazy Luna or something just not poor character writing.


** I don't know what centric means but I assume this post means” hello world I am looking for fanfiction were Luna lovegood is written as her normal crazy fun self” and if I'm correct then try nargles in the air.
