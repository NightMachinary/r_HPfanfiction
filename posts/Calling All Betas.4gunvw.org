Hi! I am looking for a beta to help me along my first ever foray into writing fanfic. I've read for years, but finally decided to take a crack at writing one. So I am looking for someone to go along on the journey with me, hopefully a fun one! It's SS/HG, so preferably someone who loves/ knows that pairing. Thanks!


** Good luck! My only advice is be prepared to write a lot of stuff that sucks - even you, the author, will be able to see that it is poor material. Start writing oneshots before you try your hand at your own full blown story. A story needs a good solid start, and experience at writing will help a ton.

** Wowzers. This is my /favorite/ pairing. I'm mrsProbie on FFN, so you can see my changing style over the years. Although I haven't posted anything in a while, I've been reading and writing a good bit.

PM me if you're interested in some help!

** I've never beta'd before, but I'm in college studying creative writing and have quite a bit of experience in writing fiction. Please PM me if you're interested, SS/HG is my absolute favorite pairing and I would love to get more experience in proofreading. Please PM me if you're interested and I could either show you some of my work or whatever you'd like to get to know me as a writer/editor. :)
