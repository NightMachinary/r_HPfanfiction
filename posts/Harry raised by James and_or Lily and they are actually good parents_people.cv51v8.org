*** So does the Everyone Lives title mean that nobody dies in the series? Or just that a bunch of the people who got killed off in the first war are still alive? I read the first chapter thinking it'd be a kind of crackfic where nobody dies at all, but then Pettigrew bites the dust in the opening chapter exposition.

**** It's been a while since I read the series, but as far as I remember, Pettigrew is the only character who dies. (However, the series is a WIP, so I suppose that could change.)

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

I don't know, it's been abandoned for years. Seems pretty typical to me.

Nice one tho, Rise from Dust really made me depressed when I found out it was abandoned. At least make a chapter saying what you were going to do In the story and spoil all the things. At least it wont make the reader wonder what would have happened.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and the rest of the series. I think it's on the 4th book now and still ongoing. I'm not sure if it fits perfectly because Lily and James are flawed and not one sided characters, but they seem to love Harry even if they aren't perfect. Also, it's a Marauders live AU with really amazing wordbuilding, and Sirius has a kid the same age as Harry.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
