*/《When the best sort of ending one can hope for is a bittersweet one... how DO you go about living?》/*

The Basilisk was a foe he was woefully ill prepared to face, thus Harry took a mortal blow. But due to the intervention of Fawkes in his final moments he lived to see another day...

/But the venom never truly left./

It lingered, not dormant as its effects were still present. The damage it had done to Harry's internals was as devastating as it was irreversible. And what was left of the King of Serpents mighty toxins was being pumped around his body slowly eating him up from the inside. Every bit of exertion and stress further worsening his condition...

There was nothing to be done. He was living on borrowed time. Nothing could cure him. Nothing could reverse it.

He was not expected to have long as an adult...

Thus, Dumbledore came clean. There was no time to live in a fantasy world where Harry could ignore his destiny and live a normal childhood. In the cruelest of twists, he was sat down and made aware of the prophecy and his role within it, as well as his responsibility to kill Voldemort before the venom killed him.

Via Divination, his expected remaining time is calculated down to the second. Harry has a legitimate timeline set before him where he must discover what it was that allowed Voldemort to survive, destroy it, destroy HIM and try to carve out some semblance of a life in that time period.

When midnight strikes on July 31st 1993, he looks at that figure and sees it at 5 years, 12 weeks and 16 days exactly... the exact point where he refuses to mope around and make something of the time he has left...

How does he go about his last half-decade alive?

** He would want to see the world a bit more, go to an amusement park (possibly Disneyland) at the start.

He might date around a bit and not look for a long term relationship because he doesn't have a future but still wants to experience dating. That would probably exclude Hermione or Ginny because he would not want to hurt them.

I don't know if he would throw himself into training to kill Voldemort. It would be like asking a kid who suddenly developed brittle bone disease (not possible I know) to train in weight lifting and beat the weight lifting record of past 50 years before his bones completely shatter in 5 years.

He might just lose hope and stop trying in school as it is not going to help him, he is going to die before it is any use. He would just do what he loves like flying(if it does not hurt too much) or spending as much time as he can with his friends.

As the years progress his health would worsen. Any little thing would exhaust him. His immune system would weaken like that of a HIV patient and he would be sick all the time.

Alternatively once he reaches the above point he would refuse to slowly waste away and attempt suicide.

Overall this development would be for the worse.
