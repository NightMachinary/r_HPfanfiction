I've read quite a few Slytherin!Harry fics over the years, and it seems like almost none of them address the idea that before Harry was sorted into Gryffindor, many suspected that Harry was a powerful Dark wizard himself. It took Harry proving himself to be Light-oriented before people like Lucius took steps against him. Even Dumbledore had his suspicions which were entirely cleared away by Harry's performance in saving the Stone. Lots of students were highly suspicious of Harry for being a Parselmouth as well.

What do the think the implications might have been of these widespread suspicions seemingly being confirmed by Harry being sorted into Slytherin? How would characters like the Malfoys, the Ministry workers, Snape, and Dumbledore have reacted? Usually in fics I just see them treating Harry the same or, in Snape's case, marginally more favorably. "Pureblood society" generally treats him based on his own merits, without expectations of him turning out to be a Dark Lord. I think that ignores this dimension and I would really love to see it played out.

If anyone knows any fics that address this, that would be awesome too!


** it was one of theories about his survival, yeah. as stated by Distaly, it was mentioned by snape in hbp and in the writing about draco on pottermore

#+begin_quote
  Like every other child of Harry Potter's age, Draco heard stories of the Boy Who Lived through his youth. Many different theories had been in circulation for years as to how Harry survived what should have been a lethal attack, and *one of the most persistent was that Harry himself was a great Dark wizard.* The fact that he had been removed from the wizarding community seemed (to wishful thinkers) to support this view, and Draco's father, wily Lucius Malfoy, was one of those who subscribed most eagerly to the theory. It was comforting to think that he, Lucius, might be in for a second chance of world domination, should this Potter boy prove to be another, and greater, pure-blood champion.

** I think you're confusing 'many' with a couple of loud rumours. There is no evidence that anyone took them seriously. Harry Potter is the person to ever survive the killing curse. The first, something must be strange about him but nobody knows how a child at one could do it. Any sensible person would tell you that it was a fluke or something done by his parents. Only the nutters and conspiracy theorists would call him a dark wizard. When he re-enters the wizarding world at eleven he's a small, quiet mystery trying his best to fit it. Being sorted into Slytherin would have had people ask more questions about his upbringing than him being evil. You'll get rumours sure but nobody who matters would care about him, he's eleven. If however you found that he was forced to become cunning and distance due to his upbringing then people would try and guide his future. Nobody knows where he has been. Dumbledore hid him away, stories have been written about his adventures but at no point would they care about what he has to say. Hogwarts is its own little fiefdom with Dumbledore in charge, nobody can touch Harry there and its unlikely he wouldn't be sent back to the Dursleys at the end of summer.

Draco and Harry don't like each other. That much happened before the sorting. It is unlikely that after what happened on the train Draco would take that lying down, they would be bitter and likely it would be like the Harry/Seamus drama in fifth year where they dislike each other but mostly ignore each other. You and so many Slytherin Harry authors are forgetting he's eleven. People might seek to guide his growth, to groom him but it is unlikely that he himself has any real ambitions set in stone at eleven. Draco might wield his father's projected power to make Harry's life harder and it would be strange for Mr Malfoy to try and reverse this open antagonism, if anything he would likely try and isolate Harry even more.

Dumbledore would almost certainly looked into the Dursley's more had Harry been sorted into Slytherin. Dumbledore wants Harry loved and cared for, he would want to know why Harry was sorted there and I doubt he would be happy to learn that Harry lived in a cupboard. You'll likely find that if anything Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing even more to guide him away from people like Draco. An ambitious cunning Harry who Dumbledore personally guides would be far more interesting than some poor attempt at child grooming by Malfoy Sr, anyone could tell Harry that the Malfoys would hate him and he being a Slytherin would be more cautious. Remember that when Harry returned only Dumbledore and a few others knew Voldemort would return. The fact that Malfoy Sr ditched the diary shows he doesn't anticipate the Dark Lord returning to claim it, why plan around controlling Harry Potter when he is nothing but a novelty. 'Pure blood' society is a fanon thing and I doubt Harry Potter age eleven is very interesting outside of being the boy-who-lived.

This is true. While the rumors were persistent, there is no evidence that they were by any means the majority. It was most likely limited to paranoid people or Knockturn Alley types. The thing is, Slytherin is not lacking in either kind of people, and if everyone at Hogwarts has /heard/ these rumors, even if they dismissed them, it's likely that the more impulsive of them would condemn Harry immediately based on his Sorting. Ron certainly comes to mind. Another question is whether it was common knowledge that Dumbledore had been in charge of Harry's placement. People ignorant of Dumbledore's influence in Harry's life might easily have assumed that Harry was taken in by dark wizards.

While I agree that almost all Slytherin Harry authors conveniently ignore Harry's mental maturity at 11, I don't think I am doing that at all. My post is about other people's assumptions about Harry, not how Harry himself would act as a Slytherin. I'm pretty convinced that Harry would have no clue what he was getting into and would simply react naively. It's made pretty clear that Harry had never had any friends before meeting Ron, and it's heavily implied that 11-year-old Harry is deeply impressionable. He consistently accepts whatever the first person who tells him about a topic says, and then sticks to his guns after that. I think he was pretty lucky that Dumbledore sent Hagrid to go fetch him, as this basically guaranteed that Harry would be on Dumbledore's side. I have little patience for fics that give Harry his own lofty independent ambitions before puberty. And he certainly wouldn't have the social skills to navigate Slytherin House without making several powerful enemies.

I agree with this. It never makes any sense when it turns out in fanfiction that Dumbledore never cared about Harry's treatment or had some stake in having him be mistreated.

I think it shows the opposite, actually, but that's rather off-topic. I linked to an essay explaining why in my response to Distaly above.

**** I thought that essay was almost completely wrong. On the rumours front I would suggest the opposite kind of people would be the rumour spreading lot. Throughout his time at Hogwarts Harry had the most image trouble with Hufflepuffs. Slytherin disliked him and knocturn alley types almost certainly would know what dark was and should be better in formed. In the forth book it's dotty Doris or whatever who spreads the nasty rumours about Frank the gardener. It's idle people with too much time.

***** I hadn't considered that before, about the rumors. Lucius was indeed a believer in them, though.

Could I ask why you thought the essay was wrong? There is quite a bit of speculation in it, but I find most of it to be pretty solid. In any case, it seems to be one valid interpretation.

** I have just read PS again a few weeks ago and I dont remember either of the things you just pointed out. You say it was idespread that people tought him to be "dark" but there is no canon evidence for that. On the top of my had I only remember Snape saying it to Bellatrix in HBP and he would have said anything to discredit Harry in that situation.

You say even Dumbledore had his doubts until Harry showed he was "light-oriented" (btw the whole dark-light already is pretty much completly created by fans) but as far as I remember he always was behind Harry, always. The stuff with the parselmouth is easily explained, a bunch of childrean in school have just 'lost' a few class members and suddenly this famous dude is revealed to have an ability that only the evil have, therefore he must be evil. That this logic is flawed doesnt really matter when you are 12.

How would Dumbledore have reacted? Propably the same, the Malfoys? Propably the same consindering Harry had already made Draco an enemy before the sorting. I even doubt Snape would be very conflicted in the end, his hate for James is pretty much limitedless.

And last, what is this Pureblood society you are speaking of? I mean if something like this is included by the author (which happens often in Slytherin!Harry fics) it has only two consequenzes:

1. All ELEVEN year old childrean are expected to be political masterminds and only act in favor of there family. Does anyone really belive thats how politics word?
2. Harry becomes really important for the politics despite being evelen and therefore having the voice of an little girl. Seriously no one would take his words for anything other than amuse.

There are of course still fics like what you search (although I cant recommend one), they just have the problems of being far from canon and being bad.

*** Thanks for the lengthy response! I disagree that that quote by Snape (”I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack.”) is unreliable, because he is referring to stories and rumors, not his own opinions. This is enough to explain the antagonism towards Harry in CoS, and it's a simpler explanation as well.

The fact that rumors were circulating around Harry at that time also explains why Lucius waited until his second year to plant the Diary, as explained in [[https://hpcompanion.com/essays/csessay/][this essay.]]

As for Light/Dark, yeah, I agree it's mostly fanon, though there are a few references to it in the books, just not as this big Star-Wars-esque conflict. TBH, I was just using it as a shorthand.

I put "pureblood society" in scare quotes because it is fanon for the most part. There are canon things such as the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but those things are never fleshed-out. It only makes sense that Harry would become more familiar with these things if he were in Slytherin, even if he ends up rejecting them.

**** Didn't Lucius only need to get rid of the Diary because of some new Ministry law about dark magic items? I think that was the given reason for why he tried to offload it at Borgin and Burkes, where no one would have written in it and it probably wouldn't have been used as a weapon that year, which he was only unable to do because Borgin knew Tom Riddle was Voldemort.

***** You're right that's the implied reason, but if it were the only reason, why would Dobby have been so concerned about Harry specifically, unless he had overheard the "plot" to make terrible things happen at Hogwarts? I think Lucius had been playing with the idea of handing the Diary off to Harry since sometime during first year, once it was clear that Harry was not valuable as a potential ally. There's also the fact that Lucius was getting impatient with Borgin, saying he had important business elsewhere, yet, we see him again not long after just hanging around at the bookstore, seemingly waiting around for the Weasleys and Harry. It is possible that selling the Diary off to Borgin was a last-ditch effort that failed, and then it was back to Plan B--offloading it onto Harry. It just happened to be that he got in a fistfight with Arthur, and he changed his mind at the last second.

**** I don't really think Harry would learn more about "pureblood Society" in Slytherin than in Gryffindor. There hardly is such a thing in canon. Authors who make a pureblood Society up could as well have Harry learn about it from the Weasleys or other pureblood Gryffindors.

** I would think the Malfoys would wait patiently, maybe even attempt to have another child (daughter) so they can marry into the Potter-line.

Snape would be just as nasty to Harry, as most people who see themselves when they look at someone, see someone they hate. And a closed off boy that is really good at every wand-related subject (if you go by most fanfictions that put him in Slytherin) would definitely remind Snape of himself at that young of an age.

I would like to challenge the theory of Dumbledore attempting to convert Harry. I actually think that it would be the opposite. Dumbledore was always a realistic person with a touch of optimism, it's highly likely that he expected Harry to get into Slytherin, due to sending him to the Dursley's. Maybe, that was what he wanted, a Harry that thirsted for the magical world, wanted to learn every subject with a wand that he could. Harry getting into Slytherin would give Dumbledore hope, and maybe even the will to train him.

The others in Slytherin house would constantly bully him, and he would regularly be challenged to duels simply for impeding on the Slytherin 'honour'. Harry naturally not having the forces of the Weasleys behind him, would just leave it be and not rise to the bait, we can assume he had to deal with people like that in school.

I have no idea about the ministry, since the ministry itself was generally incompetent in canon, and I cannot gauge any character from there other than Tonks.
