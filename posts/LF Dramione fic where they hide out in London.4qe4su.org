** I loved that story as well. For some reason, it isn't available on FF.net anymore but I found it here : [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28434947-cruel-and-beautiful-world]]

Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10157648/1/The-Confusion-of-Theo-Nott][this]]? It's a kind of follow up.
