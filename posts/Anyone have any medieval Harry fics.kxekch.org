Any will do, just want to branch out from my usual fics!

So if Harry gets tossed back in time, or he was born there, all of it sounds good.


** You might like linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494]]). Some of the works are set in the canon present but others are either Harry or the Hogwarts founders in the early middle ages.

** A fair bit of linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is set in Arthurian times, with Jasmine Potter teaching Merlin and then avenging his death.

Note that it's technically unfinished, but it has an unusual structure that means it's never really incomplete. It starts by giving you the beginning and ending, then the rest of it is telling tales from along the way. So even if those tales are unfinished, the story as a whole is always complete.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Do you have to have Harry there?

- “The Friar's Calling by Chthonia” linkao3(7460772) ... beautifully written story of The Fat Friar (and Sir Cadogan). You don't have Harry Potter, but you get the real historical figure, [[https://historyofphilosophy.net/grosseteste][Robert Grosseteste]].

- “Bloodstone by Northumbrian” linkao3(9445599) surprisingly for Northumbrian who otherwise writes rather realistic and down-to-earth stories (I have invented the term magicians realism exactly for him) wrote this historical story from the time of the unravelling of the Roman Empire and what was the true origin of Merlin. And it has surprising relationship to one of his next-gen stories.

- “[[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]]” is a story from really long time ago (yes, you will finally find out what happened 382 BC) about the origins of magic and wands. Slightly too long, but otherwise very well written.

- “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil by celticbard]]” being a muggleborn is tough, but what about being the one in the Puritan New England exactly in time of Salem Witch Hunts?

  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.
