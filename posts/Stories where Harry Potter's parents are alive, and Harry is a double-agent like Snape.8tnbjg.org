** I guess linkffn(2705927) counts---it certainly has a similar feel to /The Double Agent/. It's a much longer read though and quite dark at times.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

** Totally wrong fandom but if you read naruto fanction give this a go. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/722013][in dreams you follow (but I dream in the dark)]] Kiba swallows and reminds himself that he's an S-rank criminal, that he's a traitor and a killer and there's nothing he won't do if it means preserving his cover. Even if he has to kill a whole family.
