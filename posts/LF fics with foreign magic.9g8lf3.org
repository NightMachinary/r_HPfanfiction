Hello! I'm looking for fics that explore the idea of different cultures having different styles of magic. Even better if it's not just different spells, but they actually use different tools and rituals. Preferably with Harry learning how to use said magic.

No romance preferred, but any pairing is fine, het or slash, except for big age differences (ie student/teacher).


** linkffn(Accidental Animagus) and it's sequel linkffn(Animagus at War) have this (or maybe only the sequel, not sure). The sequel was on hold for a while though and since then has only gotten occasional updates. It's not clear yet if the author plans to complete it.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Druid of holly and yew is one such fic. It has barely begun, but depicts a druidic Harry, more in tune with nature, and less wand-waving. Note however, that this Harry is quite OOC compared to canon.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.
