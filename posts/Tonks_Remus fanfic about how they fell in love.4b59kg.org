  Remus was a stubborn man, but Tonks'd prove to him that she could be even more either to show him that they should be in a relationship and start a life together or to bet on their baby's gender and choose the nursery's colour. From the end of GoF until the end of DH, centred on Remus and Dora and how they turned each other's world upside down with laughter, tears and love. Canon.

** So I haven't read either of these in a while, but I used to be really into Tonk/Remus fics. linkffn(The Order Through the Eyes of Nymphadora) - I'm pretty sure this one isn't completed nor updated in quite a while linkffn(The Werewolf Who Stole Christmas) is a really good one, as far as I remember.

  Remus manages to rob Tonks of her Christmas spirit, but helping her to get it back proves the catalyst for something a tad more lasting than a kiss under the mistletoe. RemusTonks romance through OOTP and HBP. Started before DH.

  Remus Lupin has long believed that love is a luxury beyond his means. Nymphadora Tonks has been too busy proving herself as an Auror to pay any attention to romance. Their strong if unexpected friendship is a source of comfort in difficult times---until it threatens to turn into something more. (Eventual RLNT. Sirius Black, Order members. Set during OotP.)
