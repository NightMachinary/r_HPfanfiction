The story was post-dh, Harry was an Auror, had 3 children and moved in an old, disused manor in a muggle hometown. Ginny wore her hair in a braid down her back and His youngest had just started school at a muggle school and the mothers were very gossipy.

- Harry and Ginny developed a friendship with one of the muggle couples.

- Initially, the muggle husband tried to look into finance history of Harry and Ginny (can't remember why) and they were promptly told off by higher ups.

- There was a party at Harry's house where we saw most of his friends and they tried to hide magic because muggles were also invited. There was a case of accidental magic from Victoire against one of the muggle children (she charmed a pot of punch I think and dropped it over the child's head)

- Harry rode a motorcycle and had a helmet in the form and color's of Gryffindor's lion head.

- There was a problem with werewolves attacking civilians, but it was still nebulous.

- Lavender had become a werewolf.

- They communicated through mirrors like cellphones.

- One of the last plot-relevant chapters had an emergency summoning Harry, who tried to run in the forest to avoid being forcefully portkeyed in front of the muggles. The ghost of his recently killed subordinates had appeared to warn him right before.

Many thanks!


** Strangers at Drakeshaugh is what you are looking for.

Just a note for future use, the flair you are looking for is "Fic Search". :)

** I was confused for a second because 1. I wouldn't really call Drakeshaugh a manor and 2. It's his oldest, James, who goes to the muggle school.

I was about halfway down the list thinking to myself 'this sounds /just/ like Strangers' before I realised you must have just made a small mistake at the start XD

*** Yes, details got confused in my head :(

I even thought there was "neighbour" in the title, but eh.
