He seemed like he knew about Voldemort and some of what was going on outside of his prison.


** Yeah, but Voldemort had already been somewhat infamous by the mid-1950s. Given the comparisons made and the length of time he rampaged around, its not hard to see news reaching Grindelwald some how.

It may be that Dumbledore actually goes to speak with every once in a while. Maybe a few house-elves check in on him. Maybe has guards. The last two mean you can add a couple more murders to Voldemort's body count but otherwise nothing changes.

As for Harry...the thing is it seems that outside Britain Harry is less of a wizar-messiah and more like a fluke of nature. Like a talented athlete in another country: something you might be curious to see once, but would only tell people about later if you were drunk and out of things to talk about

** Probably. Doubt he was unaware of current events from Nurmengard. Can't recall from the books exactly though.
