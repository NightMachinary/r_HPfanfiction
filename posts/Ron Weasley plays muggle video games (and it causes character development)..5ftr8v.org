A thought that came to me when I was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5fssaq/lf_hhr_fics_that_feature_a_harry_hermione/][looking at this post]] and trying to come up with a way for Hermione and Ron to split amicably.

My idea is, to start off, take the concept that Ron is good at Quidditch, and good at chess, and expand on that to get the idea that Ron enjoys various kinds of games.

With his father fascinated by muggle culture, Ron eventually finds himself looking into muggle board games, and eventually into video games; enjoying these games alters his view of muggles for the better and improves his understanding of their culture, and also steers him towards being more empathic towards other magical creatures with their own literature, games, art, etc.

...Heh, whoever heard of video games improving someone's social skills?

But yeah, does anyone know any fics where Ron Weasley (or any other pureblood wizard) plays and enjoys video games, and it marks a milestone in their character development for the fic?


** Wouldn't it be fun to see Ron playing Risk?

I might write a oneshot...

** Not a video game, but in linkao3(Muggle Studies) (hermione/Lucius), Hermione shows Star Wars to Lucius and he's interested/changed. It's a long fic based on Lucius having to take muggle studies classes to be reformed, so Star Wars insn't the only thing but it's the most "pop culture" one. Funny fic, a bit long sometimes, but I liked it.

Edit : no, bot, not that one ! I'm on mobile but if you search for "muggle studies Lucius hermione" you'll find it. I don't know if it works, but I'm trying with the ao3 link.

Edit again : helloooo bot, linkao3(muggle studies)

*** I found it and am reading it now. It's pretty alright so far.

Strange, though. I thought a fair bit about power and need for control when trying to design a D&D race's psychological traits a little while back, so I'm really sympathizing with Lucius in the first few chapters, he doesn't control anything.
