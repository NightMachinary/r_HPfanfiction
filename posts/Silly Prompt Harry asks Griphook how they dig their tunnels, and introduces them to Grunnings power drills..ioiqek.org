*** nah in a flip of tropes

it turns out goblin culture is basically goblins insulting the shit out of each others for shits and giggles

and vernon accidently used the biggest and best goblin insult and every goblin is just impressed by his sheer balls

basically a reverse of the standard harry was nice to a goblin so they worship him

**** It's like when humans say 'break a leg'. Goblins believe that wishing ill on others is encouragement and positive wishes are bad luck. The weaponisation of Sod's Law, basically. :D

**** "Grubby little shites..." he muttered to himself as he stood up from the negotiating table. The Goblins were unyielding, why did he let himself get talked into this?

As it turns out, though, goblins have very good hearing. Comes with the territory, there's some right powerful beasts deeper down in the depths. So when the guards around the room readied their axes and hammers, and the negotiator stood up quickly enough for his stool to clatter to the floor, Vernon knew he was done for.

"What did you just say, /human/?"

/Eh, da always said 'never give in', and I'm dead anyway, screw it/

"I said you're a greedy little shitstain whose mind is always on money."

The goblin jumped on his desk, and waddled closer.

"Well ye're a greasy, fat windbag of a human who couldn't tell gold from brass if his son's life depended on it!"

"My son is a better goblin than you could ever be, and he doesn't even have magic tricks to cheat honest people out of their money!"

The guards looked aghast, but the negotiator had fire in his eyes.

"At least us goblins aren't cheap enough to make our jewellry out of aluminum, like yer wedding ring! Don't love yer wife enough, fatso?"

"At least I have a wife, ya fucking gremlin! Do your people even have women?"

This went on for a few hours, with the insults gradually getting more and more vulgar and profane. If there's anything Vernon is good at, it is insulting people.

But eventually, it had to come to an end. The goblin negotiator was in the middle of a complex system of blasphemous statemets implicating Vernon's matrimonal line, when there was a chime from his desk. He paused, looked down, smiled manically and held out his hand.

"Never before has a human passed our test. We'll accept your terms, Mr. Dursley. And please, do come back. I haven't had this much fun in years."

And Vernon was unceremoniously shuffled out of the bank, whose doors slammed shut with a loud clang of reinforced steel, signifying the end of Diagon Alley's workday. In his hand, he clutched a contract for the sale of seven hundred very expensive drills.
