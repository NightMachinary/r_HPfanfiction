Hi, I'm hoping you all can help us out with a psychology study we are conducting. We are doing an anonymous survey (30 min or less) about fanfiction.

Participants over the age of 18 are eligible to win a $50 Amazon gift card (chances of winning are 1 in 100, draw entries will be confidential and not associated with survey responses).

You can take the survey online at: [[https://tamuc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3z4shSca0Je2rK5]]

The survey will be open until March 15, 2019.

Thank you! Diana Siotos, Undergraduate Student, Texas A&M University-Commerce, [[mailto:dsiotos@leomail.tamuc.edu][dsiotos@leomail.tamuc.edu]] Dr. Stephen Reysen, Department of Psychology & Special Education, Texas A&M University-Commerce, [[mailto:Stephen.Reysen@tamuc.edu][Stephen.Reysen@tamuc.edu]] Dr. Courtney Plante, Department of Psychology, MacEwan University, [[mailto:plantec5@macewan.ca][plantec5@macewan.ca]]

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the feedback and suggestions. Some of which have led us to consider taking a different perspective for this research line. We're going to take up these suggestions to formulate a different study. So, we're shutting this one down early. We'll send out gift cards to draw winners shortly. Thank you all again for your help!


** OP wasn't kidding when they said it would take about 30 minutes to complete the survey.

  The purpose of this research is to assess attitudes related to the fanfiction.

could've used a beta reader

​

edit:

it also sometimes seemed like parts of the survey were recycled from something similar but not all the words were adjusted.

​

on a completely different subject, I'm curious: how much thought is given to the pros and cons of the 50$ Amazon gift card lottery? because some participants might think twice about sharing the survey because it would decrease their odds of winning.

some might even try to convince others not to do it.

might be an interesting meta study...

** Sorry, but this is a shit survey. The English is bad and the questions don't always make sense. At one point you need to specifically think about Star Wars while answering questions about your relation to other fan fiction fans and the community? One set of questions asks how immersed in “the show” you get? I gave up at the set of questions about putting women on pedestals. I see no cohesiveness in these questions and I suggest you don't waste your time.

*** It's a free $50 gift card, the least you can do is put in some effort....
