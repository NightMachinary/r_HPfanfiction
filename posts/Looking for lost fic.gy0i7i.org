I've been looking for this for days and it's driving me crazy. I know it's a harry and snape slave fic, I don't think it's slash. It's not enslaved, unwell, or to live and serve

The only scene I remember is where they're trying to get around the bond by having snape look harry in the eyes while the bond insists he not then something weird happens and some sort of whip appears and starts hitting snape, I also think there was a thing about the bond being sentient but maybe that's a different fic. Thank you in advance for looking
