****** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR.

The plotting is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of history and political philosophy most of the story will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Harry's political outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation -- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Machiavelli's Il Principe, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the plot, to realise that it's not just a story -- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots -- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the history behind Malfoy's catchphrase “As soon as I'm old enough, I'm going to rape her”, which itself is a cryptic reference to mid 18th century French feudal politics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, I DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the witches' eyes only -- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin' personnel kid.

This is an extract:

 "Quietus" she said, and a screen of silence descended around them, blocking out all the street noises.

What did I do wrong...

Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn't have a full adult Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat, controlled. "You must remember, Mr. Potter," she said, "that there was a war in this country not ten years ago. Everyone has lost someone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not done lightly."

"I - I didn't mean to -" The inference dropped like a falling stone into Harry's exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked about someone breathing their last breath - and then the salesgirl had run away - and the war had ended ten years ago so that girl would have been at most eight or nine years old, when, when, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..." Harry choked up, and turned away to run from the older witch's gaze..."

Nobility was heavily intertwined with the ideals of chivalry - and that meant that things like rape were at least supposed to not be done by the nobility. That doesn't mean that they didn't partake in it, particularly after the sack of a city - but they wouldn't joke about it in the open.

#+begin_quote
  In the fic, when Harry hears Draco say this, he decides to befriend Draco
#+end_quote

That is grossly misleading. Harry's reaction is to choke on his soda and have to cough it out, then ask about what Draco's said, with a growing sense of horror and desire to tear down the whole society that enables that kind of behaviour.

He does eventually befriend Draco with a view to changing his ways, because he takes the view that Draco is largely just a product of his environment and he is largely successful in the end, with a lot of work and some considerable pain. But it's not at all his first reaction to hearing the rape plan. He first asks questions about the court system, trying to understand how Draco can expect to get away with that (and wanting to introduce things like DNA testing), and upon hearing about how corrupt things are, his internal reaction is /Note to self: Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest convenience./ And his opinion doesn't improve from there.

Feel free to dislike this Harry for being arrogant, dismissive of others' feelings, and careless at times with forces beyond his comprehension, because all of those are true. But it's /not/ true that he shrugs his shoulders at rape.

Sadly not. He used a silencing charm first, and explained to Harry how he would be able to evade justice by selectively wiping his own memory and having his father apply the right political pressure. And went on to explain how, if Harry testified against him, the same pressure could be brought to bear to destroy Harry.

Note that they didn't have the same instant animosity as canon, and at this point Draco was still thinking Harry was more or less on the same page as himself, while Harry was silently freaking out about the kind of society that produces kids like this.

** *Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes*

I refused to lose points for rescuing the wrong person. Hermione or Ginevra were both perfectly reasonable options, and the little girl wasn't out of the question, either. At that point, it was just easier to take them all.

I threw a blasting curse at the base of the statue's tail. Suddenly, the merpeople stopped singing. They raised their spears and approached me. I was surrounded.

"While that does explain Mr. Krum's unfortunate injury and your decision to take all three hostages -- destroying a merperson relic in the process -- I'm afraid I still don't understand what you did afterwards," Dumbledore said, looking very tired.

This was a small improvement over the rest of the judges, who appeared livid.

"It was a perfectly logical decision," I insisted. "The mermen were using their environmental advantage against me. So I took it from them." "You banished all the water in the lake. You truly don't consider that excessive?" Dumbledore asked. "Not at all. Besides, I figured the spectators would have a better time if they could actually watch the task. Really, I was doing you all a favor."

Dumbledore said, "But the merpeople are unable to survive on air for more than a few minutes. You greatly endangered their lives, my boy."

I raised an eyebrow. "They greatly endangered mine first when they attacked me with spears, and, really, a few less mermen is hardly a problem. They kill more students than the moving staircase...and we all know what I did to the moving staircase." The denizens of Hogwarts simultaneously shivered, though the foreigners seemed rather perplexed. Karkaroff scowled. "Viktor Krum also had gills at the time, and he was already injured by your attack." "And my Fleur was fifty feet in ze air when ze water disappeared!" Madame Maxime said, "and zat is after ze 'orrible boy cast a Silencing Spell on 'er." "There weren't any rules that said I couldn't attack the competition. Honestly, I thought that was the entire point," I said. "It was a race, not a duel," Karkaroff said. "Yes, exactly, and I won," I said. "In fact, I'm the only one who brought his hostage back at all...whichever one she was." "Ginevra Weasley," Dumbledore said. I shook my head, dismayed by their ridiculous expectations. "How was I supposed to guess that? We aren't even friends."

Some distance across the grounds, a still-dripping Ginevra said, "We will be!" I shivered. This was beginning to remind me uncomfortably of the Bellatrix situation. "And I'm not sure why you think it's my responsibility to protect everyone. It's your competition. You should have expected I would do something like this." Moody grunted, "That's why I put up the splash guard." "See, why can't you all be like Moody?" I asked. We all turned our attention towards the ex-auror, who was currently shimmering with no less than twenty protective charms. Dumbledore sighed. "Could you return the lake water, now that the task is over?" "I would do that," I said, "except that I'm not entirely sure where I sent it."

/Meanwhile, at Privet Drive/

Petunia Dursley stood knee-deep in the flooded street, staring blankly at what was once her house. The front door had floated to the very end of her waterlogged lawn. Every window was broken, and what little she could see of her immaculate carpets and organized kitchen was entirely ruined. She didn't dare to think of what had happened to the garden. As she picked up a floating photograph of baby Dudley, Petunia wondered -- for a moment -- where her life had gone so wrong. But the answer was obvious: The moment she accepted Harry Potter into her life. This was all his fault. Things usually were.

** Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir, Chapter 8:

NSFW:

"Nine yards, perhaps?"

"Eleven. I'll go further than anyone. Let me serve you, your friends, use me however you want. In the mornings I guess you need to pee, just like anyone else. If you put the head of your cock in my ass, you can pee there, and I will take it to the bathroom for you, so you can stay in bed. I. Am. Yours! Get it? Now, I won't beg for your fantastic cock right now, but tonight, I'll be there."

Harry smiled warmly at the ferocious Huldr. His life was looking up.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions is loaded with them.

Chapter 2:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's friends cruelly abandoned him to talk to Draco, on the theory that it was his own stupid plan.

  Traitors.

  (A small voice inside his head pointed out he'd never had friends to be traitors before, and he should be grateful. The little voice that told him he was ungrateful for things always sounded like his Aunt. He tuned it out, with long practice.)
#+end_quote

Chapter 79:

#+begin_quote
  “I will not be shown up by /Minerva McGonagall/,” Professor Snape hissed at him, over a cloudy potion that stunk of regret and elderberries.
#+end_quote

Chapter 94:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Professor Snape,

  /I know you do not like to be bothered during the summer holidays, but I thought I would/

  Harry crumpled up the note and started over.

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I achieved an Outstanding on my Potions OWL, as instructed. I hope your summer is/

  Harry tore that one in half. Hedwig, sitting on her perch, hooted at him.

  “I'm working on a letter for Professor Snape, Hedwig. I'll have it for you in a minute.”

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /How are you? I am fine. I hope you are recovered. I was pleased to receive my OWL results and look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts/

  Harry studied that one, then crumpled it up too. Hedwig, bored, soared out the window.

  /Dear Evil Nose,/

  /I got an Outstanding on my potions OWL, so you're stuck with me. Everyone has been asking me how I am, and I look forward to returning to school so you can tell me I'm being an idiot. I've been trying to figure out what to put in a letter to you for an hour and this is sadly my best attempt, which I am now going to ritually burn./

  /My last myrtle potion demonstrated that if you're overenthusiastic about the tapping it explodes amusingly on the unwitting student./

  /Harry/

  Harry crumpled it into a ball and threw it out the window, where Hedwig caught it and flew away.

  Harry made a noise approximately like ‘gnk.'

** A Black Comedy by Nonjon, Chapter 21, [[https://pastebin.com/K3S03bDq][this scene with Tonks, Lily, and Sarah eating ice cream.]] I had to use Pastebin because it was too long to post here.

The whole scene always cracks me up. Yes it's lowbrow juvenile bodily function humor but it never fails to make me laugh, especially the end of the scene.

#+begin_example
  Tonks pat her chest a little bit and let out a loud echoing belch. "Wow. That even tasted good the second time."
  Lily raised a curious eyebrow. "Are you challenging the champion?"
  "Let's see what you got," Tonks taunted.
  Lily opened her mouth and swallowed a gulp of air. She raised her hand and repeated with another gulp before letting loose a deep reverberating burp, more than twice as loud and long as Tonks' had been.
  A house elf appeared with a pop. "Did youse call for me, Missum Potter?"
  Tonks had to look away, because she was struggling to hold back her laughter.
  Lily waved off the confused and curious elf. "No, Irma. If I did, I didn't mean to."
  "Okays," Irma the house elf happily replied and popped away.
  Tonks gave up holding back and outright laughed at Lily.
  Lily raised an arm in victory. "Still the King.
#+end_example

After many expulsions of gas (from both ends)...

#+begin_example
  The two female Potters were all set to pounce on Tonks, who was increasingly feeling as if she were cornered. She was saved by the appearance of James Potter.
  "I've been doing paperwork for seven hours straight," James complained as he walked into his wife's quarters. "And I… good lord. What's that smell?"
  Lily flashed a look at Tonks and Sarah, calmly answering, "Your son let off a dung bomb earlier."
  James shook his head. "I swear it's those Lord Blacks. They're a bad influence on him."
  "You know what? It's late," Tonks said jumping up. "I should get going. See you tomorrow, boss. Night Lily, Sarah."
  "Good night, Tonks," James said as she hurried out the portrait. He walked back towards the bedroom taking off his wand holsters as he went. He stuck his head back in the front room and added distastefully, "It was a super dung bomb, wasn't it?"
  Lily had to gulp and cover her mouth to hide her amusement.
  James smiled at his wife, turning back towards the bedroom. "You and your dainty little burps."

** I mean this whole scene had me in stitches.

“Sirius gave her the kind of hapless grin she probably expected from him, and Narcissa nodded, satisfied. She held out her hand. "Draco, come here and meet your cousin."

Sirius was pretty sure that he stifled his snicker. So Narcissa won the battle about what to name the kid, huh? He watched as a pale little boy came strolling to Narcissa's side. He was trying to hold his nose up and look accomplished and adult. He mostly succeeded in looking pointy.

"This is my son, Draco Malfoy," Narcissa said, as if she hadn't already announced that, her hand on Draco's shoulder.

"He's very...blond."

Narcissa shot him a sharp glance (still not as sharp as her son's cheekbones), and then looked around. "We had heard you were raising the Boy-Who-Lived, Sirius. Where is he?"

"I actually traded him for a map to buried treasure."

Draco stared at him with his mouth open. Narcissa's glance this time was disapproving. But Harry laughed from behind a nearby rack of trunks and gave the game away.

"It would have to be at least two maps, Sirius, otherwise it wouldn't be a fair price." Harry stepped into sight and gave Narcissa and her son a polite if unenthused nod. "How are you, Mrs. Malfoy? Draco."

"You're Harry Potter," Draco said, a vibration of awe in his voice.

"He's also very Slytherin," Sirius whispered to Narcissa.

She glared at him, but Harry answered before she could say anything. "Yeah, I get that a lot. It's the fringe, isn't it?"

Draco blinked, puzzled in a way that no nine-year-old boy should be. Sirius sighed. He was probably growing up in an environment with no jokes. What a sad thing. If Sirius and Narcissa managed to get along well enough, then perhaps Harry and Draco should play more often, and then Sirius could maybe ensure the poor boy had a sense of humor.”

** "We were kind of in the middle of something."

"You're not bothering me, go ahead." She shrugged. "Anyway, I get it though. Well, I mean, I don't really get it --- I still think how important people think this stuff is, the effort they'll put into it, all that is still silly. But the basic idea, sure. Orgasms are fun. I get it."

Siri let out a groan. "Morrigan have mercy on our souls, Little Bella's started screwing around. Do I even want to know?"

"Wilderfolk girl back at Hogwarts, you haven't met her." Lyra blinked. "Or...you have, now that I think about it --- that was you at the Quidditch match, wasn't it?"

"You don't--- You mean the little white and yellow one, always sticking her nose in things she shouldn't? You know, I would say it's hard to imagine you fucking a bloody wilderfolk, but if I had to pick one..."

"I know, she's great, right? Also, orgasms? Fun."

"Not gonna hear me disagreeing on---"

"Do you two mind?!" Lyra didn't think she'd ever heard Zee's voice get quite that high and screechy, it was bloody weird. The glaring was also rather...well, Black-ish, Other Bella and Cissy had clearly been an excellent influence. "Lyra, get out."
