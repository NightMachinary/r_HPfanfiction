Looking for a short dark fic I read last year where Hermione is a Pureblood killer who is murdering kids/infants before they can grow to become Death Eaters.

I remember that she turns young Peter Pettigrew into a rat and tortures him in a cage before taunting his mother that she should have raised him better. Also she cut's a piece of baby Lucius Malfoy's hair and carries it with her like some sort of twisted trophy.

She's not exactly sane lmao.

If anyone remembers this messed up work, please let me know!
