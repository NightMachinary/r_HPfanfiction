Yo! Would anybody happen to have any fics like the fic? I really love the style it was written in, but it's sadly unfinished at 59k, and I would love some recommendations for fics like it (somehow, I'm not picky).

Possible relations: -The style it was written -Dark Ron -Dark weasleys -Ron POV -It's fun -Little head cannons everywhere -Cracky/it makes you laugh -A new idea that hasn't been explored a lot -It feels like your best friend is whispering the story to you when neither of you are supposed to be talking -Talks about the Weasley family dynamic -Any other similarities that you can think of


** No competition is a cracky dark lord Harry fic with found family elements that always makes me laugh.
