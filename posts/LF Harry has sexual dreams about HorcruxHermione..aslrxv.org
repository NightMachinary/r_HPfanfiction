Pretty much the title.

Edit: Sorry about the confusion! By Horcrux!Hermione I mean the version of Hermione that appears in vision the locket shows to taunt Ron.

** During DH, the locket shows images of Harry and Hermione passionately kissing. Fantasy dreams about that maybe?

*** Exactly! You'd think there would be more of these but it's proved difficult to find.

**** For some reason the H/Hr pairing doesn't feature a lot of fics in which they find together on the run, or close afterwards.

**** It's rather late, story's nearly over. Most fanfiction starts earlier, or takes place after everything's over.

***** That would great if there was something post-Hogwarts. If Harry ever started having inappropriate thoughts of Hermione I could easily seeing it being manifested as Horcrux!Hermione in his head, since that's the only time in canon he saw her in some sort of sexual light.

** What does this even mean? Horcrux!Hermione?

She's a horcrux like Harry is, and somehow that factors into a sexual fantasy?

**** I think he's referring to the scene in the last movie/book when Ron sees a vision of Harry and Hermione at it thanks the horcrux
