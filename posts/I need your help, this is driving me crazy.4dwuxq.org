For the past month I have been trying to find a specific fan-fiction to do with our favorite fan-base. This fanfic includes a part where harry is attacked by Ravenclaw females, and is found by Minerva (professor McGonagall), she hates Harry in this fanfic. Can you guys and gals help me find it?

Edit: I found it about a year ago on fanfiction.net, now i can't remember the title

Harry's Golden Nuggets. McG's a horribitch in this one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

** In the future, if you are looking for a fic you read off FFN, and you *reviewed* it, it will be in your review history, which can be accessed under "settings". I think the history only holds 300 reviews, but don't quote me on that.
