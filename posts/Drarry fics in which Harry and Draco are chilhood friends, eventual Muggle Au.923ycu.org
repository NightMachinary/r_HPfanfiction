So since i read "Draco's boy", "Blackberry Jam" and "The Door Through The World" ( yeah , i know that is a Wolfstar) i have been very interested in drarry (or wolfstar) fanfictions that are centered around the childhood friendship trope (where it is portrayed and not just mentioned).I think that the sweetest way to believe in the concept of falling in love is to see the built up through the years, plus it has that kind of cuteness caused by innocence.. Do you have suggestions of this type of fics? Preferably Muggle Au .
