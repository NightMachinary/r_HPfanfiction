:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys! Long time scroller first time poster here :) This fic has been stuck in my head for years and I can't find it anywhere! Any help is appreciated.

Here is what I remember: - pretty sure there was more than one book? - (series?) is set post-Hogwarts era - Harry, Hermione, and more school friends live together in a house they all pitched in on. - The house has a ballroom. - Harry and Hermione are amazing (ballroom?) dancers after flatting together in (muggle London?). - Everyone thinks Ron is dead. - Eventually Hermione watched Harry's memory of seeing Ron's body in the pensive and realised it's a fake because it didn't have a (bruise? Hickey?) she has given him that day. - Turns out Ron was being held captive in some sort of apartment-prison thing. - pretty sure it's got powerful!harry - And I'm pretty sure the end of the (series?) isn't fleshed out, just a plot dump to satisfy the loose ends.

Searching for this fic has been driving me craazzzzzyyyyyyy! Please help a quarantined friend find relief.

(Also I'm hoping I posted this with proper [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] etiquette but please let me know if I made an error!)
