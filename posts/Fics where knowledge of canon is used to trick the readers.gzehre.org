I'm not really sure if subvert is the word I'm looking for. Basically a lot of fanfiction is predictable. First year is Quirrel, second year is diary/basilisk, third year is Sirius Black, fourth year is the Tournament, etc.

Even when things change early (Harry is OP, Harry is adopted by Snape, Harry is actually a dragon), these structures of canon still stay the same.

I'm looking for stories where this is used against the readers. For instance, third year Sirius escape but... for some reason he really is a Death Eater. Or second year there's something attacking students, but it's not related at all to the diary or Ginny.

â€‹

I'm basically looking for stories in which there is a surprising twist between our expectation of canon and the actual events of the fanfiction. I'm not exactly asking for a big AU in which everything changes, rather a story that plays with our expectations of the stations of canon that we are used to.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** The original Dangerverse series by whydoyouneedtoknow! It's an oldie but (imo) a Goldie. The first in the series is entirely pre hogwarts but the rest are during hogwarts years. The author enjoys subverting expectations and switching up canon while still utilizing the familiar plots (stone, book, escape, etc.) For instance, in year 1, both Lockhart and Quirrel teach DADA, and it cleverly changes up the stone plot.

I say original, because the author has written an /extensive/ number of au's to the original au, in between the installments of the main au. (for context, /just/ the original au series caps out at ~1,899,000 words, not even counting all the spin off fics. The entire Harry Potter is 1,084,170 words.)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** Do changes cause ripples that die down, or ripples that continue spreading? Some stories do one, and some the other, and both are justifiable.

If you're going to abandon the Stations of the Canon, then you need to be able to justify /why/ things don't happen the same way. If Harry is sorted somewhere other than Gryffindor, why would that change whether Lucius plants the diary on Ginny? I'm not saying it couldn't, but an author is going to have to provide some reasonably-logical chain of events to explain why that changed.

What you appear to be asking for is that a story go off in a different direction, just for the sake of being different. The thing about a "surprising" twist is that you don't see it coming, which means that any justification for /why/ things are different has to be laid down subtly. The author has to put down sufficient clues so that you can see exactly why the twist came about, but not until you think back on (or reread) earlier parts of the story. If the clues are too obvious, you'll be expecting the twist. It's a hard thing to do well.

*** You have some good points!

I guess part of the reason for this post is that some people try too hard to keep the stations of canon and it's kind of frustrating

In stories where Harry has a brother, his parents are still alive, Pettigrew is in Azkaban, etc. somehow year three is when Pettigrew escape. No matter how divergent things get, in year three someone will escape from prison

Or, no matter how much things change, in year three Lupin will always forget to take his potion !!

I guess I'm looking for a story that isn't too AU. But at the same time I'm kind of sick of being able to predict the next plot point.

And yeah you make a good point, it does seem like a difficult thing to write well

*** Like the other comment said, it's possible for stories to have multiple diverging elements.

A lot of HP fanfiction is basically taking Harry, altering something fundamental about him, and then seeing how he reacts to canon events. How does Slytherin!Harry react to the Chamber of Secrets? What does he do differently?

How does studying!Harry or evil!Harry or magicalProdigy!Harry react to the Goblet of Fire?

I love these stories. I'm not criticizing them. But they are predictable because while they do often diverge from canon elements, it has more to do with Harry's actions diverging the plot, while keeping the next stations of canon similar.

For instance in one story where Lily and James are alive and Harry has a brother, the Chamber of Secret is still opens. Third year has someone from Azkaban escaping. Fourth year has Moody being Polyjuiced, etc.

I'm wondering if there are stories that plays with our expectations a bit. A pretty simple "twist" that I see in a lot of fics is to have a different person get the Diary in year 2. Sometimes it's Luna or Gilderoy or Fred, etc. I'm looking for something like that but a bit more unique if that makes sense.

****** Was it? I haven't read it for a while since it hasn't been updated, so I'd totally believe I've forgotten stuff

** I'm working on a fic where the story pace is x2 speed and oh boy does that make waves and curveballs. 1st year 1st semester sQuirrel wins - partially body for LV but the stone gets destroyed.

He oblivates Hermiony to fuck her up and unleashes the basilisk / diary on the shcool. Cue in the 2nd semester of PS which is now basically a chamber of secretes. Then Sirius happens, in the third semester and at the end of the year for the spring semester the PoA happens but here is a twist Harry reserves his judgement and doen't believe any of them and asks them to prove to him that they are as good as they say by being useful to him.

After that we proceed with a runaway trope, syke no gold in gringotts for ya, build your own secret order hq, and then 2nd year begins with some OC content where there are 2 voldemorts running around and Lockhart is a competent conman that gets recruited by Harry's little band of misfits which is basically the maruaders 2 with Gildroy instead of James.

Then the winter semester of 2nd year starts and we get an introduction to remus as dada teacher, some stuff happens there is a big climax battle in which voldemort (ohmygodno) gets Hermione and Dumbledore killed by sacrificing himself so that his secret weapon the young TM can reenter the wizarding world as the defeater of the Dumbledore's murderer (TM just takes the credit actually, but because not everything went to LV plan, and because A D actually packs a punch, LV sacrifice is real and LV dies for good. However the only witness to that was TM so the plot thickens ).

I also hijack the horcruxes and change them into a save/load magics that just reloads the character to a previous save state when TM dies (for their confrontation Dumbledore did something to disrupt those magics when he killed LV, maybe it pocket phonix tears, I dunno).

Afterwards we enter 2nd year winter semester and we get the fifth book plot, remus retreats in disgrace to the maruaders hq inc, umbridge takes over and at the end of the semester there is a battle for the prophecy in which Harry is bait for the order (but not because he just flew there like a dumbass, but because he is kidnapped).

TM gets the prophecy and everyone in the order except for snape and NT dies. Also all old death eaters die because (gasp) Lucius betrays them all, which was actually a plot of TM, who manipulated him to do so.

Third semester begins with TM being a hero who helped killed off the last of DE at large, cue order of merlin, and a political campaign begins to elect him as HBIC, with LM as second HBIC.

Third semester starts in earnest with Umbridge fucking off back to the government as some stand in for the dead death eaters, for their influance/money/ or because she is just being a greedy bitch. The political landscape is left with mostly neutrals alive and everybody thinks that peace in the land of magic is back.

The third semester of 2nd year begins everybody is freaking out about OWLS which are not in the 5 year but earlier because Hogwarts is actually the best fucking school for magic and teaches its students so quick. Soquickomagad.

Snape gets the dada post, slughorn is back as potions teacher, minerva after an eventful year of teaching and headmastering, stops teaching and is succeeded by Amelia Bones who was fired because of the Harry Potter kidnapping committee found her a bitch who ought to take the blame.

As third year begins owls results come back right before boarding the train and congratulations guys, you failed, and are now on the run from the ministry raging to snap Ron and Harry's wands.

Ron and Harry are now best buds always having eachother backs, and when they get ambushed at King's Cross, a chase scene ensues and they too retreat to maruaderereres hq.

It's time to build that time travel machine that Harry's friend supposed AI, talking to him through his magic glasses been mentioning. End of book one, book 2: let's kill LV the first time. Turns out LV the shade was a save copy from the cup.

It's an adventure comedy.
