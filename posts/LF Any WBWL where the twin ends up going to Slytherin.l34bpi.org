So, I've read (or at least tried) my fair share of WBWL stories and regarding Hogwarts there is generally little to no change, the twin goes to Gryffindor and live the canonic adventures while Harry ends up in (from most to least used) Slytherin, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. So I would like to see something a bit more original than that, namely for the twin to be the one who ends in a new house, preferentially if it creates changes to the cannon adventures since he is in a house with a potentially whole new cycle of friends.

Alternatively I would also like to see at least one where Harry and his twin end up in the same house and are thus forced to interact and get to know each other since they will now be around the other more or less 67% of the time now.


** Don't think I have seen even a single longfic where the non-neglected twin is in the same house as the neglected one. Closest is Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Firestarter) where the Griffyndor twin is actually more slytherin than canon Harry. She maintains cordial relations with the neglected twin who in turn puts canon!Riddle to shame in terms of manipulative skills and Slytherin self-interest.

  Harry Potter's life had been hell. He'd spent ten agonizing years slaving away for his only living relatives, only managing to escape through the surprising hospitality of a strange book store owner. On his eleventh birthday, he discovers things about himself he'd thought were only fantasies, but the greatest revelation was that he had a younger sister who'd somehow saved the world.Inspired by Sarcasm and Slytherin.

** Family bonds by xXDesertRoseXx. It's a wrong BWL story where Harry is still loved and gets along with his twin but the Potters are always away trying to solve the mystery of the brothers â€˜special power' and Harry is practically raised by Snape. They both end up in the same house too.
