So they basically have their own extremist views just like the Death Eaters. Maybe they also target muggleborns because of jealousy.


** I remember reading a fanfiction in which Gellert Grindlewald is leading a Sect/Union/Community of Squibs that somehow are able to manipulate elements.\\
Harry is a squib in that fanfiction, and Argus Filch invites him to join the brotherhood :D

It was probably:

** Interesting consequence of this idea: what happens if two squibs have a magical child? Same thing as squib children of pureblood supremacists?

The problem would be that they wouldn't know if they were magical until some kind of accidental magic came about. The chances of an obscurial would be much higher.

I'm just rambling here but there's potential in the idea I think

*** Not sure, but I've definitely wondered about something similar. If a pureblood and a squib whose parents were pureblood, would the magical child of the two be considered a pureblood?

*** There were a couple fanfictions that took up the idea that 2 Squibs having a magical child would be the same as 2 muggleborn having a magical child.

Some fanfictions made the child a first generation pureblood while others thought it to be a muggleborn.

** In a world in which Obliviate exists, squibs shouldn't even know about the wizarding world. They just show up wandering down a road with no idea who they are or where they came from.

*** Werent Squibs banished or killed in HPU Canon?Sometimes the parents would take pity on the child and enable it to have a proper education, while others like Dumbledore would invite them to work hoping for whatever reason. Idk. Argus Filch does not look happy at all being surrouned by magic while he himself cant use it.

** There's also Gypsie Caravan where Harry runs away and joins a troupe of squibs and tours the world with them. You can find it on ff.net :)

*** It was a good story when I read it the first time, but coming back to it I have to wonder why 85% of all characters are gay.
