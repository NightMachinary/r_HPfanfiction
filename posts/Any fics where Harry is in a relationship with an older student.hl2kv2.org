Up to you whether it's more of a mentor thing, or an actual romantic relationship. Fine with all tags, all ratings.

*** So as not to scare off potential readers: the bashing in this story is a lot milder than most. Minor spoilers ahead:

By the end it's revealed that most of the "bashing" was actually Harry being a moody teenager and either misunderstanding or overreacting to things.

***** After several weeks of Harry being an ungodly asshole to him, and Ron and Draco aren't at all portrayed as being buddies. Ron and Hermione are painted in an unflattering light, but they're still recognizable as their canon characters and they're hardly cartoon villains. In a sense you could say that Harry himself gets the most bashing, it's just muted by him also being the point of view character

****** I don't recall what exactly Ron did, other than getting into a fist fight with Harry because he(Harry) was being a moody stressed out desperate teenager and Ron was also being a moody teenager, from there Hermione accidently(she cast a banishing spell but was too nervous/inexperienced it broke the wand on the wall) broke Harry's wand and he basically cut off all ties with them.

Then Katie also acted like a stupid teenager and Harry basically abandoned Gryffindor as a whole for a time.

As for Dumbledore? I don't remember him being evil just so controlling that Harry went out of his way to avoid him(Chamber of Secrets, Fleur,etc...), Harry also ascribed all kinds of motivations on Dumbledore that ended up just being ineptitude, ignorance and neglect instead of any evil, manipulative reasons. Dumbledore did think Harry had to die because of the scarcrux though, but he was open for alternatives.

Most of the fic Harry only trusts three people at all, Salazar's Portrait, Fleur and IIRC Sirius.

I know the fic is tropey and sometimes too dramatic, but I like the detail, some interactions, the ritualistic magic, how they characterized Fleur and Harry(most of it), how Harry solved the scarcrux problem, I didn't like that Harry was too edgy at times(I do not forgive, I do not forget) but that was basically explained by him being an actual edgy teenager, he did get better.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)
