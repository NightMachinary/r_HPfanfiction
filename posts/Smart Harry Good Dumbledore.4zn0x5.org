Have been trying to find this story don't know who it is by or when it was written. I remember one scene where Harry and Dumbledore are talking about magic and Wands and Dumbledore says how Magic isn't exact or something of that sort and describes Wands to Harry. He taps the Wand with his and it unravels to show a bunch of Runes and explains that's what's Directing the power. Dumbledore also talks about her still Studies Magic and wants to create his or branch or type of magic.
