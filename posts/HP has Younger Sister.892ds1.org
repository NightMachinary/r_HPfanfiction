I'm trying (and failing) to find a fic I read a few months ago. The central character is Harry Potter and an OC, his sister. Dumbledore found the younger sister and sent her away to the States/Canada. When her guardian dies, he takes her back to england. She falls in line with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The story spans through the Hogwarts years, and the OC falls in love with a Hufflepuff. Harry and OC do not find out they are siblings until the last two years or so. In the end of the whole story, the OC loses her magic in helping defeat Voldemort. I remember bits and pieces of the plot as a whole, but the title is completely gone from my memory!

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
