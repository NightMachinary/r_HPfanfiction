Something like: Unwell by SocksForDobby

Or The Long Road by SinisterMe

(Doesn't have to be slave fics at all, can be anything that deals with going through hell, and picking up the pieces).

Or something similar, doesn't have to be in any way exactly like them. Just a character (or characters) going through a rough time, and someone else trying to help put them back together again. Bonus if it's another slave story or slave recovery story like those, but not mandatory.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual

Anyone can be the main character, can be on ANY site, can have ANY warnings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.


** My new story, A Grim Odyssey, is about Harry trying to find himself again and trying to heal from a terrible mistake he has made, as he wanders through Britain alone. Much of it is an analogy on depression and the distance it can cast up between you and everyone you love, and how you can also heal from it again. It's completely done and I'm publishing a chapter every Saturday and Wednesday.

It's part 3 in a series, and while I would love it of course if you read the previous parts first, I also added a short summary at the beginning so everyone can pick the story up no problem if they haven't read the previous parts.

**** You're welcome! I took another look at my bookmarks and found Antithesis, an incredibly dark Different-Boy-Who-Lived AU that perhaps best fits 'going through hell' and 'picking up the pieces'. As far as I remember, it was also heavy on the angst.

Hope this helped.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
