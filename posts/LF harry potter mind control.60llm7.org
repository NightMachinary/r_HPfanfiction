  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
#+end_quote

From birth Tom Riddle has had a self insert character who has read Harry Potter stuck in his head guiding him to greatness. One of the things he develops is new mind control spells and runes, using chains of mind control middle men to keep himself clean in his dealings. The actual mind control-ness of the story is slight. It never actually shows him using it, just him developing it and later mentioning his black market network.

  Harry Potter discovers the Spell book of Desires in his fourth year at Hogwarts, which contains a vast amount of sexual spells and potions. Various pairings throughout the story. Rated M for a reason. (This is not my work originally. I just liked to story and thought it deserved to be re-posted here.)
