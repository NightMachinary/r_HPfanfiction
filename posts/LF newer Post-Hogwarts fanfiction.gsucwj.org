Trying to re-enter the Harry Potter fanfiction archive on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] after my disastrous tread through the AO3 archive for the first time. (I only found one readable fic, as per my inclinations)

Want to read something newer with more focus on world-building than romance (But romance focused is also fine, unless any Gary Stu or Mary Sue)

It can be also an OC based.

Other than post-Hogwarts, AU of all the years is also fine.


** I'm pitching my own.

Its got a steady chapter following of 50ish people prr chapter. So it's not total trash. It is written past 3/4 of the way and I expect it to be finished by end of June.

I publish every Wed and weekend religiously. And will update to 3 times a week when done.

The post war world gets to be too much for Hermione and she goes into hiding. 5 years later she tricks Draco in being her potions apprentice. World building ensues.

Its an adventure/world building/post war/romance. I add that last one on as a technicality. Its not one of those tragic fall stories where someone's magic sex part fixes the crippling ptds of someone else.

Take a look and let me know if you liked it. I think I've caught all mistakes but I don't have a beta so one or two may have slipped through.

  They need each other unfortunately. Hermione has tricked Draco under her tutelage, arrogant attitude and all. But she would be simple to think he would accept it quietly. They have both have secrets to hide, old wounds better left to fester, and a world full of mermaids, dragons, and magic to explore.

*** Thanks, I will give it a try. But as you mentioned it's Dramione. And I was kind of trying to avoid that since the disaster that is the Ao3

***** Well, AO2 is a den of either Dramione fics or slash fics of all kinds. Harry/Draco, Harry/Voldemort, Sirius/Lupin, and all other sorts. And most of them are badly written Gary stud or Mary sues. You have to search a lot for a readable hetero fic. And some of the things these people write. God! I take most of the things in the slide but they even were able to make me queasy! I don't hate the LGBTQ, but the AO3 is a shame for even them. But yeah if you search hard, there can be a good amount of fics and those are definitely of a higher standard than the ones in fft.net
