I've only recently been engrossed in the world of Harry Potter Fanfiction, and while there are some tropes that I don't agree with (Manipulative Dumbledore, Ron-Bashing, etc), I'll read the fic and withhold my judgment until I really get into the story. However, some fics go to far. Dumbledore being manipulative is one thing, but Dumbledore privately calling Hermione Granger a mud blood and planning to separate her from Harry as a friend and companion? That's a closed tab. Just not something I could see Dumbledore /ever/ thinking and plotting.

What's something that has made you close out a fic?


** Poor pacing. I recently slogged through the first few chapters of a mediocre fic when a sex scene came and went in the span of a sentence. Essentially "then they had sex, it was great. After that harry..." I noped right out of that one.

Bad writing in general is an instant tab closer for me. I'll read most anything if the moment to moment writing is fine.

*** Ha, bad writing can be so infuriating ! I tend to read rare pairings and I probably read everything that is readable for my favorite pairings. Then I'll stumble upon a fic I haven't read, and it'll be so badly written that I want to close the tab, but on the other hand, it's a new story about a pairing I like... Infuriating, really !

I have a friend named Alex. Those four letters are all her first name has; it's not short for anything. /AND YET,/ people will occasionally lengthen it into Alexis, Alexa, Alexandria, etc. Ironically, her parents named her Alex to avoid the hassle of people improperly or rudely shortening it.

*** Just out of curiosity, are there any fics you do read? If you included '46. Harry uses a time travel ritual.' and '47. Easy lycanthropy cure (see 26).', I think that might cover literally every fic in the fandom longer than 1000 words.

*** Thanks for the list. Like I said, I'm new to the HP Fanfic community, but I agree with everything you just said. I hate Ron-Bashing. That same fic with Dumbledore calling Hermione a mudblood had a time travelling Harry Potter try to separate the kid Harry Potter and Ron by thoroughly embarrassing Ron time and Ttme again. Like what the fuck, Ron is a twelve year old in this story. I was still a dumbass when I was /15,/ give the kid some slack.

Also, just read another fic where 12 year old Harry Beheaded 3 Death Eaters. I don't care who raised him. Harry is not that powerful.

Magical cores? I read one fic that suggested that Purebloods had stronger Magical cores, which is fucking stupid because that would give legitimacy to the stupid Pureblood bigots argument, when Canon has shown time and time again that it's all bullshit. Not to mention magical cores themselves and having them become depleted if the wizard uses to much magic? Fuck that! This is the Harry Potter universe. Use magic as much as you want until you become mentally or physically tired.

Slutty for dating? Even if she was sleeping with new guy every night she had right to do that. Why demeans someone for sexual preference?

Personally I feel like she was a fangirl and it's bad that she ended up with Harry because JK Rowling didn't want to leave Ron alone if Hemroine was paired with Harry. Hermoine/Ron was badly paced and utterly trashy. Seems forced, similarly Harry and Ginny paining wasn't even on horizeon except that 'forced' kiss before war.

Ginny/Harry wasn't even explored in Canon, except very rare moment of tying shoes, and kiss before going to war. And that kiss seemed so out of place. Seriously!

I'm fairly sure you're refering to the film version only here.

Harry does have a friendly relationship with Ginny before Half-Blood Prince in the books (where there is no pre-battle kiss or shoe tying). One of my favourite moments between them is in Order of the Phoenix:

#+begin_quote
  'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too. 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'

  'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?'

  'The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'

  Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate-Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors-or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful.

  'WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?'

  'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. 'I forgot-'

  Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled faces contorted in rage.

  '/Chocolate in the library/!' she screamed. 'Out-/out/-OUT!'

  And whipping her wand, she caused Harry's books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.
#+end_quote

There's also this really great [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=hglovered][essay]] that does a very good job picking up on the hints in text of Harry/Ginny pre-HBP, and explaining the attraction.

** Snape apologetics. Perhaps coldness to Harry can be excused due to James' behavior but certainly not outright bullying. Not to mention how he treated Neville. People like to say that he had to play the part of a nasty bastard to not arouse Voldie's suspicions. But remember that when Hermione was hit with a teeth lengthening jinx, he said he saw no difference in how she looked. He didn't have to go that far to maintain a charade. Just taking 20 points for fighting would be enough. Anyway, what kind of 35 year old man publicly humiliates a 14 year old girl based on her appearance in front of her bullies though he doesn't need to? Certainly not a "misunderstood hero" or whatever.

Same for Draco, though this guy is a lot more redeemable.

Hermione who is shown to be some sort of mindless rule worshipper. She very rarely brought up rules after her first year. Hell, half the times the trio broke the rules, it was her idea (setting fire to Snape? Polyjuice potion? Going along with Harry finding out about the dragons? DADA? The whole of the seventh book?...)

House-elves' enslavement is resolved in two minutes by talking to the creatures. They need wizard's magic (not canon btw) so enslavement is OK and torturing them and treating them like the Malfoys treat Dobby should be legal. No need to think about this topic anymore guys. Let's just sweep it under the rug. At least show both sides of the issue.

It worked especially well against narcissists like Hitler.

That move gave RAF a very crucial breathing space and led ultimately to its victory in the Battle of Britain.

I completely agree with you and actually just got into a debate with someone on facebook yesterday about that. Someone was saying how they "still couldn't forgive anyone who was mean to Snape throughout his life like James, Sirius, Dumbledore, and LILY".

I was like what the hell are you talking about? When was Lily ever "cruel" to Snape. Just because she didn't return his feelings for her and chose not to be his friend after he betrayed her and called her one of the worst insults in their world in front of everyone when she tried to defend him. I drives me nuts when people say it's Lily's fault Snape became a Death Eater. The end of their friendship may or may not have pushed Snape over the edge to join up but it's not Lily's responsibility to make sure Snape doesn't join a terrorist organisation, and she shouldn't be obligated to "get with him" to keep him a "good person." That kind of thinking is just so wrong to me.

Then there are people who get a hang of it quickly and slower ones, ones who reach a higher skill cap or a lower one, ones who work harder and those who don't.

3) Any form of overpowerment. I need realistic power levels. Yes Harry or the protagonist (Usually Hermione) can be powerful but I need proof as to /why/.

4) Speaking of power, I will automatically x out if there is ANYTHING in regards to Wicca included. *At all.*

As being British (and a Celt) myself, Wicca is a BANE on my existance within this fandom. No I will not 'so mote it be.' For goodness sake the UK alone has ALWAYS, throughout history, /to this very day/, been extremely pro conflict.

However I get very happily surprised if you can a) know the difference between Norman, Saxon, Brythonic and Godelic cultures within the UK, as each differ and use them as well as Latin to create something. This could be amazing! Like for example I have /never/ seen someone use Ogham in regards to warding or ancient runes. It's depressing honestly.

5) In regards to the above, Americanisms tire me out terribly, especially seeing someone say 'Candy' or 'Sidewalk'. I get knocked back into reality when I see them.

There is nothing canonical to indicate that transfiguring something doesn't change it on the molecular level, and saying that that object is filled with magic particles annoys me. And there is absolutely nothing canonically to ever indicate that Transfigurations somehow revert, and a large amount of evidence suggesting that the danger with them is that they are permanent.(Looking at you HPMOR).

Any fic indicating that Muggles are infinitely better than wizards, who are nothing more than backwards savages who deserve to have their culture destroyed to be forcibly assimilated into society, and forced to work for the government as agents just flat out enrages me. Oh, of course a single squad of British soldiers/squibs can wipe out the Wizarding World without any problem because all wizards are stupid, cant think and deserve to die.

And then the other way around. Fics arguing that wizards are some kind of Master race which can subjugate the muggle world without a fight are also terrible. (I confess I am a little more lenient towards those, as I tend to lean wizard over muggle in the who would win scenario).

In canon we see that it's possible to summon snakes and transfigure desks into pigs and tortoises and whatnot, and those are food that's just not cooked yet and still moving around. If you killed them, you would have food.

So, I think fanfic writers try to rationalize this by claiming that free transfiguration is temporary; anything and everything conjured will eventually disappear, transformed objects will revert when the magic powering the transformation fades, and only by using alchemy/chemistry/etc can you transform an object in such a way that it requires no magic to sustain it.

Which means that, if you conjure or transfigure food and try to eat it, it'll vanish or change back or whatnot when it's broken up, depriving you of sustenance.

**** I have always took Gamp's Laws as (Rowling deciding to make argibrary illogical rules so the society she made still makes sense) common sense rather than a actual ability to do it. You cannot transfigure food if you do not know how it works chemically. While it can be transfigured, the vast majority of people don't know enough to make anything edible, save perhaps salt or sugar. That is why the Geminio charm can duplicate food, because it is making an exact copy of something, down to the molecular level.

Money was also another one of those little arbitrary laws which only makes sense if you assume that goblin money has a very unique signature which is nigh impossible to duplicate, and that Muggle anti counterfeiting protections are not able to be reproduced without a deep understanding of how they work. The alternative is that anything which can be arbitrarily assigned value, such as gold, salt, paper, or diamonds, and is used as a regular currency suddenly gains some mystical property which means it cannot be transfigured.

**** Personally I think that the “can't conjure/transfigure food” thing has nothing to do with permanency of transfiguration or lack of it, and all to do with the fact that the effect falls apart for some reason (the magic of living beings overriding the magic that's changed something dead that is now becoming a part of it being one guess I have, and those spells losing form when the item in question becomes goo when it is being digested and thus no longer having the form it's been changed to to the point where the spell conceptually can no longer hold onto it being another guess) when the item in question is digested.

**** The thing is, we know of transfigurations that wizards believe have lasted hundreds of years. So if it is temporary, it's at the very least long lasting.

I think the food exception to Gamp is better explained by saying nutrition has magical properties as well as physical ones. Transfiguration can make food which is physically identical to real food, but transfiguration does not alter a thing's magical properties, only its physical ones. Therefore the "fake food" lacks the magical properties of nutrition and thus fails to effectively feed. Unless of course you have transfigured food into other food, in which the unaltered magical properties are still nutritive, which is why it is possible to transform and multiply food.

*** About the soldier squad. I doubt magic is effective against bullets to be honest. Since they concentrate huge amounts of kinetic energy on a really small space shields should break under the stress relatively fast. After all, most rifles can deplete their their magazines within 3 seconds.

Now, there's arresto momentum to slow stuff down but you would need to hit every bullet coming your way faster than the speed of sound. You could conjure or transfigure cover but you need to see the enemy in order to create cover. If they get the jump on you your best hope is disapparating as fast as you can.

Now, don't get me wrong, wizards could be very effective employing hit and run tactics or fighting a guerilla war. But in an straight on battle or full out war (with stuff like artillery, MRLS and airstrikes) I don't see wizards winning simply because they are vastly outnumbered.

**** The Impervious charm is a thing. But I would argue that Wizards are able to fight differently against Muggles than against wizards. The biggest things is that transfigurations can't be reversed by muggles, and magic cannot be dispersed. What happens when wizards apparate in, toss down Fiendfyre, and apparate out again? Sentient fire which is nigh unstoppable? If wizards begin transfiguring say polar bears, and then enchant them with the Geminio curse, then portkey them over, that could be devastating. Wizards are just more versatile. Asymmetric warfare suddenly becomes a lot more effective when magic is involved.

2. Fics where Ron and Hermione end up with someone other than each other (just my own personal preference) I don't mind Harry with anyone else or Ginny or Draco but don't mess with my R/H!

3. Fics where they get the magic wrong or make up ridiculously stupid magical spell names

4. When the fics are set in Britain but revolve around American problems like health care fees.

5. Fics where the author is obviously not British but they try to use British terminology and slang. It's awkward

6. Sex scenes where everyone is orgasming all the time and sex is repeatedly described as mind blowing

7. Alternatively, fics that have Hermione make Ron wait forever because she just isn't ready just to keep the story going.

8. Fics that have Ron be more upset over Fred's death than George

9. Too much sex that doesn't make sense, too much action with no romance or love of any kind. I like my fics to be pretty realistic (lol magic) but if it's all action and fighting and doesn't explore relationships (sexual and other) it just feels off

** Every time we have one of these threads, the list gets longer :D

*World*

- Muggles/technology being depicted as able to defeat/get around magic.

- Muggle society being depicted as significantly more “enlightened” than wizarding society.

- Wizards displaying significant interest in Muggle culture or technology.

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Depiction of wizarding society as lacking innovation/static.

- Ancient magic that is depicted as more powerful or advanced than modern magic.

- A wizarding world with a functional nobility. A defunct nobility is acceptable.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- A magical population that is too large. I feel like 30,000 wizards in Britain is the absolute maximum, but really it should be significantly less.

- A magical economy that is too large or sophisticated. Magical Britain is about the size of a small town. It shouldn't have billionaires, a stock market, or really any kind of sophisticated financial services.

- The idea that “Dark Lord” is a commonly used title, or even a magically real title, as opposed to a made-up title that originated with Voldemort.

- Casual use of the Unbreakable Vow.

- Casual use of Veritaserum.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

- Depiction of Aurors as having a command structure, procedures etc which are reminiscent of Muggle police or military.

- Helpful Goblins who perform a great many functions which would more correctly lie with the government, law firms, and accountants.

- Hogwarts teachers giving their students far too much leeway. In particular, having the teachers permit a teenage authorial avatar to continually undermine their authority.

*Magic*

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Depiction of wandless magic as equally versatile and powerful as wanded magic, capable of casting all the same spells as you can with a wand.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

- The idea that a wizard could cast powerful/advanced magic without having studied it in some form, whether that means reading up on it or experimenting with it themselves. Corollary: the idea that a wizard could have studied a piece of magic extensively but not cast it well. The most common and egregious example: Hermione who is an expert in magical theory but not so strong at actually casting magic, as opposed to a Harry who is great at casting powerful and advanced magic but doesn't really understand what he's doing.

- Magical oaths other than the Unbreakable Vow existing.

- Duels lasting a long time, with multiple injuries being incurred, rather than ending very quickly the moment one fighter gains a slight advantage over the other.

- A Veela's mere presence exerting a magical befuddling effect which they can turn on and off at will (as opposed to Veela having a befuddling effect that is connected to their voice and movements, and general extreme attractiveness).

*Harry*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that turns him into a genius.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- A Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- A Harry who tells his life story including extremely private matters to everyone he meets.

- A Harry who constantly dispenses “wisdom” to his peers, such as telling Hermione not to believe everything she sees in a book the first time he meets her. It's transparent use of Harry as authorial avatar.

- A Harry who ditches Ron and Hermione as friends.

- Overstating the level of the Dursleys' abuse.

- A Harry whose wealth is overstated. He should be comfortably well off, but any galleon count that goes into the millions should be avoided.

- Making Harry short

*Other characters*

- Any kind of bashing, especially of Dumbledore. Bashing turns characters into shallow cardboard cut-out villains who exist solely for Harry to knock down easily and thus look powerful/important/clever for doing so. But because the villain has been hollowed out, his defeat of them carries no glory. He's playing on easy mode.

- In particular, stupid/comic relief Ron, evil or incompetent Dumbledore, scheming Ginny, smothering Molly, jealous Hermione. Making Harry the only character who is capable of learning. Another common feature of bashing is rehashing the same conflict over and over, where a villain doesn't learn anything from the previous conflict and continues to make plans using their old, now disproven assumptions.

- Genius Hermione. She's clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- Any characterisation of Voldemort which makes his worldview reasonable or removes his psychopathy.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him too noble, or affable once you gain his respect.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him a one dimensional evil villain.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional connections to Hitler.

*Plot*

- Fics without a plot or plot structure.

- Any change made to the HP world which does not have corresponding changes to character motivations and actions. For example, in canon Voldemort could not penetrate Privet Drive during the summer. If your fanon makes it so that him taking Harry's blood does allow him to penetrate Privet Drive, you should also change character behaviours to match - Dumbledore would know this, and act accordingly. When an author changes the world but keeps Dumbledore's actions the same, and then criticises him in the story for those unsuitable actions, what the author is really doing is having the characters criticise their own poor writing.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic. Authors always underestimate the extent of Harry's knowledge. Just because we're not shown it doesn't mean he's not learning it.

- Romantic partners who do not have their own lives, with their own circle of friends, their own dreams and ambitions which may clash with their partner's plans, their own opinions and beliefs which differ in some areas from those of their partner.

- Naive sex god eunuch Harry. That is, having female characters be attracted to Harry precisely because he's so insecure and freaks out at anything sexual. “You behave completely asexually, which is exactly why I want to have sex with you!” said no woman ever.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose. Inconsistency in the abilities that characters possess, especially their level of duelling ability or the use of any special talents. This inconsistency is more often than not used to force the plot in a direction which it would not naturally go, given those abilities.

- Rehash of the canon plotlines with no significant changes. Especially where the divergent elements of the fic mean that events should logically diverge, yet the fic finds ways to force the original canon storyline.

- Depiction of magical warfare that ignores the high mobility and stealth capabilities of wizards, as well as the relative lack of need for natural resources or land. We should be seeing skirmishes for strategic objectives, not significant pitched battles.

- As above, time travel/dimension travel stories where the travelling character very quickly ends up telling their life story to people they barely know.

- Time-travel/dimension-travel stories in which there is more than one travelling character, or the character(s) are able to move back and forth between times/dimensions.

*Writing*

- Spelling mistakes and typos (more than 1/chapter).

- Grammatical errors.

- Run-on sentences.

- Purple prose.

- Self-insert.

- Walls of text.

- Incorrect dialogue formatting.

- Author notes in the middle of the text.

- Breaking the 4th wall in the text.

- Preachy authorial mouthpiece characters.

- Juvenile humour.

I feel like this can apply, given that wizarding Britain was in a state of war or post-war for most of the 20th century. Social progress is never achieved in times or war. Quite the contrary, actually. Civilizations revert into basic belief systems and traditional structures once they're faced with mortal peril. Its not weird that magical Britain would revert to stances and viewpoints as old as the 19th century to cope with Grindelwald and double-time Voldemort.

The thing is, every highly talented wizard in canon is already showcasing creativity and innovation with magic in their school years. Dumbledore was said to do things with magic no one had ever seen before, Snape was inventing spells and changing potions' recipes, the Marauders made the Marauder's map. The most creativity Hermione ever showed was the DA coins, which applied an already-existing spell in its intended and normal manner, and which was in any case directly inspired by Voldemort's innovation in the form of the Dark Mark.

On top of that, I'm not really sure how much wizards really progress after Hogwarts, which seems to cover the vast majority of magic in its curriculum. There may be odds and ends they did not cover, plus obscure areas of magic Hogwarts doesn't teach, but the foundation of their magical knowledge seems to be pretty much established by the time they are 18.

I'm not saying Hermione is just fixed for this path - no way around it. I'm just saying that I wouldn't judge it too harshly if an author decides that she learns to be creative and goes along that path.

To the progress after Hogwarts, I always assume that its like going into higher education. There are the "Grand Tours" to check out magic around the globe, spell-creation, experimentation,... Basically, after Hogwarts is the time when someone either goes to work with the knowledge they have, or they seek a focus on one or more disciplines of magic.

This is why fics have summaries.

Demanding that a fic elaborate the central plot within a few paragraphs is tantamount to demanding that all fanfics be badly written.

****** Its simply stating the fact that Fanfiction (if read on a device capable of more than reading - the PC, a tablet, a phone,...) is in constant competition for attention with everything else that is going on on the device its read on, starting from notifications and ending with the reader's knowledge that any other entertainment media is one or two clicks away, even if its just another fanfic. Therefore a fanfic has only so much time to captivate the audience. That time is significantly lower than in analog media, such as books.

"tell the point" was probably not the right wording for this. Its more about a hook; about captivating an audience. If you can achieve that within a few paragraphs, you're golden. After that you loose viewers quickly - as in, at an exponential rate.

Its not only the attention span shrinking, though. Its also the fact that "digital natives" generally don't read from top to bottom, but first conduct a scan of a page before they start reading, in order to judge the worth of whats before them. If they only see uninteresting things, which in our case would probably be "You see, Harry was a wizard" introduction stuff, the rate of tabs closed increase even further.

I'll look if I can find the study for it in my notes.

I don't think that there is anything wrong with a feminine man, but since it's such an often recurring trend in slash fanfiction, it is obviously just a lack of understanding of what a gay relationship is, or the author's anime-fueled love of pretty boys.

** The story being written in first person, unless it was something specifically recommended as being awesome.

Inconsistent spelling w/ spells, names, places, etc. I can understand language barriers, or if a name is usually spelled differently as a regional variant, or the infamous rennervate/enervate, whatever. Just be consistent with whatever you choose. I've read stories where Lily's name was spelled two different ways repeatedly within the same chapter. That's not bad spelling, it's nonexistent editing.

Snape or Draco magically becoming good people. Give them a damn path. Make them work for it. Even if it's in the background, or the story picks up after and alludes to their journey to redemption. They're /not/ good people, one is more easily redeemed than the other, but it's not impossible to write a bad character slowly changing their ways.

Rape for 'no reason'. I have read a few stories where it was used well, unfortunately that gets into the muddy waters of 'making light of rape for entertainment.' Yet we'll read character death for plot just fine. Basically it has to be damn good and actually be traumatic, not something forgotten two chapters later or defended as being justified.

I'm fine with Dumbledore bashing // manipulative Dumbledore (because he's fishy AF), but if he's a caricature, or downright evil in modern times, that's a no go unless the entire thing is already ridiculous.

If the story reveals itself to be a harem, I'm out of there.

Marriage contracts to multiple people (usually in Harry's favor, usually results in harem fic). I'm fine with marriage contracts in general, as long as they're still portrayed with some kind of negative reaction, whether it's 'outsiders' or the individuals themselves.

Marriage law affecting minors. I've read them, but lower end of the age pool was when I /was/ in lower end of the age pool and didn't really see yet the squick. Of age (17+) or nothing. I don't care about age gap, just make it legal ffs. The more negative the reaction, the more fun it is to read.

Magically falling head over heels in love after two chapters. Yeah no. Even if you're a hormonal teenager, shit doesn't go down like that. You're not planning how to propose at the age of 16

Mpreg, where the character is biologically and mentally a man, and there's some weird magic involved to make it happen, without their consent of knowledge of it being possible. I'm /okay/ with it if it's a long, well developed slash fic that I'm enjoying, and it's actually explained magically. Suddenly happening after a one night stand with no explanation except 'lol magic and you're gay' isn't gonna work. I'm highly unlikely to even open a story that mentions Mpreg unless it's directly recommended.

Original characters that quite clearly don't belong. Either poor characterization, clearly a self insert, otherwise just doesn't seem to fit properly. Especially as a primary character.

I'm okay with a lot of other things- a magical animagus is silly, but whatever, if I'm reading a story that has that, it either has a reason or is already off its rocker. I've got at least one on my favs list that has a demiguise. Magical cores? Eh, just defend it well and don't make it mean that they're automagically gonna be better/worse at everything.

- Gullible harry who shows no effect of abusive childhood. It's Unnatural. You either become street smart, learn survival instincts, or you show psychological problems. You just don't leave up and be a normal kid after that much abusive treatment.

- Overly Caring Dumbledore, and paragon of Light/Good Weasely family. World is never black and white, and you never associate with anyone without motives. Dumbledore had all the official International titles along with influence on national channels, including monopoly over education (and boarding of kids) of kids. leadership of local wizengamot. Nobody ever gets top on food chain without being a nasty, cunning and ambitious streak.

- Canon Sue - saving everyone: Problem in school? Dark Lord roaming in school halls, evading a powerful headmaster, whole ministry and everyone? Harry Potter saves the day. Problem with Baislisk? Harrys aves the day. Innocent rotting in Azkban while his leader left him to rot? No worries, leader will finally send Harry Potter to time travel back and save an innocent man. Fighting countless dementors at age 13? Well he is a prophecy child, he will manage. (Still won't get official clearance from authority though). etc etc etc.

- Fighting greatest dark lord with no experience, and killing him with 'Expelliarmus', or sickening 'love'. JK Rowling was probably 'high' when she wrote that last scene of fight. I am not reading fic to see people rehashing same stupidity from canon in fanfics.

- If your fic offers no change in Canon setting for initial phase of his life, don't waste time on writing. Write from the year change appears. If I have to read same trian scene, same sorting, same 'rush' to stone and then same basilisk fight, don't bother. I close that tab.

Canon is, fan-fiction is not. It's not wrong to see Canon events in different light though. It's fantasy; I appreciate that. But the wide space between good and bad seemed 'cute' till I was kid and appreciated every 'bad guy' getting beat on every corner.

Over-dramatic titles such as "Dark Lord", "Death Eaters", "Light", "Savior" are too simplistic. I know it is fantasy and in fantasy world 'evil' is always stupid and does stupid stuff and loses every thing.

But fanfiction doesn't have to follow same formula. In a real world if Speaker of Parliament of my country will allow two 13 year old kid to carry AK-47 around, help a prisoner escape and let a torturer run amock in school where heir of noble families are learning then his ass will be in Jail sooner than he can allow a 14 year old to run a group in school that's preparing for war.

I don't want to believe that Dumbledore is stupid for doing stuff he did. He was far powerful, more accomplished than anyone in history and too high up the food chain to be a senile old fool. Only the people who are cunning, ambitious, and ruthless strategists with keen sense of game with ability to keep pawns in check are the one who become as successful as him.

Still I won't bother if anyone wants to keep living in fantasy war between good and bad. I prefer realistic fiction where moral philosophy is not as childish as canon.

- harry not forgiving and/or empathising with snape, snape not being a significant part of anti-DE/voldemort efforts

- snape supporting the death eaters or death eater/anti-muggleborn ideology, or any obviously evil act (torture, murder, rape etc.)

- any framing of snape's actions re: lily as revenge, and not guilt for being complicit in her death, and atoning by renouncing the DEs, pureblood ideology and actively fighting against it

Honestly, I believe Snape would've stayed with the Death Eaters had he not made a deal with Dumbledore for her life and then Voldemort killed her. He was in their group and only left because Voldemort threatened Lily's life. Sure he might have reformed in later years but he still only left because Lily was threatened.

I agree on the downplaying or excusing. Especially when it's 'he gave back as good as he got', it's one person against four.

Why wouldn't they treat him like an equal? He was their friend, even if he wasn't a magically powerful equal (Though I don't remember about anything saying he wasn't powerful like his friends) they would still treat him like an equal most likely or very close to one. They did trust him enough to have him be the secret keeper.

Did he ever smile in canon? Admittedly I can see him smiling I guess, but it's not gonna happen that often and most likely not in Harry's presence.

this is kind of like saying snape would still be a DE if he didn't stop being a DE. harry would be a pureblood supremacist if he was raised a pureblood supremacist. like you said, he reformed and actively opposed them. lily being in danger is also an inevitability, just by virtue of her being on the other side of the war. you can create a lot of scenarios to catalyse his renegade.

they wouldn't treat him like an equal because they're patronising dicks, wormtail openly hero-worshipped them, and that's the entire point of his arc: that no one would expect a great betrayal from someone as sycophantic and pathetic-seeming as him. jkr has also directly stated how they thought of him:

#+begin_quote
  Remus, always the underdog's friend, was kind to short and rather slow Peter Pettigrew, a fellow Gryffindor, whom James and Sirius might not have thought worthy of their attention without Remus's persuasion.

  He was unhinged. Yes, he laughed. He knew what he'd lost. It was a humorless laugh. Pettigrew, who they, *in a slightly patronizing way, James and Sirius at least, who they allowed to hang round with them*, it turned out that he was a better wizard than they knew. Turned out he was better at hiding secrets than they knew.

plus how we see them treat him in SWM. also, remus, minerva and sirius all state explicitly that he wasn't talented, and that switching him to the secret keeper was exactly because no one would expect him

(And anyway after the war he might not have forgiven him immediately.) Also he forgave Snape after he died fighting in a war. It's much less likely for him to do it while he is still in the order and bullying him in class.

I have less sympathy for someone who only left the other side (after joining them and participating in what they did) just because Lily was targeted. He would have been fine if anyone else died considering he gave a prophecy which would have led to /someone/ dying. Yes Harry would have been a blood supremacist if he was raised as one, that doesn't excuse anything he would do as one.

Well I hadn't seen what JK said before. Most stories with Peter playing prominently are Marauders era (time travel or otherwise) and have Peter be malicious and vile even if he was a 15 year old kid who hadn't joined the Death Eaters at all.

I don't know what SWM is.

They still trusted Peter enough to make him secret keeper. If they wanted someone who no one would expect they'd make secret keeper they'd choose Pomfrey or a Prof instead of one of their close friends.
