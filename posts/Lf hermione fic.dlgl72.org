:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while ago where a lot of people died in the war and Harry was on his own.

One day a man gives him this girl like she's a slave.

This girl turns out to be Hermione, who got kidnapped and obliviated after she was crying over Ron's dead body.

That's as far as a I got pretty much.

This might be the fourth time I've posted this if the others worked, if so, I apologize.
