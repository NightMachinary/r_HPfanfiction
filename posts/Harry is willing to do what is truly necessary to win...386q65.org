Hey guys, I am looking for a story that has Harry willing to do what is truly necessary to win. Be it in the war with Voldemort, or against a new enemy. I want a Harry who is the leader of one side and has to make tough...impossible...choices. I would prefer it to be 60k plus, and to be complete.. Thank you in advance


** the fic that immediately came to my mind was [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets]] by Vorabiza. Warning though, this story is slash. Otherwise it is definitely over 60k and complete. It's basically an alternative for Deathly Hollows and starts post-HBP. It features Harry taking charge and making some hard choices and compromises, having to deal with everything from a baby to the minister of magic, resorting to blackmail and killing curses, and keeping secrets from just about everyone in order to win the war and kill Voldemort. He uses both his Gryffindor and Slytherin sides and eventually does lead the light side and the Order as well.

This is what I'm reading now. It turns out to be pretty good and like what you want.

*** Is the bashing really bad? I don't mind a bit but I hate when it gets severe. Especially when they make things up just to be angry about.
