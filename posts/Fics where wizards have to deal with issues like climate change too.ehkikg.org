** Theres a Harry Potter story called Avatar, in which this is the entire premise. Dont remember the author, but it's a crossover with the movie Avatar (alien one, not elemental). It was recently updated.

*** I loved the human/earth background of Avatar, with the somewhat realistic interstellar travel and room temperature superconductor unobtanium. I'd love to see how magic could tie into it.

**** The author managed to explain and connect to the world in a very believable and interesting way, he explains well how magic exists, what it is, and how it works in a world practically devoid of all natural life.

#+begin_quote
  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
