The bare requirements are that it starts at the latest in third year and its 60k plus words.


** Plenty of Harry/Daphne stories would fit your criteria. A Harry/Daphne/Tracey story doesn't ring any bells for me though.

** */Technically/* linkffn(Witches of Westfield) would count.

But to be quite honest, the fic is complete and utter shite. Harry is so Noble^{^{TM}} that it wants to make you puke. The girls are just awful - Every. Single. One. The thoughts in cursive are cringeworthy as fuck. Harry gets caught in the most mental-gymnastics bullshittery marriage contracts you can think of. Hermione is the plainest, dullest character in this ever. Daphne is a bitch. Luna gets her fanon-cap of quirky sexual deviant slapped on. Tracy is also a bitch, but with tragic backstory.

Its just amazingly awful. Absolutely horrible. I feel disgusted that I spent hours to read a double-digit amount of chapters of this. And /EDIT/ now that I wrote this little summary of awfulness I don't even know why I recommend this to you in the first place.
