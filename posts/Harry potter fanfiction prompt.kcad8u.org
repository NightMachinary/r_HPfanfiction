Hiii, so like i have little talent in writing but i really want to see this fanfiction idea in action.

So this is a pretty long term project but I've seen sooo many harry potter rewrites, where Harry is in slytherin and like thr actually awesome but like i would love love love to see harry in hufflepuff. Like a long term fanfiction project where Harry is in hufflepuff and extra points if ron and Hermione is with him in hufflepuff too but even if they are not i would like them to still be friends. Absolutely no bashing.

It would be super fun if you could make draco be Harry's slytherin buddy.

I would also like if you could make harry maybe acknowledge all the trauma he has gone through with the drusleys cus that shit messed up.

So yea ahahha i am really really craving this so if someone could please write this i would be so so incredibly happy. I don't mind beta reading, so im more than happy to help any way i can and i would most definitely prefer this fic to be on Ao3.

Thank you so much
