:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry and Hermione is about to go back in time to save Sirius during the events of PoA. A dementor out of nowhere interferes and they mess up and travel to 1973. They join the Marauders, and Poppy Pomfrey becomes their guardian in this time (and becomes "Aunt Poppy"). They participate in various Marauder shenanigans while Harry befriends Severus in Potions, and stay in this time for years. I remember 2 things in particular:

- Lily asking Harry out (with him being repulsed by the idea and fleeing the scene)
- Stealth-Snarry endgame -- which I didn't like at all, but was easy to ignore since it only really showed up in the last chapter (I think there's a hint earlier about Amortentia smells, but it was subtle enough to be missed by me until I read the last chapter). I did like the friendship between the two, but going beyond that felt just wrong to me.

Aside from that, the fic was basically just fluff.

This was the first Marauder-era fic I ever read, and I was curious of how good I'd think the fic was in hindsight after having read a lot of other fics since (I read this in 2017). I remember loving it back then, but that might probably mostly have been because I hadn't read a Marauder-era fic beforehand.

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU
