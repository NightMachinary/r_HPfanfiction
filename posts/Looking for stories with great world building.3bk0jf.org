I just finished reading Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived and after spending some time in Durmstrang, I realized how bored I was of the traditional setting, all the same characters and plot that's 90% canon anyway. I want novelty. I want to see the author putting effort in that stuff, not just using the tools. It could be another magical school, society, detailed magical system, anything of the sort that makes you impressed by all the thought and work behind it.

HP and The Boy Who Lived not only introduces us to another school, it also builds on the magic, something I just love to find. And brilliant!Harry that doesn't make you want to punch him? Amazing.

Off the top of my head, I know Alexandra Quick - well written, but Charmbridge is not very convincing to me, and Saving Connor - I really liked the ideas, but it's a rather boring read.


** linkffn(The Serpent and The Crown by The Green Pumpkin)

However, it looks abandoned. Which sucks, because what little there is is every interesting.

** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent) is set in an AU where Salazar Slytherin returned and killed Godric Gryffindor, and has been the wizarding Britain's immortal ruler ever since, shaping it to his will. The characters --- though changed by their circumstances --- remain very recognizable, with everybody having to be a little more cunning and ambitious.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?

** linkffn(Wastelands of Time) has absolutely /incredible/ worldbuilding - multiple cultures, histories, and thousands of years. An incredibly entertaining read. Puts Rowling to shame. (It's a trilogy, too!)

linkffn(Sword of the Hero) Same author as the previous one. Without giving away too much, I'll say it's... /multi/world building. Again, this is another must-read classic of the HP fanfiction universe.

** I don't know if you're interested in non-magic AUs, and Diane Castle is a little bit heavy on "girl power!", but [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a very interesting reimagining, where "Harworts" is a school for training spies, assassins, handlers, analysts, etc. for Britain's tumultuous intelligence community, where nobility like "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants" send their children, but some common children --- like Hermione --- can get an invitation if they do something exceedingly clever and vicious at a young age, and where James Bond style superscience takes place of magic.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (story also has [[http://hpmor.com][its own site]]) has a far more detailed magic system than canon (with extra focus on mind-affecting magics), new events and trends in magical history that tie into both societal attitudes and a revamped artifact system, and all these are plot-relevant rather than just being described in classes. Naturally, this turns the canon plot on its ear.

Some people do want to punch early-HPMOR!Harry, but rest assured that the story forces sense into him. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but definitely worth reading the first 10 chapters to see if you like it.
