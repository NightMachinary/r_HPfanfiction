Looking for good long fics about Draco(or where he is a major character) that don't involve romance with Hermione or Harry, with more character development, frienship, etc.


** It's incomplete but being updated. Draco flees the wizarding world after being prohibited from using magic for five years after the war. Linkffn(6432055)

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I guess the Draco Dormiens trilogy kinda applies - there's a Harry/Draco/Hermione triangle, but the main focus is H/D friendship. And there's all the baggage of Cassandra Claire, but hey, in spite of all of that, I enjoyed those fics.

*** I also really liked these! I haven't read them in many years, so I don't know how they hold up, but they were well done (albeit partially plagiarized) imo.
