I've exhausted a lot of the fics in these particular areas, but if you could recommend any worth reading hopefully I'll find something new. ((If possible, preferably over 100,000ish words and no SS/HG))

Specifically looking for:

- Hermione Granger/ Sirius Black

- Hermione Granger time travel (to Marauder Era)

- Marauder Era anything

- Dramione (of any variety, but preferably with a bit of angst)

Thank you so much in advance :)))


** Sorry to self-promote, but I'm writing a Hermione/Sirius time travel fic. It's a WIP at around 88k at the moment. linkffn(12055716)

  When the battle is all but lost, a chance collision of two powerful magicks sends Hermione to a time where war is brewing and light is often indistinguishable from dark. The Strands of Time will be rewoven, and the victor is anyone's guess. "Who knew that when the Killing Curse met the Sands of Time, this would happen?"

** I'm sorry your post got downvoted so much, but this sub hates Draco Malfoy and Dramione especially.

For Hermione/Sirius Black during Marauder Era, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]], linkffn(8581093), is pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717;10871795), are my preferred Hermione time travels to the Marauder Era.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is my favorite fic set in the Marauder Era and features a refreshing Harry/Bellatrix story.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Tired of Draco's arrogant claims that he can 'get any girl he wants', Daphne proposes a challenge to knock him down a peg or two. However when Draco unexpectedly accepts, the stakes are raised and neither Slytherin wants to lose. Elsewhere, Hermione has her own point to prove, but when she finds her path crossing with Draco's, will either of them succeed? 4th Year A/U *COMPLETE*

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

Post Hogwarts, Draco and Hermione run into each other at Oxford. Sentimental, believable, and just all around a lovely story.
