So [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/7/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is definitely a very good quality fic. Whilst it is a solid parody of the Harry Potter canon, there are also plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to fanon, and not having a solid knowledge of the latter will not impede your enjoyment of the work. This author knows what they're doing.

I'll say now that it's not up there amongst my favourites, but I don't think that's a reflection on the quality of the fic, and I'll explain more below.

​

*The Premise*

The story premise itself is actually quite a reasonable one, which I could easily see explored further in a less silly fic. It goes like this:

Harry Potter's consciousness is that of Voldemort, since Harry has been a horcrux since the age of 1. I think it's implied that the two personalities have somewhat merged, but we are mostly following the first-person narrative of an uncontested Voldemort living in Harry's body. Since we know that the diary horcrux was strong enough to override the consciousness of Ginny Weasley without even being implanted in her, and that the Nagini horcrux seems to have total control of what we now know to be a Maledictus and not just a simple snake, there's definitely some canon precedence which makes the idea of a HarryMort quite plausible.

The fic is essentially watching Harry grow up with the Dursleys and go through his life at Hogwarts as though he had secretly been Voldemort all along, granted a second chance to get his long-coveted position as DADA teacher at Hogwarts, rather than ruling over all of wizarding Britain. This version of HarryMort is a very believable psychopath, if a humorous one. If I'm honest, he most reminds me of the Harry in [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Methods of Rationality]] - they both even use extension charms on their trunks - but perhaps with more manipulation and less... well, rationality.

​

*The Writing*

Overall writing quality was top notch. It was clearly reviewed with a fine-toothed comb before publishing, and it is a story very wittily told. The author's strength is in the writing of her dialogue. Harry's internal monologues provide context and the truth behind Harry's many lies, but most of the heavy lifting of conveying the events of the story is told through quirky conversations between the characters, usually after the fact. There is little in the way of descriptive scenarios or exposition, making it a rather fast-paced story. It has to be -- it has 7 books to get through.

​

*The Humour*

I'd call the comedy style surrealist or absurdist, in the way that it's designed to be illogical to be point of ridiculousness. This mostly comes through in HarryMort's thought processes and dialog. I believe the author at one point stated that HarryMort tends to immediately accept the worldview of anyone he is currently speaking with. For example, he believes completely that Lockhart is every bit as amazing as he says he is, and passes off his demonstrable incompetence as an especially clever ploy to catch people off guard. HarryMort in turn is an extremely manipulative speaker, using guilt and absurd accusations to convince someone else to do or think something he wants them to.

I think the humour in this fic targets a certain type, which I would likely have fallen into when I was a bit younger, but it doesn't tickle me as much as it might have once. I'd advise potential readers to read through the first chapter. If you like the sense of humour in the story, you'll have a blast all the way through. It's probably even a good choice for dramatic readings with your friends.

If you don't like the humour, there's probably no point sticking around. The format, style and depth of the story remain the same throughout, and as the story does not significantly deviate from canon, the humour alone will make or break your experience with this fic.

​

*Characterisation*

Whilst Seventh Horcrux doesn't really keep anyone in character, that's clearly by design in this instance, so I won't be making any particular judgments around character accuracy. This story, like many comedy fics, takes a known aspect of a character and dials it up to eleven. For HarryMort, it is the cartoonishly evil arrogance and self-assurance. Ron gets to be the movie-version of himself, but with even less dignity or intelligence. If you're averse to Ron bashing, this fic may not be for you. Luna's insightful personality is now able to break the fourth wall, in a manner of speaking. Draco is in actual leather pants, at least briefly. Lucius Malfoy exists to brush his hair. Ginny is obsessed with Harry to the point of being frequently compared to Bellatrix. Hermione is probably the closest to her canonical self, but with her intelligence a little dialed down and a much-increased tolerance for being treated like garbage by her best friends.

One reason I was not wholeheartedly on the train for this fic is an empathy problem. As we know, our protagonist is entirely without remorse or empathy. This is not a problem in itself, but when a sense of humour surrounds a cartoonishly evil overlord child, I sort of expect other characters to get wise to the absurdity of the central character, logically discredit them and stop taking them seriously. What occurs instead in the vast majority of cases is that HarryMort wins, not only getting away with treating Ron and Hermione with blatant condescension and manipulation, but also making them believe every awful thing he says about them. Even though it's an absurdist fic, the manipulation was so spot on to the techniques real narcissists use that I found myself feeling more sorry for the characters on the receiving end than I felt amused by the banter. It's a bit of a downer when your main character is constantly making everyone around them feel terrible.

Internal consistency for these characters is largely very good, with one exception which I will place under a spoiler tag for those who haven't read it yet.

[ Given how HarryMort did seem to be at least 90% Voldemort, it seemed wildly out of character for him to elect to destroy his own Diary horcrux in this universe too. I understood Quirrell getting murdered by HarryMort, since the author wrote that scene so that HarryMort was unaware that Voldemort was inhabiting Quirrel's body, but he definitely knew what the diary horcrux was, and this is the only horcrux he destroys on purpose. Later in the fic he goes on his horcrux hunt in order to collect and preserve the remaining horcruxes, not destroy them. ]

​

*Final thoughts*

Whilst I can absolutely see why this fic gets recommended here as often as it does, it wasn't one that really clicked for me. You know how sometimes you might be able to see how a person is objectively beautiful, but feel absolutely no pull towards them yourself? Seventh Horcrux is one of those fics to me. I wouldn't ever caution anyone else against reading it, and might even recommend it to others myself, but it didn't leave a strong impression on me. Having said that, I'd encourage you all to give it a shot and have your own take on it, or comment below and tell me how you found it.

*Edit: Grammar


** One of the things I don't see often mentioned is the satisfying ending, although it's almost given as a throwaway. There's a sign that HarryMort has grown as a person. When he looks into the Mirror of Erised and sees only himself. He has become entirely content with life as it is.

*** Oh wow! I didn't mention the ending because I just took it to mean that Harrymort has finally achieved all his goals and is now perfectly happy. He's assured his immortality, made himself the dominant horcrux, managed to get a relic of Gryffindor for his last one anyway, got the philosopher's stone for extra insurance, and of course is at last the DADA teacher. I did love how it sort of pointed out that in canon it was easier for Voldemort to take over the wizarding government that it was to score the teaching job he wanted.

** This is honestly one of my all time favorite fics, simply because the characterization is so strong and consistent.

Yes, the initial premise is crack, but it is rock-steady in its execution (Very similar to A Black Comedy, in that respect.)

As I said in another comment- the plot is fine, but it's not some complex masterpiece... and that's /fine/.

Character-based comedy thrives on taking characters executed very well, and putting them in different situations.

Reading Author Notes, you can see that she thought a lot about how these twisted versions of canon characters "work. "

For example, Ron isn't nearly as resentful of Harrymort because Harry obviously loves fame (and does tons of amazing things)- canon Ron was more resentful of the fact that Harry had amazing fame and adventures and was ungrateful about it.

*** Yes, the consistency of its quality and internal characterisation was a huge strength of this work. And I agree that plot complexity was not a necessary ingredient to make this story work. It's an excellent example of a somewhat crack-y comedy.

I did read the author notes as well, and whilst I think Ron's lack of jealousy works within the internal narrative of this story, I don't think it can be applied as an accurate comparison of the canonical Ron, who would never have offered his friendship or loyalty to HarryMort to begin with.

I did particularly enjoy the comment where she compares her version of HarryMort to the canonical young Tom Riddle in the orphanage, and I have to give her credit - they lined up extremely well.

** Harrymort becomes progressively less evil as the story goes on. At beginning, he had no problem using Ron as the bait, but in the end, he uses himself as the bait so Ron could snatch Nagini.

Ron also grows. He started out by offering himself as a minion to Harrymort, and end up playing the werewolf politics. He neither has any jealous fits, nor does he show much insecurities.

Hermione is pretty much her canon self, and Harrymort‘s inner thoughts about her CANON DEEDS are a highlight of this fic. Another funny thing here is that Harrymort doesn't treat her as a minion, but as an apprentice and a successor (so he could retire and teach DADA forever).

Ginny is obviously a little messed up by the Diary. On the other hand, she picks up its Parseltongue and Legilimency powers. To her credit, she never uses magical compulsions to win over Harrymort, and finally succeeds in the end.

**** I did wonder about this a bit. Honestly I don't see much of Harry in the mix though. in the first two books he murders Quirrell and Lockhart (though the later was sort of accidental) and has no qualms having Hagrid thrown into Azkaban where he remains for several years before Voldemort breaks him out again. He has to be forced by Hermione into saving Ron in the third book. Oh, and he also murders MoodyCrouch and a whole bunch of Death Eaters. Ron and Hermione make a comment at some point about how Harry says all these horrible things but never actually does evil things, but I put that down to they genuinely don't know what he gets up to. he frequently does quick calculations to see how fast he can kill someone when he becomes worried that they've figured him out, and I don't think that changes throughout the series.

By the end, I got the impression that he had simply managed to secure his position and remove any competition for being the dominant Voldemort, thus eliminating his chances of being discovered as the Dark Lord. He's content, not because he has grown and mellowed as a person, but because he achieved everything he had ever wanted

#+end_quote

I have to disagree on this one. He doesn't actually offer himself as a minion. He genuinely thinks he's HarryMort's best friend. His lack of jealousy kind speaks to the lack of intelligence he's portrayed with in this story. He doesn't get jealous because it never occurs to him that he's on the same level as HarryMort. I enjoyed the Werewolf activism end to his arc, but it seemed like more of a funny follow on from Ron's being seen as a werewolf by everyone else for so long because HarryMort kept saying he was.

On this point I agree entirely. Hermione could genuinely have used some checks and balances for some of her actions throughout the series, and though this is definitely not the method I would have chosen to do it, it did highlight some very intelligent points about how dodgy some of her choices are.

​

Lastly, I remember Ginny's Parseltongue, but not her legilimency. When did that pop up?

** Nice review!

I thought the Diary thing was mostly because HarryMort didn't like the idea of more of him running around, or the fact that he'd have to potentially share any of his spotlight. He /did/ order the DiaryMort to "go back, young man," and when he refused, Harry!Mort called destroying the Horcrux a necessary evil.

***** I don't know that that's true. Voldemort entrusted two of his horcruxes to his most trusted Death Eaters before his fall - Lucius and Bellatrix. Both were expected to protect these relics, but without knowing what they truly were. Lucius acted independently when he gave the diary to Ginny, partially because he believed his former master was gone forever and therefore wouldn't miss it, partially because he was under ministry scrutiny for possession of Dark Objects at the time, and partially so that he could mess with the family of the man pressing the charges against him. Voldemort would have absolutely lost his sh*t when he was brought back and learned what had happened to the diary. Every one of them was keeping his life force afloat - I can't think of any canonical reason why he would have valued one of them above or below the others.

******* So I just looked into this further and I think you have a point. Harry and Dumbledore discuss this in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  [Harry:] ‘But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it [the diary] into Hogwarts?'

  [Professor Dumbledore:] ‘Yes he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort's say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen, because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: by planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur, have me thrown out of Hogwarts and get rid of a highly incriminating object in one stroke. [...]'
#+end_quote

So looks like you're correct that he seemed to be far more willing to risk the diary than his other horcruxes.

** Seventh Horcrux is enjoyable crack, but like most crack fics it's trading on a single joke for an entire novel-length story. It's better written than most crack, so we do at least get some distinct "sub-jokes" like the ongoing joke about Hermione being more evil than Voldemort, but ultimately I think the core joke wears thin.

Some time around sixth year the author seems to try to take the fic more seriously, coming up with reasons why Harrymort is the way he is (all that Imperius Curse nonsense) but it's a house built on foundations of sand, given that all the characterisation and worldbuilding up to that point has been completely absurd in nature (as is the nature of crack).

It would be interesting to see the core concept of the fic (Voldemort!Harry, not just a Harry who has inherited Voldemort's knowledge) done seriously. As far as I'm aware, there's only one other example and even then it's Harry posing as Voldemort rather than genuinely believing himself to be Voldemort (Curse of Fate by Mistress Nika). Plus it's a vampire slash fest.

It's almost more like a TV comedy. If you have a bunch of characters the audience understands, then the plot is more about seeing how the characters react to it and each other.

The plot and charactiersation are consistently absurd, yes. Stuff like Voldemort starting the Death Eaters because he got drunk - this is not intended to be a serious attempt at characterising Voldemort. He is a cartoon. There is humour to be had in it for sure, but it's not a particularly clever type of humour, and so it grows old fast.
