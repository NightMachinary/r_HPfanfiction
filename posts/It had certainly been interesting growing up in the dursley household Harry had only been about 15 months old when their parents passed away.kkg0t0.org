It had certainly been interestin growing up in the dursley household. Harry had been 15 months old When their parents had died fighting, Olivia had only been a few weeks in the nursery before the incident.

In another life, Harry was bundled under the stairs fed 3 square meals a day And ignored mostly. But in this one he was shoved into the same Room as Dudley while Olivia got the 2nd Room to herself the two boys were just a few months away from Outgrowing their cribs after all. And a girl needed a room to herself Even at that age if you asked petunia. Who always wanted a daughter but after a difficult birth with Dudley was informed It was unlikely she could ever have another child.

So On that cold November morning the dursley household went from a single child family to 3 boisterous babies.

The Dursleys still despised magic With the same zealotry That the concept of anything freakish instinctively provoked.

But the punishments for anything unexplained was usually a bit of yelling and a strongly worded reprimand from uncle Vernon or the silent treatment from Aunt petunia. Which usually resulted in Olivia crying, making their uncle extremely uncomfortable and invoking what little cousinly protective instincts Dudley possessed. Olivia had both the dursley men wrapped around her little finger before she could even say the word den.

Petunia had always wanted a daughter so of the 2 Potter children she got the most leeway with her antics and accidental magic something she shared as much as possible with Harry taking the rap for anything overly obvious though the haircutting incident when he had just started 2nd grade was unfortunately completely blamed on him.

Dudley and Harry shared a Room begrudgingly they weren't exactly bosom buddies but the words Harry hunting had never been uttered in the dursley household they were at most polite roommates though Dudley still did get upset when Harry played with his games but he allowed Olivia to use his computer and by extension Harry simply because the older Potter child was perpetually hovering over his sister's shoulder when she was using the machine.

Boredom made older brothers do the strangest things.

Harry got a few presents on his birthday every year usually 7 Because anything less would have Olivia crying again, And that wasn't something Vernon dursley could tolerate for some inexplicable reason. The youngest Potter child had weaponized that particular emotion well before she realized it.

It was something Harry was both grateful for and found mildly irritating.

Olivia thankfully only turned on the water works for a good cause mostly... The only exception really being the time the dursley's we're only going to send Dudley to the adventure camp in the Cotswolds his sister's crying had gotten all 3 of them shipped there for a week one summer when they were 10 and Olivia just about to turn 9.

It was a rather interesting time Dudley had purple hair for most of the trip Harry was responsible for it but remarkably their cousin found it funny since he made quite a few friends out of the magical hair dye job. Any photographs from the adventure park trip were safely hidden in a shoebox under Olivia's bed.

The owls for hogwarts were actually greeted with a bit of screaming but no trip to a remote island Olivia's crying came in handy yet again Harry went to hogwarts with Olivia, Dudley and A reluctant Uncle Vernon to see him off at the station aunt petunia refused to attend for obvious reasons.

Hearing and seeing Vernon dursley jump at the train whistle for the hogwarts express was a memory that would live on in infamy For many later cousin reunions a few decades in the future all of the children had laughed and Dudley had actually climbed on to the express with Harry and Olivia to help store harry's trunk for the journey they had about an hour to kill before it left though Uncle Vernon Called them away back through the entrance to the platform after only 15 minutes and Harry went to find a seat clutching a copy of Casino Royale something Dudley had given him for the journey a rare token of affection from his cousin a gift that wasn't given on his birthday
