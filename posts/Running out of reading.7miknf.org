I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for around 15 years, particularly the ones over 100k words (when I have downtime I can easily read 1m words/day). At the time I began, I was reading around 200-300 books per year (I was in elementary school so shorter ones), but I eventually transitioned to solely fanfiction.

Now, I'm out of reading. That is, I've read nearly every fanfic that appeals to me, but I cannot sustain interest in normal books anymore. When I first sit down, I can get somewhat into a book, but once I have to do something else or get distracted I can never get back into it, unlike with fanfics.

Has anybody else struggled with this? For those of you who read both how do you do it?

TLDR: I have nothing to read and don't know how to read normal books anymore

Edit: I didn't really think about my words/day when I mentioned it


** 1m words a day? what. No, serious, what? At that speed, it's not reading, it's skimming. I'm a fast reader, but I can't read almost the entirety of the HP series in 1 day.

**** Oh whoops you're right! I thought the last one I read was 1m words but it was only 500k! That and this is pretty readable stuff, while it definitely takes me like an hour to read 10 pages of a textbook.

****** I can't speak for OP and I wouldn't go as far as 500k words in a normal day, but there are a lot of stories where skimming /is/ how I enjoy the story. Many times I've run into a story I want to read because the author's imagination intrigues me, but the technical quality of the writing is distracting. In cases like that I can finish a story significantly faster than if I was savoring the prose and hunting for small details.

****** I didn't realize that was an extreme number so maybe I'm overestimating but I guess this is part of why fanfictions are so appealing to me. I can just read for plot without worrying about prose I don't understand. Also this is on days where I literally just read all day (I'm currently on holiday) and maybe subtract some of that for author notes or comments that I skip over. And I have always read rather quickly, probably because I go on these reading binges. As I said, if I cannot finish a normal book in one sitting, I have a really hard time going back.

********* Yes, but my point was you could read faster than that and be done sooner. At my normal speed of 500 wpm, that's a little less than 17 hours of reading, or going from 8 am to 1 am. I've done that before, on a Saturday with nothing to do. Not usually that much in one sitting, because I don't usually swap between stories in one session, and there aren't so many 500k+ stories such that I have the wish to read one coincide with a day free to do so in one session. The last one I recall doing was a while ago, and it was just a few chapters of Vimesenthusiast's Third Path to the Future.

** I've had a similar problem with reading anything other than HP fanfiction for the last few years. It helped me to read crossovers and when I found ones I liked I would read the books from the crossover. Best was Dresden Files.

** I feel your pain, OP! I've been reading Harry Potter FanFiction for, oh, 11-12ish years at this point? I'm a super quick reader too--- I can chew through several hundred thousands words in a day. I think nothing of reading 100k fics or novels in a few hours. It's how I've always been! There's a particular Merlin fic series that I'm going to go back and reread when I have maybe three days free --- it's 1.2 million words and I could easily get through that over a long weekend. It takes me around a week if I only read in the evenings.

Sometimes I find it good to take a break from HP fandom and go delve into another fandom for a while and catch up on whatever is new there. Or find a new one completely --- but that's soooo hard when I find it tough to get into new books or tv shows or movies.

** When I first got into FanFiction in 2015, that was all I read. Now, however, there aren't many stories that appeal to me and I skim through the ones that do. I've actually gotten back to reading books (Sleeping Beauties by Stephen and Owen King with Beneath A Scarlet Sky by Mark Sullivan on the back burner). And 500K words in one day?! I don't mean to be rude but is reading what you do all day?

**** Well books or Fanfiction? They are definitely not synonymous of each other. With books, I'm into Stephen King and his work so he's usually an author a gravitate towards. In terms of FanFiction, I literally scroll through the "Just In" Page and briefly look at what's newly posted. Most of the time, just by reading the summary, you can tell if a story is going to interest you or not. Also, sometimes I read what's recommended on these Reddit boards.

** I had a similar problem. I've begun to cut out fanfiction so I can get back to novels. Try Dresden Files. It's good, fast paced, and about a wizard named Harry, so it'll be a good transitional series.

The one that has me currently hooked is lightbringer by Brent weeks. It's really good. The magic system is cool, and the main characters are all fantastic. You can never tell what's gonna happen next, tons of twists. Which after the predictability of fanfiction is nice.

** I have definitely struggled with this and currently still am. The only thing that I've found to work is to listen to an audio book to get through the initial set up part of the book (which is what fanfiction usually skimps on) and then read the later part of the book normally. That way the book holds my attention.

** I had a similar problem but it wasn't running out of fics to read, but more like getting burned out by the HP fandom. I ended up jumping into the Worm fandom which helped quite a bit. Maybe try that? I would give Worm a shot. They have a pretty active fanfiction community on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/][SpaceBattles]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][SufficientVelocity]]. There's also [[/r/WormFanfic]] which is pretty useful. Worm itself can be read [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][here]].

** PM me with like ~20 links of your favourites on FFN and I will make a list of potentially interesting fics for you. Better if those are from different fandoms/authors, the resulting list will likely be more interesting and varied.

And to answer how I coped with that dilemma - I've written an app that lets me find stuff better.

**** People don't write with the intention of having their stories speed-read, they want to write things that come alive in the readers mind. You can only experience that if you take the time the envision what is being written, the way the people speak in their dialogue, the way the scenes progress and how the people feel.

Reading it out loud forces you to experience all of that in a way that speed-reading does exactly not.
