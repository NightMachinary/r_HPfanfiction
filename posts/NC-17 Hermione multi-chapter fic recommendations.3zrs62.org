I'm new to this subreddit so if this not allowed--my apologies. However, I am looking for recommendations on *multi-chapter* NC-17 or MA fics in the following pairings:\\
1. Hermione/Draco\\
2. Hermione/Fred\\
3. Hermione/George\\
4. Hermione/Charlie

I am a stickler for stories being VERY well written as I typically cannot get through anything with sizable grammatical errors or "juvenile" syntax.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** I believe linkffn(isolation by bex-chan) had some explicit scenes but it's been a while since I've read it (someone who has read it more recently could tell you!). It's Draco/Hermione. There's also linkffn(the bracelet by akashathekitty) that I read recently, but I found the characterizations kind of juvenile.

Are you open to any other Hermione ships, or just those ones?

When I get home from work I'll go through my favs list and edit some in, I know I have some from your list!

  Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet... 7th year AR. COMPLETE SINCE 2009 XD

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

** For Draco/Hermione rated M:

One of my favorites is [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]].

#+begin_quote
  Becoming attached had never been part of the plan. Neither was falling in love. One night out on the town, Hermione comes face to face with Draco Malfoy--Memory Charmed and living as a Muggle--and an opportunity too good to pass up. What starts as revenge quickly grows into something more, and as Hermione delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the man who can't remember who he is - the man everyone thought was dead - she might discover more than she can handle.
#+end_quote

I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] more than The Bracelet, but as another poster said, they do bicker quite a bit in Silencio too (both stories are by the same author).

#+begin_quote
  In a whirlwind of pleasure and angst, can Draco and Hermoine end up happy and together? Or are they destined forever to keep their relationship physical and above all secret?
#+end_quote

I also liked [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=582][An Aversion to Change]].

#+begin_quote
  After his failed attempt on Dumbledore's life, Draco seeks refuge at the Order of the Phoenix. Sent back to Hogwarts with suspicious title of Head Boy, he is forced to share a dormitory with none other than Hermione Granger. But with war looming on the horizon and sinister happenings in Hogwarts itself, their seventh year together is anything but ordinary.
