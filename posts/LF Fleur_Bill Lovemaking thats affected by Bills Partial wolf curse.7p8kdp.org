Title says all. Im curious about what would happen when they have sex and its fullmoon. Would Fleur like those Sessions the most, because Bill takes her "like an animal" or would she bare it (tolerate it), because she loves his "normal" perormance, but doesnt show her dislike against his Feral Persona? I want to know all the Versions.


** The real question is would their cycles synchronise?

**** Menstrual cycles synchronize when people live together for some time. They are joking if whether or not Fleur's period will start syncing with Bill's werewolf transformation.

** Fortunately, Bill is only part werewolf, because you wouldn't want to have sex with a full werewolf. Best-case scenario, you'd be severely injured; worst-case scenario, you'd die.

I'm not sure that this is what you're looking for, but I recall that this fic addresses how the curse affected Bill and Fleur's life in general during the Deathly Hallows.
