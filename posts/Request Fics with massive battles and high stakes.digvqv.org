Looking for fics with large scale battles, sieges, etc. Alternatively, guerilla campaigns set in a background of high stakes wars. Harry as main character, no smut, other than that anything goes.

P.S. I've already read linkffn(Emperor)


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) has a couple of battles like this. The Durmstrang battle especially is just a brawl of epic proportions, although Hogwarts and the Prison are both pretty good ones as well.

linkffn(Time, Mr Potter?) has a whole bunch of fight scenes, but only the Hogwarts battle really hits the ringer and wrecks half the building.

Edit: I should note that the second half of Third Key really, really slows down and isn't frankly anywhere near as good as the first. Still quite decent, but the first half is exceptional and the second is merely good.

  COMPLETE: An AU Fifth Year fic written pre-OotP. Sword fights, apocalyptic battles, new kinds of magic. Love, betrayal, angst. Doing the right thing, doing the wrong thing, and doing it in style. This is epic. This is dark. *This* is TTK:Reloaded.

** linkffn(Faith) is SO good. It's long and a meaty one too. There's angst, drama and such schadenfreude in the resolution, and the author incorporated pagan gods in a way that would make sense for a pagan magical society. I haven't gotten around to reading the sequel but I read the whole thing in like three days. Whoooo boy.

EDIT: I forgot there is some Drarry but it's safe for work; at least I don't really remember any NSFW scenes; the romance takes a back burner in favor of some great bashing.

EDIT AGAIN BC I FORGOT TO MENTION: I recommended because it has a gigantic battle scene in like the last 3rd that there is crazy buildup too that is actually amazing.

**** Did you mean Emperor by Marquis Black? Next time, to avoid posible confusions like this you should link the fic url code instead of the title, like this (in case this is the one you actually meant to link):
