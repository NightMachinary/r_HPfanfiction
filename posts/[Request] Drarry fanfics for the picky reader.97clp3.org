After years of adamantly hating the idea of Harry and Draco getting freaky together, I recently had a really weird change of heart. This, of course, does not come without restrictions. After browsing through Ao3 and ff.net and only seeing various repeats of the same tropes, I would love some suggestions for Drarry fics that DO NOT contain the following:

- Muggle/Non magic/boring domestic coffeeshop AU (canon divergence is okay)
- 19 years later/epilogue/cursed child compliant (aka theyre 40 years old and getting together)
- *Any Ginny Weasley bashing.* I love her and I want the best for her. Nothing malicious against her. no petty arguments or mean breakups.
- anything wildly out of character
- dark/evil!Harry
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][draco in leather pants]]. i want his past behaviour acknowledged, not pushed aside or downplayed.
- forced marriage, arranged marriage
- PWP

This isnt necessary for me to read it, but bonus points if they contain:

- Draco's redemption arc
- Hogwarts 8th year

any rating is ok. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][this]] is an example of one that i read and i really liked (even though its an AU).thanks in advanced


** I really enjoy Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run, I hadn't ever been interested in reading Draco/Harry before and I found this story to be really worth the read.

** if you know his dark materials you could try this crossover (but the concept is really easy - everybodys soul is outside of his body and has the form of an animal. the animal can change its shape until puberty, then it settles) linkffn(The Phoenix and the Hare)

  When Draco meets Harry he knows he's met someone special, it just takes a while and a war for him to realise why. Drarry.

** linkao3(Somebody to Love by khasael) is one of my favorites. It's post DH but not epilogue compliant. Spoilers but there is a nice character arc for Draco.

When he finds himself cursed, with little hope for lifting the spell, he sets out to make the most of the time he has left. Getting to know his Aunt Andromeda and his young cousin Teddy feels like a good thing to do, even if it can't help him in the long run...or can it?Rating: PGDisclaimer: All Harry Potter characters herein are the property of J.K. Rowling and Bloomsbury/Scholastic. No copyright infringement is intended.Warning(s): Angst. Definitely angst. Mentions of minor character death that have occurred before the start of the action. Small amount of violence. Musings on death and dying, as the prompt warrants.Epilogue compliant? Nope, definitely not.Word Count: ~31,400

** [[https://sites.google.com/site/harrydracosmoochfest2013/home/fics-and-art/kiss-the-joy][Kiss the Joy (Until the Sun Rise)]] is set just after the Battle of Hogwarts. If you like this one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264616/1/To-Be-Back-Again-in-the-Rest-of-the-Room][To Be Back Again in the Rest of the Room]] has the same concept, just executed slightly differently.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12080184/chapters/27370635][Denouement]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/319257/chapters/513333?view_adult=true][At Your Service]] are both 8th year fics.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irreistible Poison]] is set during the Hogwarts years, but is one of my very favorite stories. I love the writing and the unique take on love potions.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] is set some years after Hogwarts. I think I remember that marriage out of duty is an element of the story? But it's well worth a read if you can look past that. I haven't read anything else like this fic before and it's so well written and has this beautiful sense of nostalgia.
