Let's discuss fics that have become Headcannon!

For me, it is linkffn(The Assassin Wore White). After reading this I just cannot read any fic that mentions attacks on St Mungo's.

What are your fics any why?


** The Philosopher's Stone was either a fake or one of a pair.

Do you /really/ think someone who's been alive for 600+ years is just going to hand over the sole source of their immortality to use as Dark Lord bait without so much as a "by your leave"?

Also, parseltongues are immune to the Death Gaze of a basilisk. I like that too much to write it otherwise.

*** I've seen it quite a few places, and I've got it stuck in my head that Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel were not the original names of the two people. It was either a Dread Pirate Roberts situation where their Stone and Alchemical prowess was a complete hoax, or the pair of them just killed off their names and started new lives every once in a while. Who knows why they lived for 600+ years with the same identities, but I kinda figured they had been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years already when they chose those two. And with as widespread as the relationship 'Nicholas' had with Dumbledore, it would have been easy to fake their death and start new lives.

** ooooh! A fic where healers have set themselves up as ,basically , magical Switzerland. I love the idea and I love the fic you linked.

for me I have three fics that became head cannon but unfortunately I can't remember the name of the third fic.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/12/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]])\\
This fic has captured my imagination and made potions and potion making magical. What Harry does in this fic when he's brewing or making a wand is the very essence of what I imagine Snape's doing when he's experimenting or what Olivander's very first bumbling steps into wandlore would have looked like. Ignore the middle earth setting and ignore the silly names for the silly people and just appreciate how magical potion making is. Because of this fic I will never be able to go back to canon or fics where potion making is just following a recipe step by step by step until completion.

Linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712904/]])\\
This fic has become my personal headcanon for what early hogwarts would have looked like, how the founders would have interacted among themselves and how not evil Slytherin and Gryffindor were. Neither of them were evil, nor were they saints but rather they were just flawed humans beings doing what they thought was best. This fic also sets my headcanon for what Merlin would have been like as a child during his formative years in Slytherin -Slytherin's?- house.

The final fic I've lost the title for but it holds two spots in my heart that are near and dear to me. The first thing it did was show me a believable post war Draco doing what he loved and what he loved doing was fixing stuff. He works as a magical custodian and maintenance man, the story being that he discovered his passion for fixing things while he was working on the cupboard in sixth year and never stopped wanting to fix things.

The second thing that fic did is... well... It made me realise I'm a lesbian. There's a scene where Harry and Draco were kissing and it goes into excruciating detail on what Draco's lips felt like pressing up (and around) Harry's lips. I almost barfed, then I spent the rest of the day thinking about all the times I'd kissed men, which means I spent the entire day feeling ill.

So there's my headcanon and something completely different I look forward to hearing about everyone else's headcanons and maybe getting a few more for myself out of the deal.

I actually made an account just to reply to this; about a year ago, I came across an HP/TR fic and the story was decent, but there was some really well-written smut in it, and I was absolutely baffled by the fact that it turned me on. So, much like you, I eventually figured out that I was at least bisexual. Unfortunately, I've looked for the fic itself many times just to revisit and see what it was that allowed me to discover my sexuality, but I haven't been able to find it at all. :( Anyway, just wanted to share a similar experience!

*** Is it really headcanon if your image of Merlin aligns with what is known of him in history and popular culture? The Merlin as he is represented in the books works perfectly well. It is only when JKR decided on Pottermore (It is Pottermore, where this particular nugget comes from, isn't it?) that you are suddenly forced to make up a headcanon about him because she insisted on him being born AFTER the muggles had already written about him.

The Merlin of muggle myth precedes Hogwarts by about 500 years.

Of course, you could always make the wizarding Merlin a great big fake. Someone who styled himself after a figure of legend and was skilled enough to be convincing when he scammed the gullible.

**** Yes it is canon that Merlin went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin house but other than those two facts there's nothing else. The fic I linked above shows who Merlin was as a child and more specifically who he was before he became a legendary figure. As for yours and others quibbles about dates and time frames, one of the main themes of that entire fic is that specifics become confused or forgotten over the ages.

Also I if it helps I read this fic before I found out it merlin in Slytherin was canon and up until I found out it's canon Slytherin!Merlin in general became my head canon.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** I think this is linkffn(the forest of valbone). The sorting hat is actually the remains of gryffindor's horcrux. Godric felt remorse, healed his soul and passed on, leaving the hat behind. My single favorite feature of any fic. The sorting hat is far and away the smartest magical object we find . . . with the possible exception of Tom's diary, so I feel it makes sense. I also like how it blurs the line little between slytherin, the "evil" house and gryffindor, the "good" house.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
