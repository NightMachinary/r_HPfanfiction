As the title says, do you know of any fics where Harry goes somewhere with more people. Preferably I'd like it to be with Hermione but I don't really mind. Maybe something similar to Stages of Hope? No slash please.


** Not at all like Stages of Hope, but first thing that came to mind:

linkffn(10819050)

It's a fun little fic.

** Highly recommend the first two and have re read them multiple times. Discovered Faery Heroes recently and only read it once but it's also good. Altered Destinies and The Real Memory don't exactly fit what you're asking because Harry travels alone, but they're well written if you want to check it out.

On a side note, I came here looking for fics to read and found my own fic from a decade ago recommended. I'm glad it's still giving people joy üòä
