** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. In its second year, recently returned to weekly updates.

Well, Harry outclasses basically anyone his age in anything that isn't casting curses. Despite what it may seem from the previous sentence it's not a super Harry fic.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

This isn't /quite/ what you're looking for, but Harry's certainly superior to Hermione in this fic and does "outclass" her, despite what the beginning may suggest. Regardless, this is one of the best fics out there. If you haven't already, give it a read.
