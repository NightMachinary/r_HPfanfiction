BEFORE I GET STARTED I want to make certain what I mean by this: What I mean by this is a Harry who, because of some plot or another, thinks like an animal. HE MUST HAVE STARTED HUMAN AND THEN THROUGH PLOT BECOME AN ANIMAL. He could be some form of animagus permanently trapped in their form, or somehow be fully turned into an animal, but the end result MUST be that Harry no longer thinks like a human, and is permanently an animal. That includes a lack of intelligence, lack of critical thinking, etc. Also a complete lack of romance involving Harry, because, well, I doubt an animal would want to have a romantic relationship with anyone beyond f**king them, and seeing as I don't want to read what would basically bestiality... Yeah, no romance please.

The closest I've found to this idea is The Taming Of Harry Potter [ linkffn(1513674) ], in which due to over the top Dursley abuse Harry was basically an animal in a human body. This almost fits the criteria, just misses the whole "permanent" and "fully animal" part.

Thanks for any replies.

P.S: I have absolutely no idea why I want to read this /shrugs/


** Linkffn(the art of self fashioning) Harry enters an animalistic mindset after too much self-transfiguration- however, someone else notices and starts retraining him to become more human. So not exactly what you're looking for but the closest I can think of.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

*** I've read that, and definitely enjoyed it, but like you noticed he then starts working towards being more human. I'm looking for a story in which that ISN'T the case.

Thanks for the recommendation anyway though :)

  For young Harry Potter, a cupboard under the stairs was luxury compared to the conditions he has been kept in since he was seven years old...

** Okay, if you're okay with it being a Pokemon instead of an animal I think this one has the gist of what you're looking for

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.
