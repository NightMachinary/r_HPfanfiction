In most of the "Harry loses his magic" fics that I've read, Harry gets his magic in the end. Any good fics where he loses his magic completely and doesn't get it back again?

  Set during Book 7. During the time she and Harry are alone in the tent, Hermione discovers a spell that could be extremely useful against Voldemort, but it's considered by the wizarding world to be even worse than Unforgiveables. Do they dare use it?

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.
