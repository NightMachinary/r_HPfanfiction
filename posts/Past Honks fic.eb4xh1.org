:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I'm looking for the name of a fic I read a while back. Apologies for the slightly... manic structure of the info below, I'm currently mildly tipsy and I'm running on about ninety minutes of sleep, but trying to remember the name of this thing is irritating me.

IIRC, Harry used to be involved with Tonks and she died while pregnant during an attack on Diagon Alley, after which his current love interest (which I think may be Hermione?) becomes a surrogate for the foetus and gives birth. The whole story is told to their daughter as a kind of 'How I met your birth mother' story later in life - there's also a portrait of Tonks involved somehow.


** I don't have the time to verify as I'm in a hurry but I think I know the fic you're talking about. If my memory is good, it's linkffn(2120941).

  Erin Potter is loved by her parents Harry and Hermione and they've provided every possible happiness to her, except one: They were married one year after she was born and the years before that are mysteriously kept quiet. What are her parents hiding?
