Looking for fics where harry stops someone from being raped and they develop a relationship out of it. No slash but any pairing ok otherwise. I've read a couple like this but cant remember the names so I'll take anything


** There's a fic I'm thinking of... I'll post the link when I find it. Be warned, it's Harry/Harem so

**** Okay so I can't for the life of me find it but here's what I remember

-It was on ffn

-Harry was with Hermione, Luna, I think Susan Bones(that's where your prompt comes in; he saves her from something in knockturn alley but I think accidentally forges a soul bond), and a girl who's a dark fairy

-Harry and co become Fairy animagi

-It was titled some thing like either 'Dark Wings' or 'Harry Potter and the Dark Fairy'

If you find it can you link it? And keep in mind the group might have built since then I haven't read it in at least a year.

******** Oh and you mentioned the harem thing so.

I have finally decided to do my own harem thing in my Hybrid au, bc Omega Harry is something of a guilty pleasure of mine and I wanted to write shit.
