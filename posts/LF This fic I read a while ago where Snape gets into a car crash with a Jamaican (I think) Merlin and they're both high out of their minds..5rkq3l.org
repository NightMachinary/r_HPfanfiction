Merlin is from Jamaica or maybe he just had dreads I don't remember which but he was immortal or something and I'm pretty sure Snape smokes one of his joints.

I don't remember much else about it but I think Harry stashes Lucius Malfoy in the trunk of a car and there is some kind of worldwide underground railroad for Muggleborns.

  The Death Eaters have come for Harry Potter but this slightly crazy Gryffindor has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.
