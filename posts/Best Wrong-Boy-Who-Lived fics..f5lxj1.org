  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Best is probably this... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]\\
Extremely good writing, awesome new plot where Harry goes to Drumstrang to forge his own path... however, it looks like the author won't come back to finish it.\\
147k words so far/ 12 chapters. I would give it a try just to enjoy something really new and creative. I swear, this story would have been 10x better than the original...

*** Weird? Weird doesn't even begin to define it. Grooming witches. Pedophilic shit is going down in that fic. Surprised FF.net allowed it.

I'll keep saying it even if I get downvoted to hell.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** Not completed but being updated regularly, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). I'm not entirely sure if it's actually WBWL, but it has a lot of the tropes assosciated with those fics.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
