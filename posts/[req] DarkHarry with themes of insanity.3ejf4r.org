** linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) does this /really/ well. linkffn(Trial by Troll) is a must-read one-shot you should like. linkffn(The last dinosaur's roar) is a seriously dark fic (not for the faint of heart /at all/) that threw my insanity-meter into a dilemma, as I'm not exactly sure when Harry crosses the line, or when I stopped agreeing with his actions.

The last two are one-shot; Circular Reasoning is the best novel-length fic you have not listed that I can think of.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
