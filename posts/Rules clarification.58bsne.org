Quick question- I have a series of stories set in the HP setting that I wrote for my kids. Can I post those here? Or is this reddit for links to fan fics posted elsewhere?


** Post them on fanfiction.net then post links to here for self-promotion

**** It's not a rule per se but it is the common practice. Mostly because Reddit is a terrible format for presenting large bodies of text.

****** Link them here after! I'm sure a bunch of us would love to read what you wrote for your kids. :-)

******* I will. Currently waiting for the fanfiction.net probation period to end. I have five books in the series so it will take a while to post it all (and some of the latter ones could really use some revising first).

**** Yeah, there's a Promotion flair that you can use to advertise your stories here but Reddit doesn't post fanfiction. Fanfiction dot net and archive of our own are the two fanfic hosting sites most often linked to here.

**** The standard procedure is to have your fic uploaded to ... pretty much anywhere, and then post a link here. You can do it by uploading the document itself to someplace like Dropbox, or by uploading a .pdf file of it to the same kind of place, or by posting it on a fanfic site such as fanfiction.net. Any of those is acceptable, really, it's just that the last is the most convenient for the casual reader and the site chosen is the one most people post to.

There is a limit to the length of a post on reddit and the formatting is ... different, so anything longer than tiny is going to be problematic to post here directly.

** This isn't a great place for it. You would probably get a better experience and reception if you post to fanfiction.net and link here. You'd also probably have better luck with formatting. But nobody's going to tell you off for posting fics here.
