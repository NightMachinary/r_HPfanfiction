I think it's weird that most people were like, "Yeah, saw that coming a mile away," but then there's that subgroup of people that were like, "WHAT? Where did this come from? Ron and Hermione aren't compatible in the least. Harry was clearly meant to wind up with Hermione!"

** Charlie Weasley. They seem like they would have a lot in common: passion about magical creatures (Charlie with his dragons and Hermione about house-elves and the rights of all magical creatures); both were prefects; Charlie was head-boy and while Hermione wasn't head-girl, she mostly would've been if she went to Hogwarts for her seventh year; both like adventure (Charlie moved all the way to Romania to work with dragons); both were intelligent educational-wise...he fits with her, in my mind.

But then again, I don't see that age gap as being too much of a hinderance in terms of the pairing. I know, as I'm sure you do as well, several couples that are of that age gap or greater.

*** There are a fair few well written stories with that pairing, but I don't honestly think they have much in common that makes this so. Honestly much of Bellatrix's character is fanon there and my enjoyment of the pairing has more to do with the number of good writers contributing to it rather than anything about the pairing that is inherently good.

Luna and Fleur though work a bit more easily in my mind. The easiest by far as far as personality and passions go is McGonagall, but it requires some similar gymnastics to Bellatrix. Similarly, a few good writers have turned it into a viable pairing for me.

**** The most we know about Bellatrix is hearsay and conjecture.

We know she is (or was before Azkaban) a brilliant duellist and extremely powerful. Powerful in the HP universe is almost synonymous with being very educated in and having a deep understanding of magic, as well as having a good portion of intelligence. At the very least they would share a common ground in their academic endeavours.

But yeah, the similarities end here. After that the pairing is great because they are such extreme opposites while being, in essence, the same character. Bellatrix is to Voldemort what Hermione is to Harry.

***** Actually Bellatrix could be one of Voldemort's biggest victims (assuming that her marriage with Lestrange was not consensual).

Imagine getting married off to a brute like Lestrange. Since you never consented to the marriage you are basically raped for years. He allows his brother to use her too. Disobedience is harshly punished. At some point you can't take it anymore, you break, you lash out in the only direction that you can. Therefore the Bellatrix how we know her is born. Voldemort's sadistic enforcer.

Which is assuming a lot.

There is literally nothing in canon that would suggest Bellatrix didn't love or at least like Rodolphus enough to marry him. Sure, there is so little known about Bellatrix that it /could/ be possible, but I tend to think about canon Bellatrix as someone who would have gone the same path as Andromeda had she not somewhat agreed with her parents wishes, or loved Rodolphus.

It certainly adds some flavour to the Black sister dynamic if Andi is feeling guilty for creating the Bellatrix we know because she ran away from Lestrange and then her sister was stuck with him/them.
