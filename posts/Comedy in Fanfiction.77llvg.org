There's a wide variety of humour that can be present in a fic. Sarcasm, wit, dry humour, slapstick, irony, cringe, etc. all work just fine, and there are cases where they work amazingly well.

However having a character unironically called Lord Voldemort the term "Mouldy Shorts" is not funny. It isn't. No seriously, it's not funny.

I don't know why so many authors love this term but I see it all the time, and I always try to forget it was ever said.

I'm all for it being used ironically, but I've never once seen it used that way.

To sum up my point, here's a quotation from "The Denarian Lord" by Shezza, Chapter 6.

"He frowned, looking thoughtful. "I wonder if there's a way to mock his name somehow. Voldemort...Voldie? Moldie? Moldie Warts? Moldie Shorts?"

Harry and Dumbledore both paused.

"Nah, I sound like a complete moron when I say crap like that," Harry dismissed."


** Yeah, stupid nicknames for villains or offensive epithets are very likely to make one roll their eyes at least. What one has to remember, I suppose, is that many of those writing these fanfictions are quite young (12-14) or have been in very similar communities since they /were/ very young, you know?

In the same way that "lol so random" humour doesn't really carry past the age of sixteen, the use of twee nicknames for war criminals and mass murderers makes most want to just close the tab, even if the protagonists ARE children.

*** Well, seeing as there were quite a few insulting nicknames for Hitler (like Gr√∂faz, or a song that basically went "Hitler has got only one ball"), used by adults, I don't really share the view that stupid nicknames are a sign of young authors.

**** My apologies, Starfox, I didn't mean to imply the use of stupid nicknames is inherently for young authors - there are immature adults who include the same, of course! :)

But I would say the context is rather different. Nicknames for Hitler make complete sense - you see them in songs, on posters... Effectively, in propaganda.

The Weasley Twins used U-No-Poo, but the level of fear in the wizarding world is enough that we don't really see /any/ propaganda against Voldemort, like. No one even says his actual name out of fear, so I can't exactly see them using an insulting epithet instead.

But the Wizarding World /is/ very stupid on occasion. My headcanon was always that the "You-Know-Who" nickname started in the columns of the /Daily Prophet/ and was invented by some Fudge-like journalist, and its use in the sole news outlet of Wizarding Britain was so overwhelming that people began using it no matter how stupid it really was. (After all, when the headlines keep saying things like YOU-KNOW-WHO SLAUGHTERS ENTIRE VILLAGE - NO SURVIVORS, after a while, people will stop seeing the humor in the name.)

******* Even with the taboo it just makes no sense. The Dark Lord is perfectly fine without sounding like a frightened chicken.

Of course, you could simply apparate across Europe, buy a shitton of landmines on the black market, plant them in a remote area, trigger the taboo and apparate away.

******** I don't think people actually want to refer to Voldemort as a Dark Lord. That's more a form of respect from his followers. Also, people are frightened. That's the whole reason they say "You Know Who" in the first place.

******** I doubt it started out as the title, "You Know Who." People probably just didn't want to say his name out of fear and used the common phrase "you-know-who." Eventually, it mutated into a title they called him. The power behind the title comes from the fear that people have of him. Obviously it sounds silly to us, but if you consider the mindset of the people in the story it makes sense, especially if it was a gradual change from a reference to a title. Also, isn't the term Dark Lord only used by his followers?

********** Because they don't want to refer to him by anything that resembles his title or powers. The purpose of using the term "you-know-who" is to avoid Voldemort noticing you. Also, I doubt Voldemort is upset that they call him "You Know Who."

********** The reason that always made sense to me was that the taboo was up on Voldemort and he would come and murder whoever said it, thus the people cringing even years after when hearing the name.

** It's meant to be funny? Thought it was more to be insulting towards ole flight from death, defiant towards him.

By the way, Voldy Moldy started in canon, Peeves says "We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one, and Voldy's gone mouldy, so now let's have fun!" after Voldemort dies, and Voldy's gone moldy is at least mildly amusing in that context I think.

Though I am surprised how few bald jokes they use- you'd think someone would have the balls to call Voldemort chrome dome or something.

*** I don't think many wizards would get that reference. The muggleborns and some of the half-bloods, sure, but the purebloods? They might not even know what chrome is.

**** True, and that's a bonus, muggleborns and raised will get a giggle out of it, and no one would tell Voldy since, you know, you'd have to admit you know a bit too much about muggles for comfort.

Hell, it doesn't even have to be chrome dome, that was just an example, I think I'd like to see a fic call him Elmer Fudd throughout the book and have a moment where Voldemort finally learns just what the hell an Elmer Fudd was and why all those muggles/muggleborns were laughing at him.

Or something that doesn't need muggle knowledge, like saying whoa there, Voldemort, your head is blindingly bright, you think before we duel we could switch spots so your head's not in the sun?

Or in response to Voldemort saying something like "Your parents begged for mercy.." say "Well, at least I'm not bald, in fact I'm quite Harry"

Or something wizardized, "Bludger head" has a nice ring to it and sounds insulting even without the bald aspect.

Or a werewolf pretending his head is the full moon and screaming in agony pretending he's transforming, only to say "Wait, that's not the full moon." Maybe from a Lupin that isn't a beaten down has-been.

** I think names like "Moldy Shorts" are a great way to poke fun of the almost reverence that magical britain treats Voldemort with by calling him "You-Know-Who". That name gives him way to much mystique and power.

It's a great way to rob him of his power: Hey, you are to afraid to even call him by his moniker? Well, guess what, I'll go 10 steps further and blatantly insult him every time I refer to him, you babies!
