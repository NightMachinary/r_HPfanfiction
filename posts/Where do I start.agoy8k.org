** I can recommend all the stuff by FloreatCastellum, she's really good at writing in character, and making you really care about those characters. Not From Others is the seventh book from Ginny's point of view. The Aurors and its sequel Hollow Ash are about Harry working as an Auror. All of her stories have a Harry/Ginny pairing, but romance doesn't tend to be the focus.

The Changeling by Annerb features Ginny sorted into Slytherin. It's really well written too.

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of the Blood is a quite unique story, featuring Harry, Hermione and Ron in their sixties, facing once again a dangerous villain.

I've also enjoyed The Seventh Horcrux by Melindaleo. The story is twelve years old by now, but it has aged well and it's amazing how many things she guessed correctly about the last book. I've not found time yet to read her more recent writing, including the much recommended These Cuts I Have, which deals with the aftermath of the battle.

If you're looking for something a little bit more out there, I'd like to suggest Let Perpetual Light by teh tarik. It deals with the summer when Albus met Grindelwald. It's unique as it heavily features Ariana and manages to give her some agency of her own despite her mental state. The writing gives a nice mysterious vibe too.

In a similar vein, I'd like to recommend Blackpool, a story about Regulus Black's childhood. But be warned, it gets quite dark at times.

I hope you like some of them. Enjoy :)

** Are you wanting to start with canon-compliant fics, or branch out?

For example, linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) tells Severus Snape's life story, of which the final seven years are but a (significant) part, and is canon-compliant. I recommend it as a way to get a different point of view on canon, from someone who may well have what seemed to him like good reasons to resent the Potter boy. (A word of caution, it's not G-rated. Voldemort was in the habit of torturing his Death Eaters, and Snape spent a long time among their number.)

Or just one that gives a Hogwarts-centric point of view on book 7, from Ginny/Neville/etc, like linkffn(A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor McGonagall).

If, on the other hand, you want to explore something different, you could jump onto one of the many fics that branches off, typically around years 5-7. linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo) is notable for having been written before book 7, and making a number of correct predictions about its contents, while very much telling its own story. Ginny features much more prominently than in canon, refusing to be left behind in illusory safety.

Or go back and do it all over with a Peggy Sue fic like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), which is incomplete but one of my favourites for how it handles Harry rebuilding all his friendships with those whom he lost in a thirteen-year war. It has the best character development I've seen for Ginny, who is a major character from their first meeting at the station. Or linkffn(Backwards with Purpose by deadwoodpecker), which has a similar time-travel-after-pyrrhic-victory premise but quickly goes in quite a different direction once they arrive in the past (and has a really excellent sequel).

Or revisit the whole series with one of the characters being altered in some way. Maybe Hermione was a maths prodigy, not just a bookworm, and became linkffn(The Arithmancer). Maybe Harry developed a strong interest in chemistry and butted heads with his potions teacher more persistently, leading to linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions).

Personally, the first fanfic that I read was one that sharply divides the community, and I'm not sure whether I'd recommend it as a starting point. But the writing quality is high, the plot is complex, and it's both thought-provoking and very funny. To those who haven't read it, I generally recommend the alternative introduction, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMOR).

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** I think doloris umbridge is one of the best villains of all time. I'm a huge fan of the weasley's and thought it was a beautiful moment when she showed up for the triwizard tournament because harry didnt have any actual family. I was a big fan of hermione and I even really like snape. I always thought Dumbledore was always in control of the situation, even in death. I loved the friendships with Neville and Luna and thought it sent a great anti bullying message. I was always waiting for anyone of the malfoys to have a redeaming moment and other than narcissa, lucious and draco didn't really do anything but become defeated.

There is also "The Thorny Rose" and its sequels, but I'm not a fan of the Hermione characterisation and you probably won't like the Ron bashing. However, it is an interesting premise (Ginny gets Riddle's memories) and has an interesting characterisation for her.

****** Harry or Hermione centric, either of them paired with each other or some of the female background characters since I don't really find any other man in the series interesting. Perhaps Sirius or Edward Tonks, but those strictly in paternal roles. If you manage to sell me some background character like Terry Boot or Justin FF, I'd also take them. I'm generally a fan of muggleborn/half blood characters because then you can have the best of both worlds and the magical world has a lot of casual muggle abuse, even the Weasleys (the twins in GoF and Ron in the epilogue) and Dumbledore (the glasses in HBP).

Either short (under 20k) romances with a lot of fluff or longer stories with a main plot and some romance on the side. I generally want stories which focus on the characters instead of Action sequences. And I really despise stories where the main cast is flawless, especially when it comes to looks. When Harry looks like Adonis or a young Arnold Schwarzenegger and Hermione like a porn star, those stories just feel wrong. Hermione is not less of a character when she has small breasts. And given the malnutrition Harry went through at the Dursleys, he should be below average height, not 6'6.

Other than Ginny, I don't find any of the Weasleys to be interesting. Not a fan of bashing them, I simply don't want them take up much screentime at all. And considering her actions in the fifth book, I drop any stories with Molly in a mother role.

** It's hard to recommend anything without knowing much but generally going through the reddit will likely get you started. Once you get into it you'll find new things to search for.

As far as a starter, I think /Not From Others/ by FloreatCastellum linkffn(11419408) on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]] might be a good one. It is a canon retelling of the 7th book that focuses on Ginny/Luna/Neville. Especially if you're a fan of Ginny I think it'll be a good fanfic to immediately follow a HP read through. It doesn't have very much Harry/Ginny because Harry is off saving the world but it's really good.

Hope you enjoy!

** Hey, got the perfect set if you want to "continue" the HP story. There's this series of books from George Norman Lippert called the James Potter saga. There's a total of 5 full novel-length books that continue the story from the perspective of James Potter, Harry's son. The author makes a good job maintaining the spirit of Rowling's narrative, and it's especially friendly for those who, like you, just finished reading the original books. Lippert really does a great job portraying the Potter characters and it's sort of easy to fall back into that world again. The author has [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][his own site]], and all of his books are easy to find on PDF or eBook if you do a quick google search.

​

It's been a long time since I last read them, but the order should be like this:

*#1* *James Potter and The Hall of Elder's Crossing*

*#2* *James Potter and The Curse of the Gatekeeper*

*#2.5* *The Girl on the Dock* (A short story that takes place between the second and third installments, complementing the third book)

*#3* *James Potter and The Vault of Destinies*

*#4* *James Potter and The Morrigan Web*

*#5* *James Potter and The Crimson Thread*

And as a *bonus*:

*Harry's First Christmas*. A short separate story about the only Christmas Harry spent with his parents.

​

Fantastic series, and one of my all-time favorites. Happy reading.
