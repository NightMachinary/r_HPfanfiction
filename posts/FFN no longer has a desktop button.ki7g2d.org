*** hmm, I see. Tried deleting the m. but the page just reloads as mobile. A direct link will load a desktop page, but will it hold throughout the chapters? So for me, on Ps4, it's unworkable. Thanks for the link.

** They broke the desktop page on mobile a few days ago. At least for now, this is the "fix".
