Guys this is a long shot because this fanfic is probably 12 years old and was on quizilla before it was rudely shut down, but does anyone remember Dirty Tactics Up and Down the Aisle (a Draco Malfoy love story) by sinandsmile?? I was obsessed with it when I was in high school and randomly found links to it the other night.... needless to say I stayed up all night rereading it and I am still so upset that there is no finale! The writer said the finale was being worked on and then the site got shut down. Does anyone know if there is a finale posted out there somewhere or does anyone know the writer(s) are they under a different name or another site?? I know there were a lot of fans of the series and I can't be the only one desperate for closure. LOL I know it's a long shot, but if anyone has details let me know :)
