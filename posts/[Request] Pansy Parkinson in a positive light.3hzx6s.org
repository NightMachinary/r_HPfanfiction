Title. Looking for a fic that doesn't make Pansy Parkinson out the way she appears in canon. I also don't care if it's a romance fic. c:


** Not a fic as such, but I recently saw an interesting [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/18598326/][argument that Pansy was the most Slytherin of them all when she proposed to hand Harry over to Voldemort]]. In a nutshell, with one little phrase she accomplished a number of goals and put herself in a win-win situation:

1. It got her and hers kicked out of Hogwarts. You might think of it as dishonor and a display of contempt, but Hogwarts was about to become one of the bloodiest wizardly battlefields in recent history, and she would have to fight for one side or the other, which could mean getting hurt --- or worse, killed. She got /her whole House/ safely evacuated, instead.
2. Suppose that Voldemort wins. Of all the Slytherins, /she/ faced down 3/4 of the school + Order of the Phoenix and argued for obeying Voldemort and hading Harry over. She has proven her loyalty to the new system and will go far.
3. Suppose that Voldemort loses. Well, she was just a scared teenager, ready to show all the remorse in the world, and the good guys would forgive and forget; they always do.

Yes, because that has /so/ much precedence of working. Remember Barty Crouch Sr?

Do not attribute to some far-fetched scheme what can be more easily attributed to malice.

**** I don't necessarily have a strong opinion either way. It was interesting food for thought, though.

However, to respond to your argument, it was, like everything else, a calculated risk. If Voldemort loses, it is Order of the Phoenix that will come to power, not a hypothetical Barty Crouch Sr.; and they had been mentored by Dumbledore, and therefore value mercy and forgiveness.

For that matter, if you are referring to Barty Crouch Jr., he was arrested torturing people with the Cruciatus. It's not clear if Pansy's suggestion was even legally actionable.

Where did you get this idea that the Order advocates kindness and mercy to Death Eaters or their affiliates? Just because it was founded by Dumbledore doesn't mean that all the members of his organization share his beliefs. Moody killed in the first war, and probably killed plenty of times. Lupin berated Harry for not killing Stan Stunpike, who was an innocent under the imperius. Kingsley killed. Hell, Molly Weasley killed, though that might come under special circumstances.

I cannot see anyone in the order losing sleep over someone who is a public supporter of the Death Eaters going to Azkaban.

All of these were in the heat of the battle, which says little about their treatment of prisoners. Even then, I don't want to go back and look up the scene with Lupin and Harry, but I'm pretty sure that the point of contention was that if Harry Stunned Stan instead of Disarming him, Stan could have fallen off his broom and died in that way, so the disagreement was really about how much risk they should take on to avoid collateral damage.

Yeah, but then they'd have to imprison most of the Ministry. Perhaps there was a small chance that they would have made an example of her, but, like I said, a calculated risk.

If it was a calculated risk, those were pretty stupid calculations. For one, many in the Order (like Aberforth) were advocating keeping Death Eater supporters as hostages. Relying on the Order's sense of mercy is suicide, and definitely not cunning in the least. Publicly making yourself to be the enemy of all of Hogwarts /is/ stupid, and something that was done out of fear and malice, and nothing more to it.

EDIT: I will also put in that even if the order were as good and nice and merciful as you make them out to be (which they're not), there was no way that Pansy could see it that way. She has no idea about the inner workings of the Order and there is precedence of the "Good Guys" being ruthless in their administration of justice in Barty Crouch Sr and Mad Eye moody. So it is a stupid thing to do either way.

Aberforth was the exception, not the rule, and getting herself kicked out was a rather quick way to ensure that that /didn't/ happen. And, for that matter, she probably knew that they wouldn't strike her down right there, since if someone did try to hex her, the Slytherin students would take her side, and they knew more than their fair share of Dark spells. They were at an impasse, and she broke it in a direction she wanted.

As for what Pansy did or didn't know, it probably wouldn't be that hard to get an idea of the surviving members of The Order just by asking around. Also, she could have observed that The Order didn't, for example, resort to any of the more vicious guerrilla tactics that magic makes possible, and that the most extreme proposal --- to take the Slytherins hostage --- was really not that bad, compared to, say, using the Imperius to make children of Death Eaters attack their parents for psychological warfare.

****** Well, let's think about what /actually/ happened after the war. Would Harry and co. have been like "Yes, this 17 year old is evil for suggesting briefly in a moment of panic that we hand Harry over despite not actually /acting/ on this and sitting out the battle. Azkaban for life".

No.

Her parents were probably in Azkaban for fighting, killing, being Death Eaters... But Pansy - she's just a teenager, and she hasn't taken the mark, nor did she fight in the battle (IIRC). So yeah, she probably wasn't persecuted.

***** This has /nothing/ to do with what Crouch Sr's specific actions, but about Crouch's generally ruthless approach to dealing with Death Eaters, like legalizing unforgivables (and the Order used unforgivables too) and arresting DEs without a trial.

And yes, publicly suggesting Harry to be handed over right before the war was due to start isn't something that can be shrugged away nearly as easily as you're implying. Everyone at Hogwarts saw her clearly marking herself as a Death Eater supporter, and she has the solid dislike of three whole houses at Hogwarts.

**** It's not super far-fetched. And even if you don't buy into this -

Your options as she sees them are...

1) 3/4 of school dies when Voldemort takes over, and some of the Slytherins, too as they fight.

2) You hand over this /one/ dude. I mean, sucks and is a shitty thing to do, but she thinks Voldemort will win regardless. So why not end it with less danger and casualties to her and hers?

No. No. No. This is fanon!Voldemort, who Crucios and kills people for fun. Voldemort in canon is known to reward servants who please him. That is how it works, after all. Carrot and Stick.

She probably wanted to hand Harry over because she thought she would be rewarded by Voldemort. She had made her allegiances quite clear before that as well -- she knew Draco was a Death Eater and didn't report him, for instance.

If JKR had intended to make Pansy nearly as cunning as you make her out to be, she would have have chosen far less subtle means. As such, all we know about Pansy is that she's a mean little thing whose bark is worse than her bite. Given that's all we know about her it is far more logical to conclude that this incident was a result of malice and not some cunning scheme (which isn't cunning at all and has a high chance of backfiring).

I was referring to the 3/4 that fight for the light in the final and most crucial battle of the war. I can definitely imagine him executing them, POW style and damn the fact that they're children.

My theory does not take cunning. My theory just requires Pansy assume that Voldemort is likely to win (through brainwashing from her parents). She wants to avoid any conflict if possible (because she'd be in danger) and she's OK with cementing her alliances as long as she believes Voldemort's side is much stronger.

Yes, Pansy Parkinson is written after JKR's childhood bully. So she's probably ugly and mean and nasty and dumb and petty and has no nice qualities, and was sorted Slytherin despite not having Slytherin qualities because she's a bully and obviously Slytherin = Evil because that's where JKR put all the characters based off of people she never liked.

** You should take a look at Broken. It's a Hermione/Draco romance (the second best one out there, IMO) and is about 360,000 words long. Takes place 5 years after DH. Pansy plays a major role in the story, only being eclipsed by Draco and Hermione. This is also the most depressing fic I have ever read, bar none.

P.S. If you're put off by Dramione stories, you should give this one a chance. It has a slow and natural-ish buildup, is expertly written, and characters aren't quite as OOC as you would expect with Dramione.
