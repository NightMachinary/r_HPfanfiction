For instance I've read a couple fics where harry inherits Grimmauld place and then because he doesn't understand wizarding households has to hire someone to help it with "wizarding space" aka expanding the rooms, adding more rooms, getting ride of rooms entirely. That or old wizarding houses having a collective conscious and responding to the intent of the right owner because so many magical people have lived there over the years. One example is House Proud by Astolat on AO3.

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.
