What's your favorite unique take on a common character?

For example, I liked the brutal IRA Hermione in Divided and Entwined and the evil but likeable Harrymort in Seventh Horcrux. HPMoR has my favorite Quirrel and The Dark Lord Never Died my favorite secret spy Ron. My favorite Tom is from The Evil Overlord List (thanks to Jerry, of course).


** My favorite take on certain characters:

Bellatrix in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): The author doesn't try to whitewash her, as she remains a deeply flawed person. But since she chose to follow Harry instead of Voldemort, she didn't fall down that rabbit hole, and could instead put her virtues to good use.

Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): He is still kind pathetic, but he has also earned his redemption here.

Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): That's one cool manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395): Her growth in this story is phenomenal. I like this version of her a lot better than Canon.

Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He becomes increasingly brutal as the story goes on, and yet he remains fiercely protective of his friends. When he and Hermione are going on that suicide mission in the end, he 'orders' Neville to stay behind.

Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): I have my greatest sympathy and respect for this Hermione, I wish she and Harry could get together in their new world.

Petunia in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): This Petunia is strong and successful, she loved Lily and loves Harry, but she still nurses a huge inferiority complex and remains bitter throughout the story. She is still very much recognizable as her canon version.

Ron in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This Ron is model boyfriend.

  Petunia in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]],
#+end_quote

I forget how I love Petunia here. She's still a jealous bitter bitch, but since she loved Harry and Lily her jealousy is directed to other people.

Not that I also love fangirl!Hermione of course.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology.

And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  POA AU: A tumblr prompt: Cedric Diggory + "rules" The thing about Cedric Diggory was that, if he was comfortable telling that sort of joke, he'd say that really, truly, and honestly... he was really just several anxious rabbits in a robe. Always had been.

** Ew, sure, this seems fun!

Daphne Greengrass in Cage and Key by Faromir linkffn(1022385) and The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie linkffn(10649604) For Cage and Key: This has always been one of my favourites (though fair warning, it is unfinished) she isn't really her typical “Ice Queen” in this story, even though I actually enjoy that gimmick. Without giving too much away, she is definitely still Slytherin, but she is genuinely just a normal person, all be it a very driven one. It's probably the most realistic portrayal as well, that is, while still being enjoyable.

As for James Spookie's story, I'm sure most of you have read this, but I really do love Daphne in this fic. I can't actually remember if she has the “ice queen” moniker, but I don't believe she does. What makes this one so great for me is the many layers to her character and it is definitely the best case of Daphne character development in any story I've read.

For Wormtail, I second Prince of Slytherin for all the reasons already mentioned. linkffn(11191235)

Also, see the above link for a very interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, definitely OOC, but I enjoy him nonetheless.

Harry Potter: Harry Potter and Delphini Riddle: A Matrimony Made For Peace. linkffn(10205249) I may get nuked for this since it contains a character from the most hated Harry Potter work ever, The Cursed Child. I promise you though, it does not use ANYTHING from that play. It is set in Harry's sixth year. It's not a perfect fic by any means, but I think this is one of the most accurate portrayals of Harry ever written, and I actually love Delphini's character as well, so I won't add her as her own character as I haven't read enough fics of her to tell, but this is my favourite portrayal of her that I have read. Another fair warning though, it's also unfinished.

Draco and Lucius Malfoy: Travel Secrets Series by E4mj. linkffn(9622538) linkffn(966829) linkffn(10139565) To be fair, I'm not really sure if this is my favourite, but I think it is DEFINITELY the most accurate one I've read. Draco is still kind of pathetic, and doesn't play a huge role, but I think it's a good story for what would have happened if he had a contender for power in Slytherin.

Tom Riddle (not Voldemort, Tom Riddle) En Passant linkffn(10857053)

Also unfinished, but this one NAILED TMR!

I could go on for other characters but I'll leave it here. Also, if you disagree, I'd be happy to discuss, but no attacks please.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.
