I am looking for a long/long fanfic that features either a trio pairing of Hermione/Snape and Lucius or Hermione/Lucius. I seem to be drawn to these three whenever I can find a story about them and I particularly love when there is a hint of darkness involved (particularly if it is in the lemons/smut!) Any help?

they dont get together till the very end, which is great because I dislike most pairings. The rest of the story is pretty funny
