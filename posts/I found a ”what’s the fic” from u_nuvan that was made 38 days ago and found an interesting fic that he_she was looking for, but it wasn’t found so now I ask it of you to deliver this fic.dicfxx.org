:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So this is what [[/u/nuvan][u/nuvan]] asked for and had said that had read but couldn't remember the name

”the second one was set in the afterlife, I believe a lot of the plot was Harry getting to know his family. Maybe they were reviewing the events of his life? I seem to recall that people had their own houses, and I think Hermione was some sort of guide? It's not the one with the toasters I'm pretty sure.”

The first fic nuvan asked for was linkffn(three to backstep) btw

That's what nuvan said and it interested me and because that post didn't result in the fic being found or linked, I decided to ask it again as the post is over a month old at this point and the fic sounded interesting

Thank you if you can identify or link the fic

Credit for the quoted stuff is to [[/u/nuvan][u/nuvan]]


** I think I understand what you're saying, but I'm mostly confused. Was the fic in question found or not, because I'm getting mixed messages here.

*** The OP asked for two fics. One was found I guess, the other was apparently intriguing enough for someone to ask again since no one found it.

That's my understanding at least.

Rationalize this, then.

***** They found not the fic itself but the elements described within the lost fic to be interesting, but it wasn't found. It's poorly worded I'll give you that, but it can make sense.

*** The lost fic I'm looking for is, a fic that was set in the afterlife with Hermione being the guide and Harry getting to know his family, they were also going through Harrys lifes events and nuvan clarified that it was not the one with the toasters and that they had houses

Nuvan speculated a lot of it so that could be the reason for it to be hard to understand

** Unfortunately no luck yet. I've occasionally gone off on half-hearted hunts for it, but my memory of the details is - as noted - somewhat hazy, so I don't hold out a lot of hope for finding it. Maybe someday.
