  involves taking over a secondary school.
#+end_quote

To be fair, there are several reasons taking Hogwarts would be worthwhile and important. First, assuming he's still alive, taking Hogwarts is synonymous with either killing Dumbledore or almost entirely destroying his power base. Second, it's arguably /the/ cultural center of Wizarding Britain and the safest place in the country. Taking it over is a major signal of strength to friend and foe alike, as well as to the international community. Third, literally every magical child in the country goes to school there: purebloods, halfbloods, muggleborns (which also apparently includes a master list of every muggleborn in the country), the children of his allies and the children of his enemies. Controlling Hogwarts would give him incredible control of the country through the children, especially paired with control over the government. Parents would have to choose between sending their children to school, which would put them directly under Voldemort's control and force their parents into good behavior, and keeping them home, depriving their children of an education (which will hurt his enemies long term both because these children will likely be weaker in the future and won't have as many bonds with other children that are also likely to grow up to be his enemies), marking themselves as non-supporters, and putting their children in danger. Long term it would mean controlling the abilities and education of new witches and wizards, as well.

******* About the fact it's a pseudo-military school, or the outcome if Voldemort comes to control it. If it's the former, I don't really understand why. I mean they do learn some dangerous spells there, but it's magic, it's difficult to see it as horrifying when literally every magical person can learn things like the AK curse after(or even during) school. It's a community which has control over an aspect of creation itself. When the alternative is basically an unstable magical with little control over magic, i'd choose the former.

***************** Yeah, she's said some hilarious stuff over the years that people jump on her for. Everyone's just so sensitive about how a series written for teens can't grow and become darker, when the series already does. The reason Harry Potter was such a phenomenon was because you could be sure the first few books wouldn't fuck up your kid, but as the kid grew the themes in the books did too. It's perfect for all ages because the younger readers who aren't cynical yet can pick the first few as their favorites and those of us who are cynical but want an engaging story even if it is emotionally painful to read, can pick the last few as our favourite. And GoF is a nice bridge to drive home that Harry has to grow up to face harsher threats like a resurrected Voldemort and corrupted stupid Politicians.

I'm pretty sure Dumbledore didn't tell more people so he could Reveal Harry's status as a Horcrux at the perfect time to Harry, at exactly the right moment to ensure Harry died by Voldemort's wand and none others.

That was crucial to fulfill the Prophecy, everything after that, (Harry coming Back and actually winning) was pure, dumb Potter Luck and a reservoir of Magical Power so significant that it could Equal Lord Voldemort.

***** Probably cause Snape couldn't overtly begin conversion attempts, when he was first hired he was young and probably not very good at manipulation like he was before his death. Think of it this way, the easiest way to convert everyone would be to begin with the first years, but if you can't start trying to convert the first years because the other six years will object and pressure the newbies into believing the blood-prejudice anyway, how was he meant to make any progress?

One could argue that as the older years leave the problem would fix itself, but the new firsties would just get blasted with watered-down blood prejudice from the attempt at conversion the previous year, and then the next would get watered down, and so on. That would take generations of dedication and full-time attention, that Snape cannot offer.

With the existing horrific lack of balance between the numbers of students and the lack of teachers, even the most conversion-driven Snape (which is not what Canon Snape is) would have years of horrifically hard work ahead of him, and the timeframe between when he could even start the conversions and when we see the canon events is a decade at most, and that's only assuming that Snape began teaching the year directly following the Potter Family's death, which is unlikely, as he got his Potions Mastery which probably takes a little while.

With Dumbledore not just outright refusing to have a Slytherin house anymore, the cesspool of the Snake-Den is self-replicating and self-continuing.

*** -Having his first Horcrux set up to seek out and draw attention to the only source of Horcrux destroying basilisk venom in the entire country

-Hiding another Horcrux in the middle of Hogwarts, in a room that opens to anyone who needs it

-Sending a Horcrux on assassination missions

-Hiding another Horcrux in the house where his mother lived..... his name is an anagram, it's not that hard to figure out his parentage

-The sea cave would have been the only decently secured Horcrux location, if he hadn't completely forgotten to block elf magic

-Not preparing for the possibility of death and instructing death eaters to immediately perform the resurrection ritual with everything prepared already, he could've been back a week after dying if he had properly prepared everything for the resurrection ritual

-Literally acting like a villain from a kids book... That's not how you get the support of the majority of the population, and without that it's hard to permanently rule

-Not knowing about cerberi and music. That bit of information is even in muggle legends, it can't be that difficult to come across.

-Why was the Triwizard cup portkey two directional?

**** I'll bite.

- He had hidden his first horcrux. The skill piece inside was 15 years old, arguably not the most strategic of thinkers. Then again, he very nearly gained a body except a 12 year old improbably killed the giant murder snake which is conveniently the horcrux's one weakness.

- it went undiscovered for 40 years. It was literally an extremely durable self protecting needle in a haystack.

- not a mistake at all, appears to be a very effective method. Murder in the middle of the center of government? Without getting caught OR linked to? Yeah that sounds effective.

- the location was a poor strategic choice yes. Can't really defend that decision.

- there's not enough information about house elf magic to make a judgement call here, for all you know elf magic cannot be blocked full stop.

- that would require trusting his followers when he knows full well what kind of people they are

- he is literally a villain from a kids book, idk what you want from him

- ignorance is an opportunity for improvement, not a mistake. It's the default state, and everybody misses some things.

- because Deus ex machina.

Most of your issues are with Rowling's live of deus ex machina. The series should be named Harry Potter and the Yearly Deus ex Machina.
