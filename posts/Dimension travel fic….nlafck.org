:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I recall a fic in which Harry travels dimensions, lands up in one with a GWL, And a Daphne/Susan/Mrs Granger who saw him in their dreams and connect with him because of that...?

Any ideas? I know these are common tropes, but I'm fairly certain there is only the one fic like this?


** I could be completely wrong since it's been quite a while but the rose paradox. Note that from what I remember it was a smut fic more or less. I lost interest and skipped most of it but I vaguely remember the daphne/Susan parts

Edit yup it fits the dreams part at least [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14376795/chapters/33193338]]

*** Hmm, you might be right. I don't remember whether it was a smutfic or not, but I distinctly remember the whole Daphne/Susan bits.

I'll give it a read, prolly will skip over the smut to see if that's the one. Thanks!
