Canon Dumbledore, a symbol for good in the magical world, has some really obvious faults as written. But still, people have done Good/Light/Competent Dumbledore fics before. Some of them are very well done and logical, but still have to be at least a little AU because of the repair work required on his canon actions. That's fine, expected even. I'm not talking about "secret chapters" or strictly canon, zero-world-building stories here.

Taking that as an example of the general idea, does anyone know of fics focusing on, or prominently featuring, a magical culture and society that was /specifically/ a place where things worked and were relatively positive? This would be a world where people were mostly Good, Light even.

Canon coverage of the magical world itself is spotty at best, so this is another good area to work on in fanfiction. But most of the time, magical society (when it is even discussed) is either completely AU (ignoring canon entirely) or an Ãœber-Dark horror show that claims to be what was "really happening" behind the scenes. That's not what I'm looking for here.

So, how about links to existing stories that present a more logical, well-explored, and overall /nice/ magical world? Any ideas people have on the subject are also welcome. Big bonus points for specifically canon-compliant Good/Light/Competent magical Britain stories and ideas.

I know there's a lot more of the Dark stories, but that's not what I'm looking for here. If you've got a really awesome and unique counterexample, then sure, drop it on us. But I'm not really interested in another rehashing of the DLP lists and "Dark!Harry" C2s on FFN. I'm hoping to find some new gems here, stories with a different angle than the standard fannon tropes.

--------------

*tl;dr:* The canon magical world is ill-defined. In most fics that focus on the world outside of Hogwarts, it is a shitty place to live. Anyone have fics about a sane and nice magical Britain that are still mostly based on canon?


** That's a rather tall order, considering that the /one/ function that the Ministry of Magic performs with nearly flawless competence in all conditions --- even civil war --- is finding, controlling, and mindwiping people who happened to have been born without the ability to do magic, but who then saw, heard, or otherwise experienced something that they should not have. (For a Fridge Horror, consider that /someone/ made the Muggle PM's subordinates think that the invasion of the giants was a natural disaster. Covering up something that huge would have required cooperation from the Ministry. This means that, even while fighting against the giants, the Ministry must have also been intervening on their behalf to prevent Muggles from responding [1], because Statute of Secrecy takes precedence over everything.)

And, their preferred form of lawful punishment is subjecting the convict to years of exposure to creatures that basically make the convict experience the most unpleasant thoughts and feelings that the convict is capable of conceiving of experiencing, while robbing the convict of any positive ones. In other words, they are subjected to individually tailored and optimized psychological torture, not to mention general prison conditions.

Those two issues alone make for a pretty big hole to climb out of in creating a kinder, gentler wizarding Britain. A lot of writers make wizarding United States out to be some sort of utopia, but very little of that fic is any good.

[1] I don't want to start a Wizards vs. Muggles debate, so I will say outright that, despite having a pro-Muggle bias, I freely concede that there is very little the Muggle military could do against trained, wanded wizards. (Muggle-wizard combined arms, on the other hand...) Giants, however, cannot Apparate, and being big is a /disadvantage/ in modern warfare.

Not actually proven, but could be implied by context. Also seems to beg the question and doesn't logically immediately follow, but I'll wait on that.

#+begin_quote
  ...is finding, controlling, and mind-wiping people who happened to have been born without the ability to do magic, but who then saw, heard, or otherwise experienced something that they should not have.
#+end_quote

That last bit, "experienced something that they should not have" seems sort of scary when stated like that, and is emotionally evocative to the imaginative "Muggle" reader, but this level of implied severity isn't supported in canon. The closest relatives of magicals seem allowed a pass, which is oddly permissive for a truly draconian policy.

The Dersleys are not clearly "controlled" in any way, nor are Hermione's parents, after all. And the Muggle PM isn't under any obviously stated control until possibly book seven. Rather, he appears to be simply another political contact for the Minister for Magic, and one rarely used in recent years. There may also be other people so informed, as that isn't ever given as a formally stated and iron-clad rule. Here you're stating it as being stronger than it ever is in canon.

Now is this behavior immoral? Yes, clearly. Worse than allowing a possible genocide to occur (as this is implied as their reason)? Surely not. Better than draconian and isolationist laws for Magicals that are even worse than the canon ones Harry encounters? Very debatable.

I am strongly in favor of not mind-wiping people, personally, but it isn't stretching my credulity that there could be situations where it would be the best possible action that could be taken. The type of emotional arguments like, "but I wouldn't want it to happen to me if I found out about magic," isn't significant either, especially if the alternatives is one of the worst global genocides ever. This is not a clear and straight-forward moral black hole.

#+end_quote

Correction: it being the preferred one is not strongly supported in canon. The death penalty is used only rarely it seems, and the fines mentioned for Arthur's flying car are surely widespread as in the real world, but no preferences for the numerical majority of crimes is strongly stated in canon. We don't hear specifically about misdemeanors, unless Harry's and Arthur's experiences were classed as such. And Harry wasn't actually in danger of Azkaban in canon for his actions, remember. That's all fanon.

But again, immoral? Yes. Worse than western methods in the real world? Almost certainly. It isn't shown that there are any other ways to imprison moderate numbers of prisoners possessing magic, though. The only other threats to a wizard's personal freedom appears to be another apparently unique prison, Nurmengard -- which is outside of magical British control (and which Voldemort also broke into) -- or the death penalty.

As for the effects, insta-insanity from Azkaban is entirely fanon as well. Some suggest that prisoners "go insane" very quickly, but this seems to be a casual use of the term by certain characters and is not supported by canon events. Hagrid survives more than a month of it, as does Mundungus, with no given long-term effects. The imprisoned Death Eaters seem sane enough (relatively speaking) afterward as well. No one comments on how much crazier they are, at least. Not even Bellatrix, the canonically most crazy of them, seems to be very different.

As bad as it might be, and it is bad, it isn't something that makes everyone in wizarding society who doesn't actively fight against it's existence into an irredeemable monster.

Those are big problems, though I didn't ask for either kinder or gentler specifically. All you'd actually need is for the /reasons/ not to be horrible, and for people to be working to make things better. Don't be blinded by a decade of Dark Lord Potter, Azkaban-fic trope circle-jerking. That is all /entirely/ fanon.

Canon Obliviations don't cause permanent insanity or death, and neither does Azkaban. I don't think either of these automatically put magical Britain beyond the moral event horizon, either by themselves or combined. As I read it, even the presented arguments from canon do not do a good job of supporting those features of magical Britain being irredeemably monstrous.

**** I concede that I was being at least a little dramatic, and you make a lot of good points. (Yes, of course there are fines as well as prison sentences in the wizarding world, and they may well punish with fines some crimes that Muggles punish with prison, which would make their justice system more humane.)

But, I think that you've put some words in my mouth here and there --- like the whole "insta-insanity" thing, which is not something I'd said or implied; nor did I ever say or imply anything about everybody in the wizarding society who doesn't fight against Azkaban's existence being an irredeemable monster. Please don't do that.

I had a rebuttal written out, but then I realized that I really don't want to get into this debate, because it wouldn't fun (at least not for me); nor very constructive. So, I'll just say that you are right, it may well be the case that all the alternatives are worse, but I don't see that sort of attitude in canon. In some sense, tweaking the world to make Azkaban and Obliviation necessary makes the wizarding world even more grimdark. :P

I am more partial to Dark Lady Granger, actually, in case it's not obvious from my other posts. Nor have I read much Azkaban fic; though, I do remember one from my intemperate youth where Hermione was 'shipped with a Dementor. I can't remember whether she had little Dementorlets.

***** I didn't mean to ascribe anything to you other than the lines I quoted. The rest is just trope rejection. Sorry if it seemed otherwise.

For example, canon actually implies that people don't last more than a few months before becoming insane, whatever that means. A lot of writers run with that. But that doesn't actually make sense, even just with what we see in canon. So again, that doesn't mean anything was directed at you, specifically, other than the direct replies to quotes.

In total agreement here. You can still have a beacon of light in a world of darkness, though. Not everything has to be Warhammer 40K levels of hopeless.

Ah, this might be the problem. I've read far, far too much DLP and Azkaban stuff. If you weren't as aware of those stories and their... problems with canon, you might think I was specifically talking about what you were saying since it was in that direction along the spectrum.

I hope that clears things up a bit, as I wouldn't want to cause undue offense to someone debating in good faith who didn't deserve it.

Fair enough. At the same time, almost everyone we've seen spend time in Azkaban and emerge alive has had some mitigating circumstance:

- Sirius had an animagus form, and his memory of his innocence was an /unhappy/ one.
- Hagrid, my fanfic idea on the other thread notwithstanding, is a half-giant, and he has inherited some magic resistance and general resilience from them, and being only a suspect, he may have been housed farther away from the Dementors. (Also, Dumbledore might have pulled strings to accomplish that.)
- The thoughts of Death Eaters relevant to Deatheatering tend to be ones of malice, and Dementors --- who switched sides to Voldemort's --- may have been sympathetic to them, anyway.
- Mundungus Fletcher, I don't have a specific explanation for, but I, for one, think that Dementors would have found him distasteful. Also, even if exposure to them reduced him to a pathetic, snivelling shell of a man, who'd be able to tell the difference? :P

And it isn't. The thing is, what you are asking for is more than a beacon of light. It's general illumination. Like I'd said, not impossible, but a tall order.

Really? I thought the DarkLordPotter.net people tended to be very much into celebrating the wizards' cultural and other superiority. (I do lurk their forums pretty consistently.) Or, do you mean Dark!Harry in general? (Also, when you say "Azkaban", do you mean fics where we get to visit it, or do you mean Caer Azkaban?)

The boosting focus, in my experience, is on those fix-fic-ing things so Slytherin are (at best) "harsh but fair" in their rule of the ignorant plebs, or AUs on how all the "good" guys in government are wrong for various reasons and deserve their grisly, gray super Harry fates. Things are gritty and "real," which usually means corruption and vice, not effective government for the people, by the people. There are a lot of Dark Harry characters there as well. So really both.

My problem with this is, it is almost always so /forced/, as if to excuse the fact that they're writing Harry Potter fanfic. It seems compensatory, much of the time, and often directly mocks canon instead of presenting a logical and well-structured story that stands on it's own. I enjoy the exceptions a lot, but they're usually not about the government itself and certainly aren't filled with happy people.

#+begin_quote
  Also, when you say "Azkaban", do you mean fics where we get to visit it, or do you mean Caer Azkaban?
#+end_quote

On the right track. I meant, fics where someone goes to Azkaban and it changes them, usually into another entire personality who is now "edgy" and Dark.

**** Agreed. Seems to me, magicals could murder any single Muggle if they wanted to and never be caught. That's about it. Blink-Apparition combat and all battlefield magic is as non-canon as "warp strafing" (look it up), but certain implied canon effects could be force multipliers. It would require knowledge of the Muggle world that isn't apparently common for even half-bloods, though. Or cruelty and civilian causalities that would be worse than any war in history.

The main problem with sneaky magical's strategies is that they barely know what electric stoves are and don't seem to know there even is a Muggle PM -- how would they know who the head of the British Armed Forces is, or that there even is such a position to assassinate or mind-control?

When it comes right down to it, even just the British military could take 10:1 casualties and still "win." You'd need crafty Muggle-born plans or immediate total war tactics (like poisoning water supplies) to win an actual war as the magicals. And even that might be a Pyrrhic victory.

Consider: the magical's population is /tiny/, but no one we meet in canon seems to know anyone involved in producing any consumer goods (other than, strangely, Ollivander and his continental competitor). Worse, where do the basics come from? Where does the cotton, silk, and flax come from for clothing? The metals for kitchenware and cauldrons? Are there "hidden" magical farms and mines somewhere? Better be hidden from both paper and electronic county records and missile strikes. The economy of the magical world is clearly linked in some way to the Muggle, possibly intimately. That opens up lots of vulnerabilities to magical Britain.

**** I think you underestimate just how effective that guerilla war would be. Between disillusionment, apparition, memory charms, house elf help, silencing spells, curses and magical poisons, a small team of aurors or hit wizards could assassinate muggle leadership at a blinding unstoppable pace. Apparate kill apparate. Hiding would be useless as any channel of communication could be exploited by mind arts or truth serum. The PM, MPs, and the top several hundred ranking military officers could be killed in a couple of weeks. Sabotage could be equally effective a simple spell or two could completely destroy a tank or plane or even aircraft carrier. Even full scale civilian attacks would be unstoppable. Fiendfyre in downtown London?

And forget trying to strike back. Say the magical folk use Hogwarts as a base, Muggles cant find it and even if they could its unplottable. Meanwhile the attacks keep coming. There is no defence. Calling that level of complete militaristic domination "guerilla warfare" is a very misleading understatement.

Perhaps in an open field setting where wizards are limited to purely offensive spells-no invisibility, apparition, shielding, ect.-then the muggle's numbers and offensive technology would carry the day. However, those types of battles wouldn't be fought as there is no reason for the magical folk to engage in such a situation.

***** The effectiveness really dwindles the moment the muggle world realizes magic is real and they're under attack, which will happen pretty quickly with the tactics you're talking about. Someone is going to make a mistake and leave a witness, get captured, etc. It doesn't matter how powerful magic is, they're still human and someone is going to screw up. Once they're revealed, they'll still be able to cause a lot of damage, but they'll be fighting a losing battle. The magical population is tiny compared to the muggle and bullets will kill them just as effectively. You're also forgetting the muggleborns, at least some of them would side with the muggles and would be able to provide magical assistance and advice on how to deal with magical attacks. All you need is one muggleborn directing them and the military could reduce Hogwarts to a fine powder without needing to be able to see it.

** A happy utopian world where everything works doesn't leave much room for conflict to drive a plot, which is probably a big reason you don't see it often in fiction or fan-fic. (Iain M Banks' Culture series maybe comes closest.)

You are taking "nice" and "works" to mean no effort is required and no tough decisions that hurt people badly ever have to be made. So, I'm not really looking for a Utopia. As for your point about conflict, I think fannon has simply fallen into a rut with respect to that aspect of canon and isn't being at all imaginative. But let's handle that case in detail, assuming it is really a Utopia.

--------------

Just so we're on the same page, there are four [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_(narrative)][generally accepted primary "types" of conflicts]]. I prefer to organize it by wider thematic element as:

1) conflict from within your society -- the police think you are guilty of a murder you didn't commit, and you were framed by a man with one leg

2) conflict from outside your society -- Russia invades and your plucky band of high schoolers needs to band together to fight them

3) conflict from being outside the social context (outer space or nature itself) -- plane crash in the wilderness leaves you to survive with just a hatchet

4) conflict from the self (primarily internal motivations) -- you just discovered you have an identical twin, and now want more than anything to get your estranged parents back together

Virtually all stories fit into categories likes these (or the other set). Mine do a better job, in my opinion obviously, of not overlapping like the Wikipedia list does.

--------------

Now, even in the extreme case of a Utopia, that only wipes out the first one: conflicts from within your society. Or, in the other categorization set, Man against Society.

You can still be invaded by forces outside your nation or society. Muggles would count, in my book, as would Voldemort -- seeing as he has removed himself from magical society and has even fled from death itself.

You could still have to deal with a night in the Forbidden Forest, or survive an island with terrifying monsters. You could even argue that being stranded in the Muggle world would be wilderness survival for a pure-blood.

And finally, you could have a flawed character working against the horrors of his upbringing, struggling with his personal problems with classes and classmates, and finding himself while also trying to find a way to kill an unkillable Dark Lord.

A Utopia where the Ministry doesn't allow people to die in easy to prevent accidents, get thrown into Azkaban without trial, or killed in a Muggle witch-hunt war could clearly still be a place where drama and conflict occurs.
