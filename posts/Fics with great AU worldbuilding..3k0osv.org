I've just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686394/1/Hell-Eyes]] which has fantastic worldbuilding. It's so AU that it isn't really fanfiction, it's an original piece of fiction with a protagonist called Harry. I loved it as it was a breath of fresh air and would love to read more in a similar vein.


** linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is very AU, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Be warned, however, that it looks to be discontinued.

I also recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the beginning of Hogwarts Battle School, as there are some similarities in that Hogwarts has rankings etc.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Good AU worldbuilding but more in background of the story but lots of interesting magical theory, Female!Harry linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)

Also there's linkffn(Wastelands Of Time) where Harry is stuck in a timeloop and discovers lost magic and ancient misteries

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.
