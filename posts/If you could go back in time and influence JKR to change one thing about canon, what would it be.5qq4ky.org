She made Ginny into Harry's soulmate, and yet refused to give her a big role. It was a contradiction in itself. Hermione and Ron each appeared roughly 7000 times in the series, Ginny only about 800 times. This discrepancy for a supposedly important character is simply too big. Ginny especially got short changed in Book 7, 100 more pages (would still be shorter than OoTP) about what happened at Hogwarts would go a long way to improve her standing among readers.

** My biggest issue with the book is the Slytherin house or rather how it is viewed. Imagine being isolated, ostracized and hated on. They put a hat on your head to decide whether you would be good or evil at a young age of 11.

So if I had the choice I wouldn't make everything so Black and White. Slytherin might have a bad reputation but Slytherin wouldn't be synonymous for evil. It really bothers me that no one from Slytherin stayed behind to fight. How is that even possible? Some may argue that Rowling changed her mind later and gave an interview but to me only the books are canon. We don't really know much about anyone from Slytherin besides a few people and they are all used to display prejudices.

Secondly, I'd like to know more about other characters besides the trio. Maybe Harry should increase his social-circle. Maybe branch out? idk.

Thirdly, I never really understood the conflict in the books. It doesn't make sense. From what I have gathered the Purebloods already have power. I can understand that they don't want Muggleborns in their society. But why would they try to achieve that through an armed struggle? Wouldn't passing legislation favoriing purebloods better further their agenda? I mean they were already doing that though? With the ministry being corrupt. So why the armed struggle?

These are my main issues with the book.

I just remembered, another thing I dislike about the book is how much luck was involved. I don't know if Dumbledore had a bit of Trelwaney in him... but I doubt he was a seer. So how sure was he that his plan would work? If Voldemort did find out about the Horcruxes then it would have been very easy for him to get them and throw them somewhere in the sea. Harry did cut it pretty close in canon. Voldemort does find out after the Goblet, A lot could have gone wrong with Dumbledore's plan and it did. So it was just luck that everything worked out and that's is my issue. It could have ended in a tragedy just as easily. Harry Potter was supposed to die.

It was only the current generation in canon we didn't see producing anything other than black (or at best Grey) Slytherins.

For my own part I always wanted there to have been a much clearer redemption of Draco - a moment he CHOSE to be better/different rather than simply failing to pull off being evil. As it stands now I feel the epilogue implies that nothing has changed and history is doomed to repeat itself. If we had a clear "breaking of the cycle" with either Slytherin as a whole, or simply Draco as a figurehead breaking with the traditional perception of what it is to be Slytherin I would have had more hope.

Don't think of the Purebloods as one unified group. There are Purebloods in power and there are purebloods not in power. There are even Purebloods that have some power but want more. There are factions. And Voldemort was recruiting from those groups that were unsatisfied with their place, from second and third sons of Pureblood families who would never inherit the estate or the Wizengamot seat, from families that had been politically outmanoeuvred and lacked the power they felt they deserve. He gave them a scapegoat they could blame all the ills in their lives on, the Muggleborn who was promoted for competence over the /proper/ deserving person, the Halfblood who built their business with their own hands and took customers away from the ill-managed floundering Pureblood-owned shop.

They never had enough sway that they could dictate the laws.

It wouldn't be a problem it was a good ending but the epilogue came of as underwhelming to an amazing series. I feel like Harry still would have other great adventures after defeating Voldemort that J.K. Should have left the story open-ended. Plus the epilogue sort of implies that nothing has really change in the magical world. Prejudice is still present in their society and wizards still abuse magic on muggles (referring to Ron admitting to confounding a tester to get his muggle license)

3. Remove inconsistencies with the Trace, don't let Tom Riddle avoid it just by using a different wand, and don't let it screw over Harry whenever you feel it's convenient.

4. This one comes off directly from #3, so no Flight of the 7 Potters nonsense. If you want to kill off Hedwig and Moody, at least do it in a more convincing way.

We do know, (as [[/u/wordhammer][u/wordhammer]] said) that the trace works on the person rather than the wand and even during the events of Harry's story it is fairly imprecise, only showing that “oh, in this place there's some magic used and there's some underage wizard/witch nearby”; the only reason it was possible for anyone in the ministry to blame Dobby's magic on Harry was the lack of any other juvenile wizards (or witches) in the area.

And consider this, though: We don't know the exact state of the wizarding world and the trace during Tom's youth, and for all we know a delayed action might have been all they could have done. Alternatively, they knew the Gaunts in some way or form and thought it best to wait until whatever happened ended.

With that, they'd arrive later, knowing that /spells/ had been used and /maybe/ knowing that there were unforgivables amongst them and again /maybe/ knowing what those were. Since the Priori Incantato spell only shows the last spell cast with a wand, with only one wand (Morfin's) they didn't really have a way to check if he was the one casting all the spells or only the last one; for all they knew, it might have been that some underage wizard just happened to be nearby when Morfin went on a rampage, and since there weren't wizards living there other than the Gaunts and Tom's connection to them nobody knew it wasn't like anyone would think it Tom's doing.

No we don't.

In Dobby's case Harry's wand was in the cupboard - very close to the spell he cast.

It may even be that the trace is on both the person and their wand together, rather than either individually, and stops working if the two are separated.

** I have a few options, if it was a matter of editorial influence:

- Have Hermione discover the Time Turner in some tricky mystery thing, and that changing Sirius' fate is what breaks the thing.

- Make the Goblet of Fire the trophy of the Tournament, a Divination device of ancient reputation that is held by the winning school until the next Tournament

- Show the Order being active and useful, even if they are defeated half the time (unable to keep Voldemort from breaking out his allies in Azkaban; losing Amelia Bones)

But of late I think the greatest mistake she made was having Ron betray Harry's trust in 4th year; it was out of character- in fact, it broke his character for the rest of the series. If Ron had stayed a stand-up loyal friend all the way through, people wouldn't be half as bent out of shape about him and Hermione getting together. He should have been a bro- the getaway guy; the one who gets Harry access to information about their culture in a way as cool as the twins.

** I would remove the repeated references in HBP to Harry struggling with magic. They don't really add anything to the story and rather give the impression that Harry has barely learnt anything all year, which is rather depressing given that he's just found out that the outcome of the war rests on him. His complete failure with non-verbal spells is particularly annoying given that previously we had seen repeated examples of him having strong willpower and focus.

It's just a few sentences here and there but I think removing them would have a disproportionately positive effect on my opinion of HBP.

This is especially true given that he opens DH casting a load of spells we never saw him learn in HBP, meaning he was studying defensive magic during that year. It just never got mentioned.

** I think I've always been pretty upfront with being in the pro-Snape camp, but I DO understand why and how people remain so firmly set against him.

To that end, while my preference would be for him not to die and have to learn to live in a world without Voldemort (and his downfall) as a focal point for his life, and hopefully become a "better" and more whole person.

I acknowledge this is a bridge too far for many.

In that instance, I would have liked for him to die later (albeit probably not by much) but long enough for say, a hidden stash of his memories (put away in case of his death) to be discovered while the trio search for the Horcruxes in the castle.

This would have allowed an informed Harry to have a moment where he and Snape could meet with each knowing the whole story and hash things out. Either make a peace (or not). Which (to my mind) would have been a more honest and truthful forgiveness (or not) than one given after death when it's easy to do because you aren't confronted with the reality of that person anymore.

You gotta be kidding me. I think you are actually quite racist because you basically implied that all red-haired women must look alike.

In the Books, there were NOTHING that showed Ginny and Lily resembling each other: Ginny had flaming red hair, Lily dark red; Ginny was said to be 'short', Lily most likely not; They definitely had different facial features too.

Flitwick, McGonagall, Remus, Sirius, and Snape all knew Lily well, if Ginny looked so much like Lily as you said, why wouldn't anyone of them make a comment? These people had spent enough time with Ginny and Harry.

In fact, if there was ONE PERSON among Harry's friends who resembled his mother the most, it was HERMIONE: Muggleborn, bookish, studious, smart, headgirl material, had strong sense of justice, and hell of a temper.

Yes, that's a (wrong) opinion, not a fact.

Ginny is more of a "normal" ginger, and Lily has dark red hair. In addition, there is allusion to Ginny having freckles, which isn't the case for Lily, Lily having green eyes and Ginny having brown, and Lily being taller than Ginny.

Even according to the Oedipal theory, this would be wrong, because according to it it develops between the ages of three to six - in the phallic stage. Harry was one year old when he lost his mother.

****** If you're talking about Fluffy they could just play music since they did that anyway. The plan in first year wasn't terrible. If I sounded pretentious I didn't mean to.

I'm saying that their plans weren't good. The second year they barely tried telling a teacher (Who wasn't Lockhart, don't know why they told him anyway since he thought he was an idiot). Then Harry & Ron decide that the best course of action is going into the old chamber with a snake that they know will be large and can kill with it's eyes.

Third year was okay since the first part of it happened out of chance and they didn't really have a chance to do anything else. Though they could have planned a bit more since they had time-travel before going back in time.

Fourth year, he tries to out-fly a dragon (and admittedly succeeds). Second task don't have anything against the plan (Though I do have against the people runnning the tournament, they made it sound like whoever was down there would be left there forever. They are running a competition where challengers can die, why would the students expect that there friends wouldn't have the possibility of dying too.) Third task, I thought Harry was competitive though I don't see anything wrong with him taking the cup with Cedric.

Fifth year, they literally named their group "Dumbledore's Army", which isn't the best thing to do when Umbridge was already looking for excuses, and left all the people's names on a list (correct me if it was disguised or something). In fifth year (later in the year) they did what I said in my last message, which even if they couldn't floo there (The Minister did, but also of course he is the Minister). Of course its weird that the order appeared after they'd already gotten there. (Not saying manipulative Dumbledore like some stories, but it was just for the plot.)

** Severus/Hermione would be cannon.

Edit: Okay, I kept a straight face about that for precisely 2 minutes. Sermione is a whimsy, a desire founded and propagated on the fandom that would have ruined Rowling's publications due to condoning a teacher/student relationship. A hint toward it would have been lovely, but doesn't fit the publication and would honestly have completely changed the story. Really, I would want Severus to have stayed alive - for the same reasons that Rowling wanted Hermione and Ron together - but he honestly would have lead a miserable half life. Death was the best thing for him, though the death of his old life would have been better instead of his entire life - that wasn't in the cards for him without some sort of happy piece to his life. Really, really, I would obliterate the epilogue from memory. If it hadn't existed there would have probably been a lot more inventive FanFictions at the beginning, and the pairings wouldn't have generally been confined to cannon for so long. For the most part, I agree with the nit picks of all the other commenters. The time turner was used wrong, very wrong. Harry was not psychologically abused or disturbed, at least to the extent that not being loved and being called 'freak' should have left him. Ron shouldn't have given in to his jealousy and then returned when he saw the dragon, Hermione is alive - he should have know what sort of events would be a part of the competition before hand, especially with him wanting to enter. Plus, Harry is always in danger. Always. And, the magic in the series has come to run me the wrong way. Voldemort discovered a way to obtain immortality in /school/ that we have to assume no one else ever found and used. We have to assume that the only reason Harry actually won was because he has been fighting all his life, Voldemort was weakened due to the death of 6/7th of his soul and he is a child of prophecies and thus essentially inherently a Demi-God of some sort. And Flamel! He just /died/ right? Well, if I knew the secret to the stone I would make another for safe keeping and if I was 600+ years old I would probably have enough common sense to send a duplicate and, would be magically and intellectually superior and thus probably capable of /leaving the planet/ if I was being hunted down and didn't want to fight back or interfere in the lives of mere /mortals/.

**** It is certainly a pairing that grew on me, like a parasite that won't let go any more than the series will. I tried not to like them at first, the rational part of my brain knew there was something intrinsically wrong with the former student and teacher falling in love. All the same, if they hadn't been in that position we might have been presented with the story of characters like Jane Eyre and Rochester, a man more than twice her age, who fall in love due to their character. I won't try and rationalize it, but I will point out that a majority of the well-composed SSHG fics are post-Hogwarts or overly rationalized. The community isn't about the teacher/student relationship, it's about the common ground between them and overcoming societies definitions of normal to be happy. At least, that's how I see it most days.

"In my opinion"

The way that Madam Rowling put Ginny and Harry together was completely wrong, there was no build up, no emotion until HBP.

Hell, even Cho Chang had more of a build up when Harry and her were a item!

I mean Neville and Ginny were a date at the Yule Ball, so surely she could have kept them together after that instead of making Ginny date more blokes than the average IQ of Gryffindor House

******* Yeah but what I dislike about Ginny is that she acts like a slag when she dates dudes. Her and Ron. Maybe it's a Weasley trait as I remember Molly mentioning they once was caught by the old Game Keeper as well. But both Ginny and Ron's extreme public displays of affection put me off. I'm just glad Harry and Hermione didn't act like that when they were dating Victor and Cho.

The only other that would possibly count is that time Ron and Harry stumbled on her and Dean in a secret passageway. With her and Michael Corner, she didn't do any or Ron would've known they were dating before being told. So yeah...
