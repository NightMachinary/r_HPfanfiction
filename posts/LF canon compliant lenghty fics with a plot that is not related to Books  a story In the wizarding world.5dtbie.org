I think the title is clear. It can me in the futur, but it need to be true with the canon ( pottermore included).

If possible a story that is not related to schooling or Hogwart. I want to discover the adult world, what are wizard doing when they're are not teenager anymore ?

Iniating travel ?

Thanks


** I haven't read them but I believe that is what the Alexandra Quick series is about.
