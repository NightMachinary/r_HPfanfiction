Harry got in trouble in CoS for using magic even though it was Dobby who did it. In OotP the Order used magic inside the house. Tonks packs Harry's stuff up with magic. So given that Harry ignored their warning given after the use of Patronus the Ministry punishes Harry.


** You know that's a real good point
