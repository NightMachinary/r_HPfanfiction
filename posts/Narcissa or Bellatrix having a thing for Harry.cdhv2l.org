Though i would prefer an AU Bella lives and possible no war Fic. At some ocassion, lets say Draco invites Harry to his home (they might not exactly be friends, but also no Canon enemies) and one of the 2 Woman see him and try to tempt him, when they are alone. I would like lots of sexual tension and possibly even interaction.

*** Teenaged Bella before she went completely nuts, though, not quite what the poster is looking for. My impression is that they're requesting more of an evil MILF.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
