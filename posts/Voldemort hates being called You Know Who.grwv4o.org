** "Well, that does tend to happen when anyone who says your chosen name gets summarily captured and tortured, or killed, by your overeager underlings. Maybe putting that Taboo on your name had its downsides after all, hmm?"

Severus Snape, marked Death Eater and secret spy for the Order opposing the Dark Lord, would endure a few hours of imaginative punishment for his insolence - the Dark Lord would not be back-talked to by anyone.

However, if you ask him, it was Worth It - not only did it force the Dark Lord in a position of discomfort at his inability to predict the consequences of his actions*, removing the Taboo meant that those three - Severus refused to think of them by name, out of principle - wouldn't have to worry about their ill-advised habits biting them in the backside while they plotted to bring about the downfall of a tyrant.

* The chess game was the only protection of the Stone that, much as Tom Riddle hated to even think about it, he'd been forced to rely on Quirinus Quirrell for.

** I disagree. He loves that they are so scared of him that they don't say his name.
