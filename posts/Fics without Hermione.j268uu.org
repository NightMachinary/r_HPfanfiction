I don't necessarily mean bashing fics like the Mischief's heir series or ninja wizard series. Just fics where harry and hermione don't get along and are acquaintances at best.

I'm simply tired of fics where Hermione is the absolutely perfect and could stand to see her taken down a peg.


** Oh this is like all of my fics! I really don't like Hermione either! Fanfic glamorized version or canon! :) So I don't include her in like any of my fics. I love RON so I use RON a lot!!! :)

** "They Shook Hands" deals with a Harry who accepted Draco's friendship at Madame Malkin's and consequently is sorted into Slytherin. It's an excellent series overall and there are six fics for the appropriate years. The only downside is that it seems we won't be getting year seven, but for how much content there is, it's worth it.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.
