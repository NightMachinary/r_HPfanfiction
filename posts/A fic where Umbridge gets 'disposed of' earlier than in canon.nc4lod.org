I'm looking for fics where someone gets rid of Umbridge earlier than they did in Canon. Doesn't matter if her blood quills are exposed or she 'accidentally' falls down the stairs. Plays in 5th year.

Limited character bashing only. (Umbridge bashing obviously is fine)

No Harry being blind or terminally ill.

No Harry/Ginny at any point.


** Linkao3(Harry Potter And The Bucket List) Gets "disposed off" pretty soon. >! As in gets tortured to death for dark arts ritual ingredients.!<

  Being reincarnated as Harry Potter's fraternal twin sister really puts a new meaning behind "death is but the next great adventure."Updates every Thursday and occasional Sunday. No relationships prior to year four.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] goes that route. A historical expert on harmful magic is sent forward in time, the long way round. He picks up on the Blood Quills the instant Umbridge walks into the same room.
