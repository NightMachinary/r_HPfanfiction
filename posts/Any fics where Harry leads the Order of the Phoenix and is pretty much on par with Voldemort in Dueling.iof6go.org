Harry isn't so much leading... as the only surviving member in the chain of command.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(6256154)

Harry leads the Order in flashbacks. It doesn't go well, hence the time travel to win the war before it begins. Harry is a top tier dueler.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

** YES there is a really good one by TAURE I think where Harry gets Dumbledore's memories and skills and takes over the Order and it's super wholesome and great because everyone is so supportive of him and relieved he got "special training" and it's so great because there is NO STUPID BASHING ANYWHERE!!!! :) :) :) :) :) OR NEEDLESS DUMBASS DRAMA OR CONFLICT IN THE ORDER!

BUT IT ONLY HAS 4 FUCKING CHAPTERS! :( :( :( :( :( So that's super sad. :(
