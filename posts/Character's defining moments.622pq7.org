Its hard to pick out exact moments but the moments we pick can also explain our views/biases on the character. With tropes and exaggerated traits running rampant in fanfiction what canon moments define characters for you?

For example, for me Ron's character is best shown in book 5 shortly after they return to Hogwarts. He has an argument with Hermione about the knitted hats for House-elves. He is his normal tactless self but why it sticks with me is after Hermione goes to bed Ron uncovers all the hats she's hidden but leaves them out since he wants the house-elves to have choice. The way he argues shows his flaws but then he shows that above all he wants things to be fair and accepts that even if he's wrong people shouldn't be tricked into things.

Neville, I still think back to the moment at the end of the first book when he tries to stop them going after the Philosopher's stone, he doesn't really know whats going on but its the first glimpse we have of what is to come. The Neville that doesn't care who he's facing when he's trying to do what he believes in.

I still see Hermione as the demanding girl who burst into Harry's cabin and demanded Ron perform a trick for her. I know she grows up a bit but I've read the first book so many times and so much of my dislike for her is carried over from this moment. It captures her perhaps justified arrogance and self-righteousness combined with her lack of manners.

What moments define characters to you and are there any specific fanfics you think capture that better than others?


** In the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Ron stands in front of Harry against Sirius Black in the Shrieking Shack. I don't have the quote on me now but I disliked Ron until my second read of the series and that scene stood out to me.

** For me nothing in the books defined Harry better than the moment he accepted death, lying on the carpet of the Headmaster's office, having just surfaced from Snape's memories in the last book. And I think the reason for this should be apparent enough.

Another crucial thing is when Harry went back to save Fleur's little sister in book 4. When I was younger I thought this move was just silly and came from Harry's naivete; but now, having taken the way Harry Potter grew up and the sort of life he'd led up to that point into account, I think things are in fact just the opposite. He /knew/, all too well, how unreliable people could be when you need them the most, how death is just around the corner, and he'd decided long ago to be the person who would come forth to help, if nobody else will. It never even occured to him to not go back to save Gabrielle. That for me is Harry in a nutshell.

Oh and another moment: in the first book, when he sat before the Mirror of Erised for three whole nights. The reason for this one should also be apparent enough. His whole character is built around his orphan identity, his desperate love for his parents, their heritage, and consequently his deep seated need for a family of his own.

*** Actually, that part made me the angriest, out of any other part in the book. Harry is someone who never got to live a good life, his girlfriend was someone who he couldn't really relate to/express his emotions to, and she wasn't really a person who seemed to be the shoulder to cry on, Harry was always the one everybody cried on, meanwhile he had his own demons to deal with.

We see throughout the books that Harry is made out to be put at a disadvantage from the start. He shows no particular interest in magic, he only shows skill when he needs to, and he only shows ambition when he needs to. He learned a Patronus Charm to play Qudditch, but after seeing the Dark Lord rise, he just moped about for the next book, and trained everyone else, but himself. The only reason he had to die, the only reason Dumbledore acted OOC and set it up like that, the only reason any of the Battle of Hogwarts happened, relied entirely on OOC decisions. It was when I really looked back at the series as a whole and realized that Rowling mostly did it to fulfill a narrative, rather than tell a compelling and believeable story. You even see this when Harry attempts to make Voldemort repent.

**** Each will have their own interpretation of the books and its events, I guess. To me the narrative and characters (at least when it comes to this particular plot line) are perfectly consistent, I don't see any of the plot as manfactured to fufill a certain objective, and I definitely can't agree with your assessment of Harry and Dumbledore's character. However, I will choose not to go into detail here, because then this comment would devolve into a page-long essay that nobody in the sub would have the patience to read. So guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on the point.

#+end_quote

What assessment did I make? I stated simple facts, Harry is constantly seen as an active person, who does things not because he has to, but because he feels that he needs to. Dumbledore is someone that cares deeply about Harry, he constantly did things to better the boy's life and allow Harry to grow, but it was in moments where things should have escalated; when Harry should have taken his experience in the Graveyard to heart, and trained himself (or asked Dumbledore for assistance) because obviously, this Dark Lord is out to kill him. For someone who is always supposed to have initiative, and who always clings forward, Harry seems to miss those qualities in times of need.

****** I was referring to your statement that what Dumbledore did regarding Harry's Horcrux status was OOC, and that Harry "moped about" in book 5, and that it was an irrational move from Harry telling Voldemort to repent. That's not at all the way I see these events in the books. However I'm not going to argue with you, it'd take a long while and I'm really tired. Perhaps if I had more energy right now I'd lay my thoughts regarding these issues out in detail, but not now. We're all entitled to our own opinions of things.

*Edit: Also, you will notice that I added "(at least when it comes to this particular plotline)" when I said the events and the characters are "perfectly consistent“.

******* 1.) It's a common consensus that Harry's pov was Angst-Filled exposition throughout OOTP. The only moves he made, was training up the DA, instead of himself, on something Hermione said.

2.) Not saying it was an irrational move, just saying it was OOC, Harry had constantly reiterated that he would never forgive Voldemort. If he experiences the murder of his parents in such vivid detail, I don't understand how he was capable of consciously attempting to allow Voldemort to live.

3.) Wait... so you're saying that Dumbledore throwing Harry up for the slaughter, is in character? He had always been against 'The Greater Good' that's precisely why he stopped following Grindelwald's beliefs. He even reiterated that when he met Harry at King's Cross. Which is a whole in the plot itself. The same could be said for Harry's sudden interest in learning advanced magic in the third year, then suddenly losing that interest in the fourth year when it was required of him.

******** Re: 1. First off, there's a difference between being a tramatized 15-year-old who had just went through a whole year of hell filled with, but not limited to, being ostracized by the whole school, almost shunned by his best friend for good, almost losing his life god knows however many times, and to put the icing on the cake, witnessed the sudden and unexpected death of his school rival and sort-of friends, right in front of him when he could do nothing. I must see Harry differently from how you see him, if you would describe how he felt and the emotional state he was in after all that as simply "angst" and "moping about". It's liking calling a knife wound "a scratch", and calling the victim a whiny little baby for saying it hurts.

Plus, I don't see why Harry /has to/ do anything. It's not his job to be a saviour. It's his job to be a teenager. If he becomes a saviour, it's because he chooses to do so. He spent the whole of book 5 struggling on the choice, and he only made up his mind by the end of it. He was in complete turmoil (and very understandably so) throughout the volume, and if you really put yourself in the shoes of a 15-year-old (and one who has been under his relatives' ceaseless abuse and had essentially no one to rely on for the first 10 years of his life, and who had been through more in four years time than most adults have gone through by forty), and if you put aside Harry's literary role as the heroic protagonist for a moment and just looked at him as any other boy, I think you might understand why.

Besides I don't know there ever was a "consensus" on this. A lot of people brings up the same complaint that you just made, yes, but also a lot of others hold views more similar to mine. You were just exposed to a limited crowd. When it comes to Harry Potter, I don't think there are many "consensuses" among its readers. This is one of the most divisive fandoms. Every possible point could and have been argued.

Re: 2. You might not understand it, but nevertheless, Harry is the sort of person who would tell Voldemort to repent. Not because he had forgiven him, but because it was the right thing to do, for Harry. By the end he was looking at Voldemort in a near pitying light. He understood things that Voldemort never will, and even as he advised Voldemort to repent, he knew Voldemort most likely wouldn't do it, and yet there is still a small part of him that can't helpt but hope. You will notice that the books mention the similarities between Harry and Tom Riddle throughout, and out of all the people, it's Harry who understands Voldemort the best, even better than that man understood himself. Besides, he wasn't attempting to allow Voldemort to live. He was attempting to prevent the final devastation of Voldemort's soul before all hopes of salvation had gone out. He knew what kind of existence Voldemort would lead after he died, and he wouldn't wish that on anyone, even if the other is his worst enemy and living nightmare. Voldemort would have died no matter what; the Elder Wand was Harry's, and Voldemort wouldn't use any other curse than the one he thinks to be the most powerful (the Avada Kedavra), and so the spell would have rebounded on him no matter what Voldemort did. The difference is how whole his soul could be when he goes into that ephemeral station.

Harry understood the importance of the integrity of one's soul. Voldemort didn't.

Re: 3. I think Dumbledore is a vastly complicated character, and his attitude towards Harry is even more so. He had shunned his teenaged ideal of the "Greater Good", because it was a warped one, and he would never do anything in his life again that's simply all block letters and helps no one in reality, much less do evil in the name of good. However, at the end of book 5, Dumbledore specifically mentions he had a plan tor Harry, and that that plan began to fall apart the moment he laid eyes on the eleven-year-old little boy. To me, that tells me that Dumbledore plans with his logical mind, but his decisions are not always immune to emotions, as in the case of Harry. He cares for Harry, perhaps more than any other living thing, yes, but at the same time he knew how crucial Harry is to the war, and he even explicitly said that he had weighted the life of Harry against the life of everyone else, and he found that perhaps he had cared for Harry a little too much. Yet the simple fact that he was able to make that comparison says that he would still do what's necessary; it's in the other places that he made compromises, like the fact that he should have let Harry know everything the moment Harry came to Hogwarts, and he didn't. And I don't think it was ever a question of if he would give up Harry's life; all he did was lead Harry onto a path and hope that Harry chose the right direction when he came upon a crossroad. He had already given up training Harry as a soldier, back in year 1. He yearns to protect Harry; he knows what Harry had to do (and guessed that when the right time comes, Harry would voluntarily do it.) These are two types of motivations and emotions inside of Dumbledore that exists simultaneously; one doesn't exclude the other. Again, Dumbledore's complicated, and a lot is behind every seemingly simple decision he makes.

I haven't read book 5 in a while, but if you looked at the chapter after Sirius's death, when Harry and Dumbledore talked in his office, you will find Dumbledore's whole reasoning and the mental struggle he went through in the years after James and Lily's death laid out there, in detail. He spoke in riddles, but it's all in there.

Dumbledore dedicated his whole life after his sister died to prevent the rise of Dark Magic, and he was prepared to lead a little boy onto the same path because it was necessary to do so, but there is a huge difference between being a war leader and doing what it takes to win, and planning to massacre millions of Muggles to build a non-existent ideal Wizarding society. The "Greater Good" he abandoned was a dangerous and harmful ideal, but I think the utilitarinist part of him still remains, even though it tortures him as well as he had to watch people's lives play out (either in misery or in triumph) because of his decisions, even if he tries to suppress that nature, just as he tries to suppress his own power-hunger and thirst for control. It's what's required of one when one is literally the only viable leader against a Dark Lord. He mitigates that utilitarinism with his genuine caring for everyone who works for him and his cause. Besides, you will notcie that even as he was planning to wage war on the world alongside Grindelwald, that aside from his power-hunger, there was also a part of him that was driven by something truly good: he wanted the wizarding people to be free, to not be like his father and sister and mother, who had either gone to jail, went mad, or been killed by her own daughter because of what three ignorant muggle boys had done. He didn't hate those boys; he simply fantasized about a way to prevent any of that from ever happening again, and in his teenaged, love-addled mind, that equated to Grindlewald's "brilliant" plan. This is what set him apart from Grindelwald, even from the beginning.

As for Harry's "sudden interest in learning advanced magic": no, he never was "interested" in the Patronus Charm, he learnt it because if he didn't he would most likely die, and even if he didn't die, he would experience something a lot like death when he ever went near a Dementor. And again, he isn't a boy who is setting out to be a saviour and hero; he's just a boy trying to survive when everything is out to kill him, and struggling to do the right thing at the same time. Remember that before book 5, he didn't even know he and Voldemort was fated to die at the hands of each other (i.e. the Wizarding world is essentially on his shoulders), he just knew that he survived one of Voldemort's attacks and the guy will always be after his head for that.

I don't know why you're so bent on picking a fight with me, do you not have anything elese to do at all? We could argue the finer details of the book for whole days, but you do know that there has been whole books written about the themes and characters of Harry Potter, and I'm not sure I'm willing to spend my breath on it when I do have other duties to attend to. Can you not be content with the fact that we will hold different opinions on this matter, just as everyone does on every subject there ever was? You are free to hold your own opinoins and I to mine, and before you had to reply to my post with three long points when I didn't specify what I thought about your views just that I disagreed with them, I wasn't going to type out these many words at all just to argue a fictional plot with some stranger on Reddit. I'm not the only one who thinks of the book and the characters in this way, and if you're determined to start a fight with someone, find someone else. I've stated all I can on the subject, and if you have anything else irl to do at all, let this go, and feel free to discuss the OOCness of Dumbledore and the plot holes in the books with someone of a similar view to yours. I'm not going to reply anymore. Have a good day.

#+end_quote

Harry is someone who always does something, even if he doesn't have to. Case in point, the DA and the Patronus Charm. If he felt powerless from watching Cedric die in front of him, which he did, the only natural move for Harry would have been attempting to train himself in Magical Combat. Because that is what Harry does, and has done for most of the series before that. Tri-Wizard Tournament? Learns Spells to compete on an even playing field with the other competitors. Dementors threatening Quidditch? Learns Patronus Charm to repel them. Heck, he even learned the Disarming Charm in passing because he saw Snape use it effectively.

That's why his entire character arc was thrown out of the window in the fifth book. The Harry we've known for almost four books may have acted similar, but he most definitely wouldn't have sat there knowing the Dark Lord was still out to get him (with dreams through his eyes to boot).

Harry is supposed to be the 'Leader' and 'Take Charge' most of the time, that is what he did most of the time in all the books. He wasn't struggling with his role as saviour, he was struggling with Voldemort's visions and his PTSD.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry at that point had grown up from previous ideologies, he used an Unforgivable on someone for spitting on Professor McGonagall, and inferences that you're trying to make with previous incarnations of the character are pretty much useless, as that is when the narrative took over fully. Don't believe me? Think about HPB, and his "Monster in his Chest", and then think about how suddenly before going into the forest, he gets a wave of "savage pride for his parent's sacrifice". It's inconsistent with everything.

That's your own headcanon. Albus was still a genius even during his Hogwarts years, and he was still a Gryffindor. The plan likely sounded good enough and saved enough people in the end, that he approved of it. Otherwise, he never would have gone along with it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, he said that he did this all for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Reducto, Sectumsempra, Patronus, Confringo
#+end_quote

These are all spells he learnt in a short amount of time, that are well above his year when he learned them respectively. Harry's interest in the Patronus Charm was because he felt powerless in their presence, and he wanted to play Quidditch. Once again, an inconsistency when he sees the Dark Lord rise and is powerless in the Duel against him.

********** you know, this nigga got a point. by the end of book one harry had come to terms with the whole wizard jesus thing otherwise he would not have tried to hel with the stone, book two he did the same. Harry was struggling with puberty, survivors guilt, and ptsd along with being the voldemort jinchuuriki. it's not ooc that harry spent his time angsting but it is ooc that harry never got off his ass and tried to prevent that shit from happening again.

Harry is shown to be ambitious and incredibly adept at magic. except when he's not. harry is able to learn and use high level spells in a short amount of time with relative ease yet he only does so for arbitrary reasons. he tried to learn more advanced magic during year 4 but stopped because he wanted to angst about not knowing good enough magic? that shit makes no sense.

harry is a child soldier. harry is the worst kind of child soldier, he literally suicide bombed voldemort because it was the "right thing to do" and would "honor his mothers sacrifice". Harry was like that from the moment he realized that voldemort may not be 100% dead. i'm sure that if he read a book with a ritual in it that would let him permenently kill voldemor or seal him into something he would have skipped from step one to dead demon consuming seal and sold his ass to the shinigami. by the time year 2 started he was ready to kill himself to help put down voldemort.

also on the repentance bullshit. that shit is like the H/G bullshit. it exist to make him a better shonen protag and not for common sense. he pities voldemort in the same way you pity the rabid dog that killed your best friend, you put it down like the like the little fucker deserves and do not try to make it better with the power of love

I also don't think dumbledore ever acts ooc. he has a president or reason for everything he does and really fits everywhere from the repentant old man trying to atone for his sins to the evil dictator who realized he done goofed putting on the death ring and merely set up everything so that his ideal world could happen after his death. the only label aside from straight male that does not fit dumbledore would be blood purist (assuming that you ignore everything aside from harry potter books 1-7 because pottermore, and fantastic beasts are bullshit.)

also I view dumbledore as a crazy brony who is supergay like that guy who you don't think is actually gay because he tries so hard to "act gay" and uses all the shitty tropes associated with a "gay" character and that dumbledore wants to solve everything with the power of love like some sailor moon character. so basically my headcannon is that dumbledore is a batshit insane brony who wants to solve everything with "the power of love" and a caricature of a gay person.

Note: not being homophobic it's just that dumbledore is perfect for that role, it's really more satire than anything serious but it stuck with me

**** I'm really interested in how you said that as soon as shit hits the fan Ron would stay you in the back, because aside a few minor arguments throughout the course of the series, he consistently stands by Harry, /especially/ when shit hits that fan. The only two major times he turned away from Harry are during the triwizard Cup, which, fair enough, was a dick move, and in the 7th book while under the influence of the horcrux, which has been shown to negatively influence people by making them not think clearly and bringing out their worst traits on multiple occasions. As soon as Ron left the influence of the locket he tried to return, but got caught by snatchers. He escaped and the tried numerous times to find Harry and Hermione, but they were hidden from him. He went to stay with Bill and Fleur, but when the deluminator showed him how to find the others, he left to find them as soon as possible.

In first year, he stuck with Harry through the traps before the stone, and willingly sacrificed himself so Harry and Hermione could go on when by all eight he could have just fucked off and not helped at all. Keep in mind he had known Harry less than a year at this point and was only 11.

In second year he went into the forest with Harry knowing they were walking right into a spiders den, despite them being his biggest fear.

He continued staying with Harry throughout 3rd year, knowing that a mass murder was after him, even after being seemingly attacked. I also vaguely remember him stepping in front of Harry to protect him in the Shrieking Shack, even with a broken leg, but I'm not 100% so don't quote me on that.

Fourth year he was pretty much an all around dick, I'll give you that, but he apologized in the end.

In the fifth year he went distracted Umbridge so Harry could contact Sirius, and then insisted on going to the DoM with Harry, sticking with him until he was critically injured and couldn't continue.

In the 6th year he was a bit of an insensitive jerk, but he never intentionally betrayed Harry over anything.

In the 7th book he transfigured the ghoul in the attic to resemble him so he could go Horcrux hunting with Harry, and stuck with him through the entire hunt with the exception of when he was manipulated by the locket, and like I said, as soon as he was out of its influence he tried to return to them.

All of this was done completely voluntarily, putting in himself in danger countless times, and going to further lengths than anyone could reasonably expect a child/teenager to go, and even just being friends with Harry made him a target. In all seven years he had known Harry, he only abandoned him once while in his right mind and not being manipulated by an evil artifact.

4th year = actions speak louder than words/better ask for forgivness than permission is the rule of theives and dicks the world over.

5th year = umbridge does not even reach monkey levels of shit flinging until the end of the book, it was get detention or get your friend killed and even the biggest cowards chose the former and DoM was like skydiving you were like fuck yeah until you were in a plane but by the time you realized the shit you got into peer pressure and adrenalin kicked in and by the time fighting started he was either about to die or being mind raped by a tentacle monster.

6th year = the little shit he could have betrayed harry over were nothing compared to the size of harry's metaphorical stick

7th year = lightbulb mode was its FINAL FORM^{tm} because peer pressure and weird light thingy were influencing him even when it was not in it's FINAL FORM^{tm.} also horcrux hunt uses same skydiving metaphor along with harry has the biggest stick until he realizes harry doesn't and then runs away until lightbulb/peer pressure forces him to realize that he is harry's friend, he wants to copulate with hermione (do not make me think of ron/15 year old white ginger me having sex it was bad enough when I did it), and the fact that the only thing he really wants in life (respect for his own accomplishments and surpassing his family in every way) were not things he could achieve working for deaths bitch but could easily get with fate's bitch.

I think that the reason why I don't see the good in ron is because he reminds of myself from when I was like 15 because back then I was like Ron: Black edition with subtitle 'whiny bitch who dreams big and tries bigger but runs away as soon as shit hits the fan only to run back to help clean the shit once someone sprays some fabreeze.

tldr: I hate my 15 year old self. ron reminds me of 15 year old self ron. I hate ron. its whatever you call that awkward form of narcissism.

****** I can see your reasoning. I guess I just don't really get the skydiving metaphor from a personal point of view, since I'm naturally a very cautious person in terms of risky behavior and over think things a lot, and try my absolute best to not get involved in potentially dangerous things. (The idea of skydiving scares me shitless, so I would have a very hard time deciding to do it on the basis of 'fuck yeah this is awesome.') So for me it would take an insane amount of bravery/courage/loyalty to be able to do half the shit Ron does.

Also, I find it funny that you don't like Ron because he reminds you of your 15 year old blunder years, which is the exact reason I like Ron. I see a lot of myself and my flaws in him, especially his jealously issues. Because of this, I can sympathize with a lot of his poor choices over the series, especially the ones rooted in jealousy (which is to say, almost all of them.)

******* I understand what you mean about the skydiving metaphor. The gist of it is the idea and peer pressure make you feel all hells yeah until you get there where you are like "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuuck. I do not want to be here right now" until you are watching your Friends jump out where you have the whole peer pressure and hormones practically dragging you out and you feel this sense of obligation where you *need* to jump out /or else/ and it turns into fight or flight where both involve jumping out.

So the thing with the DoM would be like yeah it can't be that bad (because your fucking ignorant) and peer pressure make you go until you going through all the dangerous shit and realize that you are in deep shit but can't really get out if it until the corpse munchers arrive where you are In such deep shit that you *need* to fight /or else/.

I generally try to ship harry with a black or a delacour or oc/crossover character or just avoid major romance. I also like the Weasley's even molly and ginny though I am indifferent to the twins because I used to know these 3 "pranksters" but they were just bullies and kinda dicks unless you were friends with them which leaves me with a negative view on pranksters.

Edit: also the only reason I don't dislike the twins is because their characters were kinda like what I used to wish I was like back when I was like 15 if you could replace prankster with that one bastard who is always behind you and steals things before giving them back without you even noticing and does that weird thing where you can't tell where he is by his voice which led to me taking singing lessons and spending hours trying to figure out how to do that and DAMMIT I'm going on a tangent.

** Character defining moments that come to mind (mostly just ones that made me love the characters in question all the more).

Percy and Fred: I was mostly ambivalent towards Percy during the books, this scene however, changed me into really respecting him-and even liking him-it takes a lot of bravery to admit his mistakes as he does. I also liked that despite Fred normally being the one to harrass Percy, here he immediately accepts him back into the fold.

#+begin_quote
  'I was a fool!' Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. 'I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a-a' 'Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,' said Fred. Percy swallowed. 'Yes, I was!' 'Well you can't say fairer than that,' said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy.
#+end_quote

Luna: Luna saves Harry, Ron and Hermione here. The fact that she's able to encourage Harry in such a dark moment really stuck with me.

#+begin_quote
  'That's right,' said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply the spell practice for the DA. 'That's right, Harry...come on, think of something happy...'
#+end_quote

Ginny: Ginny really stood out to me in the OoTP and if it weren't for Luna she would probably have been my favourite character of that book. This is my favourite Ginny scene.

#+begin_quote
  'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.' 'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?' 'The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'
#+end_quote

Hermione: Hermione's bravery was especially noticeable in the OoTP, this is one of the moments that come to mind.

#+begin_quote
  'Harry,' she said timidly, 'don't you see? This...this is exactly why we need you...we need to know what it's r-really like...facing him...facing V-Voldemort'
#+end_quote

McGongall: There are a /lot/ of standout McGongall moments (even in this very scene) still I really loved that she offered to go beyond the call of duty of a teacher.

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move; she towered over Professor Umbridge. 'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'
#+end_quote

Ron: Ron really has some great moments (such as standing up to Sirius), I thought this really emphasised his character the most however.

#+begin_quote
  'We're nearly there,' he muttered suddenly. 'Let me think-let me think...' The white queen turned her blank face towards him. 'Yes...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way...I've got to be taken.' 'NO!' Harry and Hermione shouted. 'That's chess!' snapped Ron. 'You've got to make some sacrifices! I'll make my move and she'll take me-that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!'
#+end_quote

Neville: I just loved that he had no idea what was going on-but still tried to protect Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  'Got 'em all,' said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room. '/That/ one,' he poked a thick finger at Neville, 'tried to stop me taking /her/,' he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin holding her, 'so I brought him along too.'
#+end_quote

Arthur: Not necessarily a smart move on Mr Weasley's part, but a very brave one.

#+begin_quote
  'One moment, Runcorn.' The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr Weasley said, 'I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.' Harry had the impression that Mr Weasley's anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance to act stupid. 'Sorry?' he said.\\
  'Don't pretend Runcorn,' said Mr Weasley fiercely. 'You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn't you?' 'I-so what if I did?' said Harry. 'So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the man you are,' said Mr Weasley quietly, as the lift sank even lower. 'And if he survives Azkaban, you'll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons and his friends-'
#+end_quote

Molly: I sort of imagine that Molly is actually quite powerful and this really shows it. And of course it's all in defence of her family.

#+begin_quote
  'You-will-never-touch-our-children-again!' screamed Mrs Weasley. Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
#+end_quote

Malfoy: HBP gave a lot more character to Malfoy and this sort of summarises the buildup for me.

#+begin_quote
  'There is little time, one way or another,' said Dumbledore. 'So let us discuss your options, Draco.'\\
  'My options!' said Malfoy loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand --- I'm about to kill you ---' 'My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first dis-armed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.' 'I haven't got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!'
#+end_quote

Dumbledore: I think it's really quite poignant that Dumbledore probably saw something very similar to Harry in the Mirror of Erised.

#+begin_quote
  'What do you see when you look in the Mirror?' 'I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.' Harry stared. 'One can never have enough socks,' said Dumbledore. 'Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.' It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful.
#+end_quote

Harry: Harry really grew I felt as a character after Dobby's death. I loved the respect he gave in burying Dobby himself.

#+begin_quote
  Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared under the Rock's surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read: /Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf/.

*** For me the Luna moment will always be the bit about 'it was like having friends' or something like that. To me that showed that she was a slightly broken little girl, perhaps too accepting of her lot in life but simply a odd little girl, no seer, no hidden genius or whatever people in FanFiction try to do to her. Just someone peculiar enough she was awkward to be around and she didn't see the need to change.

  Hermione was stuck at the last task, for only one of us could go forward. She suggested that I should go despite her voluminous spell knowledge. Her argument was simple, and I couldn't deny it.

  "I am just books and cleverness; there are more important things, like friendship and bravery and..."

  "And?"

  "Well, a killer instinct. You don't flinch, Holly."

  I guess I must have looked a little sad as I nodded my head, because Hermione gave me a hug to compete with the strangling vine just then. It took me a minute, but I finally relaxed into it. I hope someone gives you hugs, Harry. They make you feel like you can do anything. Hermione gave me one last piece of advice before she turned to go back.

  "Don't you die in there. I would feel severely put out."

** My opinion on Ron was majorly influenced by his tantrum after Harry became Champion. I remember being really annoyed at him, as a reader, because back then I identified with Harry a lot and felt that such betrayal couldn't be forgotten, nor easily forgiven. Which made me pretty annoyed at Harry for forgiving Ron like he did. That was the moment for me when Ron was suddenly tinged in a very different, more negative light in my mind. He had his moments of greatness, no doubt, but his flaws and shortcomings were always reminding me of people I didn't want to be friends with in the real world.

This is something that also reflects on my writing. I can't write Ron. Period. If I write him, eventually it falls into a bash of his character. Therefore I mostly just don't write him at all. I also remember one fic I once read where Ron's tantrum was a complete break between the two, but without bashing. The friendship just ended, which was the more "realistic" outcome in my head.

Hermione is a bit of a double-edged sword with me - /nowadays/. There were a lot of moments, small ones and throughout the series, that made me put her on a pedestral. She was intelligent, valued knowledge and learning and was loyal to a fault. I think a lot of her negative traits were simply ignored by my ~14 year old self.

I don't really remember there being "a moment". Looking back, I think her character just resonated with me from the start. Probably because I too was a socially awkward loner with no filters in my mind when it came to sharing my book-knowledge. I only remember the moments when she broke with this glorified picture of her. The moments that tainted her character for me. For one that would be her zealous ways of trying to free the elves, regardless of the elve's wishes. It was her acting purely on ideology and ideals, rather than on conclusion from research and discourse. The next was her (and Ron's, to be fair) dismissal of Draco's plot in sixth year. For her to so completely disregard even the /possibility/ was a pretty scarring thing to read.
