It can't be a character that was depicted as unsympathetic cruel or bad in canon ( at least not for what the fic is being critical about)

So not say Umbridge or Bellatrix

or Ron's actions during book 4

It has to be something a character did that the narrative didn't hold them accountable for or brushed over that a fic is holding them accountable for.

It can't just be one character lecturing another .

Just the negative aspects of what they did being depicted as bad and having consequences that are explored.

So for example lets say you want to be Molly critical lets say the scene where she and Sirius have that argument.

So while you see her with the boggart to see her perspective on things you explore Sirius's struggles to see how much dick move it was to have said what she said. What she did is still depicted as bad and not just understandable or sympathetic as it was in the books.

But you dont say make her a massive bitch that needs to be lectured demeaned or thrown out of the house.

I often see stories where they hold people accountable for things they weren't held accountable for in canon and I appreciate that. But they often go to such extremes it doesn't feel catharthic. So im looking for fics that do that.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is quite critical of canon Hermione. For example, even the retired dark lord finds her actions against her parents excessive. Or he comes to the conclusion in third year that she's not really Bellatrix like, but resembles him a lot in his youth:

#+begin_quote
  Upon closer observation, I had cast aside my early assumption that Hermione was this generation's Bellatrix. Her obsession with rules, goody-two-shoes personality, intelligence, and hidden cruelty were far more reminiscent of my younger self.

** Another Hermione-critical story is Got Balls? by Ellory While it's more focused on Harry the critique is about Hermione confounding Cormac McLaggen during Quidditch tryouts in sixth year (Hopefully the link works)

** I like ones that address why Remus wasn't there for Harry. I loves Remus though so I usually go for raising Harry fics that fix it rather than address it admittedly.

** This is my own fic. It's critical of the fanon! Hermione that runs off with Draco Malfoy. linkao3(Litany of Lies by HeirGaunt) it's a oneshot and in my biased opinion well worth your time.

The old favorite marriage contract story is nothing but Harry and Daphne critical. They are essentially both portrayed as power hungary politicians. Well worth your time as well. linkffn(contractual invalidation)

  With a marrige on the rocks, and a political career that cannot seem to make any progress in the dual causes of freedom and equality, Hermione gets an offer that she cannot refuse. A dramione story like none other.

** It's abandoned, but 'Golden Bullets' comes to mind about Hermione's actions with the birds. Been a while since I've read it though, so I admit that I can't guarantee that it doesn't go overboard.

**** While this is a good an unique story it's still a bit bashing. They fly broom way up in the sky with flying iron balls, can regrow bones ect,ect. So I don't feel causing scars via bird beaks would result in suck a hard punishment. And I wouldn't call it a betrayal. The author is picking up on a glossed over part, but clearly dislikes Hermione's character and writes such. Still entertaining.

It still is literally assaulting a friend and classmate for the crime of not returning feelings that Hermione either didn't know she had or never actually displayed.
