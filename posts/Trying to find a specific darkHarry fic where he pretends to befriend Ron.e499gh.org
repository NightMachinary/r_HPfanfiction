:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I only remember a few concepts of this fic, and it's really bothering me lmao. It was definitely dark!Harry, but I don't remember which house but it was probably Ravenclaw bc i remember Ron bothering Harry about spending time in the library. Lots of Ron-bashing, and I would assume Dumbledore-bashing as well. Ron was extremely bitter that Harry didn't become friends with him, and would try to push his friendship into Harry. Harry was probably friends with Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins. At one point (I think it was during third year so that Harry could get to Pettigrew), during the Christmas holidays Harry pretended to finally take up Ron on his offer of friendship. Ron was super happy and dragged Harry around to have “adventures” and they played chess in the Gryffindor common room. Ron was super childish about his bias against Slytherins. In first year, he got Ron's “help” to figure out what the Cerberus was and what it was guarding. That's all I can really think of, hopefully it's enough info. If I had to guess, it's probably a super generic dark!Harry, lightSide-bashing, helpful goblins, 50 compartment trunks, with a million inheritances fics, and i can only remember this part because everything else blurs together. Pls help?
