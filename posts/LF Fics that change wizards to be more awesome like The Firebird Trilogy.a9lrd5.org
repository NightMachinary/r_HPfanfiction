**** They live in a hyper-sexist, hyper-oppressive society that manages to suck majorly for both men and women, just in different ways. They sneer at and look down on Muggles to an even bigger degree than in canon, and they treat each other horribly and even the so-called heroes do atrocious things. Says something when the person who has the LEAST objectionable ideas is Voldemort.

****** To me it DOES mean they can't be interesting. If they have no redeeming qualities, then I don't CARE what happens to them. And if you don't care whether the characters live or die, they aren't interesting. At least that's my take on it.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
