Please share your favourite Ron/Hermione fics. A gen fic with them as the main characters and together is also fine.

No Harmony (or Ron/Harry). Love triangles are the worst.

No Ron/Hermione side pairing to whoever Harry or the fics main character is banging. Their popularity as the background ship is why I'm having trouble finding fics about them.

Post-Hogwarts if possible, but open to canon rehashes. Slash is fine for other pairings.

Thanks!!


** I found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18483637][this]] fic during my searches. Only halfway through, but really enjoying it so far! It is a fake-dating au set in 6th year and has a cute rom-com vibe. Can't wait to see what others find!

** Unfortunately I don't know any myself. I tried to do a search on AO3 by excluding tags of Harry pairings and then even Harry the character and wow still most of the fics seem to have Ronmione as a side pairing. I feel for you.

I found this and it looks like it's actually focused on Ronmione: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/479063/chapters/832123][The Waiting Place]]

  COMPLETE! When Ron and Hermione are forced prematurely into an act of intimacy out of necessity to save her life following an accident, will they be prepared to handle the consequences? Half-Blood Prince subplot, interweaves with canon. **WINNER! Best AU, Best Ron, & Best Hermione in the 2012 Romione Awards!**

*** Thanks for looking! That was my exact same experience. Who knew finding fics featuring a canon ship would be so complicated.

**** Right?? Granted, I don't use fanfiction.net so maybe it would be better on there? I'd imagine there's more het content at least. Good luck, I hope you find some good Ronmione fics!

  In the search for Hermione's parents Ron is stricken with an unknown curse. The experts and family all agree that Ron is brain dead, alive only in a shell of himself. But Hermione refuses to believe that her soul mate is gone, fighting to find him and bring him home. Ron, meanwhile, is fighting just as hard to get back, falling more in love with his witch every step of the way.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]] by DianeCastle. AU in a world without magic, but with James Bond style spies. Covers the whole 7 years and lines up the romance with Ron beautifully - and it is complete, with a couple sequels in the series. Roughly follows canon, though with enough variation to keep it entertaining. The twist on Lavender's relationship with Ron is especially amusing.
