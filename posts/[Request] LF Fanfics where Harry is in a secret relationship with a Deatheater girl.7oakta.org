Hey there! I am looking for a fic where Harry is in a secret "forbidden" relationship with a girl on the opposite side like Bellatrix for example. Basically, I want a fic that will describe the struggle they have with maintaining this relationship and how they hide it from their friends and allies and also the aftermath of said friends and allies when they discover the relationship and how Harry and his pairing will respond and such.


** hi i couldn't find a fic like this so i wrote one for u

"pls, harry! none of ur friends will accept my muggle hunting!!"

"its alright enoby we can muggle hunt together"

enobies eyes teared up. "and crucio them too??"

"and crucio them too", hairy said with an approving nod

edit: I made more

DUBLEDORF looked down at hardy. "this shit ain't right"

hary looked up at dombledore. "from MY point of view, U arent rite!" tears streaming from his eyes

he LOVED enobi, especially her cute eyes as she hunted his muggle family with him

dumbldore looked down at harry. "stop"

harry looked back at dubledore. "no"

harry escaped the office with enoby, his one and true love

"lemon drop?"
