*What I'm looking for:* I'm not really sure what that means exactly, but I've gathered that it's where Harry goes on his own (or with his friends or Sirius) and gets powerful all by himself? Basically, I'm cool with fics where Harry leaves the Dursleys and travels around the world or whatever or even fics where Harry's badass after Voldemort's death.

*What I'm not looking for:* Crossovers! The only crossover I'm fine with is if it's Twilight.

*A few pairings I don't want are:* Harry/any-male-Weasley-save-Charlie, Harry/any-girl-who-isn't-Hermione-or-Ginny-or-Luna, any harem/multiple pairings, no Harry/Voldemort (Tom Riddle is okay, I suppose), no Harry/any-other-guys-unless-it's-stated-below, and Draco/Hermione

*Pairings I'm okay with:* Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Charlie, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Luna, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Sirius, or Harry/Remus

Many thanks!

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think. Alternate from Order of the Phoenix

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106612/1/Lesser-Evils]]. You have a Harry that breaks off from Dumbledore's faction with Sirius and eventually starts breaking off from Sirius's faction as well. It's a well-written story. Slightly rocky start but it really catches its own.
