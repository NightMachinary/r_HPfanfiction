It just popped in my head, but I much prefer longer rituals in my stories, so someone else can use this if they want.

"Blood of a loved one, you will send me home." (You have to kill someone close to you who was alive at the time you want to go back to. Or they have to willingly die for you. Not sure)

"Breath of an enemy, you will power my journey." (Have to kill an enemy alive and an enemy of yours at the time you want to go back to)

"Soul of the familiar, you will be my steed." (Not 100% sure of this part. Perhaps you need bits of a pet you had at the time you want to go back to. So if it was Harry, he'd have to find bits of Hedwig or something)

There'd be a potion involved too, since in my head words are spells, ingredients are potions and both together are rituals.

But yeah, feel free to use it, credit if you want, I don't really care all that much. I'm never going to use it.

  What if the war was over, but the only ones left were Ginny and a paralyzed friend? When Ginny finds a ritual that will send her back to an earlier point in the timeline, how will she change things to come out for the better? HP/GW
