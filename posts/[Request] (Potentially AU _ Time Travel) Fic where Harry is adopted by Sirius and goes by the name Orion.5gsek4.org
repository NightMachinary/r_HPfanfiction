I remember reading this a while ago, and totally forgot the name of it! Sorta want to reread though, to see if its as good as i remember.

It involved a lot of Black family politics etc. I think Draco might have made an appearance as a sort of neutral character.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

**** In the story I linked, Harry takes the name of "Orion Aubrey", and then gets adopted by Sirius. And it has a lot of family politics, and Draco's a friend.

So, while there might be other stories with a similar theme, it certanly fits the request.

****** Not exactly. "Growing up Black" lacks the time travel/dimensional travel. In "A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story", Harry is an older wizard, stufed into a younger body in an alternate universe.
