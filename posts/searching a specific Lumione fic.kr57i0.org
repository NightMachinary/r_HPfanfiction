Lumione/LuciusxHermione. I remember reading it years ago and it was quite popular, but for some reason I can't find it now. I remember it's a longfic where Hermione got kidnapped by the Death Eaters and kept in a remote location, Lucius was supposed to take care of her. They eventually develop some kind of relationship and they had a plan to escape, but it all goes to shit and people die in the end. Anyone has any idea of where I can find it, or the name?


** Sounds like Eden, although Lucius was the one who kidnapped Hermione, not the Death Eaters.
