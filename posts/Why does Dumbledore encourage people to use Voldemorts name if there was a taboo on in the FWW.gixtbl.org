I'm like, 70% sure there was!!! This has never made sense to me


** Except, there wasn't. Or perhaps there was, but we have no shred of evidence about it. It is pure fanon.

*** No, voldy only made the taboo in the second war due to Dumbledores efforts to get people to call him voldemort, how do you think the de's found Harry, Ron and Hermione in the cafe?

** There wasn't a taboo until the Ministry takeover and, I believe, there's something in the books that suggests they needed the Ministry to do it.

Or maybe it's my headcanon that the taboo is a modified version of the trace.

** You got it backward, it only became a taboo in the second war because of Dumbledore's efforts, since now they have a way to detect Order members.

** So there's no definite answer in the books about whether there was the taboo In the ffw (there's none in j.k. interviews not that I would take that as cannon anyways).

So you take the overall picture and look at it.

I get people hate Dumbledore but he's not trying to get people killed, he wouldn't encourage people to say the name knowing that Voldemort is still alive and there might be a taboo again.

No one told Harry about a Taboo during the series, not even Ron who had family members were in the order in the fww.

Voldemort had peter to tell him information and where people were at in the fww. He didn't have a spy that knew where Harry his Target was in deathly hallows.

It seems obvious to me that it was an idea thought up by Voldemort or cronies during deathly hallows to mainly snatch Harry but to then get all other resistance against him as well

** Because the Taboo was controlled by the Ministry, not Voldemort. So Voldemort never got to use it until he took over the Ministry in the Second Wizarding War.

It might be possible that if Ministry used the Taboo prior to the second war, it would be on the word "Morsmordre". IIRC, it would explain how the Ministry suddenly arrived near Crouch Jr's location at the Quidditch World Cup and were already prepared to stun. It also explains how effortlessly the Ministry rounded up all the Death Eaters after Voldemort's downfall. All it would take is one person hearing the incantation (if Crouch Jr yelled it out, equally or less talented Death Eaters probably did the same) and informing the Ministry, and now the Minister can Taboo that word. But that much is just a headcanon.

Though the Taboo ignores context of a word, so if lots of people just said the Tabooed word, it could just waste the Ministry's time since people could just say it on purpose (i.e. similar to calling emergency services purely to waste their time). The only reason the Taboo worked so well for Voldemort was because basically nobody outside the Order would say "Voldemort". If saying Voldemort's name was normal and common to do (as Dumbledore wanted), then it would be basically impossible for all the Death Eaters to go after all the people saying Voldemort's name. It would make the Taboo less effective.

Also, using the Taboo on a spell would be really stupid of the Ministry since effectively every adult wizard could do non-verbal magic, and non-verbal spells are expected of sixth and seventh years. Contrary to fanon misconceptions, the Unforgivable Curses can be performed non-verbally---Bellatrix used a non-verbal Killing Curse in HBP on a fox, and Voldemort spams non-verbal Unforgivables in general. While not confirmed, its possible Lucius used a non-verbal Imperius Curse on Bode since he would have likely cast the curse at the Ministry and without being noticed.

So even if the Ministry put a Taboo on the words "Imperio" or "Crucio", it wouldn't matter since they can be done non-verbally, making that sort of Taboo pointless. Its possible that the Taboo might only work on one single word at a time (e.g. "Voldemort"). So the Ministry might not even be able to Taboo "Avada Kedavra". It explains why the Death Eater-controlled Ministry didn't put more words under the Taboo (i.e. "Horcrux" or "Horcruxes").

** It'd be an excellent way to set up an ambush on Snatchers. Or, if the entire Wizarding World just randomly started chanting "Voldemort, Voldemort, Voldemort!" every morning, whoever is in charge of listening to the Taboo and dispatching hit squads would have a massive headache.

*** There was a story I read where Harry uses that in the end. It wasn't a very long read, I believe, but he sets up a spike pit and just calls out "Voldemort!" every few minutes with Shacklebolt and all the Snatchers/Death Eaters keep apparating in and falling lmao

** My headcanon is in the first war if someone says Voldemort name in the presence of death eaters or his spies, they get a visit from the DEs at night. A great way to induce fear. That's why no one ever says his name unless your name is Dumbledore.

Dumbledore just wished that if everyone says his name then it would be useless as no one gonna attack every family. They put taboo using resources from Ministry after over throwing it.

** The stories I've seen that address the subject take the view that Dumbledore was trying to make Voldemort's name so commonplace that a Taboo would be impractical. If there are a hundred triggers in the first five minutes of setting it up, either the spell behind it will run out of power, or there simply won't be enough Snatchers to actually follow up.

** The best explanation I've seen is that if by the time the second war started everyone was used to using his name all the time the whole Taboo thing would become useless since thee would be too many calls for them to track. Kind of the same reason he didn't put a Taboo in his true name, since Tom is such a common name he would get tons of calls for second.

If everyone said his name then knowing when and where would be useless.
