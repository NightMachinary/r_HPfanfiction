** The character is very holier-than-thou which makes him unlikable and using "lol" in a story is a little... Childish. Moreover, the writing becomes repetitive as the character continuously says what he's doing e.g. "I did, I thought, I saw, etc".

But... you made a story! And that's the first and biggest step. If you want people to continue to read and enjoy your stories then you just have to continue to make small steps to become better. Keep trying :)
