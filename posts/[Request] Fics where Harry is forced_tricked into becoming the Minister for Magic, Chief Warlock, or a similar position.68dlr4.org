** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): He took the Minister position reluctantly, and resigned as soon as the transition period was over.

I feel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is getting there. Harry might be forced to take the position of Chief Warlock so that magical Britain didn't tear itself apart. This story should have a role reversal from Canon for him and Hermione, in that he would set the policies while she would lead the troops.

*** I feel like Delenda Est only barely fits the requirements of the OP.

**** Yes, barely, but OP is asking for something extremely rare. The example he/she gave fits even less well than "Delenda Est".

***** I see. I only commented on Delenda Est since I've actually read the fic before. He doesn't really get the position during the storyline itself.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
