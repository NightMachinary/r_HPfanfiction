Disclaimer: This is mostly me rambling and ranting about how I find Voldemort is treated in fan fiction. I also wanted to highlight some great stories I've read in hopes that it'll lead me to other great Voldemort fics. If your story or a story you like is not in alignment with my preferences please note that they are merely my personal opinions. I don't mean to offend anyone with my opinions and if I do so I apologize. Also sorry for the formatting and unnecessary bloat. Onward!

I always disliked the commonly accepted notion that Voldemort was born "evil" because he was conceived under the influence of a love potion. While the Harry Potter series is near and dear to my heart it does have the problem of having a flat villain. The love potion = not being able to understand love idea contributes to the flat character problem. If all Voldemort's actions are caused by the love potion theory then he's set up for failure from the very start. I dislike this pre-destined type of story but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7658662/1/All_Roads_Lead_to_Rome][*All Roads Lead to Rome*]] by *Alemantele* is a good exception due to it's well thought out and well written state.

If Voldemort is not inherently evil then his environment must have caused him to become who he became. Then if something or /someone/ were to change that environment then Tom Riddle might not have become Lord Voldemort. Thus the time travel fic was born. The problem I have with time-travel fics is that they don't really resolve well. Usually, the main conflict, when involving Voldemort, is to change him so he doesn't become a dark lord. The only two outcomes is success or failure. You can add a bunch of drama in between but it's usually predictable how the story will go. I suspect that's why there's very rarely finished multi-chapter time travel fics of this line. And of course the vast majority of time travel fics will have the time traveler and Tom Riddle fall in love and through that romantic love redeem him. One of the best time-travel to change Tom stories I've read is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting_Thomas][Doubting Thomas]]* by *AzarDarkstar* where instead of romantic love, it's parental love that changes Tom. Luna goes back in time after the war ended badly to make sure it doesn't have to happen. Another bit of pre-destination at the end there but I find the parallels rather satisfying. Another time travel fic I enjoyed involves Luna, again, except this time as an unknowing participant in *[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/646653?view_adult=true][Fear of the Unknown]]* by *black_hat_with_bells*. Child Luna is transported to Tom's orphanage after a time turner accident and Tom hates her. What I love about this fic is that child Tom still has all the sociopathic tendencies he's shown to have in canon and in this story we get to experience it first hand through his perspective. I think it avoids the pitfalls of most time travel fics because it doesn't try to tie everything into a neat "and this is how they lived the rest of their lives" bow. This story, and Doubting Thomas, was never about whether Tom Riddle will or won't end up becoming Lord Voldemort but rather the experience of meeting Luna and how it affected him. The ending is open but it is complete and that's how I think time-travel stories should be like.

Another thing that annoys me is Voldemort and the romance genre. I don't actually hate romance involving Voldemort if it's well written and makes sense for the characters involved. I'm just really, really tired of going through pages and pages of LV/HP or LV/ HG, GW, DM, etc. in hopes of finding a good fic that doesn't twist Voldemort into some Byronic antihero who can be redeemed only by the power of love or worse changes the other person into accepting/excusing all his terrible actions. The only pairing I actually like is Voldemort/Bellatrix and only if the story acknowledges how twisted their relationship is.

For example [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/862776?view_adult=true][*Dammable*]] by *deslea* does a great job of exploring Voldemort's character through the context of the relationship between him and Bellatrix. The Voldemort we are familiar with from the books is one that rules mainly through fear and ruthlessness so it's interesting to see a charming, glib Voldemort that appealed to the Pureblood elite. We also get to see a Voldemort that still has some human qualities attached to him despite how much he wishes he could get rid of them.

The Voldemort/Luna Lovegood *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3037156/][Twelve Dark Moons]]* by *Sophiax* was also a really good read. (Quick note. You'll notice that a lot of these recommendations involve Luna. This is the fic that started my search for other Luna+Voldemort fics) Normally I really dislike the cliche Harry/Hermione/Ginny/order member/original character gets captured by Death Eaters, is for some absurd reason spared by Voldemort, falls in love, and either turns to the "dark side" or /shudder/ changes Voldemort into a "good" guy. I'm not saying this premise is bad (except for the last part) but it's often badly done and untrue to the characters. In order for these types of stories to work one or both of the characters will have drastic changes to their characters. This isn't the case for this story. Luna is still recognizable as Luna from beginning to end. She never excuses Voldemort for his abhorrent actions and the author certainly doesn't shy away from including them in this story. To my knowledge this story was started before /Deathly Hallows/ was released so the exact details of how the horcruxes worked was still unknown but the way the author uses them in a very clever way which, I believe, explains the changes in Voldemort's character. Even saying that though Voldemort doesn't really change much at all. He's still trying to kill Harry Potter, gain power and take over magical Britain. He still does terrible things and treats everyone around him as pawns but by the end he's gained a very little something which injects an extra dimension to his flat evil villain role in canon. Twelve Dark Moons, despite this post being about Voldemort, is still a story with Luna as the protagonist and thus explores Luna's character: her isolation from the rest of the Order due to her eccentricity, her ability to adapt to dangerous and terrifying situations, and her belief in looking for goodness in everything. It also explores the duality between humanity and monstrosity. What defines a monster? Is it their nature or their actions? Overall I think this fic really exemplifies a solid Voldemort/x fic and just a solid piece of fiction in general.

I find Voldemort grooming Harry to be his heir or something really problematic and squicky (yes, even the ones where they don't end up as lovers and Voldemort acts like a "father-figure"). Voldemort does bad things. I don't want to read about a child being taught to do bad things and believing it's okay. Those that try to invert the story and present Voldemort with good intentions and extreme methods are probably worse than those that have him still be the "bad" guy. Unless the author clearly treats the manipulation, torture, murder, etc. as bad in universe and states that they absolutely understand that fact in author notes I'm not even going to give it a chance. The only dark!Harry story I'll be remotely interested in reading is one which has baby Harry die on the night of prophecy and Voldemort takes over his body through some horcrux shenanigans or something.

Finally, I've rarely found any good humorous Voldemort fics. I guess it's hard to find humor in a situation where you're either afraid for your life or constantly thinking of murdering Harry Potter all the time. [[http://mahaliem.livejournal.com/157090.html][*Voldemort in the Loony Bin*]] by *mahaliem* is pretty great though.

*tl;dr:* Recommend me fics where Voldemort is a main character where he's still a (competent) bad guy, does not fall in love with anyone (but especially not with Harry, Hermione, Draco or Ginny), and doesn't raise Harry Potter to be his heir/lover.

I definitely would have liked to see a sequel from the same author but it's still a very solid story on it's own.

Rectifier isn't so good. I usually give multi chapter stories of this length around 3 chapters or so but there were too many things that annoyed me about it for me to continue. There isn't enough build up and character development when we're introduced to Tom Riddle to really accept his behavior. It's also hard to believe Dumbledore would just accept Tom's story so easily and just let him do whatever.

*** Sure I'm not arguing that, but from my personal experience a lot of the community I've encounteres still subscribe to this idea and it's reflected in their stories. Besides, not all members of the HP fandom follow every word that the author puts out about the universe. That's why widely followed interpretations are still based on the books which never made it clear the effect of the love potion and Tom Riddle's conception. If it were clear then the author would never had to clarify in the first place after all.

***** ??? I don't think so. I'm merely giving my opinion that it's hard to justify Tom choosing Hufflepuff without any changes to his canon character.

** Best one I recommend is A Riddled Universe. Great story telling but Tom doesn't become Voldemort, but you can still see what an amazing character he is. I recommend it to anyone to read this. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe]] linkffn(A Riddled Universe by hazeldragon)
