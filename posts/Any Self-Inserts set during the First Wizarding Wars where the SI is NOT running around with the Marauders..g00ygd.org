** If I was in the same year as them, I'd find Lily and Severus' cabin on the Express prior to First Year and convince them both to try for Ravenclaw. How?

*Me*: "They're the Smart House, and have their own library."\\
**Lily Gasps\**\\
*Sev*: "I didn't think of that."\\
*Me*: "Want to help me find one of their prefects and interrog- I mean verify?"\\
**Lily&Sev stand\**\\
*Me*: "Brill!"

Has the SI drop in pre-Marauders era... as a 11year old; the story timeskips the early years and then is about the SI creating stuff and being special in Hogwarts

*** That one's a toss-up in terms of quality, and i'm pretty sure it starts and happens before the first wizarding war.

Had a nice start, and then got bogged down doing stuff and being special in 5th year and summer afterwards - not unreadable, but a bit powerwanky (though, let's be honest - if any of us were to be SI'd into Hogwarts we'd want to powercreep the fuck out of the magic system, and propably succeed at that).

It does a good job on worldbuilding of magical US though
