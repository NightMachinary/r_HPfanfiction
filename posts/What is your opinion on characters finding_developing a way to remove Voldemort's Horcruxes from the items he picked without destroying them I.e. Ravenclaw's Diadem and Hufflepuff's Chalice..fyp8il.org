I just find it to be a waste to completely destroy the Founders' relics when they could (Hufflepuff and Slytherin) or have (Ravenclaw) so much useful and powerful... powers. I particularly liked the way the Diadem was pictured in /Lady Archimedes/ by White Squirrel and the Chalice and Resurrection's Stone from /The Imposter's Complex/ by Notus Oren and I just think any character who has a tad bit of common sense would try to access to this power to defeat Voldemort.


** I don't mind if an author does it, but in my personal headcanon I view it differently:

The horcrux is not /in/ the diadem, the diadem /is/ the horcrux. There is no part of the diadem that isn't the horcrux, and the horcrux is nothing but the diadem. And the only way for it to stop being a horcrux, is for it to stop being the diadem.

This would explain why Harry has to die, why the diary can be so powerful, and why Voldemort chose important objects. If you hesitate to destroy them, then you might lose your chance.

Anyway, this is all personal opinion, but I feel like it fits the magic and world of HO better.

*** I agree. I figure if there was a way Dumbledore could remove Horcrouxs safely he would have done so. He would have used it on the ring. He would have used it on n Harry also. Even a manipulative Dumbledore story would use this method. Finding priceless artifacts can only help him.

****** Can I give you an example of it? From canon?

A sixteen year old Draco Malfoy managed to bypass all the protections placed upon Hogwarts by Dumbledore using a pair of Vanishing Cabinets and brought Death Eaters inside the castle; something Dumbledore believed impossible. He also managed to smuggle a poison inside the castle that almost killed a person and could've killed two others; sheer luck and some quick thinking saved all three.

No matter how intelligent, celebrated or knowledgeable Dumbledore is, he is neither omniscient nor infallible.

******* The vanishing cabinet was in the room of requirement I think. I think the room didn't even show up on the Marauders map. Headcannon could be that it's outside of the school wards. The argument could be made for the chamber of secrets also. Maybe the founders had agreed to have their offices or whatever not under the school wards. After hundreds of years and no direct heir's the offices were lost. Would the school wards look for poisons? Wasn't it common for things to be smuggled from Hogsmede?

With Dumbledore cannon or otherwise he would have access to most information or ways to do things. If he wanted to see if the goblins had a way to remove the soul from the items why not ask Bill Weasley? Dumbledore wouldn't have to straight up ask the goblins for help if he didn't want to for whatever reason. You have to also ask why can't he go to the Unspeakables (I think there cannon) Basically Dumbledore should have a greater possibility of finding a answer or finding someone else who can. Dumbledore could even go through Slughorn to go to the private sector.

******** My point was that saying "if there was a way, Dumbledore would've done it" is a /bad argument/ mainly because the man isn't infallible or omniscient. There is always the chance that he hasn't thought of something.

Dumbledore knew about the Room of Requirement. The Vanishing Cabinets bypassed the wards entirely. The cabinets would've worked even if they were outside the room; it merely provided Malfoy a secret place to work. Something Dumbledore should've investigated.

Dumbledore had Filch examining all objects and people entering and leaving the castle. *Filch.* A squib who can't do magic. That's how the poison got through.

********* I mentioned also it could not have been just Dumbledore. He could have tried to find someone to do it if he couldn't. Surely he may have had contacts. He seemed to be on good terms with Slughorn and assumed there had to be a reason Slughorn went into hiding. It wouldn't just be Dumbledore but potentially a few people just knowing enough to get the job done.

Snape was reporting on Draco's progress wasn't he? Remember Snape gave a unbreakable how to "help" Draco. No death eater would question Bellatrix. I would have assumed even Voldemort was able to trust Snape after hearing about the vow. Dumbledore didn't need to investigate when Snape could be claim to be checking Draco's progress. Snape didn't have to directly help with the work because he could claim the Dark Lord gave you the job.

The posion and I think the necklace was a desperate move on Draco's part when progress wasn't going well.

It shows Slughorn was the one who got the Mead from Rosemerta. Slughorn never checked the Mead. Draco was working through Rosemerta.

linkffn(13140418)

In this one, Harry Potter finds Slytherins locket and Horace Slughorn, who told Riddle about the Horcruxes in the first place, had the theory that a killing curse could remove the bit of Voldemorts soul from the locket without destroying it.

In theory, it is even canon. After all, Harry got struck by a killing curse, which took care of that for him in the original books.

** Throughout history people who had access to a Horcrux were either the creator or someone loyal to the creator who would not want to risk harming it, or someone who would want to immediately destroy it using a proven method like fiendfyre.

Nobody was ever in the position of having multiple Horcruxes to experiment on available, so someone like Dumbledore could probably make quite a few new discoveries about how one works and how to destroy one.

There was a fic I forget the name of that commented on how useless the intelligence-boosting Diadem had been (I think it might've been Fairy Heroes?) - in the story, Rowena neglected her daughter, her daughter stole it, and the baron killed himself and the grey lady over it. All making really stupid mistakes and decisions, which the Diadem didn't prevent. It was a really interesting rationale for "Actually, we should totally destroy these things." that I quite liked.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

** I think it's safe to say that the MCs are quite lacking in the common sense department.

To get the soul-pieces out of the artifacts and not destroy the items themselves is a much better alternative compared to destroying pretty powerful enchanted items like the Diadem. Authors can use some sort of excorcism mechanic to do this, it's not like they can't do it or anything.
