So Harry partially loses his ability to talk to intelligent snakes and discovers it at ch 29 year 2. When does he fully regain his ability?


** If I remember correctly he doesn't actually lose is ability at any point. Instead a head trauma coincides with the real heir of Slytherin ordering all the snakes in Hogwarts not to respond to anyone but the heir. In one of the author's notes the writer mentions that a reader suggested that Harry use a conjured snake as an intermediary to bypass the ban on communication

*** Ah, thank Merlin for that. I had so much trouble to continue to read when it was uncertain he would ever regain it. Many thanks!

**** If it's an issue, the author /does/ implement some power adjustment somewhere around the 100 chapter mark. I say power adjustment because Harry was on his way to being too overpowered for the narrative. And also I'm fairly sure he will find a way around his new limitation at some later Point.

***** Fairly sure because you haven't read far enough or the author hasn't written it yet?
