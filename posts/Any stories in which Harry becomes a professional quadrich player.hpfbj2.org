I remember two in which he received offers while in school, but both were abandoned before he got to play even one match as a professional. Could be either while in Hogwarts or after.


** Try hope by jeconais

Or linkffn(letters) both are quidditch focused

  This is a strange rewrite (even for me) - - I am taking a throw away 'sub-plot' from an abandoned story by 'Jeconais' and expanding it. It involves a well intentioned Hermione setting Harry up for a couple of blind dates with girls ... dates that Harry didn't ask for (thus the title) I am a huge Ron fan and I like to put him in situations where he looks good. enjoy

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
