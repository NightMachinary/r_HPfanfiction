** That sounds like a nice idea, especially if it was Frank and Alice that raised them both. There's no reason they shouldn't have been under the Fidelius charm as well, if they were subjects of the prophecy. Frank and James should of just been each others secret keepers. Mutually assured destruction.

*** That's such a great idea. I can't see any faults in the plan unless you force headcanon that people under any Fidelius charm can't be secret keepers

**** I mean that is “canon.” But it's there strictly because JKR needed them to die but was totally ok for Bill to do.

** There is a really long ongoing fic where Neville is BWL and he and Harry are raised by James and Lily. It has 40 something chapters but it's super slow paced, both story-wise and update-wise.

  What if Voldemort chose to mark Neville as his equal instead of Harry? Neville and Harry get raised side-by-side by the Potters, that's what.
