I've seen dozens and dozens of Harry or Hermione time travel fics where they get to undo mistakes and try to minimize loss of live etc.. but I can not ever recall seeing a fic where Dumbledore gets sent back..


** There it is! That took me a few minutes to find...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure-Part-1]])

..it's actually more of an AU that pure Time Travel, but it's the only one I've ever seen.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** Funnily, this is the second time I've recommended this for completely different reasons in the past week, and I've never recommended it before.

Linkffb(A Collection of Harmonious OneShots) Chapter 4, specifically. The time travel is only a few hours, so maybe not what you're thinking of, but it's the only fic I know that has time travel wifh Dumbledore.

  When Albus Dumbledore is killed by Draco Malfoy on the Astronomy Tower, he welcomes Death with open arms. However, Death isn't ready to accept him yet, believing that Albus still has a few lessons to learn and mistakes to correct. Albus is promptly reborn as Draco Malfoy! (Realistic Dumbledore, no bashing of any character)
