:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for this fic I read a couple years ago. I remember it was some combination of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, maybe even Draco, going back in time to probably prevent the second war??? McGonagall and Sirius are there? All I really remember is at the end, the time travelers leave, and the adults watch them disappear over a hill, thinking about how the time travelers changed their lives.
