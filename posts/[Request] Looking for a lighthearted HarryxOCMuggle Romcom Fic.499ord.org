I'm in mobile.

I want to request a fic where Harry meets a muggle and develops romance with her. I have already seen Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy but what I want to read is something more lighthearted, kinda romcom. Something similar to Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19

Thanks.


** I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but there aren't much in the way of good muggle/Harry romances. Behind Blue Eyes and Grow Young with Me are without a doubt the best, and I have never read another that holds a candle to them. Sorry :/
