To be more specific. I'd love to see a Harry that's kind of like Dumbledore. A complete genius, but also completely mad. He's a little less concerned with saving the philosophers stone, and a little more concerned with figuring out how the mirror of erised worked, or playing with Fluffy. An example would something like linkffn(7796463) or here: linkffn(4810036)


** Some people will probably hate me, but at least the beginning of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Less Wrong).

What also has a /very/ quirky fem!Harry: linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin)

An even different definition of quirky applies to linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby? by SpoonandJohn)

#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

#+begin_quote
  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
