What are your favorite well-written incest fics?

I prefer:

- Harry centric.

- Incest on characters in some way related to Harry.

- Non-slash.

- Decent plot and writing

Anything good here? I liked Odepius Flower.

Kind of difficult to find well-written fics here because Harry doesn't have any living relations in canon.

Harry/Fem!Dudley, sadly abandoned.\\
Rather sweet story about two broken children.

** linkffn(Equal and Opposite) MIGHT fit the bill. Otherwise Harry Potter and the Future Remapped, which isn't nearly as good. The former is harry/fem!Harry the latter is Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix time travel in the Marauders era.

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

** Dragon Lily, by Werewolf Warrior. It's Harry/Lily/Narcissa. It's abandoned and deleted but you can find a copy through Google. It's a very well written story, both plot and smut. His other story A Big Happy Weasley Family is also a good read (no incest though, which is what you asked for).

Holly Polter. In some ways a sequel to Holly Evans and the Spiral Path but it's not strictly necessary to read that first.

*** linkao3(1727183), I think. Thanks for the mention!

I'll just go back to upvoting to counter the hate, now.

**** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1727183][*/Holly Polter/*]] by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/wordhammer/pseuds/wordhammer][/wordhammer/]]

#+begin_quote
  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in 'subject to entanglement').

  #+begin_example
      If you've never heard of Holly Evans, here's the short version: In another world, Lily's protection went further, merging Lily with her son Harry to make Holly, except that she forgot everything Lily knew and had to grow up in Harry's place\. This was her first step on the road to becoming a Dark Lady in her own right\. The second step was shattering the Philosopher's Stone\. The third probably was falling in love with a quite heterosexual Hermione Granger\. Somewhere around step 37, Holly Marked Nymphadora Tonks as her vassal, using a Spiral Mark derived from Riddle's Dark Mark\. Between Tonks' shapeshifting and Holly's need for frequent orgasms to keep Riddle's splinter of soul in her head at bay, Holly became quite adventurous, sexually speaking\.

*** Tried to read Holly Evans, I've gone between enjoying it and flipping the table in rage/frustration multiple times... Just couldn't bring myself to finish it and I was so close to the end

Edit: just saw the author on the post below hello [[/u/wordhammer]] your story frustrates me and not in a good way

**** Thanks for giving it a try. If you feel the urge to give me what-for about it, feel free to send a PM or communicate however you prefer. I'm still learning, still trying, and still subjecting the fandom to stories about Holly.

***** Nah not gonna rip into you about it, the story itself was good. Just the way it progresses made me all sorts of sad/grumpy, I'll probably finish the last... Four? Chapters eventually.

*** I think you're looking for Hinamori Kidou Master's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10525361/1/Getting-Wet][Getting Wet]] which has been taken down by the original author, but saved by another. Yoyomans1234567890 has all(?) of her stories I think.

ETA: real mature down voting everyone in the thread anonymous vigilante.
