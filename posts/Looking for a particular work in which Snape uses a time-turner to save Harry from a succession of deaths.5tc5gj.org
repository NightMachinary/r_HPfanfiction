I am looking for a piece of work I read a while ago, the main premise of which was that Severus Snape had to save Harry Potter from a vast succession of ridiculous deaths during his time at Hogwarts, via the use of Dumbledore's Time-turner.

I think it started off with a ridiculous accident, but because time wants to retain its shape, that means Harry was a magnet for danger of every kind, and Snape had his work cut out keeping up with the continuous deaths of the Boy-Who-Lived.

A highlight included ten (or fourteen?) different Snapes trying to get Harry to survive the first task.

I'm almost certain it's completed, and I believe it was a multichapter work. It covered all of Harry's time at Hogwarts at least through Year 5, and I think for longer.

I believe I found it originally looking for stories updated less than one year ago that contained Severus Snape, but I tried that again looking for it now, and it didn't work. I tried a Google search for various permutations of First Task, Severus Snape, Harry Potter, and Time-Turner, but got too many hits.

I tried DLP Scryer, and didn't have much luck there, either, so I'm hoping one of you kind souls recognizes what I'm talking about.

** That sounds awesome, wish it was on fanfiction. I'll read it on the bright background though for Snarry!

*** I believe you can change the way AoO is displayed by going to your account and clicking on my preferences and then skins. Then choose public site skins and there are quite a few available in various colours. I'm currently using Reversi, which is a comfortable dark grey background and white latters - not too diffirent from this subreddit.
