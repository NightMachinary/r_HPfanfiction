Hello! I've just finished the first chapter of a story I'd like to write.

Sirius ends up blind, because of an accident during potion. I am blind myself and I want to develop his carachter and the plot taking a realistic approach toward what happens when you become disabled as an adult, or almost, and how you've to aggiust to your new reality.\\
My writing style is a bit weird and I'm not sure if it's suited to fanfiction.\\
That's why this story is somewhat of a test.\\
Interesting feetbacks or suggestions are welcomed.

Here it goes.\\

** Interesting and I liked the countdown but there's some major formatting and spelling errors I'd fix. You need to do like extra lines of space in ao3 or it won't show up right, because I've had that same problem. I don't know if I'd use Snape's POV at the beginning or James' at the end, but I tend to like chapters to be divided so that I'd there is a POV switch it's more distinct and doesn't just repeat the same information too much. But I definitely think the concept is great and you're definitely getting there but the story seems like it needs more filler or detail because you'll end up with like a ton of tiny chapters which I know can turn some people off. Hope this helps!
