Hi, I'm new to here but I've been reading HP fanfiction for waaaay too long! So I have been enjoying this reddit before I decided to pop in and say 'Hi'!

There are many cross-overs and many popular cross-over sources (twilight, Naruto, Doctor Who), many for a good reason, however, a few gems lay hidden away. What are some of your favourites? I'll start!

Aladdin is a great movie but there are very few cross-overs. Among those few, however, is a great, albeit unfinished, master piece. linkffn(4476202)

Another favourite of mine is from the possibly lesser known, Young Dracula. There are a couple of good stories in this small selection, however a favourite of mine is 'A Normal Life' linkffn(8976764).

I can't wait to hear what other hidden gems others have found.


** linkffn(Culture Shock) takes a Harry from a phenomenal sci-fi post-production society and introduces him to Hogwarts. Unfinished, but reallllyyyy good.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

**** Culture novels are /incredible/. This fanfic is actually what introduced me to them! I absolutely love the way Ian M. Banks writes, and as a huge fan of transhumanism and post-production societies, the Culture novels are quite /literally/ worth their weight in gold for me.

** Of course there are the 'obvious' crossovers; like the ones you mention, or Marvel, or the Lord of the Rings, or even Buffy. But everyone's seen those, right? Most are just plain crappy anyway.

But what about a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10568823/1/Average][HP/NCIS crossover]]? That's pretty strange, right? And pretty well done too.

Things like Star Wars or Star Trek may be strangely uncommon, but they're hardly /weird/.

But what about a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10968606/1/Why-Luna-Lovegood-Should-Never-be-in-Charge-of-Anything][HP/Frozen crossover]]? That's gotta be worth something even if it could be much better.

Then there's stuff that /should/ have way more crossovers, I mean HP/Highlander or HP/Cthulhu basically writes itself, right?

Do you really think so? I would've thought that if that were such an obvious crossover as you imply, more people would've written one. FF.net only has 23 of those listed in the proper fandom categories however.

*** These are great! I hadn't thought to check out the Frozen or Pacific Rim categories before (exactly my point in making this thread :) ).

Although, I was thinking of categories that ffnet has less than 20 or so stories in, but I have to agree, NCIS is a great cross over genre and this is a good story. I've not actually ever really seen NCIS (maybe half an episode here and there), but a lot of my knowledge of NCIS comes from HP crossovers with it (and Alex Rider crossovers with NCIS).

** I'm a big fan of HP/Stargate x-overs.

linkffn(Oma's Choice by jacobds) is a great one. Long and complete.

linkffn(Harry Potter and The Alteran Gift by robertbryan) is another. I faintly remember this one. Don't think it was complete when read through it, though it is now.

linkffn(Isis's Bane by althor42) is one of the first HP/SG1 cross-overs that I ran into. It's great. The author couldn't decide which way to go with the story, and wrote a second sequel that takes the story in a different direction.

linkffn(Guardian by Blueowl) is another good one.

*** Ohhhhh! I'm a HUGE fan of stargate (all of them) and Harry Potter cross-overs. I've actually written my own crossover for them (which I shall not share because it needs a lot of work). I have read a lot of stargate/HP stories and love them all.

I love Oma's choice, although I was surprised at the sudden ending of it. The Guardian is a great premise and a nice story. I just LOVE the Isis Bane series. All of them are brilliant :D

One of my favourite HP/SG1 story and, indeed, one of my all time favourites on ffnet is Fighting The Gods linkffn(2994996). I also went to add another story about Harry ascending, killing Voldemort and therefore being banished to Abydos... only I can't find it anymore! It was a story that got better and better before the last chapter made this huge revelation etc. it was awesome and now I have to consider that it may be taken down! This is horrible!

Sorry, I got a little side tracked now. Lots of great stories. Thanks for sharing :)

linkffn(8575201) /Harry Potter and the Escape to New York/ by /Writing Warriors/, where Harry leaves the Dursleys behind in a feat of accidental magic and grows up in a New York of the late 1980's Beauty and the Beast TV series.

linkffn(9136440) /Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy Bears and Spot/ by /Clell65619/, where Harry grows up with the Munsters. A funny/cracky alternate to all those HP/Addams Family x-overs I've seen lately.

linkffn(5714450) /The Crow: Phoenix Rising/ by /Belcris/. What if, instead of Eric Draven, Harry Potter had been resurrected by a crow? This is that story.

linkffn(3168612) /Harry Potter and the Boondock Saints/ by /Kalistar/. I have to admit that I don't remember reading this one, but it jumped out at me when I looked for rare crossovers. Should probably read it myself again at some point!

linkffn(8400788) linkffn(8707895) linkffn(10499319) /Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens/ and its sequels /Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure/ and /Inquisitor Carrow and the Tournament of Tribulations/ by /littlewhitecat/ is a funny series to the length of almost 350k words about a Harry Potter at Hogwarts that's just a bit too strange for everyone's tastes. Warhammer 40k crossover. I don't think I read everything back when I put it on my list, so it probably annoyed me at some point.

linkffn(10652736) /Lone Traveler: Harry Potter in Arcadia/ by /dunuelos/. Not my favorite by a long stretch, but it's the only Harry Potter crossover with /Joan of Arcadia/ on record.

linkffn(10767188) /Poppa John/ by /MSgt SilverDollar/, in which Harry's father figure is none other than John Rambo. I haven't read this story either, but it's been on my to-read list for months. Sadly it will forever remain incomplete, since the author died this summer.

** I'm a big fan of horror crossovers. I like the juxtaposition of the high fantasy of Harry Potter and something much more gritty and bloody.

One of my favorites is *Jurassic Park* crossovers, the best of which I think is The Point of No Return linkffn(9727741) which has a sadly very slow update rate.

*Hannibal* crossovers haven't quiet gotten the level of horror right yet, especially things like Hadrian Lecter: Becoming linkffn(10280220) which just isn't bloody enough. Gaining Innocence linkffn(10116207) is a bit better in the gore regard, but has a few overused tropes at the start to get through. There are some Hermione/Hannibal fics out there too, but I'm not a fan of Hermione, so I can't tell you have good they are.

I had high hopes for *Resident Evil* crossovers, but they always sort of become OP Harry fics... Resident Evil: Potter Style linkffn(7344753) has OP Harry, but is a good read none the less. A Different Life linkffn(8708283) is very dark, and has slash-incest, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.

A favorite of mine is Weapons of Light and Dark linkffn(7849109), a surprisingly dark *X Men* crossover, maybe because it is more a crossover with the weapons X program (warning endgame is Harry/Logan, but there isn't anything except primal Logan lusting after Harry until much much later in the story).

On the non horror side, *Grimm* crossovers are surprisingly fun. Not as Grimm as it Seems linkffn(8772657) is cute, don't be put off by the short chapters, there is plot development as well. I also want to recommend pretty much any crossover by esama, their three most popular *Sherlock* crossovers, Business linkao3(1113588), Whispers in Corners (slash) linkao3(1134255), and Magnificent (some minor slash) linkao3(1113600) are truly brilliant. Esama also has a set of Tumbling HP Crossovers drabbles linkao3(1647644) which are generally good. The Island of Fire series (starts with The Island of Fire linkao3(3236603)) is a wonderful *Temeraire* by Naomi Novik crossover which has been copied a number of times now.

  Stripped of his humanity, Logan became Weapon X. When the doctors were through; he was little more than a remote controlled beast guided by base instinct. In contrast, Harry became Weapon IX and was stripped of his human trappings. Care, love, and compassion were torn from him, creating a superb machine who kills without remorse. Is that all they will ever be? *Slash*

*** Wow! That's a great selection of stories. Also, if I had read this just 10 mintues ago, I would probably turn you deaf with my shouting (or is it blind since this is text). I'm a huge fan of esama (Whispers in the Corners is a great story), but I thought they had left fanfiction so all I had was a collection of stories that I had downloaded. To see more stories and an active profile on AO3 (something I didn't know about - how I'm not sure about but still) has me jumping off the walls. I'm soooo excited.

I've read a couple of your recommendations such as the Hannibal and Jurassic Park cross overs and have to agree with your choices. They are brilliant! Thanks for sharing :)
