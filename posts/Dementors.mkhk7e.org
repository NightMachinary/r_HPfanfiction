Why did Harry react so strong to them? I never understood why they targeted him explicitely (come on, he doesn't have that many happy memories) instead of, lets say, Hermione or Ron. The way I see it, Dementors could have more food with these two.


** ‚ÄúThe Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.‚Äù - Lupin in PoA

Edit: and it doesn't seem like they targeted him explicitly. He just knows more trauma than his peers.

*** Dementors make you recall your worst memories, so for Ron that might be the time his teddybear was turned into a spider which would make him feel pretty shitty. Harry however would recall his parents death, his not so happy childhood, his confrontation with Quirrel/Voldemort and the Basilisk and Riddles diary.

**** I think I remember that in the books, the dementors didn't specifically target Harry. They were just there and Harry got the most intense reaction of it.

In the quidditch match, they were drawn by the whole stadium, not just Harry.

Feed as in they're attracted to /present/ happiness. Harry wasn't unhappy in the compartment or during the match. And Ginny, who was just as affected, didn't live anymore of an unhappy life than Ron.

** They don't feed on emotions, they feed on souls.

Why do you think they affected Harry more than anyone else?

Lupin thought it was the trauma but every kid has trauma. Susan bones lost her whole family. Luna saw her mother die in front of her. Neville's Parents were tortured to death and he has to see them every week. Harry doesn't even remember his parents.

So what makes Harry special? He's a Horcrux. Two souls for Dementors to feed off. Two tortured souls, one broken beyond repair, one lost in grief. That would make Harry irresistible.

The scream Harry hears? It's the last thing Voldemort heard before he was obliterated. Hearing his mum isn't Harry's worst memory. It's Voldemorts.

** There's another post which has dementors sucking away happiness allowing bad memories to come to the surface. Harry has fewer happy memories to insulate, so his bad memories pop up sooner than a happier individual. This is the most logical thing to me.
