** I posted about this 5 months ago (I looked!) but I figured it was worth another link out there in the world since I just broke 100k words. WHICH IS A LOT OF WORDS. I have been writing for a very long time and I am pretty sure I've never broken 100k before.

Threesomes+ actually. Usually denotes a harem fic. Also, your reaction made me laugh.

******* By my reading experience, multi isn't a harem. It sometimes indicates simply that the main character goes through more than one romantic relationship. Sometimes it's meant as 'sometimes there will be more than two in the bed'.

A harem usually mean that the women, once bedded by the 'hero', never leave to pursue other relationships. Their lives are lived forevermore in the orbit of their +conqueror+ +collector+ I mean 'rescuer'.

** I have been following this fic for a while and I really like It! It's a refreshing take on SS/LE interactions and "relationship" in that it's actually believable, especially in the later chapters. I am interested to see what happens.

*** Thank you so much!

I love the ship precisely BECAUSE of how totally fucked up it can be. So many writers--good writers doing beautiful work, work that I like a lot!--forget that Snape is, at his heart, just not a very nice person, and that Lily stood up to him.

**** That is so true. It seems so often that even if a fic starts out good it just ends up turning Snape into this do no evil, romantic, almost sad type of character. Lily or whoever else is a main character is usually not much better, suddenly forgetting all his faults and deciding that he is the best person ever. It just makes me wonder where most of his personality went and it's quite frustrating.

I like reading fics with him as a main character precisely because of his bad attitude, questionable morality, the sarcastic bitter comments on everything and everyone. Or even something that shows his more dangerous and powerful side. If you take that all away, you may as well be writing an OC.

***** Totally! I mean, I can enjoy a softer Snape in some contexts, in some versions--like, SnapeLives!AU where many years have passed, for example, or very very specific kinds of Severitus. But the overwhelming amount of the time, I have to agree. Snape is an angry, bitter man who is actively cruel to make himself feel better and is not above hurting people for reasons they'll never know. And, at the same time, his greatest acts--the arc of entire latter half of his life!--is motivated by love. He's not a good dude! He's a complicated one!
