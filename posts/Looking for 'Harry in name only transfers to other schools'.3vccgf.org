I read one awhile back with an excellent OC character where Harry transferred to Durmstang (?) and befriended the daughter of a death eater, but that want revealed until later on in the fic.points if you can find this one, but I am also looking for general recs.

Prefer romance or accomplishment focuses - example being the animagus transformation, highly developed charms or transfiguration work, or interesting classes and such. Time travel is a favorite, but I haven't seen any in this particular genre before so not really expecting it.

Or feel free to rec any decent 'HINO' even if it doesn't have a school transfer. I'm bored of the regular reading material, lol.


** The one you mentioned is linkffn(HP and the Boy who Lived by the Santi).

Other candidates:

linkffn(the Brave New World by Bellerophon30;HP and the Irish Choice by Disobedience Writer;Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity)

Alexandra Quick isn't Harry at all, but the stories cover American schools and related culture in such detail that it'd be a crime not to try them out.

*** I wouldn't rec Brave New World for a variety of reasons. First, the romance is so obviously some sort of author SI or plot convenience since Harry decides to date some random chick and marry her because magic. Secondly, the story rewards characters depending on how much the author likes him/her. Are the character's unappealing to the author? Well, they are suddenly not worthy to hang out around the great Harry Potter (including Ron and Hermione). Also, it gets really boring in the middle for the sake of the author expounding his/her knowledge of the American way of higher education.

Honestly, it's a very boring/pandering story with some moments of good action. YMMV

*** Also worth noting is that Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived has 12 chapters posted on ffn, but 17 posted to the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/index.php][DLP forums]] work by author section. Of course, one needs to be a user with at least 5 good posts (iirc) to be able to view that section.

**** Has someone downloaded them and posted them elsewhere? I don't care much for system they have there and making an account to get 5 reward points isnt worth it to me - making an account at all is a stretch for me.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.
