~ Harry leaves after 5th year. ~ goes to an American school { 1 of 4} ~ doesn't tell hermione because he thinks she will tell dumbledore ~ plenty of OC's ~ Fred and George join him for the end of the year to finish school.

Read this last year on ff.net and can't remember the name or find it again. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
