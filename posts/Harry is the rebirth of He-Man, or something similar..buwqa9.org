Do not ask me how I get it ... I do not know it myself.

Instead of the sword of Griffindor, Harry pulls the sword of He-Man out of the hat.

... By the power of Hogwarts, I have the magic ... [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zIoElk3r2c]]

Hedwig transforms into a mighty dragon ...

Dobby as "Orco"? And who as she-ra? Hermione? Fleur? Daphne? Ginny? Susan? OC?

I know, that's crazy. But I think such an OP Harry would be amusing.


** Hermione is She-ra. Harry's twin, given to the Grangers for safety when the Potters found out about the Prophesy.

With his love of technology, Arthur is Man-at-Arms with Ginny Teela.

** I am Harry, Boy Who Lived, vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort. This is Dobby, my fearless friend. Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic sword and sang:

"Eleven years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope / for a destination...

"And I realized quickly when I knew I should / that this world was made up of this Ministry of Magic / or whatever that means..."
