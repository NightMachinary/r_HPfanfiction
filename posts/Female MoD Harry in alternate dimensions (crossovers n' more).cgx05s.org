there was one really sweet/funny, with Death Note. I forgot its name wich is sad, id re-read it too.... sooo got anything for me? :P


** Was the one you read "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11866019/1/The-Labor-of-Light-Yagami][The Labor of Light Yagami]]" by any chance? If so, that author has many crossovers with that same fem!Harry in different universes. I particularly love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12160753/1/The-Wasteland][her HP/LOTR crossover]] in which the Ring has a mind of its own. Unfortunately it's the kind of spinoff that requires knowledge of the main fic to enjoy, so I'm usually hesitant to recommend it.

*** Oh, hey. I love that author. On the bright side, she /is/ still active so there's a chance it's not completely abandoned.

** Linkffn(like the rain chooses the grass) might fit- it merges the HP universe and the MCU, so perhaps not what you want exactly.

There's also very little emphasis put on the MoD part- might not even become MoD. I don't remember, honestly.

  Not once had he ever considered his soulmate would be anything other than a black woman. His opinions on that are already far too solidified to allow for anything else. Yet, green eyes and a carbon copy soulmark are telling him otherwise. (Female Harry Potter)

**** It doesn't always result in super powers. I've read some great fics that took what it means to be 'Master of Death' in unique directions. Some fics treat it as more of a curse than a powerup.
