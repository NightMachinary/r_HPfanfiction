Especially compared to the HP fandom


** * Mass Effect:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mass-effect
  :END:

- Deeper characterisations and interactions

- Sticks annoyingly close to canon. The HP fandom might follow the stations of canon closely, but there is still a lot of artistic freedom compared to ME. Most stories feel like novelisations of the games, not real fanfics.

- More Self-Inserts. And those try to alter the plot, not bang Draco Malfoy.

* Star Wars:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: star-wars
  :END:

- A lot more black and white when it comes to the worldview. Then again, that is kinda the SW canon.

- Fewer "the bad guys are just misunderstood and genocide is part of regular teenage angst" themes.

- Canon elements are not seen critically. You can make a somewhat solid argument that the Jedi are running a religious cult with a heavy emphasis on brainwashing and child soldiers. Yet it is rarely questioned as much as Dumbledore's behaviour.

* Star Trek:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: star-trek
  :END:

- Mostly missing scenes or minor divergences which do not significantly alter the universe

- Most stories feel very cliche, and I have not even delved deep into that fandom

* ASoIaF/GoT:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: asoiafgot
  :END:

- Stories often lack the depth of GRRM's world. While HP often goes down the deep end of magical theory, GoT often brushes over the complexity of the involved fractions, something you really can only afford if you give the narrator side a significant advantage (the Industrialisation SIs come to mind).

- Authors try to emulate the "multiple PoV" style of GRRM and fall way short.

- A few interesting SI concepts, like the aforementioned industrialisation or becoming a "shadow player" instead of openly making changes.

Unless GRRM decides to throw everything he's written into the bin, the Starks will not be making a comeback like they did in the show.

From My perspective, I think point 1 and 2 are connected. End of the day, i think the average ME fans are more interested in the characters rather than the lore itself. And honestly i kinda just want more novelisation fics of different Shepards kicking ass and making friends. I think that canon divergences in ME are pretty hard because you have to go into areas like First Contact or stuff way past ME1. But that's just me

#+end_quote

There are countless fics which do just that. "And the meek shall inherit the galaxy" has a first contact with the Quarians and the first contact war is fought together with the Quarians against the Turians. "First Contact" is a Asari first contact set in the 2050s. There's one where Wrex crashes on Earth and uplifts humanity. A bunch of Halo crossovers where humans have Halo technology. I'm currently reading a Battlefield 2142 crossover of so far decent quality.

The issue is rather that almost no fics diverge during the games. I've yet to read one where Shepard gets a Geth Armada to go through the Omega 4 Relais. Or takes Tali to Rannoch just to spite the Admiralty board. Where some of the canon companions are kicked from the team after questionable actions (Zaeed and the refinery). Or Liara returns to the Normandy in ME2 instead of becoming the shadow broker. Where Shiala or some of the random Quarians play a bigger role. Where the Reaper war isn't just a chain of ME3 missions.

There are so many divergences and almost none are written.

Yea, i think i didnt pick up on the this part of your argument. There are some fics that do shuffle some canon events around. Or try and bring more party members to the missions for more interactions. But it is interesting that most of your examples are from ME3, which implies that the fic would have to go through 2 games of canon rehash to get to it. I think just on a simpler level, we are spoiled by just how many fics the HP fandom churns out everyday, for a fandom whose main canon work ended in 2007. Quantity has a Quality on its own, after all.

Partly this follows from your first point (B&W worldview), but also, Emperor Palpatine spends most of the Prequels saying precisely this, so by association the idea becomes very suspect. If the Death Eaters kept insinuating to Harry that Dumbledore is an evil manipulator in canon, somewhat ironically (since that would be more canonical support for it than it has ever enjoyed IRL), I don't think the idea of Manipulative!Dumbledore would have gotten off the ground to the extent that it has.

This has been almost entirely my experience with the ME fandom: if it isn't a smutfic, or a by-the-numbers romance, then it's a canon rehash that pretty much just novelises the author's playthrough of the series. It's kind of disappointing, because there's so much in the lore outside of the Reaper conflict that would be cool to explore, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest from the fandom in doing so.

**** Yeah, it's kinda annoying that Shepard always feels like the stereotypical GI instead of, let's say a British Naval Officer or someone with a Dutch/German/Russian/whatever background. Never a full out batarian hater, whose only regret about the Alpha relay is that it wasn't their homeworld. Never someone who gives up the alliance after their actions in ME2. Can you imagine Shepard commanding the Geth Fleet against the Collectors? Or embrace the resources Cerberus gives instead of just waiting to defect.

This is the reason why I haven't read any ASIOAF fanfic yet. GRRM create a very complex world. JKR's worldbuilding is like child compared to him. The number of lores, foreshadowing, and off-screen scenes are unthinkable. I've only read the first two books yet (and watch all 7 seasons ofc), but I can tell his works are on another level. Also the fact that a lot of fantheories and headcanons is basically unconfirmed also makes me reconsider reading any fic.

But then the reason I read HP fanfic is to complete (and fix) JKR's worldbuilding, GRRM doesn't really need that anymore.

**** Tbf, it's a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. I know both ASOIAF and HP are labeled as fantasy series, but only ASOIAF is a "proper" epic fantasy series with the stacks and stacks of lore and worldbuilding. Conversely, JKR set out to write children's mystery novels set at a magic school, and didn't care about worldbuilding in the way an epic fantasy author might because worldbuilding doesn't matter as much as character interaction and development when writing mystery novels. Unfortunately that came back to bite her a bit when she started leaning into the fantasy aspect of the story regarding Voldemort and the war in the later books, because then worldbuilding actually mattered, and hers was flimsy in certain areas.

**** Unpopular opinion here, but I would take JKR's writing over GRRM's any time. Complex worldbuilding isn't in and of itself an indication of a good story. After the first book, which is really great, the writing gets progressively more and more meandering and bloated, and the books would benefit greatly if a good editor made GRRM get rid of a good half of the wordcount and focus on character arcs and plot progression. Yes, the worldbuilding is great, but it starts to feel pointless if he doesn't have a clear story to tell.

- Stations of Canon

  - Divergence from canon... that still leads to following the exact same story events of canon.
  - Locker Scene and Trigger Event, described in full detail. Yum, tampons!
  - "But what about Scion?" --- Every fic is expected to find a way to defeat the villain, even the fluffy one-shots.

- Flanderization and shoddy characterization

  - Catchphrases become repeated over and over, when only used once or twice in canon. "Kiddo" and "Predator".
  - "In my opinion the +Jedi+ PRT are evil!11!" but up to Eleven.\\
  - Woobiefication for Taylor and Amy. Demonization for everyone else.\\

*** GoT also makes the world significantly cleaner than it ought to be (other than the stench of King's Landing).

I wouldn't say that it is more sexualised though. It paints perhaps a more realistic picture, yet at the same time 13 is considered a valid age for marriage in Westeros while that is completely unacceptable in our world. The whole world is cruder, not just more horny. I mean, murder and rape are just a regular Tuesday in GoT while Malfoy's attempts at murder fill half a book.

** Is there any decent gen Avengers fanfiction out there? Almost all my searching has resulted in tons of slash and romance with super heavy angst, hurt and comfort or torture plot and little else.

Its common in other fandoms too. The main character gets tortured/hurt in some way and then they have to escape bad guys while injured and get better with help of friends or their love interest. In contrast I almost never see this whump plot line in the Harry Potter fandom. There is the abused Harry trope, but it reads different from from the typical hurt and comfort fighting bad guys plot.

Also modern AU's seem really popular outside of HP. Super common to come across those coffee shop or college/ high school AUs while it's more uncommon in Harry Potter.

For star wars (sequel) fics - one thing that I noticed is that the plot and events among many Reylo fics are almost exactly the same. I would start one, then read through a few more only to drop them all after I realized that I couldn't remember which fic was which and the writing was mediocre at best. Even HP canon rehashes tend to be a little more varied than what I saw.

Some other fandoms I have read are Avatar the Last Airbender, Stargate and Buffy. Even though I occasionally do find interesting fanfiction in other fandoms, I find myself coming back to HP for almost all my favorite stories.

Maybe it's because this subreddit helps filter out good from bad, but I have found so many amazing HP fics. There are many that really go deep into specific characters and have great writing or plot. I find it much harder to find fics outside of HP that explore characters really well or that have interesting worldbuilding or great writing.

** *Teen Wolf* : The fic usually turns The Best Friend into the main character but, other than that, there's a lot of similarities with HP fic:

- other friends gets bashed for not being a good enough friends and the character gets superpowers/is related to someone important/trains to become OP.
- The Hale family is a bit like the Slytherins in that fandom: the morally questionable ones that have been turned into the smart and capable ones with these widely accepted fanon behaviors that justify brutality.
- The biggest pairing is between two people who kind of hated each other when people first started writing it (but different from Harry/Draco in that they did come to be friends in canon).
- One of the fairly large pairings is a good character with a much older character who has done terrible things.
- Canon characterization gets kicked right out the window. Anything goes. There are people who admit they've never even watched the show and a large group who deliberately embraces popular fanon over most of canon.

*Stargate*

- characters often become less independent rather than more (for angst reasons.) I guess this is a result of them already being very smart, capable people in canon.

*Hannibal (NBC)*

- There's a lot of creepy romance (Will/Hannibal), redemption fics, and AUs.
- Comparable to how people write Tom/Harry in the HP fandom.

*Supernatural*

- A lot more incest.
- More casefics. Considering characters are aurors in HP, I'm surprised there isn't more of these.
- People stick way closer to canon characterization than they do in HP fics.

*Arrow*

- Fic is dominated by one pairing and various AUs and romance-themed stuff related to that pairing. Everything else can qualify as a rare pair from what I can tell.

*Merlin (BBC)*

- Less of characters being paired with people they've always hated. A lot less.
- Again, writers try to stick to canon characterization.

*General Hospital*

- Pairings at war/bashing of the alternative pairings.
- The chosen family of the usual main character is seen as holding them back and gets written as gold diggers/users/disloyal like the Weasleys.
- Not a lot of things like time travel, dimension travel, space AU's, etc. The show has veered into scifi and rebirth, but fic writers don't really run with that. It's everyday stuff.
