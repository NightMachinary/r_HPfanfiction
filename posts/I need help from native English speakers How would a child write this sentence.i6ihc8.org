Hello,

I need some help from native English speakers. The point is that in a story I write, a child writes a letter. This child is very young and therefore still makes a lot of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.

The sentence in question is spelled correctly: "You're an evil witch."

How would a young child write this sentence? I think a child could mix up "you're" and "your", but what other spelling mistakes would they make?

As I am not a native English speaker, I find it difficult to empathize with an English-speaking child :D

Many thanks!


** Depends how young they are. Younger than 5, something like “Yor an eevil wich” might be likely because all the letters in the words there sound right, they're just not spelt right. If they're a little older then they've probably had more spelling drilled into them so younger than 8 and “your/you're an evil witch/which”, and if they're older than eight just write it normally.

***** Thanks for your offer! However, the rest of the letter isn't that relevant because one of the main characters is just reading that one sentence out loud. It's just a very small detail, but I'd like to get it right :D

*** misspellings from my childhood haunt me. I found something from 1st grade in my terrible 7 year old handwriting "amerika is osome" and a very badly drawn american flag underneath (I was in my revolutionary war phase lmao)

*** So "a" instead of "an"?

"Your a evil witch."

**** Yep. A child would probably write that. Lots of adults do it too.
