I never read The cursed child but I am interesting to buy one but most people seem to hate it and complain about it I have no idea why? Look like I haven't update anything about HP verse for a while. can you guys tell me why you don't like this book?

(So I can decide to buy it or not)


** Oh boy. Why do I hate Cursed Child, let me count the ways. *There will be spoilers.*

In a brief list

- Harry is an asshole and a relatively incompetent asshole
- Hermione is Dumbledore 2.0 in terms of hiding things
- The trolley witch is some sort of ancient magical thing who keeps children on the train with pasty-grenades
- Cedric Diggory becomes a Death Eater
- Time travelling nonsense
- Voldemort had a bio kid with Bellatrix. Somehow.

It nerfs the Golden trio a lot, even in the alternate timelines while simultaneously trying to bludgeon you over the head with things. In one, where she didn't marry Ron, Hermione is Snape 2.0 to a kid that she should have a perfectly fine relationship with because even without having married Ron she should still be friends with Harry and Ginny. But see, she didn't marry Ron so therefore she must be angry and mean for no reason.

In another, where Harry died at the Battle of Hogwarts and Voldemort rules, Ron - who has spent twenty three years as a fugitive from war, probably seen friends and family die and been one of the two most wanted people - comes charging out holding his wand by the wrong end.

In fact, the entire way Ron is dealt with is generally awful. It's revealed that he was so drunk when he got married that he cannot remember it, he casually hands out love potions and seems amused at the thought the kids might be using them and is generally ineffectual comic relief.

Harry - who's been Head Auror - can't beat Draco Malfoy or a teenage girl in a fight, intimidates McGonagall into tracking his son to break up the friendship between Albus and Scorpius and is generally an asshole for basically the entire time.

But the single biggest reason that I will never like Cursed Child is quite simple. The 'climax'. You would think, what with this being a play/script about Albus and Scorpius that the climax would have something to do with them? You know, they're the central characters, they're the ones we've been following. What is the climax? Having time travelled back to 1981, an adult Harry Potter is forced to watch Voldemort murder his parents. That is the fucking cheapest, most assholish shot I have ever seen and I'm irritated merely by regurgitating this information to you.

Instead of letting their play, their characters, their interactions, stand on its own merit with a climax that had nothing to do with Harry's past, the writers decided to go for the cheap gut punch of Lily and James' death. Moreover, they decided that apparently Harry hasn't gone through enough having heard parts of his parents deaths in his worst memory compounded by seeing their murder through Voldemort's eyes, that he should now have to not only physically bear witness to their deaths but also be complicit in them to protect the timeline.

Of course, I agree with you that Tom Riddle did not care about anybody and did not want an offspring, and I suspect he didn't have all bits in right places for generating one, but [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][I was thinking]] that there could be some much nastier reason why to generate a child: either it is unwanted by-product of some Dark Magic ritual, or (other way around) she was generated just in order to be material for some other one (what about the ultimate Horcrux created by killing of your own offspring?). And even Muggles can conceive a baby without sex and without all the bits in right places, there should certainly be some magic equivalent of IVF.

Albus and Scorpius time travel to try and save Cedric's life. To do this, they try inflating him during the Second Task, so he floats away rather than rescuing Cho. This humiliation turned him bitter and resentful so he...became a death eater for some reason. In the battle of Hogwarts he killed Neville which led to Voldemort winning and an even more stupidly changed future with some hilarious, nonsensical lines.

** Many people hate Cursed Child because it reads like a bad fanfiction. As a play, I'm told it's an amazing spectacle due to fantastic setpieces and effects. As an addition to canon, it's both shallow and insulting, and in fact retcons material from the original books in a way that ruins them in bizarre ways (see: the trolley lady).

Basically, when you look at the Cursed Child, it's everything the fandom didn't want: saccharine homage to the original books & characters while changing critical aspects of them that absolutely no one asked for.

***** I disagree.

Assuming I can read sheet music and play it on something, I could very well enjoy a piece of music having never heard another interpretation. And, of course, sheet music is fairly accessible and not heinously expensive.

I've seen a bootleg of Cursed Child and while I will admit that the acting, staging and effects are good, they fundamentally cannot take away from how utterly stupid the plot is. The shiny bits can distract you from how ridiculous the scenes are but they are still, at their heart, not part of a good plot.

It is not helped by the fact that going to see it was anywhere between hard and impossible and that was before there was a pandemic. So for most people, the only way they are going to get to interact with it is the script unless they decide to release a filmed version of it a la Hamilton.

Shakespeare at least has literary merit.

****** Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Cursed Child is good - I've neither read the script nor seen the play, so I have no actual framework or experience to make that judgement. I literally can't agree or disagree with you on that.

All I meant was that reading a script and making a judgement of the play based solely on reading the script is bizarre because that's not what the script is designed for. It's not like getting sheet music and playing it yourself, because they're both just resources to let you tell the story/play the song in another medium, not mediums that tell the story themselves - when I compared reading the script to reading the sheet music, I literally meant just reading the sheet music. As in, you don't get to play the song, just read the notes. The comparison to getting and playing the sheet music yourself would be getting the script and acting it out yourself on a stage since you'd be using the resource to do the something else that it's designed for (play music and perform a play).

A script isn't there to tell a story, it's there to tell Actors and Technicians and Directors and so on what the story is so they can get on with telling it, like the sheet music is there to tell you what notes to play. It's why I always say you can't fully appreciate Shakespeare from reading the plays - they're designed to be performed, and then appreciated from that perspective. Hell, the man didn't even publish the scripts, that was done by some of his friends after he died.

You're not going to get the same experience just reading sheet music as hearing a song, and you're not going to get the same experience just reading a play script as seeing the play. I could read the code scripts behind a video game too, that's not the same as playing it.

And for the record, I adore Shakespeare, but I definitely wouldn't say reading the scripts and seeing them played were in any way comparable for his works either.

Also for the record, none of that makes the plot any better - and the plot of the Cursed Child does sound ludicrously silly, I do agree with you on that, at least - but plenty of old operas had just as ridiculous plots and they're pretty interesting to see performed, even if the scripts are incomprehensible lunacy.

The merit of a play is also based on more than people's ability to act and the flashy effects.

** Cursed Child is full of ridiculous plotlines and so many plot holes it basically makes the story unreadable, not to mention it changes a lot of things in canon. It takes things you loved in HP books and just flips them upside down. The biggest plot hole of HP series, time turners, play a big role in Cursed Child, but they are not like the time turners we saw in the books, they're worse. And the way they work makes everything that happened in HP irrelevant and stupid. Why Harry grew up as an orphan when you /can/ go back a few decades in time and change things? There's also a big problem with characterisation since the characters from HP are mostly unrecognizable in Cursed Child.\\
That being said, when I ignore most of the stupid storylines and things that have no right to happen, I actually like quite a few things in Cursed Child. First, the story implies that not /all was well/ as the epilogue tried to make us believe, which was mostly why I never read the epilogue during my re-reads. There are many beautiful quotes that, in my opinion, fit very well with HP canon.\\
And lastly, unlike the rest of the world, I actually think that it is possible for Harry to be a terrible father to his children.\\
Still, considering everything, I don't think it's worth reading, especially if you love Harry Potter books the way they are.

** The short answer is that The Cursed Child is a Technical masterpiece but a Literary disaster.

Those who have seen the play typically like it because the actually performance is excellent. However, most people who pay any real attention to the actual plot recognize that it is a total dumpster-fire that failed to remember that time-turners were only used in ONE novel for a reason and were promptly destroyed at the first opportunity. Because time travel is EXTREMELY difficult to write properly.
