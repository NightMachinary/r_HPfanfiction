Just kinda in the mood for it, no real idea why.


** The only fic I can think of that has a significant dwarven presence (and a good, lore-rich version of them at that) is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/better-living-through-magic-harry-potter-si.756754/][Better Living Through Magic]], which follows an SI living in 1964, which is after Voldemort's school years but before the Mauraders' era. It's a pretty good read and it's one of the only stories actively updating that captures the sheer /wonder/ of magic, even if the SI is trying to science the hell out of it for fun and profit.
