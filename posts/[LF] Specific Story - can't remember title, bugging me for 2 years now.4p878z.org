** Was there magical email in that fic? Because there is a Jeconais fic where Harry just constantly breaks the rules of magic because he doesn't know better.

EDIT: Not the fic I thought it was. Please disregard.

**** I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for, but what I like to do is put a general search into ff.net, then filter it down.

In this case, I searched up all fics with the word "fantasy" in the plot summary, then filtered by "Harry Potter" category, "English" language, "Harry P." main character, and from your description I assumed the word count was at least 30k+ and ended up with a two page result. Then I looked for fics with the most favourites/reviews :) I've found this is a great way to look up fics when you're not really sure what you're looking for.

** I can see why you thought of This Means War as in that Harry does impossible things because no one has told him its impossible.

** There's one I remember where HP plays online games for a summer online then because magic is based on belief and millions believe in WoW all of his WoW style spells are OP. Does that sound right?

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.
