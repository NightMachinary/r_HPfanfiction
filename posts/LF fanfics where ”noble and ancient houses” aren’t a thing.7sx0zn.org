Harry-centric, no h/hr, would prefer no bashing and minimal Snape and Malfoy involvement. No massive AUs(as in, unrecognisable as HP) please and no canon rehashes.

Thanks


** I mean, if you tell us a genre or something that would help. Right now your post is the equivalent of saying "I'm looking to meet someone new, but I'm not interested in black women."

*** What does that even mean?

I genuinely just want people to rec fics without noble houses, imo it's a pretty narrow request since that's such a common theme?

**** Sure it's a common theme, but it's a lot easier to give recs when you state a plot point you do or don't want to see. You're kinda asking for something like non-fiction books that focus on the US.

What kind of genre do you like?

***** I think they mean a fic where Most Ancient and Noble Houses are /markedly/ not a thing. Like, for instance, a story dealing with the Black Family prominently, but where they're /explicitly/ not a MAaNH.

***** Okay, I would be really interested in PoA and OotP rewrites, I like adventure fics and fics that retain the magic feeling of the original series. I don't like too much angst or hurt/comfort. I like a badass Harry and strong friendships. Forging the sword, forests of valbone and by the divining light are my favourite fics. Does that help?

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
