** There was one like that. That said I only read the description and not the fic so I can't recommend it to you at all as I don't know the tittle. So in essence this was a pretty useless comment

** Like, Harry wakes up in the cupboard under the stairs after dreaming about all his non-existent years at Hogwarts...only to discover he's a Squib and today's the day Dudley goes to Hogwarts.

BURN!

*** It'd be a more interesting reversal if the Dursleys were some elitist pureblood family and Lily Evans who's a Squib married a muggle/another squib and had Harry, then Harry also turned out to be non-magical, but somehow the whole boy who lived business still happened when Voldemort tried to get rid of them for being non-magical. Then the Dursleys get Harry forced on them still.

***** I thought so too. He'd be stuck with them and he'd be stuck in the wizarding world. Things would happen like them delegating the House Elves who adore him to take care of him until he's able to take care of himself and then free all of them and make him do all of their work so he's both without friends and still ends up doing chores. The only thing is where it'd go from there, maybe he escapes to the muggle world at some point, but Voldemort is still after him and he uses muggle tech as the "power Voldemort knows not" since he's fucked over magically. The whole muggles trumping wizards is a bit weird, but why not team up with Dumbledore who hunts the horcruxes at some point later on and then have Harry finish Voldemort with a sniper rifle. I'm not sure where he'd get training for that though.

**** So reverse every cliche about harry potter then tell the story.

Sounds like a way of being mind numbly cliched to me.

***** Considering how many Harry Potter stories are out there you'd think there'd be something like this. I'm just coming up with shit on the spot and I'm no writer.

** Ask someone to write it. It sounds like it would make a funny crack oneshot.
