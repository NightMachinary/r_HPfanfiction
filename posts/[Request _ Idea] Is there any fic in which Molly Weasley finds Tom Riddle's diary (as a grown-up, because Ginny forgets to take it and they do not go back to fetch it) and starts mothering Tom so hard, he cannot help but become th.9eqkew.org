I am sure she could nurture the shit out of his nature.

((I am aware that one would have to assume that Tom was not born an actual psychopath, but that is the case in almost every TMR centric story))

** Molly looked over her ingredients on her kitchen cupboard and propped open her new diary with two potatoes. She wiped a sweaty stand of red hair from her forehead and looked at the blank page in front of her, wondering what to call her soon-to-be recipe book. Deciding to think of a title later, she flipped a page and began to title the first recipe she would be recording.

/Chicken Pot Pie/

/1 pound chicken breasts, cubed/

/2 cups of sliced carrots/

As she started to write her third line of ingredients the ink on the page shone and disappeared. Molly frowned and shook her quill as if somehow the ink that had gone from the page was still stuck in the feather. The page shone again and writing appeared.

/Hello, sorry to erase your recipe like that./

Molly raised her eyebrows in surprise and mild concern. She hadn't realized it was a magical book. It was just something Ginny had found that must have fallen into her cauldron when they were at Diagon Alley. Ginny hadn't wanted it so Molly decided to use the ratty supposedly muggle diary. Now it was talking to her. Goodness.

/My name is Tom, I'm the memory of a student who used to go to Hogwarts./

That caught her interest, she picked up her quill and only briefly hesitated before writing:

/How old were you?/

/I was sixteen when I made this journal. What's your name? Are you at Hogwarts?/

/Sixteen! So young and such impressive magic. I hope your professor gave you many house points. I daresay your parents must have been very proud./ Molly smiled and leaned on the cupboard. Children today were so ambitious, she thought, so clever.

/I/ This was crossed out and then disappeared. /My parents were dead at the time. I never knew them. I don't know how they would have reacted./

/Oh sweet child, I'm so sorry. Well, I'm a mother and as a mother I know your own definitely would have been proud. It's a great accomplishment./ Molly's heart went out to the little orphan boy who had probably spent a long time creating a magical diary. If her imagined orphan boy happened to look like Harry, no one was around to comment or to guess.

/Thank you./ A pause after these words disappeared. /So what's your name?/

/You can call me Mrs. Weasley dear. Now I've noticed your cover is a bit dull, if I had you rebound would you still keep your magic? That way you could look very snazzy and I could show you off to all of my family and friends. They would be very impressed. I could also knit you a sleeve or bag, do you get cold? Can you feel hard surfaces? What's your favourite colour Tom?/

Another wait and a few scratched out starts of sentences later and Tom said:

/I quite like green actually... could I have a snake on my new cover?/

/Of course darling, Slytherin eh? Don't worry I won't judge, I can tell you're an excellent Slytherin already, so ambitious./

It took only a few days before Molly was walking around with a green woollen bag strung around her waist. She would bring out Tom every hour or so to make sure he wasn't getting bored, he was quite good company now that all her children were at Hogwarts.

********* I suppose it depends on your definition of bashing, then. Ron acts like Ron, which means he's a dick to Harry when Harry doesn't like that Ron trashes Snape in front of him and "chooses" Snape over Ron. Both Harry and Ron act realistically based on their own viewpoints. Ron spent his whole life hearing how awful Snape is from his brothers, so he talks shit despite never having met the guy. Harry doesn't react well to some kid he just met talking shit about the guy who saved him from an abusive home. Ron is stubborn and holds a grudge (canon traits), but [[/spoiler][he gets over it eventually and they do become friends]].

But if any depiction of Ron's negative canon characteristics is bashing to you, then you probably won't like this one. If you consider Dumbledore being verbally dressed down for allowing Harry to grow up in such an abusive situation and other adults not trusting his judgement after such an appalling oversight to be bashing, then I'm guessing you won't like how the author treats Ron either.

********** No, the beginning few chapters had the clear makings of an evil! Dumbledore fic and it really seemed like he was getting bashed. The headaches and evil chuckles to himself don't help. He's even been called an old coot. As I am reading more it seems like he is not being bashed but just shown in a different light which is fine (though it's too early for me to comment on the truth of that statement) .

Dumbledore bashing usually comes with Weasley and Ron bashing. I am just in one of those phases where you are too fed up with one characters "bashing". As you can tell I am still continuing because the story itself is interesting. I am not going to lie, I would have stopped at Ron's treatment but I won't if he does change within the fic.
