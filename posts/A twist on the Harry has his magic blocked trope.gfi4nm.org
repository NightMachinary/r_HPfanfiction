Harry doesn't care that his magic gets blocked. Instead he steals the knowledge of the spell from Dumbledore in retaliation. Harry goes and steals the blood of every bad person he can find and blocks all their magic. With magic blocked he uses compulsion charms to fet the blood of more death eaters and blocks their magic. Finally Harry learns to use a gun and blocks his own magic again which inturn blocks Voldemorts. Voldemorts wards fall with the magic gone and Harry shoots him in the head

** And then, plot twist, it turns out someone in ages past did this before, collecting blood and using magic based on bloodlines to lock up the magic of thousands, if not millions of people, and muggles are in fact the descendants of those de-magic'd humans today.

*** I remember a fic I read, where everyone used to be magical, but the people now known as muggles wanted to use earths power and did a ritual, which backfired due to mother nature/magic didn't like that, after a few generations there started to be people who hated magicals for having something they didn't. It was a frikin amazing idea and currently a headcanon of mine. :)

Sorry for the rambling

** This is why I've never liked this concept. Forget that wizards are basically made of 60% magic all by themselves, if it were actually possible to take away someone's magic then they'd do it to life-in-azkaban inmates, for example. The DE controlled ministry would do it to muggleborns. The DEs themselves would do it to "blood traitors".

Not to mention conflicts in the past that would end with swathes of people being magicless because they were captured and neutralized without killing them.

*** Yes but you forget that Harry discovered this in an ancient text that dumbledore had found, but the scroll was enchanted a bit like a fidelius so he couldn't tell anyone about it or help anyone find it.

*** A combination of people wanting Manipulative!Dumbledore and OP!Harry, so they can have dumbledore block harry's magic for whatever reason (manipulative) and so Harry can unblock it and do cool stuff (explaination for why Harry can be OP)

** Why would blocking his own magic block voldemorts?

*** its a blood ritual (because with a drop of blood you can do all kinds of voodoo blood magic rituals that are forgotten in ancient texts) Harry and Voldie share the same blood because of the ritual that brought him back to life if you take it literally. He has his fathers bones, his servants flesh, his enemies blood and his own soul. Any ritual using Harry's blood is the same as using Voldoes blood so it effects both. Or at least it does in this little world

** Without magic Harry cannot steal spells or block other people's magic. Nor use compulsion charms.

*** obviously the goblin super rituals unblocked it for no charge because he remembered Griphooks name. Its what seems to happen in everyone of these stories
