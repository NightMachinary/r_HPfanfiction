Hello, I'm searching for a fic where Tom Riddles Diary got in Dumbledore's possession, intact.(Prefering Ginny not dying) Dumbledore now tries to interrogate the diary using different methods. A furious Dumbledore breaking into its defenses would be very cool to read as well.


** This is what should have happened if Harry had slightly more common sense and confidence in Dumbledore:

"Professor, I found this old book in that abandoned girl's bathroom. It belonged to someone named T.M. Riddle."

I'm really surprised that this plot divergence has NEVER been explored before.

*** Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday linkffn(2477819)

It's a very minor point. But in an AU, Ginny turns in the diary in after it starts talking back to her. Dumbledore keeps it in his desk. It's unclear he's aware it's a horcrux, or just considers it a copy of Tom's memories.

*** True, but in second year Dumbledore wasn't Harry's Mentor just yet. Why should he bother the HEADMASTER? Some old book? That's hardly cause to inform such high authority. If McGonnagal would have listened to him in the first book, he could have told her, but...

**** AND Dumbledore all but blamed Harry for the petrifications. He didn't really, but to a 12 year old kid, that sure seemed like Dumbles blamed him. Didn't stop other people from blaming Harry either. Add in what happened last year when they went to people in authority.

It's no wonder the Golden Trio never went to a higher authority. It's a staple of the Harry Potter series. Once you hit 30, you become incompetent. Except if you are a bad guy. Then you only become mildly competent, but it's still enough to be a threat. IIRC in cursed child, Harry himself admits this.
