Generally we see an 11 YO Harry acting like he is 60 while getting all the monies, titles and power while battling with a Manipulative!Dumbledore... what if instead Harry and Dumbledore are just a pair of overgrown children having their fun while not taking themselves too seriously?

‚ÄúSo, you see Mr. Potter, based on the Deus Ex Machine law of the Bullshit Code, subsection Garry Stu you can claim your full inheritance and emancipation at the tender age of eleven by singing this plot-contract that I just happened to have laying around for absolutely no discernible reason. Oh, and Albus Dumbledore was administrating your proprieties‚Äù Said the Goblin with a Smile, happy that the wizard had remembered his name. ‚ÄúThis way you will claim enough power to virtually rule over the world uncontested by inheritance despite the fact that your parents never had even a hint of it. Now what will be your first decision as the new de facto government of Magical Britain?‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet! Ok, first the most important, it is now illegal for a potion professor being named Severus Snape, as punishment they must change their names to Shitstain Motherfucker; it is new legal to steal from Malfoys -actually, scratch that, it is now /obligatory/ to steal from Malfoys at least yearly; the Black Lake should have it's water changed to pumpkin juice; oh, and homework is now outlawed; as is being a Dursley; and also...‚Äù said an excited 11 YO jumping up and down in joy. Who wouldn't after being given control over an entire nation?‚Äù

The Goblin looked on with his smile stretching in truly panic-inducing proportions, this sounded like exactly the kind of responsible leader the Wizarding World needed. Harry may be even better than their other candidate, too bad he got blown up while trying to kill the boy talking to him, so much gold in investment lost...

‚ÄúNow, you see Harry, our families made some bullshit blood contract with yours some random number of centuries back. So now, because of some nonsense clause, you absolutely /must/ marry all our daughters and sons to save all of us, including yourself, of some unexplained but supposedly bad effect of breaking the contract - which may or may not be actually just a day of indigestion, our ancestors were obviously crazy enough to make a contract like this, so worrying all of us for no reason would probably the kind of thing they would find funny‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkay... what does marriage really entrains?‚Äù Asked the clueless child.

‚ÄúI think you mean entrails? Well, you would live together, and cooperate with each other and Huh-Huh, that is to say... well, also do some.. other things when you are old enough... like after puberty at the very least... hnnn, bedroom stuffs if you catch my meaning‚Äù Said a now uncomfortable parent passing through the awkward experience of trying to not explain sex to a child frankly too young to even understand the act, to say nothing of actually /doing it/. Not for the first time said parent cursed their ancestors for having such a bad taste in practical jokes.

‚ÄúLike a sleep-over!!‚Äù Yelled the child now excited.

‚Äú... You... wouldn't be entirely wrong?‚Äù The same way someone calling the theory of relatively space-rock stuff wouldn't be /entirely/ wrong that is.

‚ÄúSweet! I knew I was missing something about this whole ‚Äòmaking friends' business! So all that I need to get a friend is marry them!‚Äù Exclaimed Harry with the air of someone who just discovered that water is, in fact, wet.

The random parent deeply wished to not having had drawn the short-stick, hence being the one chosen to explain the situation, so he could be with the other random parents day-drinking their way into an alcoholic coma.

‚ÄúSo you see Harry, my foolish boy! I was the one who controlled all and each actions you took since before the start of our game! I carefully manipulated you into acting just as I wanted, and it all lead us here. So Harry, what will you choose? Will you give up your life for the greater good like the pawn I made you into?‚Äù Crackled Manipulative!Dumbledore.

‚ÄúNever! Despite all your manipulations I grew strong by my own merits and now will finally defeat you and then move on to become the next Supreme Sorcer! You will never beat me old man!‚Äù

And so Indy!Harry focused on his greatest challenge yet, and with a deep breath sent the fire first spell. Dumbledore, not being so easily overdone countered by casting his own water globe at the young but talented boy. And so the fierce battle took place, water waves rushing to one of the fighters before being turned into icicles that rushed back at the original creator only to them be turned into arrows sent back at the double of the speed only to them be incinerated to ashes by a powerful fireball. Spell after spell with both adversaries only speaking to pronounce particularly arcane incantations.

Then, finally, a misfire. A spell sent by Dumbledore took a bit more than expected and flew a bit too far away. Harry, seizing the opportunity immediately casted his next spell while his ruthless adversary was vulnerable ‚ÄúNow! forceful hand!‚Äù Said the boy waiting with baited breath to see if he could finally claim victory.

The sound of dices being thrown was heard and then...

‚ÄúForceful hand successfully cast‚Äù ground out the voice of the very annoyed potion master. ‚ÄúManipulative!Dumbledore takes 45 points of damage bringing his total HP to zero. Indy!Harry is the winner‚Äù he completed between clenched teeth's while his hands made aborted clenching motions, as if he was contemplating strangling someone, I wonder why.

At this Dumbledore started cursing up a storm

‚Äú... you motherfucker-‚Äú

‚ÄúNow Headmaster, let's not be rude here, it is Professor Motherfucker‚Äù said Harry with a smirk as Dumbledore grumbled some more. The look Potion Master Motherfucker was giving him could kill a Basilisk.

‚ÄúNow that we ended this... /game/‚Äù spat the GM as if the word game was poison in his mouth ‚Äúcan we please focus in defeating Voldemort?... /please/?‚Äù.

Dumbledore however only carelessly waved his hand at him. ‚ÄúNow Shitstain, you worry too much, I am sure even /if/ Voldemort gets somewhere he won't be the worst leader Magical Britain ever had, eventually the situation will just solve itself on it's own. Now, I heard about this new game called Cyberpunk that...‚Äú

The sound of the potion Professor's teeth grinding themselves into a powder could be heard from the other said of the castle.


** I see you point. I only like those types of stories if at least Harry's mind has come from the future. And within reason too.

Like. Why does he have to be the riches wizard of all time? And why does he have to be the heir/lord to basicly every ancient mythological houses? Why not just declare him king and move on? Making him merlin heir basicly means jusy that to wizards.

It's beyond ridiculous.

*** Indy!Harry means independent Harry, it is the trope in which he basically breaks away from all his life-long friends and allies over some stupid pretense to strike on his own.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
