Hello. Sorry if I'm bad with this. I'm a newbie. I just wanted to let people know that I have in PDF "The Point of No Return", which is the best work I have ever seen about Harry Potter and Jurassic Park, but I don't know if I should share it (after what the author decided) or where to put it safely so other people can get it even if I share it. Any ideas, please?


** If the author doesn't want it online anymore, it is not a good idea to share it.

*** But, that's the thing, I don't know about that. Some of their works are still out there, downloaded in ebook form and I haven't seen any complains for their part. So I'm kinda confused about what to do. It's one of the best works I have seen and I feel so bad that others might miss it. Because I have also gone through that with other works.

** if the author deleted it I wouldn't share it by posting, if someone wants to read it I'd just let them dm you and then send it through email (provided they won't upload it anywhere)

*** Thanks for your reply. It's eases my worry a bit. I'm going to think about it a bit longer. And I will also see if I'm capable of putting myself in contact with them.

*** I just wanted to confirm something. You see, when I downloaded that work, I didn't know about the different systems to imprint fanfics, so maybe you'll want to modify it once I send it. It's just a heads-up. If you still want it, I can send it to you.

*** No problem with that. I know very well how can you miss it. Just give me a mail where I can send it (you can send it with a chat if you don't want to post it here). Consider it a present for a good beginning of the year (I believe everyone in the world needs it a little right now).
