:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry blatantly walks into the kitchen of number 12 Grim during an order meeting after he was told he couldn't stay for the meeting and then tells them off for using the kitchen instead of the meeting room or office.

Needless to say Sirius and the twins found it a hilarious prank.

Has a scene like that in it, but it's a fairly small part of the story.
