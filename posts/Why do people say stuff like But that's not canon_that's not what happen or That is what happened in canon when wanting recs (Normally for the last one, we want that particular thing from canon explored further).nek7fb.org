Those type of comments really don't help. The stuff that is from canon, you can explore in a way that canon never would.

Or you could write things up in a way that didn't happen in a interesting what if, etc.

But when people ask for specific recommendations, people almost always make a comment like the above, but just why? It doesn't help anything, I don't get it.

This is the fan fiction subreddit for Harry Potter, but then when it comes to certain stuff people get all up in arms about it, like that'd never happen. We know, that's why it's called it's fan fiction, and this is what the forum is, for fanfiction.


** This sub had a similar discussion just last week, and here is an explanation that has been mentioned there : [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted][Like Reality Unless Noted]]

When reading a story , the reader will assume that any detail not filled by the author will be similar than in the Real Wolrd. It can be for little things (coffee is made from beans), to bigger things (France has a President, UK has a queen . . .). In the cases where the story is nothing like the Real Wolrd (things like Fantasy or Science Fiction), it is said from the start that the story is happening in a different world, so the reader know he can't assume anything.

The same thing is true in Fanfiction. I'm reading fanfics to read different situations compared to Canon, but it is a fact that the fanfictions are build on the base on Canon. So unless the author clearly say that his work is an AU, I'll always assume that, outside of the "prompt" of the story and its logicials ramifications, everything else is pretty much the same as Canon.

There is also the "problem" (though it's arguable) of some people who have almost forgotten Canon or have a warped wision of it after years without reading the books (if they ever did) and only consuming Fanfictions. It's little things but, if the only difference with Canon is that Harry is now a girl, then why the hell is Ron now a complete moron barely better than Crabbe and Goyle, and why the hell is Hermione now a super model able to seduce half the school just by breathing. Another example would be a comment I saw in a GoF story (forgot the name), where someone the author why Harry didn't use a Magical Vow to prove he didn't put his name in the Goblet, totally assuming it was a possibility even though it never existed in Canon.

​

Basically, I read fanfictions to read something different, but I still want to be "prepared" to these changes. Completely unrelated changes (from what was previously announced) will just throw me off. This is why AU are usefull, they clearly say to the readers that he can't be sure of anything.

*** This, exactly - I always assume a base of canon, particularly in prompts/stories that are along the lines of, “if this one event/piece of the storyline happened differently, what would then happen?”

So if the prompt is, “What if instead of being raised by the Dursleys, Dumbledore decides to place Harry with a member of the Order,” I expect whoever he's placed with to have been canonically in the Order if it's a named character and not an OC (eg not the Weasleys, because they weren't part of the first Order). If that's not the case in the story, then I want the back story on why this person is an Order member and how they came to be one in this AU when they specifically weren't one in canon.

If you want to write a full AU where a number of changes are made other than what you say, that's totally fine - but mark it as such so the reader isn't thrown off by their base knowledge being incorrect.

** The best part about stories that aren't just canon rehash is knowing the WHY things change. If a story just changes something without saying how or why, and is just like "Harry is death eater now. Don't like don't read" then I assume the author is just terrible because it doesn't explore the motivations, the why, the how, the consequences.

The worst part though is when something changes but other than that it's just a canon rehash and they're not brave enough to follow through on their changes. I'll dislike a fic (and consider it complaint worthy but I tend to just ignore the fic after finding things like this rather than complain) if it's a canon rehash with 1 change that should be major and change everything but everyone ignores it. Longbottoms are 100% okay and somehow beat the Lestranges/Crouch without issue because Traps and Tactics or something? Why is Neville still a meek little shit, why was Harry not raised with Neville with Alice kicking up a major fuss. That sort of thing. "But the Blood Wards" only works as an excuse BECAUSE Alice and Frank were attacked, Lupin is a Werewolf and wouldn't be allowed, and they thought Sirius was Sus (and then he was arrested/imprisoned) because with all that, it showed the need for the protection.

But I'm pretty sure that Alice Longbottom being Harry's godmother (while James or Lily is a godparent of Neville) is completely fanon.

I mean, Harry was put in front of Privet Drive during the night between the 1st and the 2nd of November 1981, while the Longbottoms where attacked the 5th of November. Harry should have already been living with them at that time if they could.

If they were the same age as the Marauders, Lily and Snape they wouldn't have had time for that. They would still have been Aurors in training - because Auror training takes three years. And they wouldn't have had time to establish their names as great Aurors if they were that young. I always thought the Longbottoms had to be at least five years older than the Marauders and as Teenagers (which Lily and James until shortly before they went into hiding were) that's a pretty big age gap.

Doesn't mean they aren't expected to take up other responsibilities. Especially if the parents aren't around anymore. An older lady in the 1500's was the godmother of thousands of kids in her region, she paid the fees for their apprenticeship.

** Let me just rewrite this from a post in another fandom:

*Canon compliant:* Takes place between scenes of actual canon, but doesn't change the overall story. F.ex. A conversation between Harry and Cedric before the third task.

*Alternate Universe:* A change happens before Canon that would make the events of canon by it's mere presence in the world. F.ex. Lily isn't killed. Ex.2 Aberorth and Dumbledore reconcile. Ex.3 Bill and Charlie stays in Britain.

*BIG AU:* F.ex Non magical au. Ex.2 Everyone is a different gender. Ex.3 targeted gender bender.

*Point of Divergence:* Can easily be mistaken for an AU story at times. But the gist is that people make a choice that spirals the story in a different direction F.Ex. Remus takes care of Harry. Ex.2 Harry is more curious about his parents and figures out what they excelled at and wants to excel at it as well. Ex.3 Draco has a heavy case of the teenage contrarianism. Specifically against his father.

AU usually includes divergence here and usually requires quite a lot of change, I've seen a lot of stuff get lumped under "canon compliant" that would be AU in other fandoms. And HP fan fiction also has a lot of fantasy AUs (either changed to a more fantastical world, or written in the tradition of modern fantasy) whereas most AUs in other fandoms don't have this trend.
