I recently started reading WBWL fics and truthfully i enjoy very few of them because more often than not its just bashing of everyone so i thought i would create my own challenge but feel free to pick and choose if there is something in the following that sparks inpiration:

Harry isnt the BWL but instead is a prodigy or Dumbledores apprentice/protege

bwl is just a slightly above average wizard

no prophecy or that it was fulfilled at toms defeat

harry's family is either dead or like canon Nevilles parents

Tom kills whoever is the BWL publicly so that there is no Chosen One bs this occurs either during the triwizard tournament or if tom succeeds in getting his body back because whoever is the bwl is useless

Harry faces off against tom and death eaters multiple times

no golden trio

no bashing except maybe ron if it can be done well

pairing haphne or harry/fluer

*Most importantly* magic needs to be epic dumbledore harry and tom cant be the only truly powerful wizards the qoute below is from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/]]) and its what comes to mind when i think of wizard and witches battling

"Gone were the days of old, where armies faced off on the field of battle. Transfigured beasts tearing each side to shreds, conjured weapons falling from the skies, and where witches and wizards came together to murder each other by the thousand.

Wars that created legends of heroes and villains wielding incredible skill and power."


** linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) has most of what you're asking for. It's a gen fic where Neville is the BWL, and Harry's parents are in St Mungo's. Harry himself was brought up by the Dursleys and is unaware of magic until right before he starts Hogwarts. As the Dursleys never told him about his parents, when he first sees them in St. Mungo's he's determined to use transfiguration to fix their brains. It's really well written.

** Yeah, all the different bwl stories just have Harry being abandoned or neglected in favour of someone else amd then actually he's a good and destroys everyone

like the neglect is noticed by someone and they do something about it
