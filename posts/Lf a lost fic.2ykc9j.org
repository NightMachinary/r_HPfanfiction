Hi, Started reading fanfics about 7 months ago and am trying to find one i read at the start of my journey. It was a harry/hermione post Dh. After the battle Ron dies and harry leaves England without telling anyone and goes to america, 5 years later he returns to either teach dada or quidditch. Hermione happens to be the new transfig teacher and is royally pissed at harry. They eventually get together, any help will be great

*** Considering the uncomfortably graphic Luna/Ron sex scenes in Bearings, it's safe to say that's not it. Still a pretty decent read, though.
