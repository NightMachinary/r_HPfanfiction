I've been reading Problem with Purity (The Snape/Hermione fanfic) and I've reached on Chapter 14 where Harry asks Hermione in Christmas holidays that he wants to learn dancing because he saw Draco dance at the Yule ball and he was wonderful.

Now, ever since the beginning Harry's interest in Draco has been made pretty evident. However, after he threw a Cruciatus at Hermione (before the holidays started) , I thought Harry would not be interested in him anymore.

Note that after the Cruciatus incident, Harry's request for dancing lessons is the first time the story is showing any mention of Draco, let alone Harry's interest in him that STILL exists after the fiasco.

I'm amazed how the author can still expect Harry to be into Draco after that incident, or am I missing something here ? (Till chapter 14, when she starts teaching him dancing).

Edit: Reached the point when they were dancing on the Astronomy tower on New Year's and he actually says " I don't know how I can care for a man who cast a Cruciatus on you Hermione, I still want him, and that makes me feel horrible" ..

WTF


** Never read that fic, but:

- Attraction doesn't have to be logical

- Attractive people (I assume Draco is one here) get a pass for a lot of things

- Women (I assume the author is one, given the pairings) love their bad boys

****** Okay so my favourite trope of all time is the 'secret occlumency lessons' one, which basically says that Snape was giving Hermione occlumency lessons through sixth year and that's when a relationship started to develop. It's brilliant on a number of levels - some fics have Snape helping Hermione with her parents, which fills in the plot crater of Hermione modifying her parents' memories but later saying she's never cast the memory modification spell, and they mostly fit beautifully into canon.

Linkffn(Angels to Fly by Slytherpouf) is my current favourite. It has a beautifully done spiky-yet-vulnerable Snape, but then all of Slytherpouf's Snapes are beautifully done.

Linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the H B P by Grangerous) is beautifully done also. Its the first in a trilogy and is the very slowest of slow burns, and I love it.

Linkffn(Camerado by Milliejoan) is also magnificent. The author has promised an epilogue, but the story is complete without it so don't worry.

Linkffn(The Professor's Discretion by TwelveYearsInAzkaban) is absolutely stunning. It goes a bit off the canon rails in seventh year and there's no romance as such, just this beautiful sense of emotional intimacy that builds throughout the story.

I'll be back later with some of my favourite other fics :D

  Forced to give Hermione Granger private lessons, Snape soon finds himself desiring something he cannot have, and it begins to consume him. He looks to escape, but the endgame has been Seen and there is nothing that Severus can do to change his fate. Is there?

** I think you're going to have to accept that this author believes that if you 'love' someone then you will keep loving them no matter what they do to you (or your friends) , because tbh with some of the shit Snape pulls in this fic I would be totally in favour of Hermione chopping him up for potions ingredients.

This is not an opinion I agree with. There has to be some point where you say that 'this is enough. I don't have to put up with this' and leave, because if they pull that kind of shit at the beginning of the relationship and you allow it, you're setting yourself up for disaster.

However, those caveats mostly apply to the sshg ship in this fic. At the point you're at, Draco has only really done this one thing, and I think Harry may understand the pressures Draco was operating under (I think there was something about unforgivables setting off the wards and using one may have been a conscious choice to summon help and cut the encounter as short as possible, while still doing what needs to be done). I also believe Harry and Hermione have a discussion about that very subject, but you may mot have gotten that far yet.

So look, I don't want to write any specific spoilers, but... If you're having a problem accepting this bit you might want to reconsider reading this fic because honestly, it gets much much worse (not between Harry and Draco though).

**** Hermione being a bit of a show-off is pretty much canon though. But this Hermione Sue thing that's going on in this fic is... A bit much. I mean, she's a super powerful witch with a unique animagus form who knows everything and calls her professors by their first name. Why is she even in school anymore?
