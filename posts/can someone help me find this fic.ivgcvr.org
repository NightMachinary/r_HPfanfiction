:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic once in a post apocalyptic setting, where both sides have been decimated, so voldemort decides to sacrifice his followers to power a ritual to go conquer an alternate reality. I recall that Harry was too late the ritual, and that he had been hoping to get with fluer after defeating voldemort, though fleur ended up dying.

It may have been part of a different fic, but for some reason, I remember that harry gave up the deathly hallows in the process of going to an alternate world at Death's request and needed to gather them again in the new world. anyone know fics that matches 1 of or both descriptions?


** this one fits the first

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
