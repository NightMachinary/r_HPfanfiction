Even the worst fanfics sometimes have great moments, that don't particularly fit into the story, but are just really enjoyable. What's your favourite?

** In /Harry Potter and the Four Heirs/ (EDIT: the sequel, /Kings of Magic/) Harry gets his driving licence and /immediately/ proceeds to buy a car. On his ride back to Privet Drive, he turns on the radio and "discovers" R&B and hip-hop. I should also mention that this Harry is also the heir of Gryffindor, master of ALL THE ELEMENTS and Prince of Souls (essentially the Master of Death before it was a thing).

  Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

#+begin_quote
  Dousing Ronald in troll pheromones should ensure the big guy arrived, though with a club in his hand instead of flowers. Harry thought that Ronald being rogered to death by a randy rank troll was a fitting punishment for the animal who dared to touch his Hermione.

  "There is an operation the muggles pioneered that can physically turn your son into your daughter. There would have to be a post operative potions regime but, as he hasn't quite hit puberty yet, they should be very effective. We are not talking being able to bear children here but they would at least be able to physically have sex and lead a near normal life as a female. As we all know, female squibs have a far easier time of it than their male counterparts. The only reason I'm suggesting this is I know the family is moving out of the country to build a new life, the child couldn't possibly stay in Britain after this opperation. In Cairo, no one there need know your new daughter used to be your son. It's obviously a bit more complicated than that but it is a viable option and I thought you should know about it."

  They finally got there and Molly declared, "Ronald Weasley will be no more, in his place we will have Ronda!"

  "Avada Kedavra!" A.K. snapped out with his wand aimed at Harry.

  Harry just smiled and watched the spell smack into his chest and bounce off with a high­ pitched clink. It dissipated in a small shower of green sparks when it fell to the ground in front of Harry. Harry grinned, "Doesn't even tickle anymore."
