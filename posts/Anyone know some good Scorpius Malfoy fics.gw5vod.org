I'd preferably see him paired off with Lily Luna, but I'd settle for some well written Scorrose fics. I'd also prefer to see Scorpius written as not just a carbon copy of Draco. I find it likely that Draco would've realized his mistakes as a child and raised his son in a better way. I feel like being the son of death eater would lead to lots of bias against him from Hogwarts students and teachers, and Narcissa's betrayal of Voldemort at the end of the war would poison a lot of the Slyherin's against him. I'm looking for stories where he overcomes all this, befriends Al, then has a romance with Lily or Rose. I've read The Inquistor's Son and enjoyed it quite a bit. Any recs?


** If you don't mind slash, try Sins of the Fathers, by Blamebrampton. I think the pairing is the only criteria this doesn't meet. (It's Scorpius/Al)

(Actually, read it even if you do mind slash. It's a helluva fic.)

** linkffn(Ignite by Slide) fits all your criteria. This is the first-book in a Scorpius-centric, three-book series which is considered one of the very best next-gen fics, and one of my favorite HP fics.

The first book is very different from the second and third books; they're all very-well written but in different genres. The first one is a pandemic thriller where a mysterious disease has ridden the world, and Scorpius, Albus, Rose, and three others are the only ones who haven't succumbed to it. The second is a global adventure-style thriller as this group of friends become involved in a larger uprising, and the third is largely a romance and conclusion to the plot introduced in the second book. The entire series has fantastic writing, complex and interesting characters including a fairly unique take on Albus, and a historical perspective to much of the plot.

I personally didn't love the first book but a lot of people like it, the second and third books are pretty much acknowledged as the highlight of the series.

linkffn(House of Cards by Aebbe) is a more traditional Scorpius fic and a four-book series, he doesn't have a relationship with Rose but his relationship with Draco is really well done and is a big part of the story. It's more traditional fanfic and not on the same tier of quality as the Stygian Trilogy, but it's fun to read.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  James Potter and Scorpius Malfoy are enemies, everyone knows that. So when a Malfoy is put in Gryffindor, sparks soon fly. But with dark magic rising, the Malfoy family in trouble, and the Muggle and Magical worlds set to collide, old rivalries may have to be forgotten. Various pairings. Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone.

*** I've started reading Ignite, but as negligible as it sounds, the use of ' instead of " makes it almost impossible for me to get into any sort of flow reading it. Is it worth powering through that?

**** That's a Britishism, I'm somewhat used to it so never really noticed it. The writing is very good and gets better throughout the first book, certainly worth powering through that.
