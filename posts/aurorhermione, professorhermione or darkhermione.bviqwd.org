I'm looking for fics that are hermione centric ofc also even better if it's already complete, idc if it's one shot, SF or LF don't care much about pairings either, as long as it's well written


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Auror!Harry and secret Thief!Hermione. Awesome heist action, auror police drama, clever disguise tactics and the Death Eaters don't know why they can't find their blood magic books.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Revolutionary!Hermione, Politician!Harry. If the system is too corrupt, maybe the french muggles had the right idea. Featuring Ron in a flying invisible tank, Ginny as broom fighter, and Viktor accidentally starting the Bulgarian revolution.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Guerilla!Hermione. The Ministry wants to avoid a war and tries appeasement politics, because who cares what happens to the mudbloods? Turns out that they do care, and they know guerilla tactics, how to make napalm and one of them has family in the IRA....

Linkffn(Coven)

Dark!Hermione. Accidentally discovering a ridiculously overpowered ritual leads down a dark path of murder and sacrifice....

*** /Coven/ is new to me, and the summary reads a bit Dumbledore-bashy. How is it?

**** Terrible summary, great fic. Dumbledore tries his best but assumes that Voldemort is behind everything dark even when he isn't.

***** Pretty interesting so far, but the author seems to be intent on making up problems out of nowhere. There's the whole gender inequality thing that has no basis in canon, and if we take Pottermore/interviews as canon, there was a muggleborn Minister of Magic in recent past. Nor had Lavender ever bullied Hermione, that we know of.

******* No, it doesn't, but it should try, unless there is a good reason not to. In very general terms, by labelling something a fanfic, you import the reader's notions of the characters and the setting from canon, and, very importantly, you import whatever suspensions of disbelief they have had to make. Every deviation from canon is additional cognitive load on the reader and requires its own suspension of disbelief---the reader inevitably asks why a particular change had been made.

******** Fair enough.

I suppose this just doesn't effect me very much because my memory of canon is incredibly vague.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

*** Coven is great! The writing is a little awkward (always a hard read when the author decides contractions are for letter mortals), but I love the premise, plot, and character development much more than I expected. I might be getting back on a dark!Hermione kick...
