#+TITLE: Looking for a very Specific old Fic - Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, visited by 7 Sorceresses and told she is the Virgin of Light, while Harry is called the Green Knight? Mild Ginny/Draco( with plenty of grooming from the Malfoys) but mainly Hinny, and a showdown with Voldemort in Machu Picchu?

It was something like the Final Prophecy or Final element? The main things I remember are:

- Ginny is sorted into Slytherin and gets rejected by the Weasleys for this
- Ginny is very much still using the Diary, and had the whole connection to Tom Riddle
- Ginny is into art and painting
- She's visited by seven goddesses/sorceresses/witches who each give her a ring, and is being tolda prophecy where she must aid the Green Knight (Harry) to stop Voldemort, they regularly call her ‚ÄúThe Virgin of Light‚Äù, I believe Morgana Le Fay is one of them?
- Ginny is basically top of her year in marks, child genius sort of thing
- Ginny and Draco have a mild romance, but it's very much for survival
- Both Draco and Ginny get killed by Voldemort- Draco for trying to protect her I believe, but she comes back? -Both Tonks and Moody were Slytherins (the lesson being ‚Äúnot all slytherins are bad‚Äù)
- Centaurs help train Harry for the final fight
- the showdown takes place on Machu Picchu with the Intihuatana Stone that Voldemort was going to use to come back to life.

I CANT FOR THE LIFE OF ME REMEMBER THE NAME but I'd definitely appreciate the help ‚ù§Ô∏è

** The Unforgettable Fire by The Labris. It used to be on fictionhunt.com. Don't know if it still is.

Pretty old and got taken down a few years ago. I loved it when I first found it...I don't wanna think about how long ago that was.

*** Nope! The fic used a LOT of mythological references and names and imagery, but it was more just a way to refer to Harry than his destiny. ü§£
