Basically what are uncommon duos you've seen in hp fanfiction whose dynamic you have really liked? It doesn't matter if its a romantic or platonic relationship ( though I do have a slight preference for friendship). Its also ok if its a very specific set up and the duo would not make sense outside the world of that fanfic. My current fav is Draco and Bill from the Code series by Aduro but id like to see other uncommon and weird duos in fics.

Duos i wouldn't count as weird/uncommon

Draco with Blaise, Nott, Pansy, Hermione,Harry, Ginny, Padma, anyone in his family or any death eater and Voldemort ( though not necessarily Riddle haven't seen much with him and a more human looking Voldemort or young Tom Riddle)

Harry with Hermione, Ron, Parvati, Padma, Ginny, anyone in the Order( including the ones who were canonically dead when he was born), his parents and Voldemort/Riddle

Hermione with Harry, Ron, Draco, Ginny, Blaise, Nott, Neville anyone in the Order ( including the ones who were canonically dead when she was born), and Voldemort/Riddle

Ginny ( same as Hermione except add in anyone in her family too and Luna)

Any of the Marauders + Lilly with each other Snape or Harry

Apart from that I'm good with anything where the major focus is on the weird duo. I personally prefer plot heavy stuff but that's not necessary.

Please also list your fav fics with said weird duo


** The Arithmancer did a good job with Hermione/George

** I like any sort of cooperative relationship with Harry and Tom, it's just so satisfying to read them working together

linkffn(Xeroxis) was a great example

** /Regulus Black and Harry Potter/

I've seen one platonic, one romantic and another almost mentor/father

One second I'll link them forgot

*face death in the hope* Not romantic yet despite over 142000 words but it's tagged. Really funny and good story too.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

*A storm across time* Their friendship is tagged so I'm counting it. Harry is like a big brother to Regulus.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

I would include the next one /but/ it's not really a thing until the end and Regulus isn't even tagged. But he becomes one of the main characters and assumes a care taker/mentor role.

/also if anyone knows any fics where Regulus is either a key/central character or is just an interesting side piece, I'd love to get my hands on them/

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12299451/chapters/27959679][Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]] is set around a conversation that Remus has with Hermione. It's a believable missing moment from Deathly Hallows and it's very well written. I love their dynamic.

** Ron + Ginny. Their relationship pretty sucks in canon so this is more of a wish-fulfillment thing.
