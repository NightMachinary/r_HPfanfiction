:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that it started pre-Hogwarts. An Indian friend of Lily's (Patil?) remembered the address of Petunia and comes to check up on Harry. He finds out that he's abused (?) AND that he doesn't know anything about his heritage OR magic in general. He teaches him in a warded tent in the park for a while before Dumb-as-door somehow finds out about it (wards/Mrs. Figg?) and comes to obliviate the guy.

Trying to use it as inspiration for a new fic I'm thinking about.
