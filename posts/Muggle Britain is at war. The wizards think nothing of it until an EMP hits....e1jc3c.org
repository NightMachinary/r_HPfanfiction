** EMP detonation over London means no one's cell phone, camera, camcorder, etc. work anymore. So long as wizards can mobilize fast enough, they can contain the exposure. Regular folks are probably more worried because they can't get on Facebook than the fact that a dingy pub is now where it wasn't before.

Of course, the Ministry is destroyed and Hogwarts muggle-repelling charm would have to be rather powerful to cover the entire grounds but the situation isn't yet lost.

Fast international deployment can contain the fallout.

Regular folks are probably more worried about the nuclear weapon which detonated a few hundred miles above their heads and the fact that there will probably a lot of fallout from that if they don't get away.

**** Nuclear detonations for EMP attacks are usually at such high altitude that nuclear fallout isn't a pressing concern.

EMP as a secondary effect of nuclear attack is more like the scenario that you describe. In that situation, the crater in central London would be more important than the Leaky being seen--and it would provide the distraction needed to re-enable the muggle-repelling charms.

Additionally, there are non-nuclear EMP weapons.
