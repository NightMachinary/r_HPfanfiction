I'm looking for an old completed fic I remember reading on ff.net. It was one of those Snape is Harry's biological father fics. I'm pretty sure Harry found out about it before Snape and tried to keep it a secret. I also remember Harry getting trapped in a portrait for months in the later half of the fic (or he was willingly hiding in a portrait?). I also vaguely remember Snape getting tortured by a fanatic Light-side OC at some point.
