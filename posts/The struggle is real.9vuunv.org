** So is the premise that Harry and Hermione look into the mirror and see themselves in a relationship?

** However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

** On the surface, it seems like a very easy relationship to write. Best friends, one male one female, they spent a lot of time together and for the most part get along...

AND YET

The amount of quality content for that pair is surprisingly small. You have a few good one-shots (Definitions of Romance, Gamps finest blend of pretend) yet when things get longer the story inevitably gets bogged down in one of these issues:

- Too much talk about true love way too early in the story. May include proposals or runaway marriages.

- Weasleys: Either bashing them to hell and back, being assimilated into the collective or always looking out for how "Ron will react to X"

- Creature rights: Boy that is one hell of a Pandora's box due to everything from House elves, violent centaurs and werewolves where we meet exactly one decent one and a bunch in Voldemort's forces. It is not nearly as black/white as most authors make things out to be.

- Manipulative Dumbledore: Instead of simply sticking to his canon characterisation of sometimes useful, sometimes roadblock with good intentions and a few knuts short of a Galleon, let's turn him into a limp antagonist who gets nothing done and is no threat at all yet has entire chapters devoted.

- Death Eater revisionism. Often found in stories where Snape plays a big role or Dumbledore is the antagonist while Voldemort is fighting for the small man. Because nothing turns stories into quality content faster than writing apologism for magical fascists.^{^{/s}}
