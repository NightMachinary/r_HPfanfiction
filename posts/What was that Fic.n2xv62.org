There was a fic where Harry, who I believe was at least a bit dark, aided Tom Riddle (diary) posess ginny, permanently. It was tom/harry endgame. TomGinny had a few lines such as, to not bother her, bc she's "ginger and on my period" which she scared /someone/ with, though I can't recall who. Harry was a bit surprised that he/she, whatever TomGinny counted as, hadn't done something to cut her period off, but TomGinny insisted that Molly would know. There was no Weasley bashing, or if there was, it was only Ron, but probably not. I do believe TomGinny was 'trans', ftm, (TomGinny didn't want to deal with girl stuff), but I could be wrong. Weasleys were supportive. Its been bothering me ever since I lost it near the beginning of the year. Thanks!


** Damn I read this one, but I can't find it
