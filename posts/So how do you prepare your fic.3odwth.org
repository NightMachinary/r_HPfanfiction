** I have an idea and I write. I usually have key points I want to hit, so I might direct things a bit in order to reach them (okay sometimes I do literary gymnastics to get where I want to go, but I'm trying to break that habit), but I don't plan out every little detail. It definitely has downsides--I'll get several chapters in, or almost to the end, and only then realise I've got a great big plot hole early on that I need to go back and fix (which is why I don't post until I'm comletely finished), or I'll reach a plot point that I suddenly realise needs certain scenes to happen earlier in the story to set up for it. My early chapters get a lot of re-writing and heavy editing even before I finish my first draft.

I once read a quote from some famous author (possibly GRRM) who said there are two types of authors: gardeners, who plant the seed of a story and let it grow, and architects, who plan everything out before they start building. I liked the comparison and consider myself very much a gardener, albeit one who'll use sticks and ties to make things grow the way I want.

** I think most fanfiction writers start with an idea of how to throw a monkey wrench into canon that they'd like to explore, figuring the rest of it will work out as they write. This is why so many stories are abandoned.

I have learned that the only way to grow a garden is to plot out what the end will look like. The best motivator for writing a complete story is to have an awesome climax scene and a satisfying wrap-up. Once the goal has been visualized, it becomes much easier to work in themes and motifs that'll lead the reader to expect or at least appreciate the ending you came up with.

Which is not to say that the end that you wrote can't be revised or even tossed out for a better one to encompass diversions that snuck in while you were writing. Nonetheless, it isn't a story until it has an ending.

** I first started out with just the idea of "Harry runs away from Hogwarts". Then I started writing. I was at 70000 words when I hit a brick wall. I reread it all and came to the conclusion that it was all very stupid.

So I started carefully planning things out, fleshing out the characters, coming up with a few OC's, building a timeline for past events, building a timeline for important events to come and figuring out how I wanted it to end. Now I'm properly writing the story again and it's so much better. Slower and more calculated, but so much better and more rewarding, I feel.

Of course everyone has a different way of writing, but what I did realize is that the only way you'll find out your own style is to simply start writing and see where it leads you.

**** Yeah, I kinda have a lot of time on my hands and nothing to fill it with. I'll only post it when/if I've completed it, though. The further I get into the story, the more I find that I love writing and I'm taking the story very seriously.

But it's funny, I think a lot of fanfic writers started writing because they thought "if someone posts this crap, why can't I do it too?" That's how I started too!

** There's always a key idea that I pop up that spurs me to write an idea. I spend some time fleshing it out, and other random important plot elements that I wish to cover. Then, I create a rough timeline of chapters, to help control the flow and the pacing.

The most important part is to have it flow naturally, and not feel like the story is forced. That means you have to be willing to deviate from a planned element if that's where your story has taken itself. Personally, I probably under plan a bit, or underestimate how many words a scene is going to take. For my most recent story, it ended up being a bit over 250 pages, and I had about 25 pages of notes, which either take the form of brief snippets that I fleshed out, or mere bullet points of random ideas that pop into my head.

Perhaps the most important part is to just start writing. All the planning in the world can't save a dull story.

** It honestly depends on what I'm writing. When it comes to dramas, I'm actually rather particular about how I write them. The plot is defined in broad strokes and the characters are almost fully detailed by the time I even write the first sentence. Then I start drawing in other things that interest me and see how I could fit it in with the plot and characters, or if it can even fit at all. I usually have a pretty strict outline of how the first three chapters will be written, how long they'll be, and if there's any room for deviation from that, before I start writing. And even then, I'll usually be sitting for days trying to figure out the perfect opening sentence. I think Hemingway said all you have to do is "write one true sentence"; what he doesn't mention is that you may be sitting there for weeks trying to find your one true sentence. It's actually a very intricate process of planning, cutting, and planning again.

Oddly enough, all established conventions (and logical thought, in general) are thrown out the window when I write comedies. I usually just think of one thing I find hilarious, get mildly drunk, and then see where my stupid brain that takes me.

**** Being drunk definitely gives me a go for comedies.

Usually, I'll just think of one stupid, kind of funny idea like: "Harry waxes poetic about Space Oddity to someone who has no idea what he's talking about". The next thing you know, I'm drunk, and there's a 1300-word scene of what's supposed to be a super-serious interrogation to stop an assassination attempt that Harry mostly spends gushing about David Bowie to a muggle-hating pureblood. Plus, that interrogation scene was only there because I wanted Harry to compare the pureblood's mashed-in face to Picasso's Guernica, to a horrified Hermione.

**** Oh, I definitely recommend writing drunk! It's so much fun!

But seriously, alcohol makes you less inhibiting, so you're not as critical to yourself while writing, which can really help. I came up with the Parisian version of Diagon Alley after I drank a lot of wine: Rue de Mentaire. Now imagine a grown man, behind his desk, typing on his computer and giggling like mad at that pun because he's drunk.

** Being a visual person, I see my stories play out as movies in my head, and that's how I conceptualize scenes, characters, setting details. If I come up with some epic piece of dialogue, or a really heart-rending moment between characters, I have to jot it down immediately. Then I build the scene around it.

I'm also not a fan of meandering storytelling so I normally plan a series of scenes per chapter. And I've only ever written revolving third-person perspective, which is fun because I can switch between characters and keep things subtly rolling, in a sort of we're-all-cogs-in-a-machine way. I think this keeps me from getting bored with my own story.

Like others, I normally like to work with an end or climax in sight. It's important for me to know where I'm going, if I don't know how I'll get there.

My first serious fic was/is a long running mystery, so I had to plot it chapter-by-chapter, otherwise I'd never remember where the hell I was going with a certain plot point. Mysteries, I think, just have to be pre-plotted to make any sense.

** The best way is whatever way gets you to the finish line ;)

Writing, in a sense, is the way I plan. I know the major plot points, but I largely discover characters and subplots as I write them and like you, let a lot of situations develop organically. The first time I write a story, it's for myself. I'm telling the story to me. A second go-through would be theoretically tightening the story up and cutting out all the wishy-washy parts that past me wrote when I hadn't fully discovered what I was writing yet. A very noticeable trait of my stories is the "real" story doesn't get going until about a third of the way through, because it loses that wishy-washy quality around there. So I never have the perfect vision of a story up, but better than no story and never writing at all.

Oneshot-writing is nuts, though. They start from sentences or images and branch out in odd ways, but I have to write it all in one or two sessions, slashing out things as I go, or else I lose all inspiration.

** I pretty much only write world building, but it's a ton of research (canon and mythology), and a lot of expanded outlining. I'll pick a topic, decide where I want to go with it, then find everything I possibly can that's book/interview/Pottermore canon, filter out game/movie stuff. Rough outline with that, then fill in ideas for original material. Mythology research goes there, then it's the actual writing.

** I combine outlines with just writing. I will often have an idea and start working with it, sometimes just writing out as much as I can.

But, I like to create backgrounds, mainly to avoid inconsistencies. I will create little profiles for each character that I can refer to or change at will.

Most of the story progression comes naturally. If I have multiple scenes in mind, I will jot them down in point form so that I remember them later. But I let the writing itself flow organically simply because it allows me to keep things in line and focused, but it doesn't come off as sounding like an essay. It also allows for smoother changes to my "script".

Speech, in particular, I write as I go because that is how we speak. Most people don't prepare conversations in advance, they wing it, so the conversations I write may have some structure (like a point I aim to make, or where I want to have it end at), but the actual flow, format, and words used come naturally.

So, I used outlines for some things, but I also let it come naturally, which allows for me to keep structural integrity but also creates a seamless and smooth story without the rigidity of an essay-feel.

** I spent a year with a small story in my head before I decided to try writing it. I had written a fanfic like 7 years ago, but I've mostly just read them. Then, when I started writing, I spent about 8 months writing the same prologue 20 different ways and none of them truly felt right. So I talked to my brother about my idea and we had discussions on what kind of story it was in my head and it really evolved from those discussions. I ended up not writing a prologue and just starting from the first chapter and I've written 40,000 words so far of it. At this point, because I'm building an entire world (its an AU), I've been writing backstories for every single character in a notebook of mine, even for characters who won't really be a part of the story and are just mentioned. I'm calling it my wiki-notebook. I also have pages of family trees and a little bit of lore, but I'm about to make a full list of timelines so I won't get confused later on.

I've never been the type to plan ahead, I've just written stuff down and let it flow from there. But I'm really enjoying this backstory stuff because its fun and it will help me build a world that won't feel weird. As to where ideas come from for scenes, they mostly come when I'm in the shower or supposed to be paying attention in class.
