I've been reading through some saner Voldemort vics, Pureblood Pretense and inwardtransience's stuff, and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about sane Voldemort. On one hand, there's definitely some very interesting moments you can get with saner Voldemort. Him using charisma and shit instead of just torture, him having much more cunning plans, etc. But I feel that, with saner Voldemort, that fear factor kind of gets reduced. Sure, Voldemort can be more efficient when he's not insane, but he also seems to not be as frightening.

What do you all think? Sane or Insane?


** Sane Voldemort would have been the Minister of Magic for some time by the moment the books roll out and wouldn't go around as a terrorist. The old families had enough influence after his fall already, so I can imagine he would sway them his way and get power via relatively peacfull means. He isn't constrained by time as he has a horcrux and Britain isn't some sort of dictatorship for him to need a civil war to gain power.

** I honestly don't really mind, as long as he works as an effective part of the story and some gaps are explained.

I also don't need to see voldemort DO a lot of stuff. A villain can be much more scary if we hear more about him to build him up than that we see him. You need to fear voldemort when he finally decided to grace us with his presence. Hearing about how he can just free the entirety of Azkaban and not know how he did the impossible is much scarier than seeing him do it. I've read too many fics and i think we became quite desensitized to him. Make him do unexpected things. Make the reader fear the unknown.

In LoTR, we don't see sauron do shit, but hes frightening nonetheless.

** Define "insane". Define "sane". I definitely feel that Voldemort should be a true sadist and psychopath to work as a villain. But a 'sane' Voldemort in the sense of a 'rational' Voldemort can be made to work.

Conversely, there is something very compelling about the 'insane' Voldemort who is so overwhelmingly powerful a Dark Wizard that he can get away with acting like the ranting loon which, in an individual still bound by the rules of human society, would be lurking underneath a more composed façade. I like Voldemort to be beyond caring that people think he's a walking cliché, beyond people telling him that there are other ways to deal with problems than Killing Curse, because he's so goddamn good at Killing Curses that he /does/ actually succeed in solving his every problem that way. (Until Harry strolls in.) The important part of this take on insane-Voldemort is that he /acts/ insane because he /wants/ to, because it's /fun/; if things go wrong he /can/ slip back into the persona of cold, hyperrational Tom Riddle. He just doesn't need to most of the time because he's a living god.

** A bipolar Voldemort. I want a sane (or as someone else said, a rational) Voldemort, who is really charming, and is able to make long term plan with his followers. But sometimes and just snape et Crucio people left and right.

** I prefer a more sane Voldemort dealing with a smarter, more proactive Dumbledore.

** Personally I've never felt insane Voldemort was any threat, throughout the canon books we dont really see him succeed on his own merits, like, ever. Were told hes dangerous but honestly wormtail and lucius were bigger threats in canon. So honeslty sane Voldemort is the only one I can take seriously because it makes me feel like theres a small chance he might actually succeed at something.

Edit: I know some people will bring up his takeover of the ministry as a counter to this argument but that was a hundred percent lucius' doing.

*** Even "sane" Voldemort like in many fics is still only sane by comparison to the Canon one. Same goes for his "followers".

Voldy and co. had all the means to take complete control through non-violent political means, but instead they randomly decide that terrorism and sadism are a better way.

I blame Rowling for writing completely idiotic, unsympathetic, unbelievable villains.

Then again, HP started as a children's story. At the end of the day, Rowling is a children's story author, no matter how much she tried to be otherwise, and how much potential we've seen actuated in fanon.

** I prefer sane logical Voldemort or sane logical Riddle if the story is pre dark lord days. Riddle/Voldy was a charismatic manipulative person to have recruited all those people. You see some level of that in the pensive memories. But when you see him as Voldemort you don't get any of that. He just seems like cartoonishly evil. Not the kind of person that would willingly be followed.

I dont mind crazy Voldemort depending on the type of story he can still be an effective threat. But i still prefer sane Voldemort especially in a story where his character or perspective or strategy is explored at all.

** I actually just find insane voldemort stupid, unless it is taken to the extremes, like in one fic I read where:

Voldemort's Horcruxes were destroyed

Harry didn't manage to kill voldemort though

Voldemort takes over the country

Without his horcruxes he is becoming weak and is rapidly aging

Since voldemort has too little soul he can not make more horcruxes

He realized this, so he took a room in the ministry and placed the veil (The one that sirius fell through) beside him. He got thousands of people one after another, to be sacrificed in rituals to keep him alive. It was so disgusting how /desperate/ he was. I would have rather died than suffered that fate. It was ever more scary when I imagined a huge line of people, so so big, and all the people were dreading what was going to happen as no one ever came back out. That was one of the only times insanity made me shudder.

​

However, a sane voldemort who is very cunning is scarier. I've read many fics where I shudder in the situations voldemort puts harry in. In many fics, he manages to trap harry (Not necessarily physically) in a situation. He manages to find out harry's morals and beliefs and use them to his advantage.

​

Remember when Voldemort said to dumbledore that if death was nothing, kill the boy. I guess he was trying to be cunning and trick dumbledore into killing harry, but he was too insane to do that. Well, Sane! Voldemort manages to do cunning acts like that that are thousands of times better and actually work.

** Sane Voldemort is competent Voldemort, so it makes for much more interesting stories, as it's usually coupled with smart death eaters and a Harry that can fight, and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty
