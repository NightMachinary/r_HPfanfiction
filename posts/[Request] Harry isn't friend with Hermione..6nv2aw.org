*** You and me both! Not only because it would be better for both characters (I don't actually hate Hermione, I just think she's not growing up because she's as bad and socially inept in DH (she still doesn't know the meaning of the words: Privacy and boundaries (as in: Friends have the right not to tell you everything)) as she was in SS) because both (Harry and Hermione) would be forced to grow up and deal with their bad personalities (in canon both are seriously flawed individuals)...Harry would have to kind of "man up" in order to get half way decent grades and Hermione would have to learn how to not make everybody feel like they should be lucky that the great Hermione even wants to talk to them!

I love stories where Harry (who isn't stupid and can learn if he really wants to - Patronus charm for example!) has an academic rivalry with her!

*** All this Hermione worshipping that most authors do always made me cringe. Especially if it's really stupid. Like for example, Harry being raised by Voldemort, hating mudblood but still befriending Hermione.

**** Holy fuck someone should give you a gold for this. Befriend a "mudblood" if they are worth befriending, lol.

***** If it was canon or good raised Harry then yes he can befriend Muggleborns. But if it's a Harry who was raised to hate mudblood he can't hate all mudbloods but still befriend Hermione just because.
