I just wrote my first chapter of my story. Fuck it's hard putting idea's to paper. Especially describing things and people. It took me 4 hours just to write that one chapter and another 40 minutes to go over it. I will never complain about good abandoned stories again.


** It all comes down to motivation. Why are you writing your story?

Have a good idea you want to turn into a story? Outline it heavily to begin with or you're going to be stuck with difficult plot points quite often. Spend as much time editing the finished product as you do preparing the first draft.

Do you want to become a better writer? Find authors you like and read reviews of their material from literary critics to find out what makes them successful. Learn to love constructive criticism from your harshest detractors. If you haven't met them yet, some can be found [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=11][here]].

I wish you luck in your writing!

*** I can't help but agree with this. My first complete story got that way because I aggressively outlined it when I got the inspiration, which made the writing proper much easier. I'm working on a new set of stories and I've come up with a series of outlining steps: one page for the story, then one page per chapter, then three pages per. Hater, then the first draft (I've yet to actually get to this step). It's really allowing me to set up my Chekov's guns, plot points, and avoid plot holes (as in, 'where did that come from'). It also means I know where my story is going (the fact that I only have three complete stories, with four incomplete, and one abandoned is testament to my fickle muse) before I even start typing. I'll let you know how well it fully works when my current story is done and started posting (another thing I'm doing, writing it all at once and then posting it weekly once complete).

**** Do you structure your writing at all? For example, a chart of what you want to happen in what chapter, who should develop in what way and when?

** Oh its not easy, that's for sure. I just spent 3 hours writing/editing and when I looked down it was only 4000 words. I was almost giddy from it though, finally putting my own ideas to words instead of reading another persons that I don't quite like.

** I'd say that my main problem is simply that I write stories slower than I invent them. That's probably not unusual but it seems to cause me issues.

Basically I have a complete vision of what the story will become and as I write it I get part of the enjoyment that (I hope) a reader will be getting. There's a certain amount of spontaneity in how the characters react when I write which means I rarely know exactly how the story is going to progress before I start.

The problem is that I write pretty slowly and I think much faster. I mean, I have a few hours available each day to write this stuff (maybe) but I have many more hours to think about where it's all leading. Put simply a large part of me is completely selfish and once I feel I have plumbed the depths of a story it starts to lose its interest.

Why's that a problem? Because I'll have probably 'plumbed the depths' by around about 1/3rd of the way through. After that it's just will and a desire to finish things that I start and they're not nearly so encouraging as an interesting and new story.

*** OMG, you basically described me!! The worse thing is when you really want to work on a scene that is only going to happen four chapters ahead of what you are currently writting. It is frustrating... and I feel like I've often rush things a bit because of this.

I also have another problem; English isn't my native language, and I refuse to post my chapters before they be edited by a beta reader... since my old beta abandoned me, I've been having serious problems to find a new one... this lead me to an almost one year hiatus, even though I have lots of chapters ready. And not posting then lead me to loss the interst in carry on writting it.. :(

**** Hey, if you need a beta writer, I'm available. I've been described as a grammar nazi, and I've consistently performed well in English classes. Just shoot me a message if you're interested.

** There is a problem for me with outlining too heavily... if I already know what is going to happen in my story then I lose the motivation to write.

I write half-million-word epics so losing focus sucks. When I let myself think about it it becomes "what the fck did I get myself into this time?"

I hate disappointing my readers, but I also hate losing out on instant gratification from reviews... so I force myself to finish a chapter I'm not really happy with and then stare at the blank page for the next chapter.

New plan to finish my current story is to stop publishing and just write it to the end in one large document. Then my editor/beta and I will go through it and find stopping points for chapters and fix them.

I write much better unhindered by looking too deeply into details and such. I will stick to my plot outline, but the timeline may change around a bit. I like my stories to be organic. I know the direction and the ending, but how I get there is as much a surprise to me as it is to the readers.

I have all these characters living in my head, I put them in a situation and then it is like watching a play or tv show. I just write down what is happening, I don't force anything if I can help it.

...its been 2 months since my last update... I have about 4,000 of this chapters words done but I "aim" for 7k-10k word updates since I only publish once a month... if I were only aiming for 4k I would publish more often and probably be less stressed....

My total wordcount on FFN is currently just over a million words... that blows my mind sometimes.

** I had the same... I started writing fanfiction last year, and I lost the motivation for it. I had the general plot outlined, but it then just got tiring.

** I have not abandoned mine per say but the feedback is often an indicator of whether ideas are bad or really bad. It is a draining effort especially if you have original fiction to work on and know that even with all the fan fiction adoration in the world, you can never write for a living or a big legacy with just fan fiction.

That being the case, I get very frustrated with fics abandoned after a few hundred or a thousand words or so, they clog up the pages when it is clear even the author no longer cares about them.

** It's so easy to abandon a story you want to keep writing, too. Sometimes if you haven't written in a long time there's a kind of 'anxiety' about starting up again, but the only way to get rid of it is to just write something. Even if it's filler, write it. Then when you get to the actual content again continue writing, and if the filler is really bad you can cut it. If it's okay you might want to keep it in.

Just write something. I like to write just a little bit more than a chapter or scene every time I write, because then when I start again I won't be thinking "Man, I have to start something" but "Oh, I left off here, so this is what happens now".

** I abandonned two stories because I couldn't find the motivation that I needed to keep going. Also, I kept changing my mind about things and I was never satisfied with my writing. Like, I would have the plot outlined, write up the first few chapters, then read back over it a week later and be like "Welp, this is stupid, I should have done this differently."

In the end it was a lot easier to just write Oneshots.

** Yeah, you don't really understand until you actually write something. I have a pretty well-received Pokemon fanfiction, but I almost never update. It's just hard to find the motivation sometimes, and when I am it's often when I need to be doing something else.
