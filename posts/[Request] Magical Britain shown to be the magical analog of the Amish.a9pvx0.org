** The ignorant, backwards wizarding world trope really bugs me, because it seems like people focus too much on advancing technology and less on what that technology /actually does./

Wizards have had airplanes and helicopters for centuries. They're called brooms and flying carpets. But they're mostly used for fun because they have /teleportation/ for their actual transportation needs. Either infrastructure based sender/receive with the floo network, preset point-to-point with portkeys, or dynamic point-to-point with apparation.

Electricity? What for? They have HVAC, lighting, and fuelless cooking all without it. There's no reason they can't have unlimited hot water, even without water pipes! Wizards simply don't need utilities infrastructure, because they can do everything that it does for muggles only /better/ without it.

One thing that the muggles have up on the wizards is communications technology, though. For general day-to-day remote communications they use the tried and true method of "get a physical message to the other party." Granted, their owls are much, /much/ better than methods available to muggles pretty much up until the invention of the telegraph. And even after the telegraph, they're still better in most cases. Wizards /do/ have other means of communications available (communications mirrors, protean messengers, floo, patronus, ect), but they're all very limited in their scope. But I would imagine having ready access to teleportation means there's less pressure to develop the sort of generalized realtime communication systems that us poor muggles have. The bits and pieces are all there, but nobody really cares because if you really want to talk to someone you only need pop on over for a chat -- talking to someone who lives 500 miles away is no more difficult than talking to your neighbor.

--------------

So really there are only a few things the muggles actually have up on the wizards, technologically speaking, such as realtime communications and large scale information handling. And wizards don't really need either, so they never invented them.

*** Hey, so this is a "request" thread. I'm not disagreeing with anything you've said here, but can you maybe offer a suggestion, then? Like something that subverts the trope you're so annoyed with?

"Telephone? What's that? Oh it just lets you talk to someone? Can you hop into the phone and come out the other side to visit the person then? Sounds like a really shitty version of the floo network, mate."

**** I mean, yeah it's a request thread, but does that mean we can't have a discussion here as well?

*** This.

Oh, and wizards lack entertainment but that's only because with such a small population, expecting Hollywood level productions and as rich a musical culture is crazy. I so dislike 'stuck in 18th century' trope. Hell, they are even ahead of us in gender equality considering Voldemort killed madam Bones to ensure she doesn't become minister and their main sport is played with no gender restrictions.

**** The fact that their sport consists of sitting on a broomstick instead of having to run around like in football probably helps a lot with the gender thing. Much less of a difference compared to football for example.

***** Just think of Harry, he's described as pretty scrawny, yet he's the best seeker at Hogwarts, it's clearly based on some sort of magical talent for flight more than conventional athletics.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]]. It is basically the only case of "magical Britain is backwards" that I liked. Note that it is not "muh muggle technology", but more a matter of very drastic views on what's to be considered dark magic. During the fic we learn some pieces of historical background which led to the current situation so it is not just a weird thing existing in a void.
