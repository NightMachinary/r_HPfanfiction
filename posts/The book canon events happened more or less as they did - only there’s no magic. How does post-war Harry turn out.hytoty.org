Let's assume for a second that HP universe is not a magical universe: Hogwarts is an elite boarding school, Voldemort is a manic serial killer slash cult leader, Lily and James have been shot etc. How would particular events and plots be converted into their muggle versions (eg. how does Triwizard Tournament look? What is Fluffy guarding instead of the stone? Etc). And how does post-war Harry turn out now that there's no soul splitting and Voldemort is no longer “basically not a human anymore”? Personally I think there would be more repercussions - in canon the fact that Harry killed someone is kind of glanced over, psychologically speaking, because Voldemort barely qualifies as a human being (among other reasons of course). Now on the other hand, he would be a “full person” (with his soul intact, I mean) - horrible, of course, but still - so there should be something more there.
