** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9068617/1/Cloudy-Silver-Eyes]] i don't know if this was girl Draco or Draco's sister but in any case it isn't too bad of a read. It's been a while. I believe it is also WIP

** I liked this one, classic genderbender via potions accident. It's a bit "slashy" though, bit an interesting read.
