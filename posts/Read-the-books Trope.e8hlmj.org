So, we have 'Hogwarts reads the Harry Potter books' fanfics, but do we have 'Hogwarts reads Harry Potter fanfiction' stories? I'd be mildly to moderately interested to see the Golden Trio's response to some of the more... lurid Trio smut out there, for instance. Or finding out what Snape thinks of Robst fics.


** I've read a few of these and they are mostly horrible. One included Draco and Harry finding Drarry smut and then deciding it was hot so they hooked up later on or some shit. If I can think of the title(s) I'll rec some, but honestly it's such a specific weird fic that you could probably find it, or similar, by searching up Drarry reads draco/harry fanfic

**** That sounds like the kind of intersection of weird-and-awful that needs to be seen at least once - car crash TV, I think is the term.

Okay, nope. I've googled a little and I am very much with SwiftNinja on this one - WTF is probably a little too understated, really. I don't think I found what you were talking about - the closest I got was 'Draco Malfoy's Fanfic Adventure', which was more of an instant-hookup thing. Dear lord. Well, reading that was certainly an experience. Thank you for adding that to my life. :D

** The closest thing I can think of is /Hermione Granger's Guide to Gender-Flip Fanfiction/ by the same guy who did /Weasley Girl./

*** I enjoyed that, thank you. Mildly snide meta-commentary is hard to pull off well, but Hyaroo seems to have done it. Reminds of the Stanley Parable and Bard's Tale narration, come to think of it.

*** I like how this one avoids the usual set-ups that struggle to weave fanfiction into the canon world and end up being neither funny nor interesting. The first chapter was great!

  One shot. AU by both means and intentions. Featuring Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Special appearance by Severus Snape. It's too serious to be a parody.

*** Huh. I'm not part of the Percy Jackson fandom myself - the books are on the list but the list is hella long. Is there a lot of overlap between that fandom and Naruto in fanfiction? It seems like an... odd meeting of concepts.

**** Theres no real overlap but naruto and percy jackson cross fics are hella popular for some reason. My best guess is its probaly because a few authors did it decently and others tried cashing in on that.
