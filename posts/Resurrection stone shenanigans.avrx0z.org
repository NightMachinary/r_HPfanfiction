What creative out-of-the-box ways of using the resurrection stone to beat Voldemort can you come up with?

Summon Voldemort's mom to yell at him?

Ask Merlin for private tutoring?

Create a small army of ghosts?

The stone is one of the most powerful artefacts in the potterverse and you rarely read about it.

** Summon Herpo the Foul. "Hey, idiot - your Horcruxes aren't working right. They should have kept you intact even if you were hit with a blood-magic-reflected Killing Curse. You /did/ cast the Cruciatus Curse on yourself, right? You need to do that in order to synchronize the emotional components of the soul fragments, so you- Oh, my god. He did it. What an idiot. Potter, this man is an embarrassment, please put him out of our misery."

Alternately, summon Flamel and make him tell you how to create the Philosopher's Stone. "Just two immortals, dueling each other until the end of time?"

Summon Salazar Slytherin and have him disown Voldemort.

Summon all of Blaise Zabini's various stepdads, and have them all talk his mom up to Voldemort, until he can't help but marry her. Then let her do what she does best.

** I firmly believe Merlin isn't dead, as per the legends. But that aside, all good ideas I see here on this thread! I'll add summoning Lily so she can tell Snape to stop being a bully, give him warm congratulations for the good work that he did, and encourage him to keep doing it.

You could generalize that, really. Get Ariana so she, Aberforth and Dumbledore can finally work things out and Dumbledore can stop feeling sorry for himself all the time. Summon James to once and for all set it straight in Remus and Sirirus's minds that A) neither is to blame for what they did, B) nor should they waste their lives in hatred and vengefulness on Pettigrew, who isn't worth the attention.

While it would have to be a one-trick pony, I also think using the Stone to summon all the people Voldemort has killed so they can confront him would do really weird and interesting things to his broken psyche. The entire power-trip he gets from murdering people seems based on the thrill it gives him to be the one immortal in a world of weaklings with whom he can do as he pleases. To come face to face with those he thought he had exercised his awesome power to get rid of once and for all --- it'd be --- well --- a shock. Perhaps enough of a shock to make him realize he was an idiot to ever create the Horcruxes in the first place.

** The Stone is stupid powerful. Seeing lost loved ones again is sentimental drivel.

Knowledge is power, especially in the wizarding world. And the Stone is access to the knowledge of everyone that has ever lived and died. Ever.

*** ...unless you're in the MoR fanon, in which case the Entridict Of Merlin (or whatever it's called) prevents knowledge being passed down except from one living soul to another, and the Stone does Not count. You can't use it to learn anything you couldn't have come to know anyways.

OR you're in a verse in which the Stone just creates a pale imitation of the departed, depending on how well you knew them.

***** Er... "interpretation" isn't especially a religious term. Don't know where you're getting that from. "Interpreting" something just means assigning meaning to it in a context where it's a little ambiguous what the actual original intent was. To try to read and make sense of illegible scribbles is "interpreting" the gibberish, for example.

Literary interpretation is a long and storied tradition, and it perfectly falls within the definition of the word to call different ideas of how the Resurrection Stone works "interpretation". Similarly, whether you choose to believe the King's Cross Station scene was some sort of dream or a visit to the Afterlife's antechamber is "a matter of interpretation". Whether you prefer to think that Peter Pettigrew was a not-particularly-evil, but utterly spineless man, or that he had always been sympathetic to bigotry in his heart, is "interpretation". Etc, etc.
