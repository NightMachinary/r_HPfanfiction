This was probably written in the 'summer' between Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix, and definitely pre-HBP.

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are living in an (underground?) 'safehouse'. There are no doors or windows. They get supplies and food through a 'dumbwaiter', which operates like House-Elf magic (plates just appear and disappear). There is no contact with the outside world, but someday, when it's safe, Dumbledore will retrieve them.

  One day, Harry doesn't wake up. Hermione and Ron try to contact the outside world by leaving notes on their plates, with no success. They wonder if there's even anyone still out there. At the end, I think they just lie down next to Harry, waiting.
