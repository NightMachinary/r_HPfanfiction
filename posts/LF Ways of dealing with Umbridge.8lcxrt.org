Umbridge, outside of like 3 fics, has the exact same character as in canon, contemptible, evil, less personality than a Dementor. But there's only ever 3 options shown in dealing with her.

A: Canon Harry way, of actively allowing yourself to be tortured, even in "Independant Strong Harry" fics, him acting like a moron and letting his hand be sliced open happens sometimes

B: Some elaborate Magical listening device, or giving Dumbledore a heads up, or calling Madam Bones "As she isn't corrupt" somehow, and Umbridge gets arrested

C: Pranks

Are there any unique ways? Even if it's just disgusing yourself as Voldemort and Crucioing her I don't care how silly, cracky, or even just OOC and gruesome, i just don't want to see Harry actively sit through 7 hour detentions (totally not legal) with a Torture device, and never report it (Umbridge is arrested post war for her war actions, not what she did to Harry/others) It's just hard to read when a "strong" main character rolls over so easily. That part of OOTP was one of my least favourite in the whole series.

****** Proposition A: /Harry Potter/ Centaurs are a proud, highly intellectual, highly civilized people who pride themselves on their honor.

Proposition B: Wizards are very much prejudiced against Centaurs, and it's not absurd to think those wild tales could have leaked into Muggle lore pre-statute. E.g., to anyone bringing up ancient IRL mythology in this debate, you're probably quoting the anticentaur equivalent of "Muggle-borns steal magic from Squibs".

Proposition C: Centaurs consider non-Centaurs with the same vaguely disgusted disdain that purebloods consider non-purebloods. Also, Umbridge is a disgusting-looking old hag.

Conclusion: Yes, this theory /is/ thoroughly ridiculous if you stop and think about it.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world.

** B is a decent option, honestly. Bones isn't suggested to be corrupt at all. Tonks (or maybe it was Lupin) says this outright before Harry's hearng, where she does indeed act reasonably. And her provably torturing the most famous boy in the world (even in he's unpopular at the time) is probably enough for her to throw Umbrige in a cell.

That aside, I dunno, you could just frame her for something the purebloods dislike too. Like, oh, getting it on with centaurs. :3
