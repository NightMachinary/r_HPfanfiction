*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7919460/1/][*/Alternate Scene by the Lake 4/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3697775/Rumour-of-an-Alchemist][/Rumour of an Alchemist/]]

  It's 1976 and the scene by the lake after the fifth year defence OWLs but instead of trying to fight back with magic, Severus snaps his own wand and throws it at Lupin's feet, announcing he's quitting Hogwarts. Alternate Universe. Rating 'M'. December 12, 2017: minor revisions to epilogues & notes.
