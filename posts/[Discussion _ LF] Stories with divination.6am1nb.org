I'm looking for fics that have awesome divination that goes further than some talented seers and prophecy (For example: "If taught properly, it's a magic that everyone can do.") I have already read linkffn(1-800-Rent-A-Hero).

Quite a lot of fics kind of bash divination as a discipline as well as the class at Hogwarts. I mean, magically transporting information from the future to the current time is impossible, right?

Except, we know that you can magically time-travel in this universe. And we also know that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg1A7fB9nrk&feature=youtu.be&t=200][Hermione has sent actionable information to her past self in PoA, using future knowledge]] (by throwing a stone at past-Harry's head). Sure, that isn't how most people define information, but the message was clear: "Look out of the window".

We also have [[https://youtu.be/vL6crSpKEYU?t=24][another instance]] (Harry uses Felix Felicis to get the memory from Slughorn) of Harry using presumably future knowledge, this time without a time-turner. He magically knows that if he goes to Hagrid that he /will meet/ Slughorn, and he will get the memory.

And the biggest one is this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better."

  "What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
#+end_quote

The centaurs, +useless stargazers+competent diviners, /know/ that Harry will die in the forbidden forest. (Also, props to Rowling for foreshadowing Harry's death in Book one)

So why do so many fanfiction-authors (and canon characters) think that Divination is rubbish? There are clear instances of future-knowledge, even excluding prophecy, proving their worth, so a formalized study would make sense.

So why is it so underused or even hated? You could do so much fun stuff with cool divination as plot-device, and canon gives us plenty of hints that this is entirely possible.

Who knows, this could be an explanation for why Dumbledore does what he does in canon. Maybe magic /tells/ him that Draco will not kill any student this year, and thus he let's him act, and not because he's a senile, stupid, forgiving old man.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6975322/chapters/15897253][The King's Indian Attack]] has a bit of divination going on in it.

The summary is thus: "Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.

However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?"

** I assumed that Divination is the "Quantum Physics" of magic. If you're a competent diviner, you also know when and when not to say something, as in when and when not to measure what you have before you.

The prophecy, for example, could have been one of the thousands upon thousand of prophecies in the DoM that never came to be, but through the words being spoken to someone who was willing to follow them - they measured the information - it came true. And those who had the information reacted differently, according to how much of the prophecy they knew.

In real life cultures there have been a few different types of diviners. There are those who read nature to find an answer, true diviners that interpret messages sent by [insert supernatural force]. Then there are oracles, who divine the future by being in trance through the intake of fumes, drugs or by ritual. The last of the general categories are prophets, who derive their knowledge of the future form a divine being directly.

I'd like to think that Divination in the HP world categorizes similar to this. There are competent diviners, such as the centaurs that can make predictions upon observations. Then there are oracles, and I always interpreted Trelawney as such a diviner. People who are mouthpieces of prophecy, but unable to "measure the words" as they themselves don't know them.

** If time turners allow you to pass info to your past self without breaking things... at that point you've already won. At the very least, it allows instantaneous computation.

Also: I claim reasonable the following: The only reason memory-strand transfer to gain knowledge or skills is not a thing is that you can't place someone else's memory-strand into your own mind. Therefore, using a time-turner and the memory in/out spells, you should be able to learn all the things, and practice until perfect anything that does is not muscle-building-based, in the space of several realtime hours, by passing back memory strands each time you reach the end of the day, and your past self then starts the next loop from wherever the last left off.

For a Time Travel to make sense (why isn't everyone, or at the the antagonist doing it?) you need to either nerf TT terribly, or have TT be so broken as to be useless (i.e. it is given the MAD treatment), etc.

In my opinion the best way to rationalize this limitation without it being a transparent nerfing is that by incorporating other people's memories you are incorporating not just the basic information of what happened or what was learned but their entire perspective/experience of the memory.

Because a large part of who we are comes from our experiences, loading up on other people's memories would make you less and less yourself and more and more a jumble of other people or a single other person depending on how you source the memories. Best case scenario, you are no longer you and are now someone else; worst case, you've gone insane.

Most people would find major issue with this side effect and decide it's not worth it. Even if advanced occlumency could somehow mitigate this, that's difficult to learn in and of itself and something tells me it still wouldn't be a perfect solution.

**** But semantic, episodic, and implicit memory are different - the only Pensieved memories we ever see in canon are episodic memories. This implies that wizards have either not even thought of this, have not figured out how, or those who have have kept it secret.

The memory of the knowledge of how to add numbers is distinct from the memories of learning it (based on that brain-damage-sufferers can broadly lose memories one without losing the other).

** TBH, I much prefer an AU where time travel is impossible, or so heavily constrained in possibility as to be almost useless, and have prophecy be some kind of vague 'vaguely having a feeling, roughly, of possible future(s), without neccessarily knowing how a given future might come about'. For such a cliched work, the Inheritance cycle does this very well (The dragon-bone thing is more of a 'there exists a time in the future after which you will leave the place known as Alagaeisia forever, and there are /so/ many loopholes it's not even funny. Other than that, there are visions of possible futures, but they are avertable, but avert-attempts are sometimes self-fulfilling....'

** I freaking loved rent a hero's interpretation of divination. Using it to find missing girls, etc. I wish more fics did this.

I like the idea of Dumbledore actually having a grasp on Divination. I mean, he is super old, presumably there was once a competent teacher.

  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.
