I've had a headcanon where Severus, Minerva, Filius and Pomona get together and talk about Dumbledore, the other Professors, and the school as a whole; and was wondering if anyone would know of any stories that do this, or would like to write one.

Something like:

"Did you hear that Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas got together? Filius whispered, looking around as though they would suddenly appear in mid air.

"No! I thought that the youngest Weasley would end up with Harry!" Pomona murmured; a hand over her mouth in shock.

Severus scoffed and turned to leaf through his Potions book; to see if there were any particular questions he could ask the younger years, that they wouldn't get, so he could properly scold them.

"I'm sure it's just a matter of time," Minerva joined in, matter of factly.

"I'll give it a year before young Weasley and Harry are together." Pomona said.

"I'd give it 6 months." Filius said.

"You're on! Loser has to buy the best of the best Firewhisky." Pomona said.

"Deal!" Filius agreed, shaking hands with her.

Just that idea is so funny to me. Doesn't have to be like that, just something in that lane. Even if it's short like that; that's fine. Just would like moments like that.


** linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday)

A random day in the life of Minerva, filled with talks with the other teachers, confrontations with Umbridge, student pranks, avoiding aurors looking for Dumbledore, even more student pranks, etc.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
