I read this fic years ago and I have been blue balling because I commited the mistake of not including it in my favorites. It's a fic where Harry becomes mute out of the Dursley's traumatizing abuse and Snape gets to visit Harry and sees his condition. He then takes Harry and adopts him and Harry learns to speak again even though it's just a few words.


** Is this a pre-Hogwarts fic, or does this take place after Harry's already been to Hogwarts?

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? cover pic - Harry's cub

****** No problem! Just a heads up; there is severe Dumbledore!bashing in this fic and very little plot development in the later chapters, so dont read the more recent stuff if thats not your cup of tea.
