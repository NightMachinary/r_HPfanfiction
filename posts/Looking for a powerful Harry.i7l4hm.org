:END:
I remember very little

- Harry turns all the death eaters in squibs
- Bunch of purebloods in St. Mungos
- Narcissa Malfoy in a court hearing in the wizenmagot tells everyone according to a auror report Harry was involved in turning her husband and son into squibs. Harry denies it and asks Ms. Malfoy be investigated how she got that report

That is all I remember Harry may of been a mage or some OP!Harry

Thanks

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.
