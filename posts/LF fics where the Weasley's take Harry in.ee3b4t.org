I remember reading a fic back in the day where Arthur had to choose between Harry and Dumbledore and he sided with Harry. And basically I just want all the fics where the Weasley parents (or the children) take Harry being locked up in his room with bars on his window seriously, and decide that nope, he's not going back, Dumbledore can go suck an egg. It also doesn't have to be Anti-Dumbledore, he can also eventually realise that yeah, ok, maybe I was wrong and the Dursleys were worse than I thought, but all I really absolutely want is Good Weasleys, Supportive Family Weasleys, Harry suddenly has all the brothers and a sister and doesn't know what to do with all this family.

Also doesn't have to be right after the bars on the window debacle, just as long as it's before he's an adult.

Also, I'd prefer no romance between Harry and a Weasley if he gets there pretty young, because it did creep me out once when I found a fic and basically 15 year old Charlie was just waiting for baby Harry to grow up so they could bang and that is so not my cup of tea.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
