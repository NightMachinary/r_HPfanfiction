See title. Harry actually dies that Halloween night, but somehow comes back to life the very next morning. The rest is all up to the fine authors on here.


** Harry becomes the master of death when he gets older and can not die. Time is not linear for death, so even "before" Harry becomes master of death, he is unable to die. Bonus points for the fact that the power Voldemort doesn't have just being the inability to die.

*** If you want harry to still be an orphan, voldie finds out about harry's survival so he tries again, murdering Harry's parents and getting himself killed in the process. The mother's love sacrifice thingy could either still work because she believes she is sacrificing herself to save him or because death is annoyed and wants it to work

****** The changes I would make to the second book are a)when doing chores outside, Harry talked to the snakes sometimes. He just kind of assumed it was something everyone could do, but people saw sakes as inferior and.chose not to talk to them. He feels zero percent bad about being able to talk to them and he likes them. He knows the voice in the walls is a snake and doesn't question it because a snake lived in the walls of the Dursley's house too. It helped keep the rats out of Harry's cupboard. b)when investigating draco for his possible heir of slytherin-ness, he saw his humanity and realized that a lot draco's shitiness was a result of how he was raised. Like Dudley. He isn't friends with him or anything, he just understands him more and feels a little pity for him. c) pheonix tears cannot heal basilisk venom. The only reason Harry didn't die was because he will be master of death. Once agian, Dumbledore does not know that. There is no record of a pheonix trying to heal someone who had been bitten by a basilisk. d) Hufflepuffs are loyal so maybe at some point he befriends a puff and he is incredibly grateful to have another loyal friend or maybe just he was nice to the puffs/didnt look down on them so they support him amidst other people's suspicion of him.

******* Third year: a) Ron realizes that he is good at divination. Does anyone think trelawny is good at divination? Harry potter and company certainly do not. But ron pays attention in the class because this could be his chance to be special at something and get out of all his brothers' shadows. Also, at this point he has noticed the fact that danger seems to follow Harry like a particularly vindictive chihuahua and he wants to be able to help as best he can. Being able to vaguely predict the future seems like a good way to do that. b) The reason the twins give harry the marauders map is two-fold 1: they have also noticed how danger follows harry and 2: they have successfully made their own map, so they don't need the marauders map anymore c) Remus Lupin does not forget to drink his wolfsbane potion or whatever it was called, so he just gets outed as a werewolf, rather than attacking his students. d) we stan book ron in this household. we more closely follow the book's version of what happens in the shrieking shack.

******** Fourth Year: a) harry Does Not want to be in the triwizard tournament. after a short (like 10 minutes) period of being angry at harry in jealousy, Ron gets over it and believes him. Harry and the puffs are chill so they also believe him about the fact that he doesn't want to participate. Draco is still a bitch about it, but after seeing harry get almost killed by a dragon, he shuts up and questions his views on harry. b) harry is in last place in the triwizard tournament. He is baby and it makes no sense for him to score better than the other participants. c) Harry thinks that Moody turning Draco into a ferret is kind of fucked up. Ron is still delighted. d) instead of getting dates with girls they have not interest in, Ron and Harry go with each other as bros. Que awkward terrible dancing between two teenage boys in the opening dance the champions have to dance in. Hermione thinks this is hilarious and she and Krum dance beautifully. e) at some point ron ominously predicts a betrayal, voldemort's return, and the "death of an ally", which is cedric

********* Fifth Year: a) harry has experience dealing with the whole "wow someone died because of me" thing so he has a vague idea of what helps him. He knows talking to people helps, but seeing as to how no one responds to his letters, he talks to the snakes in his garden a lot (he did this after he killed quirrel too). They try their best. One of them try to adopt him. As a result harry is both marginally better adjusted so he yells at the people he cares about less and also he likes Dumbledore less. He doesn't hate him, he just doesn't like him or trust him as much anymore. Plus Dumbledore gets to be creeped out by the fact that harry has a pet snake, just like voldemort. b) when harry gets kicked out of the occlumency lessons, hermione takes it upon herself to decide they should all learn occlumency together. Hermione being hermione, they eventually succeed. The problem is that the connection a horcrux has with its creator cannot be blocked by occlumency. Hermione starts researching what in the world could be connecting harry and voldemort. c) ron's divination predicts nagini's attack on arthur, but it is vague enough that when harry gets that vision about sirius, they think it is a prediction about that. something like "the dark lord shall attack one you care about in the department of mysteries". another hint for hermione's research. Why would nagini be counted as the dark lord? d) the DA is not called dumbledore's army. Dumbledore has to flee anyways. People from all houses are included in the DA, including slytherins. Just not any slytherins who are known to be affiliated with death eaters. sorry draco.

********** Sixth year: a) Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and whoever else is harry's friend in this story all work together to become animagi. also maybe draco. b) ron divined someting or other that led them to try befriend draco. c) draco is far more conflicted. I mean i know he was already conflicted but still. I feel like draco becomes a spy for harry and the gang because he has bonded with the rest when learning to become an animagi. d) sectumsempra is not used on draco. Perhaps it is used on some death eater or a dummy in the room of requirement. e) no romance stuff because I am both ace and also I feel like they are all too busy trying to prepare for war. Likewise I think harry has quit quidditch at this point. It reminds him too much of the firebolt sirius gave him. f) the DA is reformed with neville as the main leader and they are all preparing for war. (this is a year earlier than in cannon) g)Harry is grieving sirius big time (hence the whole all his friends are trying to become animagi thing) the snake that helped him with cedric's death is trying its best. h) Sorry I just think it funny that neither snape nor draco know who the other is actually loyal to. draco never actually planned to kill dumbledore, but he felt he had to at least put on the act. other wise everything is the same. Draco defeats him so the elder wand is now loyal to him. Snape kills him so Voldemort thinks the wand is loyal to snape. etc.

** "Oh my God, they killed Harry!"

In which Harry has the inexplicable powers of Kenny McCormick. No one really talks about it, but Harry Potter dies a lot. He always comes back and by the time he turns eleven most people have agreed to just not mention it anymore.

The muggleborn students at Hogwarts didn't really understand who The Boy Who Lived really was, until they here that he was brutally slain by a mountain troll. They thought everyone had been joking the previous night when he was sitting at the Gryffindor table the next morning.

Then they all saw him take a fatal fall from a malfunctioning broom in his first ever quidditch match. Traumatized, many students cried for the actual and tragic loss of a fellow student. Until he was at breakfast the next morning again. Over time, the muggleborn became used to The Boy Who Lived after being ripped apart by three headed dogs, murdered in the forest, bitten by baby dragons, and more. Good Lord, during his second year alone the sheer number of times he was killed by the basilisk is practically uncountable.

Every morning though he sits at the Gryffindor table as if nothing happened. And the muggleborn say nothing too, other than a word of explanation to the new firsties that just watched an older classmate get attacked by dementors, or whatever it was today.

Through it all, one man remains resolute, determined, even insane given the popular definition. Tom Riddle, who once had aims to be the greatest Dark Lord who ever lived, and who lived forever, has spent over a decade focused entirely on his quest to finally end the Boy Who Lived, once and for all.

** Interesting..

I don't think I'll ever use it though but I found a way to "free" the story from the prophecy that link nicely with this prompt:

- Harry Potter is born the 31st of July 1980.

- 9 months before would have been the 12th November 79.

Let's assume that he was a late birth and was conceived on Halloween, you could just make him "die" on the anniversary of the date of his conception, explain it away with magic handwaving about the day of the Dead and there you go, a Voldemort that greenlighted a corpse.

.

Bonus points if he's not the only one in the story conceived/born/whatever on a day/night of importance.

**** I think ‘All Hallows' Eve' does not actually mean that it's the eve before Hallows' but rather that is just it's name. It means that it's the night where the two worlds are the closest together. I'd either expect the next day to be totally closed off to spirits (who aren't anchored to the world already) from some ‘closing of the gates' or for there to be some period of time around the night where it's easier to connect to ghosts. It would be more interesting imo for it to be a kind of thing that builds up and up and crescendoes at midnight with some apex of power and then closes itself off again.

Erm... anyway All Hallows' Eve is significant on the day and not on the next, as far as I'm aware.

****** Actually, I've been perusing... [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween][Wikipedia]]... which seems to be saying that what we now know as ‘Halloween' is in fact the night before a more ancient celebration. There seems to be a lot that happened in between the origin of the event and the holiday it is now.

Samhaim, for example, appears to be a celebration that happened during the night between October 31st and the sunset on November 1st - owing to the Celtic day being between sunsets. There even seems to be an ‘All Hallows Day' on November 1st - during which the harvest was celebrated.

*** I like him becoming a better person.

What I wonder about though, is, how having such a tiny amount of soul in a developing person would influence them. From how things are described in the books every Horcrux splits the soul in half and leaves 1/2 in the Horcrux.

Which means at the end Voldemort had far less soul in him then the diary, but his BRAIN was already developed so that may have mitigated some effects.
