I was reading an article on Cracked ([[http://www.cracked.com/article_21025_5-reasons-harry-potter-wizards-are-huge-threat.html][5 Horrifying Realities of the 'Harry Potter' Government]]) and the article mentioned that "According to the best estimates that Harry Potter fans have to offer, Voldemort only had around 50 Death Eaters and a couple hundred lower-level goons." The link they provided was, to my surprise, a thread here: [[https://redd.it/1a9fru][How many Death Eaters are there?]] Now, I am aware that this is a small community, so seeing that was a huge surprise, especially as Cracked quoted it as an official source form 'Harry Potter fans'.

Just thought I'd share that interesting tidbit with you :)

Tomorrow we shall see. Somehow I doubt it will jump that much, we are a pretty niche place in the grand scheme of things.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Cracked and Buzzfeed get content from Reddit all the time. Sometimes it's cute, other times it makes me roll my eyes.

** It only makes sense, seeing as we're the first non-HP wikia link when one Google searches "How many Death Eaters are there?"

I'm sure many of us have taken quotes from random sources that are near top on Google and called them "official" or whatever. I honestly don't expect Cracked to be all that great with that.
