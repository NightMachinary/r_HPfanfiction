The term Occlumency shields has always sounded wrong to me I don't like it when Occlumency is treated like star trek shields. I like it to be something that while useful is still incredibly dangerous, I read once about it causing brain damage if used to constantly control emotions this is a reason so many practitioners are somewhat crazy Voldemort, Snape, Dumbledore and other purebloods.


** I have a similar opinion. I believe Occlumency isn't a really good thing, and that's why it's only used when it's absolutely necessary, and not everyone knows about it. It became obscure because it has negative effects on wizards.

I don't believe stifling one's emotions, and feelings is a good idea. I think it might lead to some serious damage; maybe not make people crazy, but rather apathetic, depressed and at some point, consumed by emotions like rage, sadness, betrayal, loneliness.

** I see occlumency as a mix of extreme compartalization and mindfullness. So extreme that when you focus really hard, or get to be an expert at it, things are so aparts from each others that what is on your mind - at least accessible to legimens - is only what you are experimenting and thinking at the exact moments.

So, the legimens would only get the feeling of you being legimented on. And when you're at Snape level, what you choose consciously to think about at that moment. Stray thoughts do not exist anymore for you when you practice occlumency.

That makes a lot of sense!

One of the biggest challenges in following complex recipes (whether you are cooking, baking, playing with organic chemistry or making a potion) is the focus that you need. You have to concentrate on your work, follow every single step precisely and time yourself so that everything comes together perfectly.

So Snape's natural talent in potion making would aid his skill Occlumency and vice versa.

** I honestly haven't read that many fics about Occlumency. I'm writing a fic now where it's a minor plot element and I don't want my ideas to be influenced too much by fanon!

I imagine there are different levels of Occlumency: the easiest is just preventing someone from reading your mind. This is similar to meditation, where you "clear your mind" and present a blank slate to the Legilimens. But this is not helpful in most scenarios, because it alerts the Legilimens to your Occlumency and makes it obvious that you are hiding something. If they're so inclined, they can just torture the answers out of you.

More advanced Occlumency involves controlling what the Legilimens can see in your mind. This could involve strategically suppressing or hiding memories and thoughts, or constructing false ones. But in order to do that, the Occlumens needs to mimic their own natural thought processes as much as possible. Occlumency can be dangerous to inexperienced Occlumens because clumsy Occlumency can draw attention to the exact things the Occlumens is hoping to hide; it essentially creates ripples that alert the Legilimens that something is amiss.

Truly skilled Occlumens can camouflage their Occlumency by making it mimic their natural state of mind and train of thought. An Occlumens must be an expert at their own psyche and how their mind works. This involves elaborate games of word association and thought-mapping that establish clear trains of thought and emotional reactions. Then, they need to practice creating false thought patterns that mimic the real ones. This is how they can hide or suppress thoughts or memories - if you think of their train of thought as a chain, they are learning how to remove or hide one link while making the chain still appear to be intact to the Legilimens.

The construction of false thoughts and memories is even more complex, because it involves stitching together elements of real thoughts and memories to create a false one. There are a couple risks here: in order for the memory or thought to appear authentic, it needs to mimic the emotional reaction the Occlumens would have to a real memory. So it's easiest to stitch together bits of existing memories or thoughts that have that same resonance - related to the same person, from the same period of your life, whatever it is. BUT if the fake and real memories/thoughts are too closely related, that could tip the Legilimens off. In investigating the fake memory, in your store of related memories they might stumble upon a component from a real memory you've borrowed from and notice the similarities. For instance, if you've fabricated a fake memory and borrowed the setting of your eleventh birthday party, if for whatever reason the Legilimens is peering around in that memory, the deception could be too obvious.

There's also some interesting mind-bending stuff about finding the truth in everything you portray to the Legilimens. The quote I like best is "Truth is in interpretation and impressions. You've interpreted your thoughts and memories to mean one thing, but you can rearrange them to give the Legilimens any number of impressions, and they could all be considered the truth."

Basically never tell a lie even when you're telling a lie. Find the kernel of truth in every lie you tell and twist your mind so that the lie becomes the truth and seems to grow organically from all the other true thoughts, memories, and experiences in your head.

If you couldn't tell, I've absolutely loved working this stuff out and have been having a lot of fun with it! :P

** I liken it to something similar to the mind reading magic of Eragon. In there, when one invades a mind, they try to get the target to think of what they want will the invaded tries to onky think of one thing or try to push the other out. No real shields. In short, my ideal occlumency would have 4 or so "levels" 1) Detect someone invading your mind. This would be the point of emptying your mind so that intrusions could be detected. 2) Willfully not thinking about what the invader wants you to think about. IE Voldemort wants to learn some secret from Harry and tries to force Harry to think about it while Harry focuses on one inane thing, like the laws of transfiguration or something. 3) Pushing the invader out of your mind like Harry did to Voldemort at the end of OotP. 4) Tricking the invader into thinking they got what they wanted while giving up nothing. This could be what Snape did to Voldemort to continue to stay undercover, with Snapr having the mental tenacity to temporarily actually believe that he had no knowledge of important details.

** I enjoy the way how ot is potrayed in Prince of Slyhterin by TSM It does have all the ideas that there are different levels so to say of how advanced a practioner is. So Level 1-2 is pretty harmless, just helps you learn how to order your memory better and so on.

Level 3 is where it becomes tricky as one starts to activly controlling ones emotion and also doing something which is called "Perceptual Dillitation"(might have got the name wrong) where you can sharpen your mind for a short moment(couple of heartbeats) and make it so that time appears to go slower. This has the threat of severe mental trauma and brain damage when used too long.

Then there comes the idea of opening up different mind streams( Two thought streams at the same time) which carries the danger of insanity

Level 3-4 carries the danger which is a theme in the fic of coming to the level of experience where you can 100% decide if you wanna feel something or not and than having the strength to also feel all the shitty emotions so you don't turn yourself into a Occlumency induced Psychopath.

And it continues further on in the fic

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][The Hagrid version, easily.]] It might be described as the "come on if you think you're hard enough" school of Occlumency. Definitely doesn't truck with the notion of the legilimens' not knowing they're being occluded against.

Most takes on occlumency I either forget or annoy me. I'm /really/ not a fan of the Occlumency as a defence against Dementors concept, for example. I'm inclined to think of Occlumency as being either "walls" (or some other barricade) which you can try to push through (potentially at the cost of brain damage)... these being of the kind Draco deploys against Snape... or fraudulent thoughts (whether outright fakes or manipulated truths), which is what Snape uses against Voldemort. Obviously I don't mind the mindscape concept.

I sometimes come across the (non-cracky) idea that Snape tries to teach Harry a particular kind of Occlumency, one which Harry is singularly unsuited. I don't remember what the alternative is so possibly what I remember is Snape tries to use a method which Harry is singularly unsuited to. Although, in that case, I don't remember the alternative method either.

I think Linkffn(6174323) has one of the better version of Occlumency.(although I do think. It a all road lead to Rome type deal, were there are multiple ways to learn and do it, with Occlumemcy being more of a branch of magic like charms and transfiguration and not one unified thing. I prefer for higher level magics like Occlumency to be more personal in the way the person learns and uses them)

** The inversion of the usual Fanon: That Occlumency doesn't allow you to "control your emotions", but rather, being able to do so is the prerequisite of learning Occlumency in the first place. (Which is why Harry is shit at it.)

Occlumency is magical extension of being a skillful liar; i.e. being able to think one thing, and saying another, and everyone else being none the wiser. It's not a defense against "reading your thoughts" because Legilimency is not "reading your thoughts". Thoughts aren't "sentences in your head" that /could/ be read. Rather, Legilimency is a magically heightened intuition, and it picks up the sum total of all cues /including/ your state of mind. And if you attack someone using Legilimency, you're looking through someone's impressions, and the more skillful you are, the better you can direct the impressions to figure out what you're after, instead of drowning in useless impressions of the kind /that jam I have for breakfast sure tastes great/.

Occlumency, conversely, is doing the reverse, i.e. controlling your mind such that A) no impressions leak out, and B), during an attack, you retain control so that only the useless impressions are there, or better yet, you don't think anything at all. For that you need a tidy mind, and a mastery of your emotional states, so that they don't interfere when you least need it.

.

Something like that, I think.

** I agree that "shields" and "mindscapes" are not just countercanonical, they also impoverish the amazing opportunities for conflict and character development offered by the mind arts, turning them into an "Immune to Legilimency" checkbox the characters can check and move on.

The following is a repost of some thoughts I've had on the subject. I think it's pretty consistent with canon as well.

*My headcanon*:

Generally, I think that the best interpretations of Occlumency are the ones that treat it as a /dynamic/ process rather than a /static/ defence: not a suit of armour but a parrying dagger.

My model for Legilimency is basically an interrogation with an element of torture. However, it's conducted not with words and physical actions but with qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.). Occlumency is then training in resisting this type of interrogation and torture.

The Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a magical channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster. Through this channel, the Legilimens can inject qualia into the target's mind and read the reaction qualia. That's only the beginning, however, because the Legilimens then needs to correctly interpret what they are reading and follow-up with whatever is needed. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads, and interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability, requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention a lot of practice.

Basic Occlumency is the skill of identifying, dissociating from, and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing. More advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder. (This can be dangerous, to the point of the Occlumens forgetting which of their thoughts are real and which are forgeries. To quote /A Scarlet Letter/, "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.")

A hostile Legilimens trying to break through---assuming that they don't care about being noticed and the target doesn't have a way of breaking the connection---will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by the imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens. (It's worth keeping in mind that the Legilimens has to, in some sense, experience everything they are sending, and so, say, sending the notion of extreme pain hurts both sides about equally.)

Now, that means that unlike the Levitation Charm or riding a bike, Occlumency is not a discrete skill that one learns and moves on. Rather, it is something that one /becomes/. To successfully resist an all-out attack by a skilled Legilimens, one must /be/ the sort of person who can, say, experience seeing, touching, and smelling a mutilated corpse of one's own best friend, sibling, or child (or worse) and shrug.

That, in turn, means that Occlumency training is inherently a painful and dangerous process. The instructor must necessarily expose the student to painful, disgusting, and disturbing qualia, because any attack that the student hasn't already experienced and learned to shrug off is one that may surprise them in the future. In other words, if it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong, and it may well be the case that the best Occlumency instructor is a sadist or a psychopath who is on your side. Becoming an Occlumens is therefore inherently traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

One aspect of Legilimency that favours defence is that Legilimency requires a functioning mind to interrogate, and drugs, sleep deprivation, and other things that might reduce an Occlumens's ability to resist will also tend to reduce the usefulness and the accuracy of the reading. (For a simple example, physically torturing an Occlumens would make it harder for them to maintain the presence of mind needed for Occlumency, but if all the Legilimens can get in response is "Ow, it hurts!", it's not a very useful thing to do.)

Lastly, eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal". That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts. A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

The Memory Charm interacts with Occlumency in an interesting way. I imagine that it has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., "last 10 minutes") and specific memories. The first one is pretty easy, and it's what's used most of the time, though perhaps beyond half an hour or so, memories become increasingly integrated, and trying to target anything older than that risks hitting unrelated memories. The second targeting mode requires the target memory to be brought up using Legilimency. This makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without their noticing.

These mechanics have broader consequences, which I think are pretty consistent with HP canon:

- Legilimency is *hard*, and learning the spell is just the start. Most of the time, there are much easier ways to extract information. Therefore, even people who could use it don't bother to learn it. This explains why very few people practice it.

  - It explains why Snape angrily dismisses the analogy of reading a mind like a book: even figuring out how to probe, to say nothing of how to interpret the response, is difficult.

- Becoming an Occlumens has a price, and rarity of good Legilimences means that even people with secrets to keep are fine without Occlumency.

  - None of the Occlumenses we know in canon are exemplars of mental health.

- The best Occlumency instructors are sadists and psychopaths who are on your side.

  - As it applies to Harry's situation, it explains why for all of Harry's complaining, nobody---not Hermione, not Sirius, not Dumbledore---questioned whether Snape is qualified to teach Harry nor his methods. Harry's difficulties controlling his emotions---"wearing his feelings on his sleeve"---give him a powerful Patronus, but it also makes it difficult for him to achieve the dissociation needed to "close his mind"---but enables him to open his mind even wider, which provides a form of defence against Voldemort's (and only Voldemort's) Legilimency.
  - As it applies to Draco's situation, it explains why Bellatrix (at least according to Snape) was able to teach Draco Occlumency, but why she didn't even try to use Legilimency on Hermione in DH: she has the sadism to use Legilimency to torture someone until they learn to dissociate, but she doesn't have the skill to interpret what she gets back to extract useful information. [1]

As a little addendum, something I wrote in response to a post several months ago:

*What Occlumency feels like to the Legilimens* (if the Occlumency is successful):

/Basic Occlumency:/ The Legilimens gets nothing. No matter what they probe, they just get placidity, neutrality, emptiness back. They might try to push some painful, scary, or disturbing qualia until they get some reaction, and then work from there. Still nothing.

/Mid-level Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, sending the stimuli to (they think) guide the Occlumens to the information they want, and getting back responses that they would expect, then once they have what they need, they terminate the spell and act on the information, discovering too late that they'd been terribly deceived about that last bit of information.

/Advanced Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, but hits a roadblock, and gets an idea to make the Occlumens think that they are no longer being interrogated so that they would let their guard down. They project a perception of them ending the spell in frustration and turning away. They then project the perception of the Occlumens slipping their bonds and somehow overcoming the Full Body Bind they are under. Then the perception of the Occlumens "ambushing" them, knocking them out and stealing their wand (in some order)...

When the Legilimens later wakes up (if they wake up) they will probably be able to reconstruct (if they hadn't been Obliviated) that the idea of making the target think that they had escaped had probably been injected by the Occlumens in the first place. Then as they were busy confabulating the perception they were sending to the Occlumens about the Occlumens escaping, the Occlumens had somehow disrupted the mental separation between the Legilimens's imagination and their actions, and they never realised that they were actually untying the Legilimens, ending the Full Body Bind, handing them their wand, and turning their back.

--------------

[1] There are, as always, alternative explanations. Bellatrix's sadism might have clouded her judgement: Legitimency would have been more reliable, but Cruciating the Mudblood was just too tempting. Or, Hermione might have picked up Occlumency off-screen.

I interpreted this to be similar to method acting. You are playing a character, sink fully into that character so when someone enters your mind they only see the character. Get good at doing this quickly.

In my head canon, the “clearing your mind” step is to get used to noticing your own thoughts as a precursor to pushing away thoughts you don't want to have (either intruders or the sort that would break character).

** I imagine there being visualizations of ones memory. Each person might do it differently.

One person might visualize their memory or memories being in bottles, another behind a door(s), another in a maze(s), etc.

Just depending on the person in question.

I also think meditation is a way to enhance your occlumency as well.

From my own view on Occlumency, Snape ironically let his emotions get the best of him, and he didn't teach Harry the way he should have been taught.

imo, You have to gradually get to that point, it takes years to normally get there. I imagine Occlumency only being learned by like 1% of the entire world or something like that, a very obscure form of magic that is extremely difficult to do.

** Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin has one of my favorite takes on it. Basically there's different levels of organization of the mind that can give the user certain benefits but with certain drawbacks as well. It's been a while since I've read it but I seem to remember there being some pretty gnarly consequences to using it too much to block out your emotions and causing some psychological harm. linkffn(11191235)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
