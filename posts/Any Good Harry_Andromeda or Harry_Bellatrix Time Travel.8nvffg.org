Wondering if there are any decent stories with this pairing, where Harry time travels to their era (so that Bella is perhaps not so out of her mind). Don't tend to like harems (they're usually meh), but they're not out of the question if it's actually good.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I don't think this one is time travel? I think it's a spin off from /Disorder of the Phoenix/ which is time travel Harry/Nym where the time travel never happened.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

*** I mean, it's more believable than any Death Eater ships, it can fit into many fetishes, from "hot older woman seducing boy" up to lactation, and can be used for various genres, from hurt/comfort to time travel and politics.

Never read a Harry/Andromeda fic that wasn't PWP or Harem, so IDK.

**** Porn without Plot or Plot?What Plot ?

Its also not an acronym, because acronyms are words that are formed by the abreviation, and not just an abreviation, like FBI, . Acronym would be NATO or Fedex.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
