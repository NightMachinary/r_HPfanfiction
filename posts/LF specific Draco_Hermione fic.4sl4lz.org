I've been trying to find this specific fic for months. I don't remember the title, but the plot is something along the lines of -Hermione under a dark curse, a blood stone or blood crystal or something -Draco works to free her from the curse -Harry, Draco, Snape, and eventually Hermione are in a secret order

Sorry I don't have more to go on, the main thing I remember is that Hermione is bound to a person via a dark magic object that Draco has to free her from. Thanks!
