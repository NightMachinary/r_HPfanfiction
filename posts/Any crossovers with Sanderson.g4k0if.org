** Rowling's magic system is so soft you could make pillows out of it, while Sanderson usually makes his magic hard enough to use as a drill bit. And when you start drilling pillows, that sprays feathers all over your plot. Makes it messy and hard to work with.

*** One could do something like Natural 20 and drop a Mistborn or Stormlight character into the HP universe (or the opposite) for some cool exploration.

"No, magic is not about waving wands and fancy incantations," said Vin.

"Good luck convincing any of these trolls of /that/," snapped Severus.

"It's actually about absorbing elemental metal and using their properties to exert various effects on yourself and the world around you."

"Okay, now you've lost me."

**** Well, you could, but without Stormlight anyone from Roshar no longer has their magic. Meanwhile Allomancy runs on Preservation, so if the HP universe has no connection to the Cosmere any Mistborn is also rendered useless. These problems could be handwaved, true, but I think you'd have to at least make any fic using these elements partially crack.

***** I think that sort of thing needs to be handwaved away in any crossover setting. Allomancy seems easiest to do that with, as I think canonically an allomancer on another planet in the Cosmere would still be able to get powers from the metals there - so just saying it'd happen on Earth seems fine to me.

For Stormlight, it'd need an extra step, but it could probably be tied in with Harry Potter magic somehow if the author wanted to - probably starting with needing to carefully ration it, and then having a way to renew the investiture somehow.

**** I think that's the way it'd have to go, yeah. Natural 20 does it wonderfully - though it'd be harder for an allomancer or stormlight user to manage to pretend to be a wizard/witch, it would still make for an interesting setup.

Particularly with how /weird/ both Roshar and Scadrial are (at least, pre-Catacendre Scadrial) - I'd see the major non-worldhopper characters finding our world very, very strange, which would be a good bit of fun.

*** Kinda. Sanderson tried something different with the Stormlight Archive, trying to have his cake and eat it. Surgebinding is his typical rules-based RPG style magic system, but the workings of fabrials are much more like the HP system of "allude to complexity and a body of academic knowledge and study, without explaining it".

** Wow, that'd be interesting but weirdly enough I've never really seen much for it. Mistborn and Stormlight are some of the more popular of his works so they might have some stuff on ffnet or ao3.

** I would love to see allomancer!Harry! Like if the killing curse opened his soul to death and since magic flows through the soul into the body he got powers like he ingested Lerasium or something.

Bonus points if Vin's cognitive shadow gets attached to him somehow and she gets him to run away from the Dursleys and teaches him how to live on the streets.

Extra bonus points if copper works like occlumency shields and emotional manipulation metals works through said shields, though Snape notices it happening.

Also, goblins.
