So, I posted below on the Film!HeadCanon vs. Book!HeadCanon thread about this . . . but I wanted to try a new thread to see what you all think.

1) Alan Rickman is an /amazing/ actor and an amazing Snape. /HOWEVER/ . . .

2) There is no denying that even in the very first film he is /way/ too old to play the character who is written in the book. Severus Snape would have been /thirty-one/ in the first book.

That is a huge difference! Now, close your eyes and imagine for a bit . . .

What difference would it make to you if the Snape in your head were really that age, not Rickman's? How would your interpretation of him change?


** One change it would make on a subconscious level is that Snape would have spent 10 years making up for his betrayal of Lily, while in the movies it looks like he spent 20 or more . . .

Much less time being miserable, makes his continuing guilt less pathetic, and perhaps even his lingering dislike of James/mini-James!Harry more understandable.

I can certainly say (from experience) that my antipathy towards the people who severely bullied me (leaving unrequited out of the picture completely) continued until after high school's 10th anniversary (28).

For reference, here's a picture of AR in 1976, when he would have been about Snape's age: [[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_63vjmbNLaHI/SfpYfGYtclI/AAAAAAAAAn0/m7smsImaDBc/s1600/rickman+8.jpg]]

** The people who are shown in The Mirror of Erised in the first movie are also way too old to be Lily & James Potter, and that bothered me so much more than Snape's age.

** I don't think I really understood Snape's age until I started reading fanfiction... I had this moment during [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][Snape Chronicles]] when I was like "Holy crap, Alan Rickman was way too old looking!

For some reason once I figured out that my perception of Snape was really wrong, I've really seen him differently. Either that, or I've read too much SS/HG.

**** Probably just the age at which I was reading fanfiction vs my age at initial read-through of the series.

I think it was when Snape was having an internal monolog about the difference between his age and the age of the students he was going to begin teaching. I sat there and thought about it, and I was like "shit, he's way younger than I thought from the movies."

Even though I read the books as they came out, I was too young to realize that all teachers weren't ancient like my middle school teachers seemed to be. d:

** That bugged me less than some other things they changed. I always assumed Gary Oldman would be Sirius via The Scarlet Letter, not all mustached.

Though, it was hard and a little silly, in the last film. I even LOL'ed at the Snape flashbacks, trying to make him look 21.

Though, I'm a pretty huge Rickman fan, so even though he is older, I still see him via Truly,Madly,Deeply. I also think, him in that role, is what Remus should've looked like.

*** Hah! That is true. Snape in the films is more as I imagine him--but young Snape sitting under the tree is /much much/ more the way I imagine him.

** My Snape had always been based on Trent Reznor over Rickman. I'm definitely a fan of both, but the age in the movies did bug me.

I think a younger Snape blurs the line more between repentance and true believer in voldemort. You don't often see old bikers but the ones you do see are true believers. Early and mid thirties is the cusp between those who die young and/or find a way out and those who stay forever. The age of Snape adds to his mysteries, especially in the beginning.

** I never paid attention to age. I love Alan Rickman. I also recall that J.K. Rowling wanted Alan Rickman to play Snape. I think rickman did a superb job. I can't think of anyone better than Rickman to play Snape. I always considered the fact that Snape was a spy. He was dumbledores toy and he was also a ”loyal servant” to voldie. dealing with the stress, his love for lily, his life in general was a weight to be carried. A lot of the fanfictions I have read have put Snape in the early thirties and mid thirties.

** I was reading 'Sabriel' around the same time that I was reading the Harry Potter books so I always imagined him as more feminine (deep contrast with his description and illustrations) but I think it made him younger in my mind as well. I loved Alan Rickman as Snape but yes, it did cast a definitively older vibe.
