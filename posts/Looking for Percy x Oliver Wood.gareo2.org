i want to read more fanfics that have percy and oliver as a ship. they don't have to be the main couple or anything. thank you!


** I would suggest - The maybe non-eventful life of percy weasley by MalSpinningYarns on ao3.

â€˜Percy Weasley was living a normal life in London, well as normal a life you can have when your younger brothers are famous YouTubers and you have four other siblings, until his old school mate and now-famous rugby star Oliver Wood came out as gay. And Oliver wants to reconnect. Now Percy's being dragged into a world he know nothing about and his siblings certainly aren't helping.'

** Oooooh this is my favorite ship! I have so many bookmarked and most of them are oneshots so let me see....

LinkAo3(Tea Time by MalSpinningYarns) and LinkAo3(I quit by ihrt) aren't just Perciver centric. 'Tea Time' is Cursed Child compliant and about Percy connecting with Albus throught the years. I dont like cursed child and you dont have to as its just mentioned. It's more next gen than anything. I love this story as it has lots of Perciver and some cute Scorbus. 'I quit' starts as a Perciver centric fic about Percy quitting the Ministry, getting drunk off firewhiskey and getting together with Oliver. It then devolves into a more Dudley redemption fic with Dudley/Charlie but lots of Perciver still!!!! its really good!

For Oneshots and short stories I have LinkAo3(Five Times Percy Thought Oliver was Beautiful and One Time Oliver Did Something About It), LinkAo3(I dare you to dare me by SquaresAreNotCircles), LinkAo3(Forever by Glass Wolf (tlanon)) and LinkAo3(In Between Days by Perpetual Motion (perpetfic))
