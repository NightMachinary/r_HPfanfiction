I read this fic way back in the day when I was still high school. Flash foward to today and the author has deleted her fic. I was hoping to reread it to see if it was still good now that I am older. Thank you for any help.

  Here's the thing guys, I started writing An Alternate Adventure: Goblet of Fire when I was SIXTEEN-YEARS-OLD. One look at my old writing style, mistakes, and character/plot failures in AAA was enough to make me shake my head in utter disgust. Even I couldn't handle reading through the whole thing again. I actually agree with a lot of the criticisms I received regarding the story and personally, I cannot stomach the idea of going back to it and continuing it any further. The very thought alone makes me cringe and embarrasses me. It reminds me of how inexperienced I was with writing back then. Ehehehe. I'm so, so SO SORRY for those who wanted me to finish it. I really can't, even if I wanted to.

I really doubt you're going to find it dude, sorry. Since it was originally posted on ffnet and the author removed it, it may be permanently gone from the internet, barring a wayback archive of some kind.

*** Aw, that's a shame. I remember reading AAA: PS and AAA:COS back when I was sixteen. They were kinda terrible, but no less enjoyable for that, and far less terrible than smothers I can think of. (not OP)

*** fanfiction.net requests to not be archived, what is honoured by wayback archive and similar sites.
