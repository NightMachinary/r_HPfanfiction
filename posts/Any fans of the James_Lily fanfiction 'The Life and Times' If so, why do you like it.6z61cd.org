** 1. James Potter isn't a complete and utter shitstain of a human being.

2. Remus Lupin is the self-loathing werewolf who feels blessed in having actual friends.

3. Sirius Black has a lightness to him, and a dark, dark edge worthy of his family name.

4. Peter Pettigrew isn't a friend in name only that the others only barely tolerate.

5. Lily Evans isn't a saint.

6. Petunia Dursely nee Evans (Forgive me Oh Lord for I have sinned by writing it that way) is still a bitch, just a slightly lesser one.

7. If printed, it would be of the proper size to be used as a tool to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9buo9Mtos&feature=youtu.be&t=17s][crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women]].

8. Snape is the creepy, greasy little fucker he should be.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** It's just too good man. The characters are really how you would imagine them being, it's not like this sappy weird james following Lilly around and then just falling in love and being perfect. And the OCs are actually really fantastic. And the weight of the first wizarding war is really there. And it has the aspect of like teen drama that we didn't get from the original books which is awesome and hilarious at times and low key heart breaking

** Well, while it is overall a good read, I think it takes way too much time describing the lifes of people that are purely OC. I mean, I wouldn't mind it if it were just the Marauders or Snape, but for example, the life of Donna Shacklebot is something I don't give a crap about.

Apart from that, and here it comes a SPOILER, the arc of James and Sirius being mad at each other for the incident between Reums/Snape is really, and I mean, really long. And plain stupid. He/She kept it innecessarily to the point of being absurd. Also, the whole Shelley vs Carlota is unbelievable, that was Hogwarts, not a sappy prom from a teenager american movie.

Despite all that, I enjoyed it and wanted to see how he/she portraiyed the beginnings of James and Lily relationship, but almost 5 years later, that is probably not gonna happen
