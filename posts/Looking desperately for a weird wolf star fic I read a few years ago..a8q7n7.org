I don't remember where I read it but i don't think it was ao3, but I can't be sure. It was a multi-chapter piece, and it was a completed work. I remember Sirius being a bit crazy, and buying Remus from some kind of underground thing, auction maybe? I remember Remus being a not very well-adjusted human, like he didn't speak or have a great understanding of things.

Sirius buys him and keeps him at his house and like I said he's a bit crazy. There is some weird smut to it, definitely nsfw, blood as well. I don't want to spoil it or anything, but the ending isn't a happy one, from what I remember.

I went through a period of several weeks where I read a lot of wolfstar so a lot of these fics just blend together in my memory, so this bit might be another fic entirely, but I think James and his family might have been there, with baby Harry. Sirius might have taken Remus to visit or something? And James was uncomfortable with a werewolf by the baby? It was definitely not in any kind of hogwarts setting.

I know this isn't much to go off of, but it's all I got. I don't remember an author or title, but I feel like as soon as I see the title I'll know it's the right one. I've been searching hard on fanfic.net and ao3 but I can't find it. It's becoming an obsession lol. If no one can help, that's okay, I just figured I'd try this one last search before I give up on it. I'm almost willing to put up a bounty for this haha.

Thanks fellas!


** I've read this as well, but it was awhile ago. I know it was definitely rated M, cause there was some smut. For some reason, I'm thinking it might have been on live journal or fiction hunt? If you find it, let me know, now I want to read it again, too!
