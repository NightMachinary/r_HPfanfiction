looking for slytherin harry stories where he goes dark, prefer them to be completed,


** slash or no slash?

There's obviously Mira Mirth's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][*On the Way to Greatness*]] It's not yet completed but the story is in year 6 and about 230 000 words long. Harry uses dark magic. The first few years are pretty much a canon rehash only with Slytherin Harry instead of Gryffindor. From year 5 onwards the story is great. No slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][*Welcome to Hogwarts 1949*]] Harry accidentally travels to Tom Riddle's time. He thinks that non of it is real and that he is only caught in a memory of the past. Because he thinks that his actions won't change anything anyway, he does some morally questionable things / goes dark. He's also resorted to Slytherin. 129 000 words, hasn't been updated in a while but the author told me recently they'll update again. no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][*Just Another Orphan*]] It says dark!Harry in the tags and he's in Slytherin. Uses dark magic and might be siding with Voldemort, to soon to say. Starts at the end of Harry's 4th year. 48 000 words and updating regularly. Neville is the BWL. No slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9735652/1/Salvation-in-Shadow][*Salvation in Shadow*]] Harry has been missing and joins Hogwarts in 5th year. He's sorted into Slytherin and seems dark. Well written and lots of mystery. 77 000 words, nearly finished but hasn't been updated in a while. no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][*Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise*]] Dark Slytherin Harry. Starts pre-Hogwarts, covered all seven years and is currently dealing with the war/the end of the war. Soon to be finished. The first few chapters aren't great but the writing gets better. Neville is the BWL. no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][*Enveloped in the Darkness*]] starts first year. Dumbledore wants a saviour and gets a Death Eater. Harry is definitely dark and a Slytherin. finished, has a sequel that still updates. I think no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356546/1/Their-Verdict-of-Vagaries][*Their Verdict of Vagaries*]] Final Battle: Harry dies, meets Dumbledore and decided not to go back to the battle but back to the past. He meets Tom Riddle, they fall in love. Harry tries not to change the future and accompanies Tom on his travels. Shows Voldemort's rise to power. Can get a bit longwinded (I skimmed at times) and I don't really like the way the author characterizes Harry, he's a bit too meek for me. But it is: COMPLETED. slash: HP/TMR

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8808516/1/In-a-World-Gone-Astray][*In a World Gone Astray*]] Voldemort won, Harry is raised by Bellatrix, is a Slyhterin and dark. He's a Death Eater but plots against Voldemort and wants to avenge his parents. 68 000 words, updates sporadically. slash: HP/LV somewhere in the future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8746563/1/With-a-Forked-Tongue-I-Lie-in-Wait-Taming-Snakes][*With a Forked Tongue I Lie in Wait*]] To soon to say if Harry will be dark, but he's in Slytherin, was raised by criminals and is more manipulative and ruthless than canon!Harry. There are a few ridiculous/tedious parts but overall enjoyable. Hints at manipulative Dumbledore, sadly. 141 000 words and the story is still updating. slash: don't think so, but Harry is only in first year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][*The Rise of a Dark Lord*]] The writing is okay and everything but personally I'm not a big fan of this story. Harry is a Slytherin and dark (even a Dark Lord) but I think he is too dark too soon. In year 5 (I think) and 226 000 words. Still updating. slash: HP/LV

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675879/1/The-Art-of-Hidden-Personas][*The Art of Hidden Personas*]] Harry has a mysterious background and gets entangled with Voldemort and his ilk. Not completed and hasn't updated in a while but according to the author not abandoned and already 196 000 words long. non-BWL Harry. slash: HP/LV

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8205366/1/In-Noctem][*In Noctem*]] Vampire Harry with a dark background. Harry isn't really Harry Potter anymore. Different parents and goes to school with Tom Riddle, but well written and interesting. Probably abandoned, but 133 000 words so far. slash: HP/TMR

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][*Again and Again*]] Do-over fic by Athey. Harry is reborn again and again and tries a different path every time. This time he goes the Slytherin, join the Dark Lord route. 226 000 words, probably abandoned. Author also wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] Canon up until year 4 (so Harry is a Gryffindor) but goes through a major change and could as well be a Slytherin in the end. completed with sequel (abandoned). slash: HP/LV

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][*Past's Player*]] Harry accidentally goes back in time and is sorted into Slytherin. Uses Dark Magic and befriends Tom Riddle. In the summary it says hiatus/abandoned but it has been updated a few days ago nevertheless. so far 76 000 words and there is a finished sequel (prequel?) where Tom Riddle follows Harry to the present when Harry returns to his time. Harry uses dark magic but it's a stretch to call him dark. no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671073/1/Paradise-Lost][*Paradise Lost*]] Harry is a Slytherin and dark. Befriends Malfoy and has a weird connection to Voldemort. 96 000 words, not sure if abandoned or on hiatus. slash: HP/LV

*Hope there's something in there for you. Do you have any recommendations?*
