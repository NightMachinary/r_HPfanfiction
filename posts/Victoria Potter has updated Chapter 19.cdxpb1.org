It continues to be a fantastically written Girl-Who-Lived story set in an expanded, but canon-compliant, world.


** I love the in depth descriptions of mechanics of magic. They're comprehensive without becoming dry or rote, without losing that important spark that sets Harry Potter magic apart from something less whimsical. The Draught of Sparta plotline and ingredient is very interesting, and I like how the classroom instruction really does make Hogwarts seem like the premier learning institution that it is purported to be in canon, without lessening the danger that lurks around for Victoria.

​

The historical background ties together canon ideas of blood purity very well without descending into the idea of aristocratic wizarding titles that don't have any basis in canon and makes a beautiful sort of sense. It also has a side perk of explaining why Draco would marry Astoria over Pansy in canon, although that's not very important, just a thought I had when they were discussing blood purity.

​

In short, if you aren't reading this yet, you're really missing out. A dramatic improvement over [[/u/taure][u/taure]]'s first draft, and you can see the seeds of the coming darkness while still retaining the joy and whimsy of childhood. While I don't know specifically what will happen, especially in the (implied) second story that covers later years, we can see what Victoria will do for power, and her yearning for adulthood and what comes next, which foreshadows the tragedy that always seems to find those who reach too far, too fast.

*** Well said!

I love the magic depiction in Victoria Potter. The way it mixes the superficial Harry Potter magic with more traditional folk/pagan magic just fits perfectly.

*** Rakeesh's long journey home is very good. It's a MoD fem!harry set post "canon" where she is sent back in time to ancient egypt and her life there, and through the ages. Fantastic story of an immortal's life.

Too bad the fic wasn't immortal too.

*** There have been three chapters so far since i followed it. I don't know how regular they were before then.

1st of May, 13th of June and then this 15 Juli. So they seem to be monthly. I've no idea how long it had been since the last update before then.

So monthy or so. But not really enough updates to say. Try asking on the discord. Or i guess ask taure here on reddit.
