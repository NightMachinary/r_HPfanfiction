Pretty self-explanatory, a HP that crafts wands. I'd prefer it if it was finished and long. Thx


** Linkffn(The Firebird's Son)

This one's a completed trilogy. The wandcrafting comes much later in the story but it becomes essential to the plot. If you don't know anything about it, it takes place in a very different wizarding universe that is matriarchal. Some plot points remain from canon but play out very differently. Be forewarned, I found it to be a bit of a slow start but it's a good read overall.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.

** Is an unfinished story with wand making Hermione ok? If so [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/1/][Harry and Hermione Starring in: The Digital Revolution]] would be my choice. Unfinished but incredible, one of my faves.

  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?

** There's a Star Wars crossover fic that mentions in passing that he makes wands. I'm maybe 95% certain that the title is “I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For”. It's pretty good and I highly recommend it.

** I am afraid I don't know any that are complete, but I do know a longish incomplete one.

linkffn(Griffon Reborn by Yrtria) is one of my favorites, despite its incomplete state. I go back and read through it every so often, and it always holds up quite well.
