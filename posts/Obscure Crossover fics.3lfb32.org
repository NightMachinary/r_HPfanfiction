I'm looking for more obscure crossover fics. What I mean by obscure is crossovers with universes you don't normally see. The one's I see constantly posted when crossovers come up are Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and the Dresden Files (I never watched the show but I've seen the one fic posted a dozen times). So I'd like to see crossovers from other universes.

If possible I like seeing canon pairings just dealing with the new universe they meet and I am a Harry/Ginny fan so bonus for that. The only thing I don't really read is slash and I avoid Harry/Hermione whenever possible.

I'll probably check out any crossover but if someone knows a good one with Warcraft, Doctor Who, Mass Effect, Buffy, or other nerdy universes I'd be more inclined towards those.


** Nothing will ever beat this one in obscurity:

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

** *Damned Demented Demons* by hells_half_acre. linkao3(401208) HP/Supernatural. It's the first in a lengthy, ongoing series. You probably need to have seen at least some SPN for it to really make sense.

*End of the Line* byshewhoguards. linkffn(3673824) HP/Discworld. Can probably manage without prior knowledge of the Discworld series.

*The Lamentable Comedy of Severus, Half-Blood Prince of Denmark* by a_t_rain. linkao3(2725514) HP/Shakespeare's Plays. Begins with /Hamlet/, and the two sequels cover /All's Well That Ends Well/ and /Romeo and Juliet/. You needn't be familiar with any of those works for it to make sense.

  A teenaged Severus Snape drinks a Plothole-Plugging Potion and lands in sixteenth-century Elsinore. Who knew fixing Shakespearean tragedies was his real mission in life?

  #+begin_example
      I had a dream once in which I found the original manuscripts of several of Shakespeare's plays, only to discover that Severus Snape was a character in all of them\.  He had to be edited out of the final version because he kept brewing antidotes to poisons and giving the characters snarky\-but\-essentially\-accurate advice, ensuring that the tragedies were no longer tragedies\.  I imagine it would have gone something like this\.

** How about...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10568823/1/Average][Average]] a Harry Potter/NCIS crossover with very little magic. Harry's pretty bad-ass though, so I give it a pass.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] a Harry Potter/Mass Effect crossover that is very good until the last chapter. Dat last chapter, mang.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552630/1/Harry-s-Trek][Harry's Trek]] a Harry Potter/Star Trek crossover. Nice size for reading in a single sitting too. I like this one.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] another Harry Potter NCIS story. Actually, I might be confusing this with the other one... very similar. Still a fun read.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10054816/1/Sorcery][Sorcery]] a Harry Potter/Frozen crossover. A bit weird and wacky. But still a pleasant enough time-waster. I wish the author would try to do more with it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5364469/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Next-Great-Adventure][Harry Potter and the Next Great Adventure]] a Harry Potter/Stargate crossover. Uh. Memory fails me. It's a thing and stuff happens that's star-gatey. Bonus points for not having Harry turn into a harem-wielding space-god.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4990751/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slayer-Dimension][Harry Potter and the Slayer Dimension]] a Harry Potter/Buffy crossover. Cool beans.

And, I have a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10659456/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Queen][Harry Potter/Tomb Raider]] story as well as a short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11038472/1/Harry-Potter-Goes-On-Holiday][Harry Potter/Pacific Rim]] oneshot.

#+end_quote

It's nice when other people's tastes match your own. I can think of a few, but there aren't many Harry/Ginny crossover fics as far as I know.

linkffn(That Which Holds the Image) and linkffn(The Angel's War) are excellent HP/Doctor Who crossovers. The latter has Harry/Ginny elements.

linkffn(Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex) is a very good HP/Sherlock crossover fic.

Muffliato has a Harry/Ginny HP/Sherlock/Doctor Who crossover. Never read this particular fic (the author is working on revamping it), but the author's other stories are decent.

linkffn(A Scandal in Baker Street)

linkffn(Harry potter: The last Avatar) is well known. Harry's a little shit I want to strangle, but the merging of HP and Avatar universes is seamless.

linkffn(Drink Up, Me Hearties) and linkffn(The Wizard from Earth) are crossovers with Pirates of the Caribbean and Man from Earth. If you liked A Long Journey Home, you'll probably like the latter as well.

linkffn(Failsafe by Hannanora-Potter) is HP/LotR and Harry/Ginny. Decent fic with regular updates.

You might like linkffn(Harry Mewter), which is a HP/Pokemon cross. Harry's animagus form is Mew. I found it rather dull, but a few people like it.

You can really interpret much of the Avatar world. There really is little to no actual facts.

But the Avatar circle is written in stone. The Avatar after Korra is an Earthbender. Period.

Thats also why I was never sure if Harry is just a disgustingly powerful Firebender with weird dreams, or truly the Avatar.

******** A) I don't recall exactly, but there might well be a Avatar in between the two. (Or, theoretically, one that died shortly after birth. I haven't watched Korra, so there's probably some details invalidating that.)

B) I get that sometimes specific details can make or break a fic for someone. Heck, I'm guilty of it too in some areas. But, narratively speaking, Harry has to be the Avatar (chosen one fusion), has to be born shortly after Korra (Dumbledore connection, modernization of universe timeline, backlash against chi-users, concentration of power in Republic City, the Tournament, extinction of dragons, and so on), and has to be a fire-bender (Gryffindor).

All of these things are essential for the story that The Sorting Cat wants to tell. So for the story to work, the Avatar cycle must be ignored (or A applies, of course). And yes, that is unfortunate and I can understand why it could be a deal-breaker for someone.

But for me, it's something I'm prepared to set aside for the sake of enjoying a good story. Again, to each their own.

** [[http://rosa-acicularis.livejournal.com/30916.html][/The Anatomist/]] by rosa acicularis is a Sherlock Holmes fic based on the first season of the BBC show.

Premise is (to quote Newcomb): /"What if Molly (that medical examiner you'll remember as being daffy and kind of crushing on Sherlock on the show) was Moriarty's twin sister, and every bit as screwed up as he was, but in a slightly different way?"/

~30k words, so a quick read, and one that moves at a very brisk pace. The best Sherlock fic I've ever seen, and a really high-quality read in all.

** The writing could use some work, and the second in the series (Third is currently being worked on) starts some links to other series that bug the hell out of me. Besides that I find this story to be a guilty pleasure of mine.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

**** It's pretty neat. It portrays itself as being canonical, as if this was just an experience early in McGonagall's life. It is a neat story, but it does make lots of references to other fandoms in a /wink, wink/ sort of way, which I can find annoying.

 

On a side note, there are a couple other McGonagall fics out there that are fun to read. Oneshot where she and Snape end up de-aging themselves, somewhat accidentally and they get a fresh start on life. Another oneshot about one crazy Tuesday in the life of McGonagall. There is a multi-chapter fic where she again, de-ages herself at Dumbledore's behest in order to spy on/support Harry. The process messes with her mind and hormones and she has a brief fling with Harry (no lemons, just confused teenage flirting) before returning to adulthood. I could find them for you if you'd like.

***** I might look into them later but I was actually thinking more about looking for fics about her as a young woman. I always thought the elderly single lady devoted to teaching and her students was a little boring so seeing her just starting as a teacher or graduating Hogwarts might be interesting.
