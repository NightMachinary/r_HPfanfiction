I'm a die hard H/G shipper, but I've always had trouble finding long completed fics for them that are well written, and give Ginny more personality than a cardboard dickhole. This subreddit always has good recs, but I don't usually see any H/G ones. Polyamory is welcome, as long as it doesn't devolve into a massive harem, and Ginny still has a prominent role. Thanks!


** Note that I am not a Harry/Ginny shipper - almost at all. I tend to avoid most of those fics because I'm just not a fan of the standard Ginny tropes. Having said that, I greatly enjoyed these stories and I believe you would as well. They run the gamut of a few different genres.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][*Abraxas*]] linkffn(11580650) was probably the first H/G fic I read since before Order of the Phoenix came out from an author I didn't know and actually enjoyed. It's corny, has a very common plot, a mildly interesting plot device, pretty decent writing mechanics...and is just a fun read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*]] linkffn(6331126) is...different from most stories on this list. It takes place post-Hogwarts and is probably one of the single greatest "what happened /after/" stories I've read in this universe. Give it a try, even if it takes a minute.

Then we have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7404056/1/Mutant-Storm][*Mutant Storm*]] linkffn(7404056), a crossover with the X-Men. I have my issues with this one. It's not perfect, it has some glaring holes in it. It's a bit ham fisted at times in trying to make the crossover work. But. It's. /Fun./
