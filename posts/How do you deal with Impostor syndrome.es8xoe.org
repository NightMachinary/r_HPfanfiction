Like, I started a fic without much writing experience without seriously expecting many people to like it, and now it's at more followers and favs than multiple of my favorite stories I follow (ironically including The Impostor Complex) and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and I have a huge responsibility because hundreds of people expect me to write more good chapters and a I feel like there's no way for me to meet those expectations (even though the same people liked my previous chapters just fine) and ever since I started to feel this way I went from weekly updates to rewriting the same chapter over and over again for a month to get it perfect but I feel like it gets worse every time, and it completely takes the fun out of writing.


** Take a deep breath, and remind yourself it's only a bloody hobby. That's step one.

Step two is remembering that people - including me, as it happens, I would cheerfully buy you a pint for the magical rickrolling /alone/ - liked your story /before/ you had any thought beyond your own fun in writing it: that sense of fun /absolutely/ comes through in the reading experience. Find your first draft of that chapter, the one you /enjoyed/ writing. Get the spelling, punctuation and grammar straight, and publish it.

While a certain amount of craftsmanship is right and necessary, there's also a lot to be said for starting each new chapter with a rousing cry of "NO SECOND DRAFTS! WE DIE LIKE *MEN!*"

Originally I wanted to just do a short writeup how I'd defeat Voldemort. Now I got plot for years and multiple enemies beyond Voldemort for the dimensional traveler main character planned out. But when it comes to writing it I'm still stuck on Christmas of year 1. No idea how to write Nicholas Flamel's character.

I found looking in to the historical record of the Flamels - Perenelle absolutely /should/ be included, she's the reason for all of the Paris landmarks named after her and her husband, she was an indefatigable philanthropist - helped enormously.

** Tfw I started writing a fic called the Imposter Complex and started getting Imposter Syndrome about the positive feedback from it. Especially when some of that praise came from some of my favourite fanfic authors.

The important thing to remember is that almost everyone in a creative field (and many people in other fields) have experienced Imposter Syndrome to some degree or another. The only ones that don't still get that tingle aren't the kind of artist you want to be anyway, they're smarmy dicks.

The best way to get past it in my experience is to try and avoid seeing your work as something you're doing to impress other people. You're just writing what /you/ enjoy writing, and any praise that you get for it is just icing on top.

Edit: Just realised you mentioned my story in the OP, dunno how tf I managed to miss that.

** So, first of all, with all the follows and favs your fic has racked up /despite/ it being an unabashed SI, you're pretty darned impressive.

But, it sounds like you've grown the scope of the fic beyond Voldemort and don't have the confidence to write in this bigger universe.

I am not going to tell you to relax and that it's just a hobby, because you already know these things.

So, my only suggestion for you is to find a beta reader or an editor^{1} if you don't already have one. You are your own harshest critic, but a trusted adviser will be able to give you a reader's perspective and tell you where you are overthinking things, as well as giving you some peace of mind, because the odds that both of you miss some glaring problem are much smaller than odds of you missing it on your own. (For the record, I am not prepared to volunteer for the job at this time.)

‚Äã

^{1} --- An "editor" is distinguished from a "beta reader" in that an editor doesn't just get to read your drafts shortly before you post them but is also privy to the "big picture" and your long-term plans.

*** Confidence about writing in a bigger universe isn't the problem. I got a lot of worldbuilding planned out. Once I write the post Voldemort plot it'll be a bigger universe than 99.9% of most other fics. But right now I'm just stuck on how to write the Flamels.

** Well, I start getting nervous about 10 favs in so I can't really give any advice. I get really worried that people are seeing plot hooks or cleverness where I didn't put too much thought into it. Even though I have a rough idea of what I want, I feel like people expect me to have planned everything out from the hints they have received.

I can't really say anything about imposter syndrome because I don't have any obvious evidence of my competence. I will say though that if it really is just a mental syndrome acting up then it is unlikely that you can just work it out yourself within your own mind. Either have someone to constantly talk to and interact with that you recognise as having a different mind than yours or better yet maybe confront it, accept it and move on. Feeling illogical things isn't all that bad. As long as you know what's happening, it can't really hurt you in any way.

Don't they say it helps to give others advice, looking at something from separate viewpoint? Maybe you can think what advice you would give me.

**** Sorry, was sleeping. I am a notorious (if I had any notoriety, that is) fic abandoner so most of them are deleted.

Linkffn(Ars Notoria) is the latest one I started.

Back to the point, I felt like I have hyped myself and will only disappoint anyone who reads the fic. Can't stop myself from feeling that way but if you know what's going on then you can work with it.

  Estranged from Harry after his name came out of the goblet, Ron isn't sure what he was supposed to do. Whatever that was though, it probably wasn't joining a strange Ravenclaw in her hunt for the fabled book Ars Notoria.

** The people who love and follow your story love the thoughts you had and the characters and storyline that you planned out.

Not the story that you think they'll like.

Those are two different things. They love your writing for what you put into it, not what you think they want you to put into it.

Some food for thought: who's the true impostor here?

The person who put their heart and soul, pieces of themselves into a story they lovingly crafted?

Or the person who keeps second guessing themselves and re-writing their thoughts as they try to live up to someone elses' expectations? A person who... for all intents and purposes... isn't themself?

If you want to do justice to your readers... BE YOURSELF. :)

Happy writing!

** That's part of the reason I don't publish anything besides my ficlets that are responses to prompts. If I have a story I really want to tell I finish it first before publishing it. Learned that the hard way on RoyalRoad years ago. Got so burnt out that I stopped writing for years. It was one of your prompts that inspired me to start writing again.

Now I have three stories I am writing at the moment all past the 35k word mark. When I get fed up with one I switch to another. When I'm fed up with them all I just take a break and read instead.

It's part of why my responses to prompts are always so rough. They are written right then and there with no real editing. It is freeing to just put it out there and not worry about grammar.

Maybe take a break, tell your readers you're new to writing and need to refocus yourself to get that spark back.

I find doing other hobbies helps me as well. Perhaps a walk in the park, people watching at the mall, just cleaning the house listening to music. Something that takes your mind off it and lets it wander.

Either way best of luck in finding your spark again!

P.S. love your prompts by the way, they are awesome!

** I know how you feel. After swearing off posting WIP fics for a decade, I recently went for posting a WIP and it has exploded in ways I never expected.

I've had to learn how to take compliments all over again, and I also keep reminding myself that I'm writing the fic for ME. I was the first person who wanted to see the story and I'm the first fan of it, haha.

Basically, it's YOUR fic, not theirs. Other readers just happen to be entertained by it and that's a bonus.

That said, doing extra revision of your writing isn't a bad thing. I've been doing the same and I think I've learned some things along the way. I do recommend stepping away from a chapter for a day or two if you feel you're over-editing or over-analyzing it; coming back to it with fresh eyes really helps you realize how it sounds. :)
