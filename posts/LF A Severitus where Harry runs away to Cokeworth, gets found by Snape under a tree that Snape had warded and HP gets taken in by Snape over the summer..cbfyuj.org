Pretty sure this tree was important to Snape because he met Lily under it or something like that, and had warded it to be told when people trespassed there. From what I can remember, Harry ran away from his family to find where his mother came from, found the tree and maybe got drunk under it to come to terms with his grief? I'm unsure when exactly it was set but perhaps in the summer of third or fourth year, I can vaguely remember Snape offering to tutor or train Harry but I really can't remember whether it was in this fic or another because I probably read it 4/5 years ago.

Many thanks!
