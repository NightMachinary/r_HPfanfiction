What are the biggest remaining questions in the Harry Potter universe?

Some ideas to start us off:

- What are the other exceptions to Gamp's law?

- How many wizards are there?

- How big are the populations of other species like goblins, compared to wizards?

- What happens to wizarding nations when Muggle political geography changes?


** - Why did James Potter, in hiding with his family, lend his Invisibility Cloak to Dumbledore?

- How did Bill Weasley and Barty Jr. score 12 OWLs? According to JKR, Hermione was the only student to be given a Time Turner.

- Did post-resurrection Voldemort have a dick? Does he have 2 dicks, like a snake? I assumed was asexual reading the book, but then apparently he had a baby with Bellatrix so I have no idea.

- Did Rodolphus Lestrange care about being cucked by Voldemort? Presumably he's into the whole pureblood supremacy thing because he wants to ensure a future for strong, pureblooded children, but how the hell does that work when he and his pureblood wife aren't making these babbies?

*** For the bill, percy and and barty crouch scoring 12 owls, I recently developed a headcannon that there used to be more teachers or TAs. I'm pretty sure Mcgonagall joined Hogwarts while dumbledore was still teaching transfiguration, it's possible that she helped teach classes as a TA of some sort. And therefore it's possible there was more a completely different schedule and TAs would handle say the lower year classes like at a university. And so in Harry's first year there aren't an TAs so schedules were changed around such that in hermiones 3rd year she needed a time turn.

Or they all could have just done independent studies and sat the owl exam without having taken the actual class.

#+begin_quote
  Early next morning, Minerva slipped from her parents' house and went to tell Dougal that she had changed her mind, and could not marry him. Mindful of the fact that if she broke the International Statute of Secrecy she would lose the job at the Ministry for which she was giving him up, she could give him no good reason for her change of heart. She left him devastated, and set out for London three days later.

She didn't get married until sometime after 1981 (from the same article).

#+begin_quote
  Through all her early years at Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall remained on terms of friendship with her old boss at the Ministry, Elphinstone Urquart. He came to visit her while on holiday to Scotland, and to her great surprise and embarrassment, proposed marriage in Madam Puddifoot's teashop. Still in love with Dougal McGregor, Minerva turned him down.

  ......

  Shortly after Voldemort's first defeat, Elphinstone, now white-haired, proposed again during a summertime stroll around the lake in the Hogwarts grounds. This time Minerva accepted.

--------------

Delphini's character in general is pretty /My Immortal/-tier.

- She hangs out with the canon characters, and Albus crushes on her because she's so dang cool.

- She is related to other major canon characters, Voldemort and Bellatrix, and is adopted as the niece of Amos Diggory.

- She gets special magical abilities, like flying. She's also extremely talented...

- ...She duels Harry, an Auror with 20 years of experience over her, and wins.

  Why is that even a question? Why wouldn't he have a penis? Why would he have two penises? I have no idea how or why you came to that conclusion.
#+end_quote

During Voldemort's resurrection, he came out snake-looking (no hair, no nose, slitted pupils) due to being fed Nagini's venom and various dark magics he used over his lifetime. Other snake features [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis][include internalized sex organs, with unusual shapes like multiple spikes and two lobes]] which is where the "snakes have two penises" concept comes from. If he had some snake features, it's not unreasonable to assume he has other ones.

.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was a man, a human. He changed his appearance a bit because it served him a purpose: his rule and power was based on fear, make himself look more terrifying.
#+end_quote

Voldemort never saw himself as a man. He believed himself to be above all other people, to have transcended humanity, and the weaknesses of men, such as human mortality, or the desire for love and friendship.

#+begin_quote
  "Is that right?" said Frank roughly. "Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, my Lord. Turn round and face me like a man, why don't you?"

  "But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. "I am much, much more than a man."
#+end_quote

It's ambiguous whether or not Voldemort as Tom Riddle used sex, sexual appeal, or physical favors and attraction to manipulate other people, but I strongly believe that Voldemort never desired sex for its own sake, for his own desires, and once he'd ascended to power, he had no need of anything but magical might to control other people. He looks down on other people who have weaknesses he despises, including feelings, emotions, and desire.

#+begin_quote
  ...He was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions... not anger... that was for weaker souls than he...
#+end_quote

I can't see Voldemort lowering himself to indulge other people's disgusting human weaknesses, not at the height of his power. The point of being the most powerful wizard in Britain, now that Dumbledore was dead, was that he could do anything he wanted, with no limits, masquerades, or pretenses like he had back in when he was working in Borgin's. This is why I interpreted him to be asexual by the time of Deathly Hallows, and idea of sex with other people, let alone for the purposes of creating an heir, to be profoundly OOC.

****** Minor correction: Voldemort's snakey, inhuman appearance is implied to be a side effect of creating so many Horcruxes, not something he actively chose to look like, even if he might have appreciated the terror aspect on his followers, and how it distanced himself from his "filthy muggle father".

#+begin_quote
  "He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort had seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call usual evil..."
#+end_quote

Tom Riddle asked Slughorn about Horcruxes because he himself didn't know all the details about making them, or making multiples. I doubt he predicted beforehand that he would lose his human features, or had a hand in purposefully picking what inhuman features he would develop over time, whether it's the noselessness or the possible double snake dick.

******* Yeah, I thought this was pretty clear that it was a side effect from the horcruxes. When they go into the pensieve and see him at various times (asking Dumbledore for a job, Gaunt shack, visit to Hepzibah's, etc.) They note how different he looks and when he took a turn for looking snakelike. I think it's supposed to be symbolism (and bread crumbs for us to pick up) for the number of horcruxes he'd made so far.

Thats pretty much the opposite of what they said. You may or may not have read a "not" that was not part of their comment.

And that is still miles from "he came out looking exactly like he did before his 'death'"

Considering how..platonic magical concepts seem to be at times, it seems somewhat consistent and reasonable that Voldemort obsession with Slytherin and his intake of venom made an impression on his new body.

Also, if you're basing off the movie, the size of both armies are much much smaller than DHP2. It was a very intimate fight.

Plus with Harry's sacrificial protection I'm like 99% sure no one on the good side died during the second half.

** Has there been a magical expedition into outer space? If so, what did they do there?

What is the geo-political situation on the magical side as of 1994? What about in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019? That's the biggest blank of the whole Potter-verse; what the rest of the world is getting up to when a bunch of random students manage to get into life or death situations every six to nine months on average.

Come to think of it, what was everyone not within the trio's orbit up to? Because I bet that there was serious stuff going down elsewhere that none of the Trio was made aware of.

What were the events and consequences of Voldemort's first rise? How did they impact Wizarding Britain as a whole?

Wizarding Britain seems to operate on the principle of minimal infrastructure, where they seem to either straight up not have it (like, say, a telephone system, though the floo provides it as a kind of secondary service) or rely on the muggle world to provide the bulk of it (Roads for the Night Bus, the one train in the series departing from King's Cross, that kind of thing). What about magical societies that went in the other direction and went for full infrastructure suites instead? Do they even exist? What would they look like?

How in the world does the Wizarding Economy actually work? Does it routinely collapse, but no-one notices because magic? Because I get that impression sometimes.

The magical flora & fauna are plentiful indeed, not to mention deadly as all get-out. How did the muggle world cope with it before the Statute of Secrecy? How bad was the environmental collapse following the segregation of said flora & fauna after the SoS was adopted?

What were the Goblin Rebellions like? Full-on wars or more like high-intensity police actions?

Actually, what would a magical war even look like, what with the non-human combatants, charmed statues and stuff filling support roles and the highly non-linear nature of combat between wizards?

In fact, are there any magical wars happening as the main plot unfolds? Because ignoring the takeover of the Ministry of Magic by a Dark Lord implies something worse is currently keeping everyone focused elsewhere.

Did Arthur Weasley ever try enchanting something bigger? Like, say, a Tank?

#+end_quote

Other than dementors, they are ridiculously easy to deal with since they cannot cast magic and resort to physical attacks (even the House Elves do so for some reason). And repelling that is something even Muggles could deal with without breaking a sweat, nevermind someone who can use both weapons and magic.

Giants would be shredded with Anti-Tank Weapons and are large enough that even novices could hit them. Giant spiders, werewolves, centaurs and so on with machine guns. Magical Warfare only is an issue if the other side can actually cast spells. And only wizards/witches can do that. Nundu's could cause quite a lot of trouble, but NBC gear takes care of that and allows you easy hunting, especially if you charm it.

Dragon's would be very dangerous if they unexpectedly attack a city (such as London), but they are giant targets (probably quite easy to track with a radar as well) and repelling them would take significantly less anti-aircraft weapons as were placed around cities during WWII or the Cold War, nevermind planes or SPAAGs joining in.

And if they are no real issue for Muggles, I don't see these creatures being a significant threat if you actually use the existing capabilities of both worlds unless they have magical support (for logistics and secrecy) AND limit themselves to Guerilla tactics.

**** Well, that is a well-made point indeed, but I was thinking magical Army vs magical Army more than magical Army vs. modern tactics & weaponry.

See, the magical world is averse to using such, but the idea is probably more along the lines of 'we have spells that can do better' rather than 'ew, machinery that blows up on purpose' (though that could be a factor too. Trying to explain a modern car engine to a wizard would almost certainly be a study in expressions of abject shock & dismay once they learn about the basics of internal combustion).

For example, imagine if one side has a Nundu. That, right there, is every NBC specialists' nightmare-a cat the size of a truck with the properties of a Greater Daemon of Nurgle to boot.

And then you have Quintapeds, Graphorns etc, all of which are highly dangerous by themselves.

But yeah, how would an average campaign between two such forces actually play out? What would their objectives be, how do they structure themselves, how do you even start to define where the front lines are when every single wizard or witch on the field can use portkeys and apparition?

Those are the big questions I was aiming at. Sure, give a Wizard an MBT or an attack helicopter to enchant and play around with and the other side is going to have a really bad day, but in a straight up war between two armies' worth of magicals, what happens?

Except they don't, at least not against beasts. You can make an argument that a shield charm can stop a bullet while a killing curse goes through, therefore making the spell the deadlier weapon. But given that most creatures are magically resistant, the instant death spell is a lot less effective, therefore making a 30mm cannon which shoots 3-5k rounds a minute much more effective against dragons and the like. Obviously, the likes of Lucius Malfoy would disapprove of using Muggle Weapons, but that wouldn't stop Muggleborns. Also, Centaurs use bows (Muggle Weapon for millennia) and the House-elves used kitchen utensils, so that argument does not seem very convincing.

If it's the size of a truck, you can hit it easily. Worst case, build a massive ramming broom and kamikaze into it, driving a massive tungsten rod through its body while the rider is unharmed due to cushioning charms or similar methods.

Given that instant teleportation is a thing, probably fighting for strongholds. Supplies are not an issue for the most part (other than perhaps potion ingredients) and the magical World seems to lack any industry worth talking about. You would have a few skilled craftsmen, but from what we know, they don't have the same kind of massive, hard-to-relocate tools you'd find in steelworks or plane factories. You might make a case for sieges, but given that brooms are a thing and you want to dismiss guns, running blockades would not be difficult for a skilled flyer such as Harry. And since magical space expansion is a thing, you don't need to make such runs often to keep a stronghold supplied for years. Perhaps that's why Voldemort chose to assault Hogwarts even though he suffered close to 100% casualties and, had he survived, had thrown his forces away by doing so.

** -Who were the first Wizards? Were they even Homo Sapiens or were there Hominids aware of this power even prior? On a similar note, are Wizards even Homo Sapiens, an evolution from H.S, or an entirely distinct species?

-Why did Wizards never become the dominant species on Earth? They /should/ have been. And the excuse with the lack of numbers doesnt hold water.

-Are gods simply ancient witches and wizards?

-How did achieving immortality and post-scarcity change the psychology of the Flamels? I swear, those two could be some of the most interesting characters in whole of literature (yet FB 2 shows Nicolas as a wacky fossil smh).

-Why is there such a taboo regarding Lyanthropy? Even prior to Wolfsbane, its really not that big of a deal unless the person was a murderous asshole anyway. Just get locked up one night per month, whats the big idea? Compared to many real life diseases, this one is really not such a big deal.

-Are the limits of magic real or some Alex Jones type of conspiracy made up long ago and brainwashed into magical children? Because from what I recall from canon, there is no limitation, magical core or any mana pool that determines the strength of a wizard. I remember a comment from this subreddit I saw recently, similar to this. And the person that made it said something along the line that every time someone discovers just how powerful magic is, they tear up the world itself, or something along those lines.

Edit 1: I got a few more.

-How much of Dark Magic is objectively evil and how much is simply considered illegal because its more powerful and versatile and Magical governments simply dont want people running around with that kind of knowledge? Think something like a form of gun-control, but since they cant take away the guns, they control the type of ammo that is being used.

-Why did Salazar actually leave Hogwarts? I just cant believe that the other three would A) Befriend the 10th century Voldemort B) Sustain that friendship for years, probably even decades C) Build a school, of all places, together with him. And keep in mind, he was closest to Godric, so there must be more to him than the story says. I am really curious what the real reasons of his departure and conflict with the rest was. And regarding the Chamber, my favorite theory and headcanon is that he built it as a defense mechanism if Hogwarts ever gets besieged.

*** Part of the the reason the four founders created Hogwarts was to protect young witches and wizards from muggles. Muggles were a real threat back then because, to an extent, they knew that witches were real and they responded with witch hunts and burning people at the stake. Salazar didn't exactly hate muggles more than he feared them.

I think Pottermore mentioned that he was even worried muggleborn students were spying for their parents and they would reveal where the school was hidden. Hence why he didn't want muggleborn or half blood children entering the school.

So I think the founders were all on the same page at the beginning but then Salazar started to get too paranoid later on.

My health teacher once told my class that he had someone who was HIV+ come speak to thr class.

  I mean there's a clear difference between homosexuality and sometimes turning into a homicidal rage monster?
#+end_quote

Yes, but why are you arguing? It seems you and parent poster are in agreement.

Parent poster explained why people would have prejudices against werewolves. It's because people have prejudices even against stuff like homosexuality, which is pretty harmless in comparison to lycanthropy. So if people develop taboos against something as harmless as homosexuality, clearly it's very plausible that they'd develop a taboo against lycanthropy.

You said it yourself, homosexuality is harmless, turning into a werewolf - not so much. By saying someone would hate them for the same reason is being inherently unfair to the fictional characters who don't want to live near a werewolf.

One of these is blind prejudice, not wanting to live near werewolves is a lot more justified.

** Why is seeing your double while using a time turner such a bad thing? They tried to explain it by making Hermione ask Harry what he would think and he responded by saying he thought he'd be going mad or some such. But after the first day of learning about the time turner one should already know about having the time turner and it's possibilities. So that shouldn't be a problem. Plus once you're exposed to a metamorphmagus, glamours, or polyjuice you'd probably think to yourself, "Wtf?! Someone's impersonating me!" more than, "OMG I'm going crazy!" Plus I'm the one that used the damn time turner so I know that I spun the thing!

Where Hagrid planned to keep Norbert. :D (Release her into the Forbidden Forest once she got too big?)

I've seen the theories in many fan fictions, dunno if JK has ever answered it... Was the Weasley family on the muggle side of Platform 9 3/4 a plant? "Now what's the platform number?"

Speaking of muggles, given the muggle-hating nature of the Black family, wtf was up with Grimmauld Place being smack dab in muggle London? Couldn't they have bought up the surrounding properties and put up muggle repelling charms? Or made the block look dilapidated or something so that muggles wouldn't want it?

**** More likely, avoiding yourself helps to avoid paradox... causing a paradox probably results in both versions being removed from the timeline permanently.

However as we've seen... magic is very good about maintaining causality. It's a paradox that Harry was able to summon a Patronus, because he'd already seen himself do it... but apparently it is not actually the memory that is important, its the emotions...therefore ... paradox resolved.

I imagine only intentionally changing the timeline /could/ cause a paradox and cause people to disappear...

Even then... As demonstrated... time turners seem to INTENTIONALLY have causality failsafes built in to the magic they use. I'm guessing there were magical means of time travel discovered before time turners, which resulted in people exploding...and while time turners fixed the problem, the myth and legend becomes a cautionary tale about messing with time by seeing your self.

I have no clue why Voldemort was in Albania. He'd already secured the diadem that was hidden there and had placed it in Hogwarts. Quirrel, on the other hand, was the muggle studies professor and was researching Voldemort's whereabouts when he discovered Voldemort's hiding place. Quirrel wanted to show everyone that he was not someone to be laughed at and wouldn't it be great if /he/ found the great Dark Lord? Well, he found him alright.

Which makes me laugh because in GoF, all the Death Eaters were simpering, “Had we heard even whispers, my Lord,” Voldemort screams that there were more than whispers, and Quirrel dead butt is like, “yeah, I read about it in a /book./” Death Eaters are dumb and cowardice.

** What happens to wizarding nations when Muggle political geography changes?

Really good question. It seems as though wizarding geography changes alongside Muggle geography. For example, white European culture seems to dominate the US wizard world. While there are indigenous groups that influence the cultures of wizarding institutions like school, none of them seem to be sovereign states.

​

A more complicated example: the Irish have their own national team; however as a counterpoint the Irish also attend Hogwarts, which would not be their own school. Perhaps wizarding Ireland is a version of successful home rule?

As to the muggle side dictating the magical side, I think that the effect would be fairly delayed unless there's a major shift in demographics.

The Soviet Union coming to power and grabbing Eastern Europe, for example, would probably have had next to no impact on the magical side despite being a /huge/ deal in the muggle world.

The establishment of the EU, on the other hand, may have been the exact inverse; of little interest to the muggles that weren't involved at the start, but having a huge impact on the local magical communities that suddenly had citizens of other EU nations popping over to the magical side of another country for tea with little to no regard for customs or border inspections.

This may sound like next to nothing until you remember that a major war used to happen every 50 years on European soil and, while the muggles may have gone all peace, reconciliation and making money with each other, I doubt anyone took the time to tell the Wizarding World that.

It probably didn't help that this was happening during Voldemort's rise to power too. Suddenly having dozens of foreign wizards in your country without any of them bothering to register for a visa in either the muggle or magical world would probably have caused a lot of magical law enforcers extreme panic attacks.

Unless there's a formal mechanism set in place to resolve changes happening in the muggle world, though, it's almost guaranteed that a disruption on the muggle side will eventually cause a disruption on the magical one.

************* Well, it would be a bit difficult to do a really good one.

Remember that the muggle side has about 6000 years worth of recorded history to fall back on. To put this in perspective, out of the 130,000 years that we've possessed brains roughly equivalent to those of our current size, we only have 6000 of those years recorded.

In other words, we have a spotty record covering about 0.046% of our species' history. And boy, do we have a metric ton of records covering that 0.046%.

The reason for that is manifold; the recording tools used back then were crude, writing was still the very cutting edge of technology much like computing systems are today and, quite honestly, institutions capable or willing to invest the huge amount of time and training necessary to make sure that someone was writing down what was going on in their society were... limited, to say the least.

See, back before civilization, information was orally transmitted because a) people were waaaaaay more likely to understand the spoken word than they were likely to be able to read and b) people still lived in a highly fluid situation where their lives were more often than not regulated by the environmental conditions around them.

Places like the Nile, which allowed for predictable and sustained agricultural practices, were vanishingly rare and it would take millenia to discover how to transplant the practice into less obviously continuously fertile areas.

In other areas, you told others what worked for you and what didn't. When it stopped working because the situation had changed, you simply passed on what did work (or you were dead because you didn't find that new thing that worked in time).

There simply wasn't much call for a scribe per square mile for a very long time. I think we would have to wait for the Greeks and Egyptians to get to a point where people learned to value reading and writing as great vehicles for abstract or fundamental tenets of reality before the whole thing really starts to take off, though that's more of a guess than anything (Babylon had /contract lawyers/, for instance. We know this because they baked contracts into clay and where you find a contract, a lawyer's not exactly far behind).

Now yeah, the value of information in the muggle world took a while to get recognized, between 2 and 7 thousand years if you include the civilizations that existed prior to the Bronze Age Collapse.

And despite this, we have easily way more history than could be accurately mastered in any one lifetime, magically enhanced or otherwise.

Compare and contrast with Wizards and Witches, who mess with fucking magic.

To a Witch or Wizard, information is key to their continued survival and prosperity, especially in a time before they figure out relatively safe-ish ways of using magic to start with.

Spell research is one of those ridiculously dangerous fields that still kill Wizards and Witches at the time of HP canon after all, as Lovegood's mother can attest.

And since once you start gathering information it becomes really hard to stop, the likelihood is that there is a magical historical tradition going quite a bit farther back than 6000 years. Bear in mind that our historical record only really goes back 6000 years because we've got archaeological evidence for it. On the magical side, they potentially have written documents going back much, much farther since preservation charms are a thing.

Also, bear in mind that the Statute of Secrecy is a recent thing history-wise (17th century which, when you consider by just how much potential /history/ the magical world has, 400 years is practically nothing), so not only do you have a written record of magical happenings dating back 10-20,000 years, you potentially also have those same historical documents detailing the civilizations they are a part of, which is a /huge/ deal, because we have next to no information or archaeological findings whatsoever that could tell us what was where, when, why and how those civilizations existed-or if they even fit the classical definition of civilization.

Come to think of it, it's likely that early Wizards and Witches did fulfill the role of scribes, accountants, lawyers and such in those early civilizations, purely because nobody else would have really had the incentive (apart from a few priests and warehousing employees here and there) to record such things in a structured, formal manner. It would certainly explain why the muggles can't find anything beyond 4000 BCE if that was the point where muggle scribes first started appearing.

There's also the way magic would mess with our perceptions of history. For example, the Bronze Age Collapse may instead mark a golden age of magical-muggle cooperation, weaving communities together to the point where they became indistinct from each other and only diverging when Gilgamesh messed everything up. We would know it as a collapse because the relationship between the two was so intimate, the SoS enforcers felt they had no choice but to completely erase that period from the record.

Hell, thinking even more deeply, that whole thing could have come about with the discovery of the proto-wands and staves that would later come to dominate the magical side of Western Civilization-an industrial revolution on the magical side, happily supported by the muggles to the point where magical society could finally stabilize and start to turn into its own distinct entity.

One of the big discoveries of the period? Portkeys. One of the big research topics of the time? Portkey calibration, so that they stopped losing 'volunteers' by accidentally portkeying them into the stratosphere and the bedrock of mountains.

This would also mark the period where astronomy took a front seat in the research priorities of wizards and witches everywhere-accurately calculating where you're going to end up is kind of important when messing with a teleporter that, based on the movies, actually works using wormholes (check it, it's insane. The portkey scene in Goblet of Fire makes it look like they're stuck in the accretion disk of a Black Hole for a few seconds before getting sucked in. I bet that gave some Star Trek fans a heart attack).

And that's something to consider before you get into the whole 'religion' mess, which will probably end up becoming a chronicle of failed diplomacy rolls that make the political screwups in the lead-up to world war 1 look like the genius moves worthy of a Caesar in comparison.

So there would be a lot of ground to cover there. Way too much for any one fanfic, really. This is the kind of project that becomes its own book series, quite easily.

On a side note, we have no clue how Hogwarts passed from private property (of the Founders), to state property. Even more so, the Ministry was created a few centuries /after/ Hogwarts was built. Maybe is just a headcanon, but I always imagined there must be a legal mess and a large gray area regarding the ownership of the castle and its lands. Heck, that place was built even before England ruled Scotland, so the politics and paperwork of the place must be a mess. Irish wizards may have been going there for centuries already, and the Ministry lacked the desire and reason to stop it.

However, that raises the question, why is there even a political affinity or alliance between wizarding Ireland and wizarding Great Britain? Without a long history of colonialism, the acts of Union, etc. they share very little political ground. I think the only reason would be, as you suggest, low population means that regional wizarding communities coalesce into larger political coalitions than their Muggle equivalents.

Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.  

  “Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”  

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

***** I love love love diverse characters, but I'm gonna disagree with you there. I think Hermione had to be white.

The whole point of Hermione is that when she faces prejudice at Hogwarts, shes completely surprised. She's a white girl from a well-off family. She has never faced anything like the Mudblood insults, for something so arbitrary to her. Her journey through the books is about her reckoning with the institutional bigotry in this world. For all of the readers, its a primer on why bigotry is bad. We all want to join the wizarding world, but if we did, we'd be muggleborns too! And they wouldn't like us for a thing outside of our control. I think the books do a great job of bringing up why racism and bigotry is bad in a way that kids can understand.

For better or worse, a black hermione -- a black girl in England in the 1990s who is as well-read as hermione is -- know about bigotry. She's experienced it before, and she knows the history of it. In hogwarts it would be a different version, but her reactions/interactions with it would be informed by her personal experiences. I think black hermione could've been awesome, but a fundamentally different character who would have offered a different critique on the wizarding world.

Also, the book is more than inclusive enough when it comes to race. If you want an accurate modern representation, add some Polish students to Hogwarts. There are more than 900000 Poles in the UK, which is more than gays/lesbians. Not that those are mutually exclusive.

Looking back, every single important (to the narrative not setting) character is white. Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Weasleys, Hermione, Bellatrix, Neville, Marauders, Lily, Dursleys, Snape, Tonks, Cedric, Umbridge etc. There are PoC included, especially in book 5 and onwards, but none of them really affect the narrative in any significant way. The most significant character development given to a PoC is IMHO Dean (dating Ginny in book 6, on the run and looking for evidence of his wizard father in book 7), and yet nothing he does really affects the outcome of the main storyline compared to say, Neville's character arc.

I totally understand that the books are a product of their time and their author, but saying it's "more than inclusive" is a bit ridiculous. Had Hermione or Neville been PoC, that would have been "more than inclusive".

So it is accurate to British History then? Because Churchill, Victoria and Thatcher all were white as well. And 90% of Brits are white, with 6% Asian and 3% black. Having a black important character is statistically unlikely. And we have an Asian love interest for more than two books. That is enough to count as "inclusive" for me since it gives an accurate representation of the demographics of the UK.

I said important to the narrative exactly because of this. I don't care if everyone in the Ministry seems to be a white Pureblood. I'm talking about the narrative arc of the books.

That would mean that 1 out of 10 important character could be non-white but they aren't. And let me reiterate, I'm saying important to the narrative. That their presence impacts the narrative arc of the story in some way. Hagrid rescuing Harry from that island hut, Draco's handshake offer, Snape hating Harry, Lockhart being a fraud, the Weasley twins giving Harry the Marauder's Map, Remus' patronus lessons, GoF "Moody" being an imposter, Cedric dying, Luna introducing the Quibbler, Umbridge's torture, Bellatrix killing Sirius, Neville decapitating Nagini. These are characters who mattered, whose presence and actions changed the story and moved it forward. None of the PoC characters do more than add, lol, colour.

#+begin_quote
  And we have an Asian love interest for more than two books.
#+end_quote

Love interest is a really strong word for someone Harry has a crush on in one book and goes out for one disastrous date with in another. Her purpose was basically to shade out Cedric's character more fully. Harry emerges from this with more awareness of the impact of Cedric's death and not much else, IMHO.

**** II can sort of accept Indian!Harry, except that Vernon and Petunia seem to be sort of xenophobic. So if James was Indian, wouldn't they at least have mentioned it to Harry as another thing to hold against him?

Then again, they might have been so freaked out by his magic that all other considerations went out the window. And Vernon seems to dislike people who are recent immigrants (I.e. people/things who are “noticeably foreign”).

And it's odd that James would have an English name when Christianity... wasn't practiced in Wizarding Britain around his time (or is that a fanfic thing?).

It's conceivable that James' family has been in England since way back when and his last name could've been anglicised. It's also why, as much as I like the fanon that Harry = Hari, I don't quite subscribe to it.

** What kind of cultural norms are there surrounding wands? To most wizards and witches a wand is the most important thing they will ever own, and will likely use it every single day. Despite this there are no descriptions of customs, rituals. taboos etc concerning wands. The only relevant thing I can remember is the wand weighing ceremony where wandcare was briefly mentioned.

There is some wandlore, but that is more on the fantasy side of things, not the practical. Where do people put their wands when they're not holding them? Are wands just as durable as ordinary wood? Would really suck to break your most important possession because you sat down incorrectly.
