Just a silly idea that I couldn't pass up: What if Harry actually turned Hermione into an owl out of anger right after she says that exact line?

"Amazing. Amazing."

"Neville! You're doing it again!" Harry says.

"Oh, right sorry."

"Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?"

"Yeah. Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea."

Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them. Harry's gaze darkens upon seeing Ron, his best, or rather ex-best friend he supposed.

"We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?"

"Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him... that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you."

"Is that right?" Harry says. "Well, you... What?"

"Uh... /(Goes back to Ron)/ Are you sure you won't do this?"

"You do it."

"Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me to say it again. Hagrid's looking for you."

"Well, you can tell Ronald..." Harry starts to say but is cut off by Hermione.

"I'm not an owl!"

"Oh really? Well, lets change that, shall we?!" Harry snarled, nonverbally shooting a spell at Hermione from his wand, changing her, making her almost bird sized, until finally Hermione is replaced by a brown bushy feathered owl.

Neville and Ron stand there, speechless, too shocked to actually do anything.

The newly minted owl looks around, hooting, seemingly in confusion. Until finally.

"Hoot? Hoot? HOOOOOT! HOOT!"

(/Translation: What did he do? What did he DO?! HARRY JAMES POTTER CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT NOW!/)

"NO. Ron seems to think that you're his personal owl. So I made it so!" Harry huffs angrily and stalks back towards Hogwarts castle.

"Note to self:" Neville says, "don't make Harry Potter angry."

"I wonder if he'll turn my Gran into a toad." Neville mutters that part under his breath.

"Bloody hell." was Ron's only response.

Far away, Dumbledore watches from a spy glass and says, "Holy shit."


** Ron was sitting at the common room, trying to finish his dead boring HIstory of Magic homework. So far, every sentence just made it more boring to him. At one point, he leaned forward, resting. He was almost asleep when a piercing pain woke him up.

"Bloody hell, Hermione!"

The bushy feathered brown owl was batting her wings at him.

"I know, I know, language... but what did you expect? You just pecked me!"

The owl seemed to roll her eyes, throwing an annoyed hoot.

"It doesn't matter that I was getting asleep! Bird beaks are a nasty thing!"

A new hoot came.

"And what if I can't get Binn's work by Monday? He's a ruddy ghost! He never checks homework anyways,"

The brown owl fluttered her wings more furiously, then pointed at the book with her left one.

"Well I'm doing it, ain't I?"

Neville and Seamus came forward. "I don't know how you understand her Ron, truly."

"She has been nagging me about homework for over three years now. I could understand her in my sleep,"

It was true, especially now that Ron had not been hanging around with Harry. If Hermione saw him doing so, she would peck his eyes out or something. Or ask him to do even more homework.

Hermione turned her head away and pulled her feathers back together.

"When is she coming back, do you know?" Seamus asked.

"Madam Pomfrey reckons that she should turn back eventually, but not before the Ball. Lucky for her, she won't have to go through that rubbish,"

The brown owl frowned at him.

"Now what?"

Seamus and Neville laugh. "Forget about you understanding her. You don't. She wanted to go to the Ball,"

"Who?! Hermione? Of course not!" Ron said, then the owl pecked him again, "Ouch, what did you do that for?!"

"All girls like Balls, it's a known fact you git," said Seamus.

"Well, Hermione is not like most girls. In fact, she's not a girl, she's an owl,"

The owl fluttered its wings and tried to fly away, but Ron tried to get a hold of her, "Hey! don't go, I was just taking the mickey on you..."

He managed to get her to stay, but in doing so, he might have touched parts of the owl he wasn't supposed to. The owl made quite a feat over him. Ron's ears went a little red as well, "What?! Don't blame me, you're too bloody small! One cannot hold just your shoulder anymore!"

Seamus was almost choking with laughs, Neville wasn't much better.

"I'll tell you what. Go with me, to the Ball. We can stay in some table, eat, talk about who steps on whose feet..." Ron told her.

The owl stood silent looking at Ron, then moved her head sideways, as only an owl could do.

"I mean it, I don't want to dance, either way, it's the perfect arrangement. We can just talk... well, I'll do the talking."

Neville raised an eyebrow as Hermione gave Ron the owl version of a nod.

"Brilliant!"

The brown owl seemed quite chuffed for a while, then her wing went back to the book.

"Oh come on!"

But Ron's pleads didn't make Hermione leave it. So, unconsciously, Ron moved his hand between Hermione's head and shoulder, and scratched.

Hermione's big eyes open even bigger, but she instead of separating, she leaned closer against his hand.

"Whoa, she seems to like that. You surely know Hermione, Ron,"

Ron went impossibly red, "Shut up! It's what Pig, my other owl... well, my real owl, you know... what Pig likes,"

"Well, Hermione likes it too, and is mad that you stopped,"

Ron frowned, then turned, to Hermione. Was she? Of course not. But when he saw Hermione not moving, he guessed it must be true. Maybe owls were really that sensitive, and, without thinking about Ron scratched her neck again. This time Hermione moved closer and even released a hoot that sounded almost like a purr.

"Er... sorry!" Ron said hurrying his hand away.

Katie and Angelina saw the whole thing though and yelled as they passed, "Oh get a room!"

"Oi!" Ron shouted.

"Or an owlery!" Seamus added.

Ron stood up, "Drop it...."

"OKay, okay..." Seamus said raising his hands in defeat, then he smirked, "Or a perch!"

"That's it!" Ron said as he stood up and chased Seamus all through the common room.

Meanwhile, Hermione just stayed there, trying to even her breath, and thanking Merlin that no one could notice an owl blush.

**** Don't tempt me! I have already too many WIPs. And as I wrote this it revealed to be a romance thing. And never done pure romance things before. Not my strength.

I would be lying if I said a whole outline didn't come to me just moments ago.

** Where does Harry learn this magic? It's N.E.W.T. level, and he's not even top of his class. Also, isn't this in the movies, not the books? I'm 90% sure it's not in the books, but idk.

** I wished that Harry would have turned Hermione into an owl in that scene. It would serve her right for getting all pissy at Harry in the movie. In that scene, it sounded like she wasn't on his side at all.
