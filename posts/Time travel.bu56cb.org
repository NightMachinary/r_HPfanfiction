Are there any time travel fanfictions in which the characters fail and or have a bad ending.

Before anyone recommends The Nightmare Man, I'll tell you I have already read it.

Thank you.

â€‹

If you do not know any time travels with bad endings, just find some fanfics with bad endings for the characters.

Double thank you

  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.

** Fred and George try to change canon and wind up being responsible for how bad canon was.

And here's a very silly one-shot of mine in which Hermione doesn't realize how good her alternate universe is:

  Remus Lupin is an anti-werewolf bigot like his father, but Hermione Granger and her time-turner can fix that.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) Harry succeeds. Sort of. Mr. Murphy pays him many visits, and overall his trip through time just goes poorly.
