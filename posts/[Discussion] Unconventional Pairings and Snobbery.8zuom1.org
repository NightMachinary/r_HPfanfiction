Ever since I found this sub, I've been thrilled. I view it mainly as a source of connecting people with stories they want to read as well as a place for some interesting discussions. And it's really great: I've found many fics that way.

However, there is an aspect that is honestly grating. Often, when a Request/Fic Search thread for an unconventional pairing pops up, there is an individual that decides to, with a somewhat condescending attitude, input their opinion, which goes something like this: “Actually, such a pairing could never exist in canon, as it is unrealistic, completely goes against the established characters, and, frankly, offends the socks off of me.”

Like, I get it: Hermione, Ginny, or even Harry paired with Deaths Eaters may not be your cup of tea. And that's cool. But some of us may want to read those stories, and jamming up *Request* threads informing the OP of just ludicrous their chosen pairing is...isn't very nice. Besides, this is /fanfiction/. All kinds of stories exist; Hell, there's even a fic about the giant squid getting it on with Hogwarts! It is out there!

So then, hearing that a specific pairing “can't be done”, for example, is a bit baffling to me; after all, there are tens of thousands of fanfic authors, many with very cool ideas and some pretty neat writing skills. If someone can write Giant Squid/Hogwarts or Hermione/Sorting Hat, then something like Draco/Ginny should be more than available: it's just a matter of finding it.

I guess, what I'm asking is: please don't let your biases and personal preferences deter other people from finding stories that /they/ enjoy. We're all here just to read, and there's more than enough room for everyone. If you really want to voice your opinion on how despicable or senseless a certain pairing is, well, there is a discussion tag for that. I will gladly argue with you there.

Thank you!


** I completely agree. I think there should be a distinction between discussion threads about a pairing and actual request threads. People sometimes take pairings too seriously.

Condescending behavior towards certain pairings can have the effect of discouraging people to interact in this community.

*** I don't think it's about not being okay with slash because of homosexuality or the particular ship (though it does come into it) but rather that skepticism toward slash comes from accumulated experience of people seeing that slash in particular breeds a lot of poor fanffic wherein Harry is an emotionally weak waif. At least super!Harry lets him kick ass even if the fic is otherwise bad.

** This all comes back to the eternal problem with reddit: Anything that's slightly controversial will be downvoted enough to barely be visible and the few that see it will express their opposite opinion.

Reddit is just not a good platform for controversial matters and I have never seen the admins care about this problem even a little bit. Reddit is basically designed in a way which encourages echo chambers on a per subreddit basis (which seems to be the way all social networks and even news sites are going, people don't want to read about things they don't like). Luckily there's always some tolerance for differing opinions as long as they aren't too objectionable to the majority, but there's a reason you'll never see - for example - slash fics in a subreddit like this.

Maybe people who want to recommend Hermione/DeathEater type fics should create their own containment subreddit? Don't know if that's a good idea...

*** According to the subreddit survey, 40% of the sub reads slash. I think the perception of the sub as "anti-slash" stems from the fact that a lot of slash readers are used to slash-exclusive communities, so anything less than full support feels like persecution.

Similarly, I imagine indy!Harry readers consider this sub anti-indy!Harry. But again, there are plenty of threads on the sub where people support indy!Harry ideas and make indy!Harry fic requests. It's just that there's an equal number of threads criticising those same ideas.

Ultimately, the sub is /diverse/. But people have a tendency to see diversity as being against their particular viewpoint - kinda like how IRL both the left and the right identify the BBC as biased against their end of the political spectrum.

**** I'm not gay and I only occasionally read slash fics. So on the whole I don't personally feel persecuted by some of the comments about this topic.

Objectively however I do find that those comments are often unwarranted and unnecessarily negative. I've seen posts asking for requests for something completely unrelated (say fics with indy!Harry, could be anything though) and there will be comments along the lines of "There's lots of slash fics with this trope, but no one would want to read that shit so if that's what you want I'm gonna nope out of this thread."

I've seen these sorts of things written as top level comments for no apparent reason and I think it's fair for people to feel vilified as a result of that. That sort of comment doesn't help anyone and just makes other people less likely to offer their recommendations or to write a post themselves.

****** Discussion =/= downvoting any opinion that a person doesn't like, or coming out of the woodwork just to express a negative reaction any time a topic is mentioned.

It puts me in mind of the Bieber hate fad. Is Justin Bieber uniquely terrible to warrant such vocal opposition? No, there are plenty of other artists that are worse. The extreme negativity is a direct reaction to the perceived popularity. If Bieber didn't have a large fandom then no one would care enough to "bash" the topic. The same phenomenon applies here: extreme negativity is a response to the perceived popularity of certain fics/pairings/tropes.

Slash is definitely not unique in bringing on the downvote train; recommending any fic with Ron/Dumbledore "bashing" also gets the same treatment on this sub, as does any mention of HPMOR. There are a lot of friendly communities which follow the maxim 'personally, that's not my cup of tea, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it if it doesn't appeal to me.' It's a bit sad that this sub isn't one of them.

I, for example, would have to answer it as "reading slash", because there are good stories like linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) which contain slash which I read. However, I don't particularly enjoy reading slash and avoid most stories with it. Again and Again is good in spite of the slash, if anything.

(Then again, I didn't get to the survey in time to answer, so there's that.)

I think more options relating to frequency or preference would have been helpful for that question, similar to the general HP fanfiction one or the Harry-centric one. As it is, the question is too broad and I'm sure many of that 40% are readers with opinions similar to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8v0v21/hpfanfiction_survey_2018_new_and_improved/e1kdrh5/][this]].

*** Most of us aren't Anti-slash, just Anti-weird slash. Harry/Ron, Harry/Neville, Sirius/Remus pairings get a LOT less hate than Harry/Snape/Voldemort/Draco/Lucius sort of stories, as writing them without being Stockholm Syndrome fics where Harry is mindbroken into it with heavy noncon, it just seems weird. Harry "Wakes up one morning and finds he wants to bang Snape" is just creepy, as most of them are weird Grooming fics.

Hermione/Sorting Hat is just creepy, so it's a bad example, but if you want the "Unusual Pairings" as you call it (Harry/Cho is a fairly unusual pairing, even though in canon Harry wanted her at first) at least go for the well written ones, rather than making "BAM" changes, make the reason the pairing happen actually make sense. Though some people have "Guilty Pleasure" styles of fanfics (I like weird Triwizard Tournament Surprise motherfucker Harry is here out of nowhere summoned from x alternate or wherever the fuck he was fics) "Dumbledore/The Light are evil, Voldemort is misguided and Snape is a Sexgod" ficis are a bit of a stretch.

**** This response shows me that you don't read slash at all. Harry / Draco is an incredibly common pairing, and doesn't require much imagination to see why. They are very similar minds- and both athletes - handicapped by crap guardians that send them on very differing paths (Harry to inelegant bumbling, Draco to snobbish hubris). Put them together and they balance out each other's flaws. Harry develops his Slytherin instincts and Draco relaxes enough to show his humor and heart.

I don't have a list of faves but off the top of my head the Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Cranmer for Delinquent Wizards is a nice one, that is also I believe strictly PG 13. But it is AU. Harry never went to Hogwarts so Hermione, Neville, Luna, Draco and Ron hunt him down in (i think) their 7th year to fight Voldemort's threat .

Draco Malloy It's Your Lucky Day is a funny, shortish, well liked one that works with canon.

One of my favorite scenes in the books is when Dudley tells Harry ‘I don't think you are a waste of space'. It is hardly a compliment, and it took him way too long to get there, but it is a spark of redemption, and hope for the future.

***** "Develop his Slytherin Instincts" Seems Cliche to me. Only way to actively make that work without being "BAM" OOC snap changes rather than character development, would be for Lucius to be in Azkaban whilst Draco was young (His imperius bribe wasn't believed) so Draco can grow up with a non-bully personality. Harry hates bullies because of Dudley. You can't suddenly make Canon Draco change, unless he's forced to do something horrific by Voldemort that makes him crack and turn "Not Death Eatery" so you can lead him to Harry. The changes have to make sense. That's my point. IDGAF about the pairings as long as they're written in and not creepy AF ("3rd year Harry falls for snape and wants to sleep with him. Ewwww)

I disagree very much. Only Movie Hermione was perfect, her book version exhibits significant flaws such as strong jealousy, close-mindedness, and stubbornness. Hermione made several glaring mistakes in the final 2 Books: not suspecting Malfoy, rejecting HBP potion book, physically assaulting Ron, rejecting the notion of Death Hallows, and ruling out a Horcrux at Hogwarts. These mistakes indeed cost them dearly.

Ginny has enough fans, as surveys on this sub and [[/r/harrypotter]] show. On FFN, she's the 5th most occurring main character (after Harry, Hermione, Draco, and Snape).

The others have enough appearances in the Books to give authors good framework to work with.

Astoria Greengrass didn't appear in the Books, but JKR mentioned her a few times in interviews and on Pottermore. That's good enough for me, at least far more so than that nobody Daphne.

You didn't mention Fleur and Tonks, who are actually very well characterized in the Books and (male) fan favorites. Fleur especially is one of my most favorite characters. Behind her somewhat snobbish appearance lurks a great and powerful woman. The fandom is really not doing her character justice by often reducing her to an object of male sexual gratification.

Lavender might appear a little silly during her Won-Won episode, but who can say they didn't do something stupid during their teenage years? Her breakup with Ron was quite humiliating and embarrassing for her, but she didn't hold a grudge against the Trio. In Year 7, she braved terror and torture, actively participated in the resistance, fought in the Final Battle, and possibly gave up her life. Lavender is a very admirable character for me, at least far more so than those bigoted, bullying, and cowardly Slytherin bitches.

Cho falls in the same category as Lavender for me: much maligned in the fandom over some less than favorable episode of hers. But consider this: her love was murdered, but the government lied and covered it up. How could she not be upset? How could anyone not be upset? Later, she stood by her traitor friend Marietta Edgecombe and was unceremoniously kicked out of DA. But in the end, despite out of Hogwarts already and the fact she could have kept herself out of trouble, she came back to fight, risking her life and limbs against overwhelming enemy odds. Oh, she even had to put up with Ginny's jealousy.

One of HP Series's great aspects is the abundance of interesting and strong female characters, unlike in so many other literary works.

Think back to How I met your mother and the hot/crazy graph (that's how the Harry/Romilda relationship in "Whatever happened to Bromance" works). Also, remember, that easiest way would be to get them together before that attempt happens, and then she practically becomes the trope-y possessive girlfriend (like Hermione in adorable violence). Lastly, since you can buy them in a "Joke shop" and Romilda Vane was by far not the only one toying with the idea, it is a cultural thing in the magical world.

Granted, his friends all turned out pretty terrible but at this point it's a bunch of 16-year-olds and James and Sirius did a lot of questionable shit at this point too.

Grindelwald is okay though because his ideas were more refined, and because he got shit done?

Romilda is okay because love potions are sold by the twins? Even if wizards find this stuff amusing, they do know it's not really acceptable and love potions are banned at Hogwarts. She certainly doesn't seem like the kind of girl to like Harry as a person, but rather for his fame, something he obviously detests.

"easiest way would be to get them together before that attempt happens"

Alright, so you're saying the only believable way for them to be together in fanfic is to ignore the one big contribution she made to the plot. She's basically just a super hot OC with a canon name.

When it comes to DEs in fanfic you seem to be against this kind of white washing. Actually not all DEs though, as I've seen you have arguments on here where you're defending Bellatrix as a redeemable character. You're merely picking characters you like - mostly just hot women - and you're generally being incredibly inconsistent and judgemental.

******************** The only way I can see a Bellatrix "redemption" happen is AU territory where she gets fed up with Voldemort while in Azkaban, and even then she'd still not be a nice person but rather an antihero, someone who slaughters Death Eaters for revenge while having a drinking problem. And neither Draco nor Snape give me the "ruthless murder streak" vibe. Also, Snape's werewolf expedition was such a fucking brainfart on his part (I think that there's a werewolf there, better check it out on a full moon night) that it makes Harry look like Sun Tzu.

The difference between an annoying pest like Malfoy and someone of Grindelwald's or Riddle's calibre is that they actually pose a threat. Grindelwald and Voldemort had significant power and were difficult to take down, Draco was pathetic in the bathroom fight (or any other encounter). He's a spoiled little shit, but unlike for example Joffrey "Baratheon", he poses very little threat.

The other nice thing about Bellatrix is that you can fit her past to your story without violating canon nearly as much as giving Snape or Malfoy a vastly different past because there is very little canon information on anything before ~1975.

Romilda is ok if you write their "romance" before she attempts to rape drug Harry because he is a teenager and she is hot. I'm not sure if you know how male teenagers work, but most of them would only think about it long enough to remember a condom. It wouldn't be a deep emotional connection, that's for sure, but I know a couple of relationships which grew from "We're horny, lets fuck" into something more meaningful.

Nor do I see much of a problem with "everyone is gay" AUs. For one thing, they're not necessarily AUs in the classic sense. For most characters, we can only infer sexuality from their canon relationships, and even if Harry only dates girls in canon, that doesn't preclude the possibility that he's bi. To take a [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Watsonian_vs._Doylist][Watsonian]] approach for a moment, he spends an awful lot of time thinking about how handsome Cedric and Bill are for a straight guy. ;) Additionally, it's extremely common for LGBT people to have a friends circle with a high percentage of LGBT people, even if the friendships were formed before any of them officially "came out", so if, for example, you're writing from the premise that Harry is bi, it would hardly be surprising if several of his friends also turned out to be LGBT of some variety.

Since this is a male-dominated forum, it's possible that they just don't like romances, though they're ok with adventure-with-a-side-romance-plot. When they run across a het romance, they just say, "boring plot, not enough action" and move on. But they lump all slash into that category, since a lot of slash tends to focus on the relationship.

** I am going to argue the counterpoint here, even if it gets me downvoted to hell and back.

People read fanfics due to different reasons. Some are here for the ships, some are here for missing scenes, some are here for fluff or angst, some want "Harry growing a spine" or Weasley bashing. But there is a general consensus regarding fic quality. You won't find many recommendations of fics riddled with typos or bad formatting. People come here for quality over quantity, because otherwise, they'd simply be on FFN and sort by "new; 60k words+".

Over the years, most of us have developed strong feelings on certain ships. There are a couple guys hating Hermione like she is the second coming of Hitler. Some of us see the Death Eaters as nothing but human trash. Some people here hate the Weasleys, some love them... You get the picture.

No one is "stopping you from getting the stories you like". But if you ask for recommendations and the tread results in a discussion because someone brings forth a story and someone else says that it's trash due to X, Y and Z, then that is the whole purpose of this sub. If the pairing is something that ruined the story (like X being the love interest in a Hermione-centric fic and it came out of nowhere), then people should not be afraid to say so. If you ask for stories with a certain pairing fine, there should be no critique there because everyone is aware which rabbit hole they are going down, but if it is a general request "Good Hermione stories" and someone suggest a fic where Hermione is the sex slave of the +magical Waffen-SS+ Death Eaters because "that's everything those filthy +Jews+ Muggleborn are good for", then people can rightfully argue against recommending such a fic.

Tl;dr: We are here for opinions on fics, not just a list you could get through Scryer.

** I'm guilty of doing this very recently and almost feel like this thread is directed at me, so I'll respond:

Yes, you're ultimately correct. I shouldn't have chimed in on a request thread about how the pairing can't work. I didn't realize that was actually against the rules, but regardless my bad.

I will say in my defense that the OP requested a believable Draco/Ginny, and that's why I chimed in with why it can't work. Because I rejected the very premise. There have been many other threads asking for specific pairings (even Draco/Ginny) that I never added my opinion to on its validity, but because the request specifically asked for something that was believable, I thought it appropriate to engage on whether such a thing is even possible. Because the OP wanted that, and was going to get fics that are making that claim. And I just don't believe any fic can be believable.

On the larger point, anyone can like any pairing. If you want to see your two favorite characters get together, changing them enough to make that plausible is probably not a big deal to you. But one of the drawbacks of so much fanfiction is it makes us lose the actual characters. For example, Draco in canon is a coward who believes in blood supremacy and in the end wanted Voldemort to win. But in more fanfictions that I can count, his character is drastically changed to make the pairing work. And we forget his true nature, which overall hurts our understanding of the original work. And maybe it's just me but I simply don't understand the appeal of reading about a character when they have been changed so much as to not make them that character anymore. Of course any pairing can be done, and can make for an interesting story. But I stick by my assertion that certain pairings are not possible without changing fundamental aspects of the characters. They can't be done in a true-to-canon fashion.

*** Honestly, it is and it isn't. It's not like you are alone in this, because I've been following this sub for...a year? I think?...and I've noticed a certain amount of negativity aimed at certain pairings. That post was just the unlucky tipping point. And it's possible I should have been more subtle about it; it's not fair to single anyone out, as it is undoubtedly a group thing.

Now, to your point: I actually understand where you're coming from. Many fics can alter characters to such an extent that they're practically unrecognizable. But I will posit that the problem with those stories isn't the change itself, but /how that change comes to be/.

If story A presents Draco Malfoy as a fearless leader, championing the likes of muggleborns, and /there is no explanation how or why he got there/, then yeah: it's absurd.

But if a story starts with something subtle, a little (or big) event that forces him to ponder matters of equality, leading to a slow rebellion against his parents' ideologies, which culminates in him switching sides...why not? Thing is, stories are built on /change/. Characters grow and evolve. And different stimuli can lead to different outcomes. Villains can become heroes, and heroes (Harvey Dent is my favorite example) can be torn down into villains.

So, my argument is that it's not about the change itself, it's about the journey that leads to it.

**** I didn't mind you calling my post out; you were right and it did violate the subs rules. And if my opinion can be interpreted as being condescending or rude to others who don't share my view, it should be called out and I need to own up to it. Since it wasn't my intention,, then I need to clarify my stance. So it's good you posted this.

So to clarify, my position is not that a person can't enjoy reading a pairing because it isn't realistic or believable. There are many great stories that include a pairing that is not believable based on canon. But since the OP was specifically asking for a believable fic, I responded that indeed it would be impossible, in my opinion. And as I stated, I do not comment on request threads where the OP is simply asking for a certain pairing with no caveats.

Regarding the rest of your post, on one hand, you are correct about how the story of someone changing for the better, and then the love interest falling for that new person who they originally hated, is a compelling story. And Draco could theoretically change in a way that might make Ginny fall for him. But this also requires Ginny to change a lot too, which is also possible.

My general issue with this type of story, specifically for Draco/Ginny, is that in order to buy into it, there has to be some drastic fundamental change to the core of who that character is. And if you are a fan of the character of Draco, that fundamental core characteristic is very unpleasant. Draco is a very unpleasant person, and someone who is incredibly unappealing to people like Ginny. Ginny in canon seems to be attracted heavily to bravery, and presumably would be very unattracted to cowardliness. Draco is a coward at his core. That's not something so easily changed about a person. Ginny is also fiercely opposed to literally every aspect of Draco's life and belief system. Ginny also is incredibly loyal, incredibly loyal to Harry, and in love with Harry, even in death. So the story needs to make Harry not worthy of that loyalty, because if Harry dies (as the way to get him out of the equation) Ginny would never be with Draco if for no other reason than out of loyalty and respect for Harry. Ultimately, for Ginny to ever want to be with Draco, Draco would need to change literally everything about his character, and Ginny would also need to change major parts of her character. Personally I just don't see the appeal since you are now reading a fic with two OCs. But sometimes people just want their favorite characters to be together, or they just appreciate a certain type of story, regardless of its consistency with canon characteristics. That is fair. But I still maintain that a believable, canon-consistent Draco/Ginny does not exist

***** That's a pretty solid argument, especially regarding their characters. It makes sense, and, honestly, I didn't even think about it like that. But I'd still claim there's plenty to work with to change them in a realistic way.

Take, for instance, some of Draco's negative traits: his spoiled nature, his brattishness, his bigotry. These are all learned behaviors. He acts that was because he was taught to act that way...meaning it can be unlearned with the proper stimulus.

Then, his cowardice. And, you're right, Draco often does act like a coward. But, the thing is, even cowards can do brave things. When he was standing on the top of the Astronomy tower, holding the most powerful of the world(?) at wandpoint, don't you think he was scared? He was, but he did it anyway. And I see that as act of both desperation, yes, but bravery too.

Finally, I'd like to point out that there a million different mechanisms to force them to work together. In the story I pointed out, for example, Ginny was forced to live with Draco via a Voldemort-induced marriage law...and she /hated/ it. She fought tooth and nail. But Harry was dead, and she was practically alone...and Draco wasn't in the best position in Voldemort's court either, which led to them working together. And cooperation -- even forced cooperation -- is a great prelude to respect, admiration, and, possibly, even love.

Obviously, that's not canon-consistent. But why stick to canon in fanfiction? I mean, sure, you can -- there's nothing wrong with that -- but there shouldn't be any reason to limit yourself either. There are a million different ideas, and if a story can take you from point A to point B with sound reasoning and logic, having the characters act in ways that are believable, then that story can be very realistic, even if the characters end up completely transformed.

****** Good points.

My whole thing about canon is that I'm fine if you make the world AU. I like fics where Harry never went to Hogwarts, for example. But for me, the characters themselves need to be true to canon. So don't make Ginny demure, even-tempered and overly lovey-dovey with Harry. Don't make Hermione lazy or manipulative. And don't make Draco have a heart of gold or have him throw himself in front of a killing curse.

Specific to the example you gave in that fic, the problem is that in a world where Voldemort wins and Ginny is given to Draco, the whole point of Draco's character is that he would actually be ok with this. This would be the easier path for him and he would probably relish the fact he gets to have Ginny. Even when Draco was at his lowest point in canon, it was really about how to survive the situation in the easiest way; it was never about doing the right thing. In the Astronomy Tower, Draco was not brave. He was forced into a bad situation but went along with it, half-assing several attempts because he was torn about whether it was the best play for himself. He also couldn't kill, not because of some noble idea about murder, but he just didn't have the stomach for it. Keep in mind he had no qualms with others being murdered and when things were looking very good for him under the possibility of Voldemort's rule, he relished in the pain Voldemort and the Death Eaters caused.

Another example: at Malfoy Manor, when he fails to identify Harry, it's not because he wants to protect Harry. He could've just said it wasn't him if that was the case. He said maybe because he was a weak, shell of a boy who couldn't decide anymore which side he wanted to prevail. He was a coward even then because he couldn't make a choice.

Finally, during the final battle, Draco almost captures Harry while in the Room of Requirement. Even at this late hour, Draco was still trying to curry favor with Voldemort. He fully knew what Voldemort winning meant and because he thought in that moment that capturing Voldemort would gain his favor, Draco committed himself to Voldemort.

So even in a story where Voldemort wins, Draco doesn't do the right thing and rebel against his rule.

Finally, in order for this to work, Ginny needs to be attracted to Draco. Simply having them live and work together can't do it by itself; otherwise we'd all be hooking up with our coworkers left and right (ok that's a bit hyperbolic ;)). Ginny has to respect Draco and he needs to be brave and a leader for her to change her opinion. And again, it simply is not in Draco's core nature to be that way. I can buy that his bigoted views and aristocratic nature can be unlearned, but the cowardice and "follower" attitude is very much ingrained.

But regardless, this conversation is fantastic and what this sub is about. So cheers to that!

******* Well, you and I won't agree about Draco's motivations, but that's not a bad thing, as his feelings and intent are frequently not defined in canon; hence, they're open to interpretation. It's an element that we can discuss and agree to disagree. That's fine!

Regarding the story, however: it forces Malfoy to cooperate with Ginny specifically for his survival. The Malfoys were not held in high regard by Voldemort at the end of the war; the story plays on this and worsens the situation for Malfoy.

And, completely agreed about the conversation: I think we both came away with new thoughts!

** When people say "can't be done", usually they mean "can't be done well". And when it comes to Harry Potter fanfiction, that usually means that there isn't an enormouse departure made from canon in characters. Well, that's not completely true either, since it happens all the time and can be great... when it's done for the plot. If it's done just to set up an unlikely pairing then it just feels cheap, I'd say.

But I don't really bash on those requests, if you're looking for whatever, best of luck to you. But that doesn't mean I'm going to enjoy or be able to say that Harry/Bellatrix, or Harry/Lily is a reasonable pairing.
