#+TITLE: The Statute of Secrecy works both ways to some extent. Some Wizards should never find out about atomic bombs, or the internet, or space travel. Some phrases are magically tracked in case a Muggleborn mentions them to a pureblood. Arthur Weasley will never know the function of a rubber duck.

*** I'm working on a fic that has a runaway amnesiac 'I don't want to remember' Harry stuck in his animagus form meet and live with Hermione, then the two of them realize they can 'make stuff happen.' They promptly start watching anime together to figure out how to do the magical stuff. "I bet you can do that" and "Hey, we can build that!" are big themes.

***** It's a work in progress, just wish I had enough time to get my main fic, Elune's Pebble, far ahead enough to produce a second fic regularly. 'Black Cat,' the working title, also has in the outline various students working on projects to create awesome familiars, because that Granger muggleborn obviously can't be the only one with a cool magical creature for a companion. Thus they use magic to crossbreed pokemon-inspired hybrids of magical creatures and resurrect hybrid raptor/dragons by using fossils on unfertilized dragon eggs in a magic ritual on Halloween at Hogwarts. (Even have half of the arguments about making the resulting creatures omnivores to avoid 'Jurassic Park' scenarios written out in the sprawling, 47k word outline.)

It will get written, either when I get more time or when I finish Elune's Pebble.

** Best take on this I've seen is that the Statute is actually a spell that as a side effect of protecting the secret though things like making dragons flying overhead look like airplanes, muggles and wizards have a hard time holding onto an understanding of how things work in the other world.

*** Some Auror would just wipe Arthur's memory of what Harry said if Harry said anything.

Or not. Maybe rubber ducks are okay to know about. But if Harry were to talk to the elder Weasly about atomic bombs...

** Yeah but the point of the secrecy is to protect wizards from the muggles, because they teach muggle studies at hogwarts and wizards can go into the muggle world but not the other way around.
