Recently, I've remembered an old fanfiction about harry being sorted into Slytherin. I think the name was "Better Be Slytherin!". I don't actually remember if I've finished it... So, do you guys know if it was complete or if it has a continuation??

Click on the blue name of the author, if there us a continuation, it'll be there.

** Is Better Be Slytherin the fanfic where the Light wins, but any student that gets sorted into Slytherin has their magic taken away? I think that story is only a oneshot
