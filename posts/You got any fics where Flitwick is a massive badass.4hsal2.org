I'd prefer that he's actually Yoda in hiding and nobody notices anything's amiss except Hermione but since that's obviously not going to happen I have to settle for the second best thing.

So yeah, hit me with you best Flitwick fics.


** A Clock on the Face of Hell by IsSayWhyNot fulfills the title. Flitwick and Harry go back in time to the Grindelwald era.

  Fate was sealed that night. I was to live and fight, to breathe and conquer. The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend.

  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book One finished! Book Two started!
