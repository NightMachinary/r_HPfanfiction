**** Okay, from the top. :D

A Long Journey Home - the 'Ancient Harry' fic, Jasmine Potter gets punted back into the past and lives through centuries. She has no active relationships going, but mentions some past romance somewhere (hence the semi-gen tag).

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]

linkffn(9860311)

A Witch and An Amazon - Fem!Harry (I think she goes by Rose?) meets Wonder Woman in Vegas and gets drunk-married to her. Has a lot of homophobia from Magical Britain, but generally handles the concept semi-well. Fun fic with some relationship drama and superhero drama mixed into the plot.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12514982/1/A-Witch-and-an-Amazon-Walk-into-a-Bar]]

linkffn(12514982)

Yule Ball Panic - Fem!Harry-Hermione relationship fic beginning in the Yule Ball with lots of 'Female Revolution!' vibes to the plot afterward. Fun though, not preachy. Also the tamest Veela-Orgy-Ritual fic ever written. Has homophobia and does deal with it more interestingly than Witch and Amazon. Not porny, but does have fields of Veela fucking for actual plot reasons. It wouldn't be my thing, otherwise, ace as fuck here. :D

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/Yule-Ball-Panic]]

linkffn(11197701)

The Last Peverell - Technically goes by another name in this fic as she's time-travel reborn into someone else's body in the Marauder Era (not a canon character, but she's basically Jasmine Potter in another body). Very Lordship-ey, but in a fun way. And does feature kooky-deadly Aunt Cassiopeia Black, which is always a pro in my book. :)

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12744735/1/The-Last-Peverell]]

linkffn(12744735)

Charlotte the Great - Vaguely sociopathic-manipulative Charlotte Potter becomes a Slytherin and is basically an unpleasant and ambitious person for the whole story. Fun story, though.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820]]

linkao3(3694820)

Dahlia Evans - I haven't read this, but it's marked Harry/Hermione and it's in my fem!Harry folder, so I'm assuming this fits. Apologies if it doesn't.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026760/1/Dahlia-Evans-the-Broken-Bridge]]

linkffn(12026760)

Future's Past - fem!Harry goes back in time, getting time-travel reborn into a past person, and rescues Orion Black and ends up dating him and vaguely parenting Sirius. It's very cute and very fun, despite the Romance Novel-esque verbiage used throughout. It's a personal favourite. Ianthe/Ophelia is a fun character.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790]]

linkao3(6762790)

Harriet Potter is - Quite sad 'Slytherins fight against Voldemort' fic told in that epilogue-dreamscape style. Fun and interesting.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822]]

linkao3(6109822)

Holly Evans and the Spiral Path - I have no idea if I've read this fic or not, but it's in my fem!Harry folder and I don't know what the pairing is. I suspect not Draco, Snape, or Riddle, given that it's written by Wordhammer.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path]]

linkffn(4916690)

Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise - Fun fic about Iris Potter being belligerent and sarky as heck about being in the tournament, with some really interesting changed/extra tasks added in.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/]]

linkffn(12568760)

The Archaeologist - Another semi-gen fic where Harry gets punted to an alternate universe, wakes up in the body of his female equivalent, and basically doesn't care and wanders off to explore tombs. Fun fic, if a little clunkily told, with a lot of Bloodborne stuff involved.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290]]

linkao3(19328290)

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool - Harry also gets punted to an alternate universe where he's a woman. She gets with Tonks in this universe and there's a weird ending.

Magical Metamorphosis - Harry becomes Fem!Harry when she realises she's trans after walking up some stairs. Hermione is very supportive.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12507814/1/]]

linkffn(12507814)

Mistakes and Second Chances - Fem!Harry gains special powers from being MoD, goes through some shit (trigger warning for mentions of sexual assault, it's posted in the ANs of the relevant chapters) and makes new friends (and a ladyfriend).

The Unbroken Saviour - Another fic I haven't read, but I know it's a time-travel fic where fem!Harry actually is honest and open with Albus Dumbledore. So that's interesting. Don't know the pairing, but nothing is listed.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12025821/1/]]

The Girl Who Lived - fem!Harry is kind of a tomboy, also told in the epilogue-dreamscape tone.

****** I loved 'em. Yule Ball Panic is one of those series I go back and revisit like a comfort blanket every so often. :)

And I have not read that series, I'm afraid. I'm not the biggest fan of superhero things generally and the only superhero things I've actually enjoyed were the smaller, constrained stuff (I've seen exactly four superhero movies - the first Avengers, the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Logan, and Wonder Woman - and while I enjoyed both Logan and Wonder Woman, I found Avengers and Guardians to be incredibly bland and bombastic) so I tend to end up avoiding most superhero fics.

I only picked up your Wonder Woman one because it was her trying to integrate into the HP Universe and not overmuch about her doing superhero things and continued because the relationship was interesting and fun enough to outweigh the superhero stuff. Your Iris Potter series seemed to have a lot more superhero stuff than the Wonder Woman one did, so I've never read it.

I apologise if that comes off as rude - I've tried rewording and it seems brusque to me regardless. It's not intended to be rude, just explanative. I've never been able to pin down tone conveying in online conversation - but in a world where 'k.' can indicate irritation where 'k' does not, I was doomed from the get-go. That distinction will never not baffle me. :D

******* I'm happy to hear how much you like the Jasmine series! I've got a few fanfics that I like to return to every so often, too.

And no, you didn't come off as rude at all. If you don't like superhero stories, then you don't like them. Nothing to apologize for there. “A Witch and an Amazon” does utilize superhero themes a bit less - Wonder Woman may be a superhero, but her powers are more in line with fantasy and sword/sorcery figures/stories than many superheroes. That's part of what made her a good fit for a crossover with Harry Potter.

That said, while the Iris stories closely follow the MCU movie plots, Iris is still a witch who uses magic. The stories focus on Iris' magic, her character, and her relationships much more than superpowers. Marvel superheroes may play a big enough role that you can't enjoy them, but if you like how I handled magic and characters in the others then it's at least possible that you'd enjoy Iris.

It's just a suggestion, though. I won't be offended if you still think the MCU context is enough to not want to bother.

******** In regards to the rude thing, I meant the tone, not the sentiment. Tone is hard to convey or infer over the internet and I have an unfortunate inability to phrase things diplomatically when I'm tired - it's caused a lot of trouble when writing emails. There's a reason I express similar sentiments in every one of my little boilerplate disclaimers I put on my request post. :D

But yeah, I wasn't sure if I came off as "Ugh. Superheroes suck, I fuckin' hate them and you're terrible for liking them!" or the intended "Each to their own, but Superhero movies aren't really my thing." Good to know I came off how I wanted! :)

I like that - it's a really good way of putting it. She definitely has far more Fantasy vibes than Superhero ones.

Well, I do like your storytelling and if the focus is more on the magic than the Superhero themes, it could be my sort of thing. I suppose there's no harm in adding it to the list and trying a few chapters, at least. Is there anything I need to know in advance to read the fic?

It's certainly going to be a while until I get to it, anyway. I'm resorting my fics back into their folders and I currently have eight-hundred-and-something fics I don't really remember and am going to need to reread/skim in order to work out where the heck to put them.

********* Anything you need to know in advance? I don't think so... general familiarity with the overall MCU plot line might help. I wouldn't say it's critical, but in order to avoid boring the people who have seen the movies (which I tended to assume on the part of readers), I didn't repeat a lot of the details from the movies when it wasn't absolutely necessary.

It's honestly hard for me to say how much you might miss if you're completely ignorant of a movie's plot before reading an associated story. Maybe not a lot in some cases, but probably a bit in others. The first story, for example, begins with the climactic fight at the end of Iron Man. If you don't know anything about why those two people are fighting, even though their fight (mostly) isn't the focus, it probably won't resonate as much.

So... I guess reading a basic IMDB plot summary would help to give context.

Oh, and since you're not a fan of superhero stories, I assume you never watched the old 1968 Batman series? If for some reason you have and liked it at all, then you'll want to try “Amy Potter is Batgirl”. If not, then definitely stay away because none of the jokes or characterizations will make sense, I think.

I hope you enjoy what you do read, though!

********** Good to know - and might I say a sincere thank you for putting some consideration behind the explanation, it's always nice to get some thought process insight from writers on their works. Many would just leave it at 'nah, you'll be aight', so the helpful explanation is also appreciated. :)

I'll note to get some basic background before I start it. It'll be like reading Ancient Literature all over again, only instead of being accompanied by an archaic dictionary, it'll be a Marvel wiki. :)

*********** You're welcome!

And speaking as someone who has studied more ancient, dead languages than modern, living ones, I have a good idea of what you mean about sitting with a book on one side and a dictionary on the other. I started as a medievalist in college, so I spent a lot of time with Middle High German, Old High German, and even Gothic. And those were just the primary ones I dealt with!

Yes, I'm referring to the series with Adam West and Burt Ward. Even when it first aired, it was very campy and tongue-in-cheek, and that effect seems to have grown over time. I did what I could to capture the campy atmosphere and the characters' hokey lines - and as I'm sure you can imagine, my fic would just sound weird to anyone who isn't at least a bit familiar with that series.

That leads to a much smaller audience for it, I know, but I had fun writing it.

************ Oooh, nice. You definitely have a type, huh? What got you into the medievalist game, if you don't mind my asking? Big Tolkien fan? :)

Never had the chance to do anything linguistic in academia myself - the UK system doesn't do unaffiliated classes at degree level, so all my classes were in psychology - so it's been strictly a hobby for the most part. A mild necessity, too - I'm of Irish-Italian heritage, so pretty much everyone I share genetics with is Catholic-as-Hell and picking up old philosophy and translations of bible stuff is practically a matter of survival for family dinners. :D

I do have a fondness for camp media. The old 80s movie campness is one of my favourite things ever - and 'ole Palpatine's camp enjoyment of everything is the one redeeming facet of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. I'll add it to the list. :)

Ah, nice. In the end, that's really the best motivation - if you had fun. This is a hobby, after all, and the internet has the attention span of a frenetic goldfish. :)

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

***** Charlotte the Great and Powerful is an underrated story. I usually dislike a lot of Harry in Slytherin stories because they tend to have him widely accepted which just seems...highly unlikely with the whole "pureblood" password slash half of them having Death Eater parents. I like how the author wrote her as kind of ignored but respected for her talent/fame with only one real friend and the relationships with Draco and Blaise. The whole "sociopath" who feels ambivalent was done well. And the age thing with Barty is creepy asf but also obvs. meant to be creepy & not explict and doesn't go beyond tame, thank god, and makes a bizarre sort of sense with the character.

** Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

Victoria Potter is one of my favourite Fem!Harry stories just by virtue of how much the story avoids the "stations of canon" and how much worldbuilding went into it, and it's a genfic (at least so far) - no romance in sight for our main character.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.
