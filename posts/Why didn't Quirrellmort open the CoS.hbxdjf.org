I just realized, that Quirrellmort had the perfect opportunity to open and exploit the chamber of secrets for confusion and distraction while he himself worked on the stone.

Are there any fics where he does something similar? Or just uses snakes to his advantage?


** I don't think there was any need. He fell hook, line and sinker for Dumbledore's trap and thought himself way above the puny defenses of the Stone, which he was, too. By the time he would have reached the Mirror and get himself trapped, staring into it for hours on end, it would have been too late to turn tails and come up with another plan.

The real question is why didn't he jack the Mirror entirely and try to break the wards once he was in a secure location.

** They wanted to close Hogwarts when Ginny was kidnapped. They would close Hogwarts if some student died. And then how they could to take the stone?

** You don't drop a nuke as a distraction for a stealth-operation.

As-is, the Hogwarts staff are suspicious but can't /act/ on it directly since he's not doing anything obvious - the Chamber being opened gives them every reason to act on their suspicions, regardless of whether or not Quirrell goes to the Third Floor Corridor during the attack.

** Oh, this is a clever question. I actually haven't wondered that, ever, and it's been a while.

A few guesses?

- Quirrel himself can't speak Parseltongue, only the -mort part can, and as we are told, it takes a lot of strength for Voldemort to speak or act himself.
- There was no reason to -- because there actually isn't anything down there except for the Basilisk (notably, no study, potions lab and library), and a Troll was a better diversion than a Basilisk.

*** Ginny was possessed in book2, she could open the chamber.

Edit: Maybe it's a difference between active and passive possession? Well, that might be out too, as Harry allegedly is a parselmouth from the scarcrux.

** He wanted his body/power back. Its his main motivation in the early books.

** LeadVonE's "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches..." fic has Quirrelmort utilizing the CoS, though it mostly happens offscreen.

** Best guess? Riddle already knew Dumbledore suspected Quirrel. Opening the chamber would immediately point to him. This was supposed to be a stealth mission.

** He was being sneaky. If all had gone according to plan, Quirrell would have run the gauntlet, stolen the stone and then bolted out with Dumbledore none the wiser. Remember, he was weak, and could only have form when he was sharing someone's body - if he could have possessed Quirrell fully, he definitely would've done it (maybe not from the start, but definitely in the gauntlet), and that soul-draining trick his diary self used seems to have been invented by that shard during its isolation, probably borne from the decades of solitary confinement and made possible by the enchantments on the book itself.

** Because Voldie could barely talk, even after drinking unicorn blood, and Quirrell couldn't use parseltongue. He had a hitchhiker, but he wasn't truly possessed.

** The only one I can think of where he resorted to that was a time travel fic where Harry was making enough problems that he ended up siccing the basilisk on Hogsmead as a distraction, which thanks to the abuse of time turners was thwarted at the same time as Harry fought Quirrell.

** I headcanon that all of Voldemort's magical muscle was used in maintaining stealth and keeping Quirrel from dying.

Ginny's possession was a long drawn out affair with plenty of temporary possessions over that period.
