I don't really know if this exists anywhere, because usually Neville is Harry's best mate and he is the secondary pairing regularly shipped with Luna. I want to see a Neville centered fic preferably completed, OCs are fine but no Neville/Luna because those haunt me


** There is one Neville/OC where the OC is Draco's sister that is really good! If you filter for M, English, 100k+ words, and Neville/OC its probably the one with the most comments.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

** There's this Neville/Hannah story that takes place during their 7th year while Harry & co. are off hunting horcruxes. It is fairly OOC, fair warning, but it's a generally engaging story, so if you're looking for more Neville, it's worth a try.

** Huh. This thread made me realize I've never read a single Neviile centric story. That's something I've got to rectify immediately.

linkffn(Asking for roses by Dogstar101) is something that's been on my reading list for a while. Neville/Hannah, Pre-DH, seems well written and interesting at first glance.

linkffn(Elementary by Amber Nickel) is a decent-ish Neville/Ginny oneshot based with multiple time travels. Both are present for the entirety of the story, but it is told from Ginny's PoV rather than Neville's.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9463150/1/Elementary][Elementary]] by Amber Nickel

#+begin_quote
  For Rare Fest 2013. Ginny's 21st birthday was supposed to be an easygoing day with her new date, Neville. But when his gift to her turns out to be cursed, it seems like the universe itself is conspiring against them. Will fate push them apart, or can their love survive the tests of the many times they find themselves flung into?

I should have expected the bot to not pick it up. Judging by that fav/review count, I'm one of the two people who have read it.

** linkffn(5281335) is my personal favorite - though it hops around on viewpoints a fair bit, it highlights Neville more than most other stories of its type.

linkffn(7907044) is much shorter, but still a great story - heavily Neville-centric.

Both stories are Neville/Hannah paired, so no worries on that front.
