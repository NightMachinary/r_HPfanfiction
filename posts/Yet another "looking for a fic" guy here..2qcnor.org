** I'd love to hear any suggestions about stories similar to this also! The only thing I can remember in this genre is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6195484/1/When-Harry-Met-Hermione][When Harry Met Hermione]] which is obviously about Harry meeting Hermione first instead of Ron, and they end up being closer to Neville than to Ron.

I would think this is a popular idea but I haven't found any other stories like this.

*** Yeah, I just finished reading that one. While good I was expecting and certainly think it could have been much longer. Listening to Hermione might have skipped a few events and speed up others but it could have been at least 200K.

Thinking about tackling this myself but its a huge undertaking and I have never written fanfic before that I would publish.

Let me know if you find anything else.

** Damnit. Guess this is a fairly unique concept. This thread actually shows up on the first page of Google results for the scenario I described.

*** That's so weird. In the intro to WHMH the author even says it's a popular discussion among HHr fans to guess what would have happened if Harry met Hermione first. I'm not sure why more stories weren't written with this premise.
