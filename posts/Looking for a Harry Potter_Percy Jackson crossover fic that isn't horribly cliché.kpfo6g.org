I want something that is different from the standard 'The demigods go to Hogwarts' thing. I have read many crossover fics where wizards are just Hecate's children or blessed by her and it's getting kind of old.


** Honest question: Are there any PJO fics, crossover or not, that are not a cliche? I searched for some fics a few days ago, and they seem to be almost identical.

*** The one where Harry was Hades' son and Voldemort and Dumbledore both viewed demigods as halfbreeds and great 'study objects' was pretty ok. I don't remember the fics name, tho. But I remember that quite a lot of demigods did attend Hogwarts and quite a bit of them actually died.

** linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is my favorite.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum) is an interesting one, but IIRC, any significant connection to Harry Potter canon disappears pretty quickly.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) is incredibly overrated, but it's not awful, especially if you just want some low stakes fluff.

It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

**** The great part about this fic is that even thou we are already at about 350K words and have seen harry and the pantheon/campers experience many different adventures we are still at a point before going to Hogwards, as harry is still only 10 years old and even when we reach the classic 7 Hogwards years they are unlikely to be the classic retelling of books 1-7 because of the many major and minor setups that have already happened

*** That kind of summary where Harry is abandoned always makes me tentative to read the fic, it's often a sign of character bashing on the potter end of the crossover. Is Dumbledore/the Wizarding World bashed in any way? Especially if it's done in a way to make the PJ side look awesome in comparison?

**** Yes and no i guess

The fic goes the classic way of making the Dursleys out worse than they have been meant to be, but that is more as a side note. it is also used as a plot device for harry to want to learn to be able to live by himself (in the wild for example). But for the most part the Dursleys are only "bashed" in the very beginning of the Fanfic.

As for Dumbledore... we didnt yet have any real chapters taking part in the harry potter side of the crossover. we have met Luna and her family but thats it really.

the only other mention of the Wizzarding world is where someone (tyche whos human aspect was lily) punished Dumbledore for placing harry with the Dursleys, but he is not made out as the big evil mastermind that some Fanfics like to portray him as.

​

when we reach the Hogwards age for harry that MIGHT change but i honestly dont think so, because this is more of a feel-good happy-go-lucky kind of Fanfic with some exciting adventures for the MC instead of an abuse or hurt/comfort kind of fanfic.

***** and retribution against the dursley's was very tastefully done and isn't a large focus. I think my favourite part about this story is Harry maintains his wide eyed amazement of the world around him and his complete indifference to the fact the gods are gods. It's very interesting and wholesome
