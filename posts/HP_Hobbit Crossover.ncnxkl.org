Fem!Harry, Living with Bilbo takes his place on the adventure.\\
Mentions to Gandalf that hobbits can clear the "taint" aka Saurons evil or other such stuff.\\
Summons a giant forest at the battle of five armies that nearly kills her to do.

Just can't remember the name of it.


** This sounds like Fate be Changed by Araceil, however it was deleted by the author when they deleted their FFN account as a result of receiving abuse from other users on the platform.

I reached out to them on the topic of reposting it to AO3 as they did some of their other works, but they made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that they have no interest in doing so. They also do not like receiving messages on the topic of their deleted stories, so I dropped the matter there.
