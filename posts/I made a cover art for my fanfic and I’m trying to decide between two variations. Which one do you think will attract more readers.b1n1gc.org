** Second one. It looks less obvious that you used a filter to give it the "illustration" effect.

Btw, people don't care about covers unless you're posting fics on Wattpad. FFN's cover thumbnail is so small that no one would be able to read your curly cursive word art. It's the summary and tags (if you're on Ao3) that people care most about when looking for new stuff to read.

** The second one. It has a better "Harry Potter" feel.

** The second one is more visually pleasing, while the first one is brighter and therefore more likely to catch the eye as the reader is scrolling. This would really only work on Wattpad though.

** The second one strikes me better. You are a fantastic artist: let me know whether you would like a bigger art platform for sharing.

** The right version is much easier to look at and understand at a first glance since the color choice draws my eyes to the illustration and wording without straining my eyes or attention.

The cover on the left seems much more blurred, less concise, and it's much harder to focus on the words and illustration due to the colors in the background. Since the background is very colorful, the wording is very colorful, and the character is a bit colorful it confuses me on where to look. For instance, I glanced from the illustration to the title a number of times because focusing on them both was a strain on my eyes.
