** Hmm...you know, given how in-human Voldemort is looking by the end of the series, maybe somewhere along the way he's abducted by aliens who think he's an extraterrestrial and want to stop him messing up Earth's natural course of development? Prime Directive style?

******** I imagine they'd just use whatever Hogwarts uses to track muggleborns, then kidnap them or whatever as soon as the name pops up. No problemo.

I could see them using Wizards, but surely they'd want to keep 'em on a shorter leash? Have them properly trained as employees or something?

Howarts uses a magical artifact for it ("Book of Admission" iirc), which is located in a location muggles can't access (Hogwarts).

How would they get to it?

********** I couldn't tell you, but given the kind of things they've caught and contained I would be extremely surprised if they didn't have a way.

If necessary they could capture wizards from outside hidden zones and use them to infiltrate.

*** Sequel: After being hit by a bus, Voldemort wakes up in a world that runs on the rules of the tabletop or video game with which he is most familiar. Unfortunately, since he never played tabletop games as a wizard and the other orphanage children never again invited him to play after the first fiasco, this game is /Uncle Wiggily/.

** This reminds me of the one fic where he waits a couple days to attack the Potters, only to find out that getting killed by your own rebounded killing curse on All Souls Day will reverse the Horcrux ritual he was attempting. His Horcruxes incinerate, his soul anchors destroyed, and his wraith form disappears in a puff of logic.
