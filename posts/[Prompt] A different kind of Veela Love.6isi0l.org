Story Prompt: Draco becomes a "Protector Veela" . Instead of forming a bond with just one mate he forms a bond with that persons abused children.

For example- Hermione and kids are being abused by Ron and Draco bonds with Rose and Hugo. He protects them all and has the Veela traits and has a romantic relationship with Hermione

or with Harry and his kids or lily/sev with baby harry


** What's the point of the Veela? Seriously, "Draco works in child protection, meets the mother of abused kids and starts a relationship with them" is a solid prompt (maybe make it an AU Draco, not the canon piece of shit), but the whole "Veela traits" sounds like stuff that won't help but detract from the story - unless you want to delve into just how creepy an adult (and inhuman creature!) bonding with children can appear to others, like the easily manipulated wizarding public. (Very often, "Veela bond" is shorthand for "I can't think of a way how this relationship could ever happen naturally, so I'll invent some deus ex machina to get the couple together!", which definitely is not needed here since the urge to protect kids is pretty much natural.

Although "Ron the abusive father/husband" is doubly OOC. First, Ron hasn't shown any such tendencies in canon, and second, Hermione hasn't shown any sign that she would let this happen. So, in order to use that trope, you generally make both characters act rather OOC. If you are stuck on Dramione, it would be easier to have Hermione and Ron divorce, and have Hemione and Draco work together on a case or so, maybe she's the head of the DMLE at that time, and he's seconded from child protection Services for a politically sensitive (or mysterious) case, and she notices how much he has changed from his canon shitheadedness. That also avoids the creepy "I love the mother of the children I am responsible for as the representant of the government who could take them away from her if I decide to" power imbalance too.

** Wth does Draco need Veela trait?

Ron the abusive husband is one of the worst bashing trope I could think of, because in Canon, Hermione was by far the more physically abusive one. This is magical world we are dealing with, not the Muggle one in which men could abuse their advantages in physical strength. Witches were in every way as powerful as wizards. And in case of Hermione and Ron, she generally beat him in a straight fight.

Hermione becoming disappointed in a slacker Ron would be a far better reason for them to drift apart.
