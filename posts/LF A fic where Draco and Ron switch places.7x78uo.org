I have no clue why, but I'm in a mood of reading a fic where Draco and Ron switch places or switch lives. Like Draco's reaction to suddenly having 6 siblings and Ron's reaction to having to do high class society edict.


** I think I've seen a few Draco/Hermione fics with this premise.

*** I actually have read one of those before from what I recall, but that's not what I'm looking for. I'm just curious about the Malfoy and Weasley feud at the moment.
