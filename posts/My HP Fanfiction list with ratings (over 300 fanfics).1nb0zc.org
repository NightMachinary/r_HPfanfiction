** A few points about this list

- I suggest you download the file instead of viewing it online. Google's viewer doesn't let you see it properly as it is quite a large spreadsheet.
- Not all The fanfics have a rating as I haven't read them all.
- You can download all the fanfics [[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B04ZGZ126GXVenkzd2lGTEliR1U/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. (136MB)
- Let me know if I need to edit anything in it

Enjoy

*** If you go to 'view' on the menu, you can click "fit page to screen width' and it becomes a whole lot more readable.

Thanks very much for the list!

*** Sorry about that. I never quite got on board with the "Snape adopts Harry" fics or even worse, a Hermione/Snape one (I did read one quite a few years ago that started "normally", and then suddenly the author decided to make it all about Hermione and Snape...it rather freaked me out)

**** I felt that way about Snape and Hermione but then I realized why Snape would lover her; she would remind him of lily. That bright, starry eyed gryffindor from all those years ago.

** I would like to submit for your reading 2 things that you have yet to enjoy.

First, I saw that you haven't read the Re- series by Regulus, but it was on there. You should seriously check it out. Like 9 books or something now? It's really damn good.

Second, Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent (and sequels) by Barb wasn't on there as far as I saw. They're pretty good.

Good list though- reminded me of a lot of old fics I haven't read in a decade or so. I'm just happy that the abortion of literature that 14 year old me called good writing was nowhere to be seen!

*** I last read most of the stories 5 or more years ago and honestly can't remember too much. I think my criteria (if you can even call it that) for the ratings was basically how much I looked forward to continuing to read it after I stopped for the day. If/when I ever get down to re-reading them, I'll be sure to keep this in mind.
