** The Stealing Harry ‘verse by Copperbadge might fit the bill. Haven't read it in ages, though. From memory it is Remus/Sirius.

Do you know Good Omens?

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) fits pretty well, it's pretty similar plot to canon but Sirius raises Harry. The first book pre Hogwarts is very original though. So far the story is up to fourth year and updated frequently.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkffn(living with danger)

this is 5 books long and around 2.5million words total

It's Remus saving him first but Sirius comes along and they raise him together with their wives and a couple of other children from the series (no spoilers). It's really good from memory although the description that's about to be linked is a bit cringe and definitely not the original one haha.
