So i've read this book in FFN by Tsume Yuki (10610076) And It''s really good. I was wondering if you've read anything similar to it? (It's a story about Harry being the master of Death and reborn as Turais Black, brother to Sirius and Regulus)

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
