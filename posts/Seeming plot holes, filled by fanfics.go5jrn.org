I remember a couple of different fanfics that take weird plot elements from the book and give them different explanations.

For example, all the way back in the first book, when the Weasleys arrive at King's Cross station, and Mrs. Weasley is speaking rather loudly about “Muggles” and “Platform 9 3/4” drawing Harry's attention. It's a very odd thing for her to do, as she has been there every year for at least a decade(A Weasley has been attending Hogwarts since Bill started, and that streak didn't end until Ginny graduated), and that's not even counting when she attended herself. She's have to be a complete idiot to not remember.

I typically see two interpretations of this

- Most commonly, I see it interpreted as a scheme encouraged by Dumbledore to ensure that Harry Potter falls in with the Weasleys, a family loyal to him, and a violation of the Statute of Secrecy

- Less commonly, I see it written as Molly assisting the incoming muggleborn first years, casting a /Notice Me Not/ charm so the muggles don't notice what she's saying, then speaking loudly about the platform so that the incoming first years notice her, and end up following her example

- I rather wonder if Rowling originally intended there to be multiple wizarding platforms at King's Cross and dropped the idea before ever getting to revisit it. That would explain why Molly could be confused, if the platform changes, like the previous year, the platform at 9 and ^{3} /4 was where people could catch a train to Hawaii, and the Hogwarts Express was on 1 and ^{1} /8

What are some other “plot holes” that are filled in rather well by fanon?


** Apparently no fanfic authors and readers are parents (yet). For me, it has been always just a desperate way how to make children busy with something else than misbehaving. How many times I have created fake questions for my own kids to distract them from some naughtiness!

** Not sure it's an actual plot hole or just items that aren't fleshed out that allow for alternate interpretations. For instance, in Harry's 2nd year why didn't Dumbledore announce that Harry was not the Heir of Slytherin or in his 4th year, Once Dumbledore was convinced that Harry didn't enter himself in the tournament Why didn't Dumbledore make an announcement at a mandatory dinner where he states that harry didn't enter himself or ask anyone to enter him and he was being forced to compete against his will. And even if he didn't do that why didn't he and the teachers do more to stop the bullying, claims of cheating, potter stinks buttons etc.

By leaving harry alone to deal with the bullying in those two years leads one to question why. Now in my reading of canon I see Dumbledore as a manipulative old man. Now depending on my mood I see either a good intentions, rose colored glasses wearing manipulative dumbledore all the way out to an evil-minded, sob, manipulative Dumbledore.

IMO it is quite easy to read canon and find support for that entire gamut of "who" Dumbledore is by his actions. And remember it's your actions that count more than your words. And Dumbledore's actions in canon leave you a lot of flexibility to question.

So using the examples of 2nd and 4th year you could easily propose that because Dumbledore believes the best of everyone he couldn't really believe anyone would be that harsh in their criticisms and therefore he doesn't understand how painful it is to Harry. Also you could see how Dumbledore believes that if Harry really didn't like what was happening he would complain. Whereas, with the teachers being present when this happens harry may have expected the teachers to fix the issue and when they don't harry figures its not worth it to complain. So Dumbledore's actions are "explained" away more due to naivety than intentional.

Of course, you could use those same two examples and arrive at the opinion that the reason Dumbledore didn't step in or have the other teachers step in is because he wanted Harry to be beat down and isolated because a depressed, isolated Harry fits into his "evil" plan.

So what fanfics do is find the discrepancies in the stories and develop their own rationales for why those actions occur. And because JKR wrote children's books there is a lot of items that is either not addressed at all or only vaguely addressed leaving lots of room for fanfics to tackle.

*** He probably just didn't know it was happening. It was mostly just some kids whispering and pointing after all. The guy's not omniscient. It probably all comes down to the students hiding it from the teachers. Every school has this kind of stuff that the teachers don't know about.

Kids bullying each other isn't a HP-exclusive thing. Even good, observant teachers are going to miss stuff or be literally unable to know. I doubt people were throwing shit at Harry's head in the Great Hall, for example.

***** It was only really out in the open in the dungeons, where Snape is the teacher, and that really shouldn't count against the other teachers in general.

Malfoy even shows a way for the bullies to get out of trouble by having the badges be able to read /Support Cedric Diggory: The True Hogwarts Champion/ which is petty, but a far cry from /Potter Stinks./

*** Dumbledore making that sort of announcement would have only made things worse, because the students who were upset wouldn't believe it, they'd see it as favoritism.

As for the teachers not cracking down, it was the 1990s. Bullying that wasn't physical beatings in school was pretty universally underaddressed.

**** As far as the announcement we'll have to agree to disagree. It wouldn't change most of Slytherin but I believe many of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs may have changed their minds especially if Harry then swore an oath on his magic or agreed to take Veritserum. Those are two things that exist in canon that could have been used to prove that harry didn't enter the tournament.

This is a completely fanon concept. It isn't an actual thing.

#+begin_quote
  agreed to take Veritserum
#+end_quote

Vertiserum has side effects and is rare, using it for this would be silly. It also wouldn't get the Hufflepuffs on his side, they'd still be rooting for Cedric and against him. Ravenclaws would still be divided. The heart of that issue is the competition, not the lie. There can only be one champion in the end.

The only people who really cared if he put his name in or not were Ron and Dumbledore, and they both come around to believing him.

****** Yeah got mixed up with the unbreakable vow.

And there were a lot more folks than ron giving harry serious grief about being in the tournament. Basically it really was just him and hermione against the world. At least if something was done even though harry was still competing they would know he didn't want to be there and that should cause a lot of the vitriol to be reduced.

And while i expect the Hufflepuffs to still support cedric i believe the bullying, potter stinks buttons etc wouldn't be used as much by anyone other than Slytherin.

******* You seriously overestimate how much people actually listen to teachers about stuff like that. Why does Dumbledore saying Harry doesn't want to compete change anything? If Harry needs to do anything regarding the unbreakable vow to prove to the school he isn't lying, then they won't bother. Seriously, it's not the biggest issue on the teachers minds. And it all pretty much resolved itself by the first task, and like others have said: if there wasn't physical harm to the student, then the teachers let it go.

*** The Marauder-era is rampant with bullying between Gryffindor and Slytherins (with Slytherins bullying Muggleborns and the Marauders bullying Severus -- and I highly doubt this was isolated cases), and it didn't seem like much was being done there either.

Dumbledore and the teachers being hands-off with the harassment Harry goes through isn't exactly new to them. And this is something that happens in real life too -- teachers can only do so much to prevent things from escalating. Especially in a school as large as Hogwarts.

However, bottomline is I like the fics that come up with some rationale and appropriate actions to limit/reduce the bullying etc.

** Other platforms are canon, that was on JKR's old website.

"In choosing the number of the concealed platform that would take young witches and wizards to boarding school, I decided that it would have to be a number between those of the Muggle platforms -- therefore, it was clearly a fraction. This raised the interesting question of how many other fractional platforms lay between the whole-numbered platforms at King's Cross, and I concluded that were probably quite a few. Although these are never mentioned in the book, I like to think that it is possible to take a version of the Orient Express off to wizard-only villages in continental Europe (try platform seven and a half), and that other platforms may be opened on an as-required-basis, for instance for large, one-off events such as Celestina Warbeck concerts (see your ticket for details)."

** The author of "Albus and Harry's World Trip" seems to take a delight in taking common negative interpretations of events and presenting them with a logical reasoning that puts them in a better light.

Pretty sure I remember it addressing Molly yelling out "Muggles!" and "9 3/4" after the fact, but also covering Snape's occlumency lessons before the fact.
