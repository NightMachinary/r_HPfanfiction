I'm not sure if it was a time travel fic or not but it was in first year. Harry saved Hermione from troll, Ron was either standing there doing nothing or not there at all. Later that night Hermione came in to the boys dormitory and get in Harry's bed and told him now she owes him a life debt. I don't remember much from there.

  When Harry Potter rescued Hermione Granger from the troll, he didn't expect it to complete a ritual that would give him a real family. Hermione Granger, on the other hand, was doomed to loudly regret that rescue laboring under much pain the next July.
