Anyone aware of a fic where Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to allow someone else closure.

Specifically Snape to talk to Lily or Teddy to talk to Remus/Tonks, but possibly interested in other variations.


** Stepping Back linkffn(12317784)

If you don't mind waiting until the epilogue, Albus and Aberforth speak to Ariana.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** Thanks so much! (And thanks for letting me know it was in the epilogue. That saved me a lot of searching.) That scene was just the type I was looking for.

***** I'm debating it. The things I read seemed interesting enough. The Harry/Bella is what I haven't decided on yet.

****** As far as Harry/Bella stories go, this is probably one of the easiest to read for people who aren't actually into that pairing. Because it's a time travel fic, and while there is quite a few character traits careful held over, the character is quite different to canon Bellatrix as they basically aren't grown up yet when we meet her. Its definitely Bellatrix, and that shows up HARD partway through, but it's easier to stomach than straight up pure Harry/Bella.

******** Glad to be of assistance. If you end up liking it, that author also has an ongoing Harry/Tonks with a living potters WBWL angle, manipulative (but not evil, I think, it's been a while) Dumbledore and, heir Black thing going on. And a Harry/Daphne with a good Dumbledore and a strong/smart Harry. All three feature Arcturus Black XD as you can no doubt tell from their user name, they quite like the Blacks.

All very well written stories

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
