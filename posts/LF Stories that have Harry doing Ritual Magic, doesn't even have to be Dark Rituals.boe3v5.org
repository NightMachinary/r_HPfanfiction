  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

** Linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) has some ritual stuff (not a lot and nothing morally ambiguous, just something that takes a lot of magic and is easier to do with a ritual), albeit not a lot, and, fair warning, it's a deadfic that, surprise surprise, ended on a cliffhanger.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione doing spellcrafting and eventually also creating powerful borderline dark rituals from scratch.

Can't say Voldemort? Let's create a ritual to stop us from accidentally saying it!

Horcrux in the scar? Let's create a ritual to extract it!

That didn't work? Let's extract your soul instead, kill the Horcrux, and put your soul back in! Believe me, it'll work this time!

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
