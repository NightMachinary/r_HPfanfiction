** It's canon that Harry has a big pile of galleons in his vault. It's not clear exactly how rich he is compared to other families like the Malfoys, but he definitely inherited a decent amount of money. A few hundred thousand galleons seems like a reasonable amount for him to have--a good nest egg, but not oligarch-rich.

*** I'm not sure why but I've always thought that 60,000 was a reasonable amount, It could reach the hundred thousand mark after inheriting from Sirius.

**** If you go by the movies, 60,000 is a good guess--someone did some calculations estimating the volume of the stack of galleons, and it came out to a bit over 50,000: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4486n1/so_how_rich_was_actually_harry_potter_i_did_some/]]

** I am writting something where he has 600k but what you need to do is explain where it all came from other than just the Potters are filthy rich. In this story Godrics Hollow is purchased as a historical monument, his grandparents house was sold after they died by James and half wemt to a vault, the other half purchasing Godrics Hollow. Harry gets royalties from Harry Potter books and figurines and other places his name is used. Harry's grandfathers hair product business Sleek Eazy still pays him well and filled up his vault. Dumbledore isn't a prick and actually managed his money well, not investing it in anything but making sure Harry wasn't ripped off by people taking advantage of him being a one year old orphan that's the most famous kid in the country. Unfortunately he buys a massive plot of land in France after ditching England after second year.

** This is the approach I took in Victoria Potter:

Basically around 60k galleons, which translates to around £1.5 million. I felt that was enough to be comfortably rich without being absurdly wealthy.

A few other notes:

- Generally speaking, I imagine wizards have lower routine expenses than Muggles, especially established families with a large family home, some livestock, their own vegetable patch etc. I depict Mr Bones as working a few hours a week, cash in hand type jobs, and largely living off that income without touching his Gringotts vault.

- Generally speaking, I do not picture the wizarding economy as being large enough to generate wealth of the kind which exists in the Muggle world. Crucially, without a modern banking system in which banks create new money, the money supply will be relatively static and inflationary pressures low. So I see the value of the galleon as quite stable over time.

- As an exception to the above, I picture some wizards as having Aladdin's cave style mountains of gold and treasure.

- I imagine that the exchange of Galleons for pounds is highly regulated, and something which was set-up to facilitate the entry of Muggleborns into the wizarding world. I don't see it as a large scale FX market. I doubt you could exchange thousands of galleons into pounds or vice versa.

*** That's very detailed. 60,000 is the figure I always think up as well. When Harry has hundreds of millions and investments in apple and Sony it makes me sigh in frustration.

*** Magic affords bare necessities easily. Food, shelter, and the time to maintain them are worlds easier to facilitate with magic. The Weasleys got by with a single breadwinner, not that Molly didn't or couldn't have any side-gigs. They seemed poor, but had a house with a lot of land surrounding it and certainly weren't starving.

And yeah, any reasonably constructed world would account for the galleons to cash thing, be it a cap on exchange amount or the goblins themselves being involved in the Muggle markets to incorporate their own exchange rates.

**** The Weasleys were also... well. They win a cash prize and blow it on a trip, while their youngest son has to get by on his /older brother's wand/, an instrument so delicate and temperamental the wrong one in the hands of an untrained child would blow things up.

Harry describes the wrong wands as "just wood" or "cold and lifeless", and while Charlie's wand may have been more amicable to Ron because of various factors, it wasn't /his/. He basically cast with an inert stick, not a proper focus, so it's a wonder he can even do spells in the first place.

*** Yh, the wizarding world has no speculation or financial markets, from what we can see in cannon. It's just piles of gold in vaults.

** Deus Ex Goblina strikes again. When the plot can only move forward by going to Gringotts and seeing Harry owns 40 properties and have 7 vaults with 60 million galleons in each. I have no idea when it started but I've been seeing it a lot recently in the fics I was reading.

Reasonably Harry's family lived in Godrics Hollow, which can only be presumed to be the family home. They don't have Malfoy level money, but they're better off than the Weasleys. We know there could be some royalties from Sleekeazy's Hair Potion. We know when James' parent's died he inherited a sizeable fortune and he could support his family without working but he also supported Remus too. So I would guess hundreds of thousands if not a million galleons.
