lately when I'm searching for fics, I have to actively search for fics that don't have Ron bashing because I get so annoyed when I start a fics that looks promising, and there's ronbashing! Out of no where! I'm surprised people are still Ron bashing and I really don't understand why!


** It's part of a trend that a lot of people think is the norm which technically it is but shouldn't. Most of them are just a plain crackish Ron that is just there to oppose Harry. Sometimes doesn't even do much for the plot except be annoying. Because people coming into the fandom are hit with these fics, some opinions change and are influenced by the influx of all these Ron bashings. It's not like all of them are bad but sometimes I just wish some of their Ron's would die off already because he didn't do anything for the story and was just so distracting with it's general annoying personalities.

**** It's hard to ignore one of the main characters of the story, but I totally agree that the bashing is excessive and makes no sense. Especially when they write the main antagonist (malfoy) as someone with depth and being the "sort of good guy" üôÑ I trully believe that people who bash Ron have only watched the movies, because in there Ron has much less depth and is just a jealous goofball

I guess it's a combination of:

he did do things canonically that you can genuinely judge him over, and which people get hung up over.

the movies differed from the books in a way that made ron worse, such giving his smart lines to hermione and giving hagrid's anti-slytherin bias to him.

this flanderised, negative version of ron is seen/used so much in fics that it has essentially replaced canon-ron in a lot of peoples minds, so ron is, if not bashed, written as a worse person than he actually was in canon, simply because that's what people think he is.

**** It's pretty easy to ask for a judging/bashing fic on Hermione on here - it'd be harder to ask for a Ron-bashing one (or at least, it's harder to find a recommendation thread asking specifically for that). There are plenty of posts that bash on Hermione too, particularly in her relationship with Ron - though, of course, as a reaction/pushback to other fanfic communities outside of this one's portrayal.

Ron-bashing fics are easiest to find in the wild, of course. But his canonical actions stick in people's mind most clearly because they're the least logically justifiable (they're very /emotionally/ justifiable, of course). For instance, the split in 4th year is very memorable for how much it affected Harry, and for Ron being just /wrong/ there - by comparison, most of Hermione's conflicts with Harry in the earlier books are more logical/justified in nature, and affects him less (because Ron is a more important friend to Harry in canon, IMO).

The focus a lot of fanfics have on making Harry more competent also run counter to the canon influence Ron has on him - which is an emotional anchor/normal life (they both do this, but in terms of the trio, Hermione is more the one pulling towards studying/practicing at all times, and Ron is more towards skivving off and having some fun). And so, instead of doing the same thing to Ron and Harry (the proper approach), some take the easy approach of just dismissing Ron and blaming him for Harry not taking things seriously in canon.

It's terrible, obviously, and makes it very difficult to read fics that involve it - but I can see where it comes from in canon and why it's more prevalent than Harry/Hermione dislike (in the general fandom - not on this subreddit of course)

*** It's easy - it's because it's the easy/lazy option.

Since Hermione canonically ends up with Ron (which I dislike myself, but it does happen) - authors feel the need to not remove that entirely. So they throw in that relationship, but still want it to end in Harmony - and the easiest way for that is to bash Ron heavily, so that relationship instantly ends.

It's lazy, it's bad, it's not fun to read. Harmony makes a lot of sense as a pairing, if you're into that - but the way to achieve it in a satisfying way isn't to bash Ron. You don't /need/ to include the Ron/Hermione relationship if you don't want it to end that way. You don't /need/ to bash Ron to have them be incompatible and drift apart romantically.

The most glaring version of this I saw was a fic where Ron was bashed just in the middle - where he turned into the biggest asshole in the world for a few chapters so that Hermione would break up with him, and then in the last chapter basically returned to normal. ><

Thank you! I don't understand this trend of bashing one character in a relationship just because you want their love interest to end up with someone else. I read that Bill is often written into an abusive boyfriend/husband to have Fleur end up with Harry. And of course the same with Ron. I just--why can't it just be an amicable split? Or, you know, just rewrite canon so they were never in a relationship in the first place. But I guess that's just too much work for these writers.

  Between school, the war and its aftermath, Hermione hasn't had much time to connect with her family. A family wedding seemed a good of time as any to introduce her family to her boyfriend and her best friend. But when her parents invite her out for tea in the days that followed, Hermione is woefully unprepared for their opinions on who she's better suited for.

** This is the one subculture in HP fanfiction that drives me up the wall!

I am not immediately drawn away from bashing because on occasion it can be executed with excellent world building which rationalizes their reactions brilliantly. Fanfiction authors seem to forget that the audience doesn't have to like a character for them to be compelling.

Having said that, the bashing of Ron is often so unnecessary especially when he canonically played such a pivotal role in Harry's development. Luckily, I find this genre decently easy to filter out as it is usually accompanied with other terrible troupes.

Also if you call Ron lazy, then Harry should be worse in your eyes, since he actually puts less effort into things. But since you've obviously not paid attention to the actual text, and probably think the movies were good adaptations well... You'll grow up. Eventually.

********** As for being a bad influence, he encouraged harry to be lazy and slack off like he did. Ignoring the part where he had the most powerful psychopath since grindewald after him and should be training to fight him, or at least survive him.

To be fair, a similar, though somewhat weaker argument can be made against hermione. That her constant nagging put him off from actually applying himself.

It's a fairly common point made in stories that either have harry making a clean break from the both of them or for ones where he doesn't befriend them to begin with.

As for warping my view, it might be possible, but again I really didn't care for book 7. Even more so than HBP, which I read at least 4 or 5 times. Probably read the first five books at least a dozen times each over the years. Definitely more than that for PoA and GoF.

** I made an argument somewhere else that a lot of authors tend to bash him as an easy way to get rid of the character - sometimes bashing is just bashing, but occasionally?

Say they wanted to write a story starting about third year or fourth year, but wanted to change the story to not have him in it - bashing his character is a very easy way to end the friendship of the previous years without taking away or rewriting everything that had happened up to that point.

Read a story yesterday, Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift, which is a Harmony 6th year fic that portrays probably the most realistic way everyone might have reacted. Everything isn't immediately great between the trio, but neither is 6 years of friendship just ignored and thrown away.
