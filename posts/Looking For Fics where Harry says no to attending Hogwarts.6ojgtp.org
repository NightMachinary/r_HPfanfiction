I recall one such story being where he learns of magic at the age of 6 by exploring his magical core and learns wandless magic, opts out of going to Hogwarts in favor of Durmstrang Academy. Can't remember the name or author though..

Any similar stories would be a weclome change to all of the GodLikeHarry! fics I've binged this week


** Linkffn(Escapologist harry) has him saying "Don't wanna", not that Dumbledore cares. It's a one shot crack fic that's rather funny, give it a whirl.

  Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]])

He actually is rejected by Hogwarts in this one, but is probably what you're looking for in a lot of ways.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** This isn't Harry saying no to Hogwarts, but it is Harry being raised in the Muggle world after the Dursleys say no on his behalf.

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.

  What if the Dursley family had taken the more practical route of treating Harry kindly in order to keep him away from magic? What if it worked? What if he wants nothing to do with the wizarding world and Dumbledore has to solve his own problems for once?
