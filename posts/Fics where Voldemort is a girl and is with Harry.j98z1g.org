*** Bwoah, I read more weird shit in Xianxa webnovel genre. I think it looks weird because Canonically Harry is still a teenager. Fast forward a decade into a story where Voldemort (firstly is sane) decides to slowly take power as all her powers base is close to the ministry of magic High up in 1995, and you can get a 30 year old harry banging a 100 years old ageless Cougarmort.

I know you need to sketch a ducking lot to get there but people write whatever they want, at least it still is less weird that the fem!harry fictions where Riddle bangs her when she is just 15.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

*** Gonna leave this comment for posterity.

First of all, this fic is /creepy/. And not in a good way. There was nothing compelling about the story, just a slow simmer of nausea growing as I read. The only thing that kept me going was curiosity about the ending and the general lack of Harry/female Tom stories.

Harry is characterized almost as a complete buffoon. Literally a simpleton.

Like 40% of the story is unnecessary exposition and could be cut with no real difference to the "plot". /Purple/ exposition at that, full of flowery adverbs and thesaurus-inspired descriptions.

Finally, in the story tags you get: *Rape/Non-con Elements*. It's not elements bruh. From the moment the "smut" starts to the end of the story, it's straight up *RAPE*. One rape after another. Either by coercion, potions, threat of violence or what have you. If the genders were flipped I doubt this would have 1/10 of the kudos or comments.

To sum up, I award this story no points, and may god have mercy on the author's soul.

  Riddle says hello.

  A jolt goes through Harry, and he drops his book, attracting the attention of nearby students. He finds Riddle standing a hair's breadth away, grazing his legs with her skirt, and recoils in shock. She tilts her head with an inscrutable smile and a wicked gleam in her eye, and he flushes in embarrassment. Blah blah blah, three paragraphs of introspection and sweating.

  Harry finally asks her what she wants.

  Her eyes narrow as if he just told the most amusing joke, and his breath hitches as he feels as if she's peering right into his soul. Blah blah blah, four more paragraphs of dramatic body language descriptions until she speaks again... and I realize I'm 2,000 words into the chapter and so far they literally just exchanged two lines of dialogue.
