So we know that in the books,there are some wards that make muggles remember things that distract them from going to that area.What if a muggle realises that he remembers things from a particular area all of the time and abuses it by going there everytime? Are there any fics that have a muggle do this thing?


** That's clever. But I always assumed the things they were suddenly remembering weren't actually correct, i.e. they are suddenly made to think an appointment for tomorrow was today, or they think they forgot to do something they'd done already.

*** I thought it was more like a vague sense of needing to be somewhere or wanting to go home that would get stronger and stronger until they remember some task that was in the back of their mind but now it seems urgent, like 'oh no I need to vacuum the floor'. So when they get home they might wonder why they were so worried about it, and then forget about it because it doesn't matter.

**** The spell is referred to as a Muggle Repelling Charm which seems pretty specific. :P They don't remember actual things necessarily, they just get an overwhelming idea that they need to be somewhere else instead.

**** True, but it's not so likely that everyone who runs into that charm happens to have already forgotten something important they need to do just then.

Maybe someone could write how a muggle uses it by tricking others into passing through the charm. How far ahead could someone get with the power to make others late/distracted?

** There is a fic where muggle police officers figure out where diagon alley is. They're investigating some murders, and essentially bullrush past the notice me not charm on the leaky cauldron, wait for someone to open the portal to the alley, then go inside and but an armful of books. They were wearing the worst wizard cosplay of all time--I'm pretty sure one of them was wearing a pointed wizard hat covered in sequined stars--but I can't remember the name of the fic.

*** I remember this! There was this one woman who got alarmed when hidden police reports on an incident, I think in Little Whinging didn't match her memories. Although now I realise I don't remember anything else about it, but it was fun.

****** Really?! This weird muggle police subplot exists in the D&D crossover fic? Man, no wonder I didn't remember . . .

Great fic. Loved it, loved Milo, one of the funniest fics ever if you love D&D, as I do, and a really great fic even if you're not a dungeonhead. I remember loving Bellatrix as a villain.

****** Holy crap. No wonder I couldn't find the fic. It's stored in a whole different place in my brain to the rest of the story. I mean, I *loved* HP&tN20, but... well, if I've forgotten it that thoroughly, obviously it's time to go and read it all again...

******* Yeah, Fiona's storyline is so well done and memorable, but at the same time doesn't have much in the way of DnD references. It also probably doesn't help that last time I read it the story lines were still fairly separate.
