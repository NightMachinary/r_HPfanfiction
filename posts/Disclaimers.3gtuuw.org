Most stories I read have some form on disclaimers, from simple 'I'm not JRK' to a full on legal style paragraph. I've never written a disclaimer on any of my fanfics and have never suffered any penalty or cessation notice.

Further thoughts, JKR herself has said she supports fanfics, so thus negating the need for a disclaimer?


** From what I gather it's just generally seen as polite but has no legal standing.

** They're traditional by now... Here's a good article on them: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDoNotOwn]]

*** A great article and pretty amusing too. I shall continue to not bother writing a disclaimer then.

This discussion has been had repeatedly. The consensus is it is not necessary but up to your discretion.
