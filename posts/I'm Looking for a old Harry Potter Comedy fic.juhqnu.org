:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is what I remember:

Harry traveling to different places getting mistaken as a pro hit wizard? that just goes by the name 'Black'? I think. Maybe James Black?

I know there's this one part where he's on a balcony from a hotel room and Voldemort sends a bunch of Death Eaters to his location and they appear right in front of him and then fall to their deaths, Harry is given credit for it too, as Mr.Black.

I think there's this a mad doctor character and his female assistant that invent things? Maybe, I'm not sure, might be mixing up stories.

Also at some point the auror's that are following Harry, different people for every new travel spot, at one point think that 'Mr. Black' was able to 'satisfy' 10 (or just a lot of) veela (doesn't happen but they think it did) and I think made a statue was made in his honor, Harry doesn't know of any of this and that's the running joke for the whole fic.

This is a old completed fic that I know was once on FanFiction, I just can't find the dang thing!

Does anyone know the name or author from just this?

Please Help! Thank you!


** That's part of the Mr Black series by Rorschach's Blot. The first story is called Make A Wish

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
