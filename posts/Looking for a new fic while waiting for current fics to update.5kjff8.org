Hi everyone. Hope you had get great holiday. Here's my problem, I have a great list of fics that I am currently reading that are being updated regularly(if any of the authors are reading this, thank you for your speedy update) but I'm all caught up. So what I'm looking for is some good complete fics. Now here's my list of do's and don'ts. Do, complete(obviously), action, comedy or light romance. Any of those 3 or all 3 together doesn't matter. Crossovers are welcome. Just really looking for a couple good stories to read while I wait. Now the don'ts this is a short list. No slash (just not my thing) and that's really it. Now bring it on and hit me with your best fics. Thanks ahead of time.
