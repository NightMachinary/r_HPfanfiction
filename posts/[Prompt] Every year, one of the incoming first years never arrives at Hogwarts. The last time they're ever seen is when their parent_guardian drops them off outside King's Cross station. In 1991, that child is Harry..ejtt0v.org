** A tribute is to be paid to lady magic. Every year a child is sacrificed so that the others can keep their power. The practice is long forgotten but the promise once given still holds. A child is picked at random but Harry Potter is bound to life by the horcrux that is embedded in his scar. Existing as a wraith for years Harry Potter learns and sees but never arrives in Hogwarts. No one keeps Voldemort from stealing the Philosophers stone and therfor from regaining a body. Hearing rumours about a wraith roaming the lands, Voldemort looks for it, in hope to meet another Powerful Wizard who once had a horcrux and met the same fate as him. Not knowing who the other one is, Harry and Voldemort form a truce. A body for the knowledge of what happened in the night in Godric's hollow.

Edit: If someone wants to write it feel free, but I'm occupied with my own fanfic atm

****** I don't really think she would change that much. She still would have read about Dumbledore vs Grindelwald and other heroic efforts throughout the past few hundred years. I don't think Harry was the reason she admired bravery. In fact, the tale of baby Harry isn't so much bravery inspiring and had the opposite effect on the Wizarding world. When a few dozen people can bring an entire nation to its knees, it shows that no one was really emboldened by it.

** What if: once every year for one second the barriers to the station malfunction. Like the floo, the wall and other entry points are all one barrier. And it just happens that one student is caught up on that. The barriers create then an illusion of what should have happened to the child, but in reality the child is transported to another dimension or another school.

*** tbh, I think it depends on how the adults who actually notice handle it. I specifically said last seen when they're /dropped off/, because I'm thinking it's mostly kids like Harry whose guardians aren't actually decent enough to go all the way into the station with them. I was also thinking that 9 times out of 10 it's going to be a Muggleborn.

That means that unless some older student is expecting this specific eleven year old on the train, the kid won't be noticed as missing until McGonagall calls their name during the sorting ceremony. They're not going to want to make a big deal of it right then, in front of all the students, so it probably gets waved off and the vast majority think it's just someone who changed their mind about attending Hogwarts.

I would expect the school to contact the parents at that point, to confirm that it is a change of decision, and only then do they realise something's actually wrong. It's still going to be kept quiet from the school, to avoid raising a panic, and if it was a Muggleborn then the matter may very well be refered to the police rather than wizarding authorities, especially if they belive the kid went missing on the Muggle side of the station. In any case, we're looking at probably a minimum of seven hours, likely more, before anyone really starts looking for this kid.

I do think the teachers would be made aware and be concerned when it becomes a noticeable pattern, and perhaps they do inform the wizarding authorities, but I think there's little they could do. Include a line in the Hogwarts letters strongly advising parents to see their children all the way to the train; maybe get some guards working in and around the station on 1st September; but it could still go on for a long time before it gets turned into a publically known issue.

**** It seems pretty ridiculous that there's so few adults riding the Hogwarts Express. We have the candy cart witch, the conductor, and one year Remus Lupin (why is he the only new teacher to take the train?). Like, Harry has a ticket for some reason, but nobody ever asks to see it. What if some younger sibling just snuck aboard? And then the time when a couple of twelve year olds just didn't make it to the train. Why isn't there someone systematically checking who's actually on the train before it leaves, and forwarding any discrepancies to someone in charge?
