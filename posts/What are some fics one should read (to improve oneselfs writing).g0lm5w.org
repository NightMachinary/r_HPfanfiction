Oneshots, character studies, or longer fics, and fics with OC's. Idc.

Give me all your fics that managed to wow you and and have you grasp for more. The stories that are brilliant and unique in their own way (even if they are unknown or if they have cliché tropes). Be it through the depiction of the human interactions & relationships in them, the portrayal of characters (canon, oc and ooc) and character growth, worldbuilding, plot or style of writing. Give me fics that inspire.


** I always liked =In Fates Debt= because it takes such a common trope (the do-over) and removes all foreknowledge, while twisting events enough to prevent a simple re-do. Plus I love the pairing.

  Waking up in a hero's body is one thing, being a hero is another. SI, where Peter Parker's body is taken over and the new owner realizes the world needs a hero, it needs a Spider-man. Fully using Peter's genius, the new Spider-man finds a balance between being a hero and a teenager. Will include MCEU and more. REVIEWS!

** Stephen King's On Writing really helped me...there are some fics that would probably be good for this, such as Mirror of Maybe(sadly, abandoned but I've read this so many times), and for world building Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild.

** This isn't what you're looking for, but if you really want something to improve your writing then don't go looking in Fanfiction. Even good fanfics are a copy of someone else's better original work. Trust me, I've been writing fanfiction for almost 15 years. It's a trap. Instead pick up a typical 100 must reads book list. Explore original ideas and break out of the fanfic trap.

*** Authors of books are just that because they are good at what they do and in comparison, books in general are of a better writing quality than fanfic. I am reading a lot of books and fanfictions as well, but I have found that there are also many fanfics that are better than the average book out there. Of course the technicality of writing might be better explored by reading books. Classicals are just that because they are outstanding works of brilliant authors.

But there are so many good fanfics out there that are original and unique in their own right and I think they deserve to be acknowledged. There are of course a lot of fanfics that are copies of a work with a twist, or a new pairing or the same trope once again, and there are good ones and bad ones.

But there are also pieces that are well written with original content and well researched topics. There are fanfic writers who have the potential to publish Novels of better quality than what is out there.

I am looking for good pieces of writing and stories that inspire and are unique. I can do that by reading books but I can also do that by reading fanfics. The writing style of people is very different and as long as someone doesn't warm up the same plot with minor differences, does that make a difference in looking at how a person portayed characters or described surroundings and sceneries and wrote a plot - be it book or fanfic?

I think fanfiction is often viewed as inferior to books and I think that is wrong. There is bad fanfiction - a lot of it - but there are also books with shallow writing and clichè plotlines that are just another copy of something else with different names attached. Alone a huge chunk of books marketed at young girls involve a 16 year old teenage girl who discovers that she is somewhat special and then meets a mysterious boy who will pull her into his world.

I agree that the classicals in the book world are something to take note of and I am doing my best to read all the books I got on my must-read list, but I think there are also fanfics from which we can learn something. And worst case scenario I still get a good read out of it.

** I can only agree with the before mentioned Prince of Slytherin recommendation.

Aside from that, I can highly recommend anything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence][TheBlack'sResurgence]], as he is, at least in my opinion, probably among the best FanFiction Authors out there. He really manages to create Villains who are actually dangerous and proper opponents. He also handles character growth really well. Honour Thy Blood ( linkffn(12155794) ) and Stepping Back ( linkffn(12317784) ) are among my all-time favourite fanfics, as they handle a multitude of the mentioned characteristics really well. (aside from Characters and Relationships the worldbuilding through Politics is also portrayed believably.)

Both Letters ( linkffn(6535391) ) and A Cadmean Victory ( linkffn(11446957) ) are really good examples of Relationship building as well as character progression. I really liked both fanfics and I feel like they are if you are interested in writing any form of romance, especially Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour, must read's.

Lastly I can recommend a writer who is a little under the radar, who I backed up on this site quite a few times already, going by the name of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9153648/][OfMiceAndLice]]. He is, in my opinion, a good example of writers growth. He kept a few of his older stories up, namely those he wrote 2017, which are absolute shite. In 2018 he put up a story which was a lot better but still not really good. But the last two he uploaded, namely Bound Through History ( linkffn(13326859) ) which is a really good example of who to handle certain aspects of OC's and how to write them, as there is a large amount of OC's present in the story he seemingly experimented with that there. And his most recent (and probably so far best) story /The Son of Grindelwald (/ linkffn(13398928) ) where he noticeably matured as a writer, creating a good base for an interesting story, even though it feels a little like the relationships between the characters had taken their toll here, but most importantly he manages to describe the scenery rather well. He has the ability to create a picture in your mind of what he imagines the scenery to look like.

Out of all of them, OfMiceAndLice is probably the least preferable example of all that, and more like a really good way to show how you can mature as a writer. The other's, meaning TBR, TE7 and DaEn are all better examples on how to orient yourself to become a better writer.\\
But if you really want to improve as a writer, stop reading fanfiction. You'll suffer greatly from that. I recommend taking a look at some classic novels, as for example Harry Potter. Re-reading the original books often improves ones touch to the world, allowing you to view the writing process from a different angle.

I also recommend following the advice of the author of Antitheses: Oceanbreeze7, who said on this very site the following in the comment section of one of the posts:

"[...] When it started to get so much traffic and people left such heartwarming comments, it inspired me to write...better? I actually started to listen to podcasts and watch lectures from writers, trying to incorporate better style and ideas. [...] I thought that by dragging the main character through hell and back, various people and readers who experienced tiny life circumstances could find themselves in the story. [...]"

Hope I helped you a little bit in your ever fruitful quest to become a better writer.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Pick fics with simple one shot concepts.

See how a simple idea is conveyed well and really jot out what was good about it. Not only how it differentiates from others but also why you liked it.

Shifting perception fics are some of my personal favorites because they focus on a storyline I know but are written in a style that is evocative of a character I am not used to reading. They are done well when they feel different. Jot down the points where the difference is actually conveyed. Look into how authors convey different point of view characters in how they perceive and interact with the world.

Emotions change perspectives. Use your own input on how a character in a short one shot would view the scene using a different lense of emotion.

Really plan out how a character would view or interact in situations.

Longer fics allow for more nuance and hypocrisy, as well as growth But keeping it simple forces you to have a clearer target.

I read a lot of asoiaf fanfiction. One of its mainstays is shifting povs. Making or breaking a good asoiaf story is being invested on behalf of each character. The unreliable narrator is also a common trope their as situations can be interpreted through the eye of the pov.

A common problem in HP fanfiction is making the main character too intelligent, too observant. Characters should have blindspots and hangups and you should keep a semi record of what those might be and try to find them in other fictional characters.

Harry is the pov for the HP books and frankly despite being the protagonist can be extremely passive as a participant in his world. Looking to shift how the story is written will require you to explore the world primarily through more active povs.

Sending you on a list of good long stories to read is mostly fruitless. Often times early chapters vary wildly in quality and vision from later chapters. What's more breadth of work can often be a crutch to cover for quality.

What I would recommend most is to go on ao3 or fanfiction and go for most reviewed on fanfiction and most kudos on a03 and limit your word count to less than ten thousand.and read through the top entries.

Specifically look for multiple pov stories. The nature of fanfiction is these stories will trend towards romance so forgive some wish fulfillment but make an effort to see why they are well liked. Long fics will gain recognition for staying power keep small and observe.
