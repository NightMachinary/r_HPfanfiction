Can anyone recommend fics with Hermione recovering from the torture in Malfoy Manor? No ships as much as possible, but especially no Romione. If there is a ship, I'd prefer Harmione or Fleurmione.


** I know one. It's Hermione/Luna but it's a really graphic story about Hermione fighting to not go insane after the torture.
