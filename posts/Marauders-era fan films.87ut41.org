Do you guys consider fan films fanfiction? I think it counts! Anyway, the Lily Evans series is pretty good -- they just released an adorable proposal video. What other ones would you rec?

** I've heard of /Mischief Managed/, but not seen it. I don't know the /Lily Evans/ series, do you have a link? I have also watched and enjoyed /Severus Snape and the Marauders/ --- good casting and surprisingly great filming and effects, somewhat lackluster characterization of the Marauders, and one hell of an ending twist.

*** Here's the Lily Evans series: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--A8rYXaapw&list=PLrZNeJBBjGtfnNGeLzud20pMT6BZKx7dN]]

They don't have as large a budget as Severus Snape and the Marauders, but I think their characterization is better.

**** Definitely agree with this! The Lily Evans series seems to fall in line with the books the best by using realistic and relatable characters. I also love their special effects and locations!

** I absolutely would! I know most feature male leads but there are a few (like the Lily series) that have female stories and that's kind of more fun. Unfortunately, they're not always /great./
