We've all read FanFics where Harry and his friends cross universes into an AU (Alternate Universe) due to either an experiment gone wrong, crossing the veil, etc. What if however, there were 52 distinct Harry Potter Universes which all take place in the same story. A story read by a guy named Harry Potter (named after the main character in that Universe's most popular book franchise) in a Universe where magic doesn't exist, period. The narrative will be his reading the books detailing the various 52 other Harry Potter's adventures. Each Universe will have minute differences in the history which ultimately change each Harry Potter drastically. For example, in one Universe the Cold War erupted into a full blown nuclear war and that Harry Potter, along with everyone else, is a mutant augmented with super strength but disfigured horribly. If anyone's read the story of Superboy Prime, you'll see where I'm getting with this.

After a few chapters, the main Harry Potter (we'll call him Harry Prime) will suffer a tremendous tragedy which will unlock his magical abilities along with sucking him into what will be named Earth-1 which is the Universe most inline with canon.

Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions? Would anyone be interested in a story like this? Thanks!


** As has been noted, it's the writing and writer's skill that matter most. But an fundamental part of that is creating a good /story/ out of the /idea/. Note: they aren't exactly the same thing.

The original HP idea or premise is something like "there's a magical world hidden alongside our world" while the story is something like "orphaned kid has to grow up, suffer through adversity, and unlock the power the destroy the evil which killed his parents."

See the difference? The idea is rather vague and can have lots of different stories associated with it. The story is based on conflict and achieving some goal (one large, overarching one that is made up of lots of smaller, focused ones).

You've got an idea, but not quite a story. What's the central conflict that's motivating various characters' actions? What is the quest or goal that is driving the main character? What is our reason to care about whether they succeed or fail? Why is Harry Prime reading the books? What is he looking to achieve? How will he use any of his powers? What's your end goal?

People will start reading a fic that seems to have an interesting premise or idea, but they won't keep reading unless you demonstrate that you've created a good story on the basis of that idea.

Keep in mind that the idea you've articulated above is very complex and even convoluted. Usually they need to be somewhat simple, because the story is always more complex and detailed than the starting premise. And the more complex the story, the harder it will be write and the harder it will be to get and retain readers. It might be wonderful story, but even so, people will get frustrated or bored and drop it. I'd strip the basic premise down to what is absolutely necessary, then build the story from there, adding only what elements are necessary to develop the essential plot and character arcs.`

*** Thank you for finally saying something that's not "There is no such thing as a 'good idea', there is only 'good writing.'"

The story's basically an exact copy of Super-boy Prime's story from DC comics except based off of the Harry Potter series. The central conflict will be first and foremost an evil Harry Potter that Harry Prime encounters during his universe hopping adventures. The driving motivation behind the evil Harry is that in his universe, a loved one (who won't be named until much further into the story) died seemingly out of nowhere. Her death, while unintentional, was directly caused by the actions/lack of actions taken by those the evil Harry called his friends and comrades. This led him to start a journey into Necromancy and other such dark arts which ultimately led to him being vastly more powerful than most of the other Harry Potters within the 52 unique universes.

The main character, Harry Prime, has to deal with not only figuring out a way back home, but also learning how to use his newfound magical abilities. Luckily, the first universe he traverses to is the canon universe where things aren't as messed up as the other universes. With his knowledge from reading the Harry Potter books, he and the Harry from that universe have an advantage over Voldemort and get rid of him in short order. Unfortunately, he has no idea how he initially crossed dimensions and has to find a way of doing so. My plan for this stage in the plot will be to leave Harry Prime to his devices while the narrative will shift to other Harry Potters.

Each new Harry Potter will take up to 5-10 chapters describing the point in time where their universe diverged and how they came to be the people they are today. Since each universe is different, some might be 20, 30, or even 60 years old. At the end of each mini-arc, the Harry in question will either wind up dead or be transported to another dimension while in the middle of an important event. For example, one of the Harry Potters will be in the middle of a rescue mission (Hermione was kidnapped and about to be used in a ritual) when as he suddenly sees Hermione, he disappears without a trace and she's sacrificed in the ritual.

Harry Potter, in Harry Prime's universe is considered to be the epitome of fictional writing. It is so popular that in that universe, J.K. Rowling decided to write 51 spin-offs to her original work with each having their own comic book adaptation, movie series, and even television series. At the start of my intended fanfic however, J.K. Rowling has just released her 50th spin-off to the Harry Potter franchise - with Harry Prime having just bought the newest issue before the events of this fanfic takes place.

Harry Prime was named Harry Potter because of his parents having the last name Potter and thinking it would be a good idea to name their son after their world's most famous fictional character. Don't worry, their names aren't Lily or James. Harry Prime's three main goals are as follows:

- Have fun - he just got the same magical potential as the characters he's been reading about for his whole life. He's going to do his best to learn as much magic as he can while enjoying it.

- Figure out a way home - while he may be in most avid Harry Potter fans' fantasy of being inside the Harry Potter world, he needs to get back home. He hopes with his newfound powers that he can prevent the tragedy which led to him having those very same powers in the first place.

- Figure out evil Harry's motivation and attempt to stop him - Harry Prime will eventually learn how to traverse through the multi-verse with apparent ease and discover that in many worlds, Harry Potter has either vanished without a trace or died a horrible gruesome death and realizes that he isn't the only Harry who has the ability to go to other dimensions.

My end goal is nearly the same as what happened in the DC comics. Harry Prime eventually BECOMES evil Harry. This might not make sense but it would be a lengthy process in the fanfic where we see glimpses of Harry Prime making decisions he wouldn't have earlier on and slowly becoming more and more focused on his goal before realizing that he himself, in the future, caused the initial tragedy. This might make zero sense but it's hard to explain without just writing the entire fanfic.

**** tl;dr: the plot will be, in the broadest sense, a copy of the Infinite series by DC Comics which feature a character known as Superboy Prime.

***** I already have a rough outline done Thad goes through everything so typing it all out shouldn't take too long. My only worries is writing the dialogue, I'm really bad at that, along with figuring out a way to differentiate the multitude of Harry's. There's going to be chapters with five or more Harry s at one place interacting with one anther.

Maybe, I'd like to be a writer - I just procrastinate alot.

There is no such thing as a "good idea", there is only "good writing". Anything can work if the writer knows what he's doing and everything can fail if the writer doesn't.

But yeah, I've once read a Naruto-fanfic about this specific idea. Where the main character crossed multiverses and met different versions of himself (including female ones). It can work, certainly.

** I'd likely read it but it depends on the writer's skill. I resd some hp/comic crossovers but too many become very sexist harem fics that try to be funny but fall flat.

*** Oh no, it's not going to be a cross over at all, it's more of a dimension hopping fanfic. I don't think I'll have very much romance involved at all, I'm atrocious at writing those kinds of fics.

It'll be more in the vain of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners]] if you've ever read it but where all the different dimensions tie into one another with multiple Harry's eventually meeting one another to fight the big bad.
