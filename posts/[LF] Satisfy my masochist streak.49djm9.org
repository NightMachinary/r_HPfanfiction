Specifically, I'm looking for fics with a submissive/Harry or a submissive/Male MC, excluding any ex-Death Eaters, current-Death Eaters or Future-Death Eaters (Draco, Snape, Lucius, Bellatrix, etc) of the pairing, as well as MSlash. Thanks!

  With Sirius' recent death, Harry's summer has a hellish start. The Dursley's abuse turns deadly, and Dumbledore does nothing to save him. Will he survive for another year of school, and will he even want to go back to Hogwarts at all? Slash, M/M/M/M, OMC/Hary, m-preg
