** I use both my PC and phone, depending on what I have available at the time. I assume when using an iPad FFN opens in mobile view? If so, then you have to switch to Desktop Mode. Just scroll down on the site and you'll see the link eventually. On AO3 it's super simple: it doesn't matter whether you use your phone or PC.

**** Okay, as I said, scroll down on FFN until you see the link which says "Desktop Mode" and tap it, then it'll change to, well, desktop mode. Then it looks as if you were using your PC.
