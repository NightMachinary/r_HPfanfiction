I'm currently writing a fic of my own and it's hard to get rid of self bias and to accurately critique my own work. I was wondering how I would get someone to read through and tell me what they think before I post it somewhere. Fanfiction is a hobby of mine that I have told to no one I know in real life as it's slightly embarrassing to talk about lol. I realistically want to know if what I have written is good or garbage.


** As I understand it from reading the tags to stories on AO3, first you must be an alpha. Then, when you come across a beta, you must sexually assault them. From that point on, they are your beta.

** Well, you could ask here, but that seems to get downvotes a lot.

There's a weekly beta-bartering thread in the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub that you could join (on Thursdays, I think, but the calendar is in their sidebar). Otherwise, there's a beta function along the top bar on FFNet (Browse, Just In, Community, Forum, Betas).

If you really want blunt feedback on what you've written, there's also the Dark Lord Potter forums. You need a profile to log-in, but they have a forum bit that lets you post your fics and ask for feedback and comments. Be warned, they can be quite brutally honest.

*** I'm shocked the self promotion post has 6 upvotes right now! Usually those all get downvoted to 0 super fast. :o Even mine.

**** I'm shocked as well. Especially for a beta-request self-promotion. I guess miracles really do happen. :)

** Ask around on various forums. DLP has a good place for authors to receive feedback as well but the feedback can be brutally honest.

** Ask here, but give some details on what your story is about first. Beta'ing a story you have no interest in reading is a chore. If it features a ship, go to that ship's sub or discord, they tend to be unusually enthusiastic. The hpff discord is also quite good, but again, make sure you find someone who likes what you're writing about.

** It's also a good idea to provide a sample of your work and/or a list of fandoms you're active in. Ideally, your beta would share the familiarity with both the settings you plan to work on and the general writing style you use.

Someone answering a generalized advertisement like this one can help you with technical details, like grammar, spelling and general flow of the work (do the events connect? are the scenes awkward, or good?), but may not be able to help with characterization, or consistency with the setting.
