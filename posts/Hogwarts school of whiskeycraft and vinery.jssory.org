Just an idea that popped into my head when I was touring a vinery.


** Lord Vodkamort and his Death Drinkers were spotted causing trouble in knock back ale-y again last night...

** I mean really, considering that everyone in the wizarding world learns how to brew potions its not that big of a leap to them developing a strong tradition of home-brewing alcoholic beverages.

It's even got historical precedent. Look up alewives. They were basically housewives that brewed their own ale for personal use and local sale (ale was a lot safer to drink than plain water back then). Their signature attire eventually became what we nowadays consider witch's attire. They were commonly condemned as witches after new brewing techniques made the industry profitable enough for men to want to take it over.

*** There's probably a wide range of potions products to cure hangovers. Actually even the liqour itself could be made in a way that prevents hangovers in the first place.

**** From my experience as an alcoholic in my early college days (and I actually mean an 'alcoholic' - to the point that days in a row I was not functional), aspirin before sleep always helped me.

** I have imagined Snape being the “Tavern Master/Brew Master” of Hogwarts.

“Class....Who can tell me what is the difference between an ale and a lager? Anyone....anyone besides Ms. Granger? Very well....”

“Please sir for the average beer drinker, the difference between an ale and a lager comes down to how the beer looks, smells, and tastes. Ales tend to be fruity-estery, while lagers are clean-tasting and frequently described as "crisp." But to a brewer, the difference is more fundamental than that. It's not color, or flavor, or aroma, or hop/grain/malt varietals or even water hardness that separates a lager from an ale. Simply put, lagers use an entirely different type of yeast during fermentation.”

“An answer delivered straight from the “Brewmaster's Bible.... Are you incapable of thinking for yourself or do you simply enjoy regurgitating information as if you had just inhaled one of the Weasley twins abhorrent puking pastry's? 100 points from Gryffindor for you lackadaisical indolent attitude.”

Or conversely: Say Percy, who's that teacher drinking beer with Professor Quirrel?

“That's Professor Snape, Brewmaster of Hogwarts. Right now he's drinking a Pilsner but everyone knows it's the Dark Beers he fancies”

** The Evans has always been winemakers and the Potter's been beer. Harry says no to that and starts to make the 1st ever whiskey (obviously whiskey hasn't been made yet) and calls it Jamison after his Father.
