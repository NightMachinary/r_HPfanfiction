The minor character can be anywhere from Nymphadora Tonks, Andromeda Tonks to say Cedric Diggory, Zacharias Smith, Theodore Nott, Percy Weasley, Lee Jordan, etc.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Length/Old or New/Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing, but feel free to rec it, someone else might enjoy.


** If you're interested, I'm working on a Percy Weasley centric story that's an AU take on his betrayal. It doesn't bash the Weasleys but Percy is pretty angry in this fic so it doesn't look at them in a purely positive way either

** Here's a one-shot that I wrote on the Ariana Dumbledore/Dennis Creevey pairing that was pretty much written as an exercise to see if I could make it work, given that there were no other fics tagged with the ship.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27001705]]

Since we get so little info about the characters themselves in canon, the fic hyperfocuses on the characteristics we /do/ know.

** There's this one crossover fic I've been following for a while now, which is bringing in Cassius Warrington, An slytherin who is definitely very confused about what's going on from the moment he met the main character, to being selected as a triwizard champion, striking up a potential interhouse/intercontinental alliance due to the twins mischeif, along with general confusion as to what the heck this first year and his golden retriever is trying to pull. It is one of the few time travel fics I know of where the characters are generally clueless about the maguffins, and have to work to find and destroy them.

** Oh I have a lot:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19276393/chapters/45844324][Divination for Skeptics]]: The latest in magical advancements is an enchantment that reveals the bearer's romantic compatibility with another person. Effectively eliminating uncertainty from dating, the charm can tell you whether or not you've found The One with a precise, Hermione Granger-approved calculation of traits and preferences. It's a foolproof method of predicting relationship happiness. It's also, for Hermione, positively dreadful news. Dramione, post-war, soulmate AU. COMPLETE. (My note - even though it is Dramione there are a bunch of minor characters explored in here)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20681483][Sunshine and Tomatoes]]: Theodore Nott had every intention of ignoring the Marriage Law - the very idea the government could force him to get married was absurd - until Luna Lovegood smiled at him in the dingy office, tomatoes in her hair. (My note - I am a sucker for a Theo/Luna pairing and this one is sweet)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21109976/chapters/50231597][A Dress with Pockets]]: Pansy Parkinson needed a drink. And a shag. She didn't care in which order. Enter: Neville /fucking/ Longbottom and his rolled up sleeves. Set in LovesBitca8's Rights and Wrongs AU. (My note - this is explicit so click with care, but the Pansy characterization is great. Also if you like it the Dramione story for the AU that it takes place in is also worth a read)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21554839][A Strong Cup of Tea in a Warm Glass House]]: The greenhouse is shadowed and quiet, and she's alone, pressed into the very darkest corner she can find. She doesn't know he's there until he touches the back of her right hand with a fingertip. “Tea?” (my note - super quick, very sweet)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27417406/chapters/67015339][What Do A Lion And A Wolf Share]]: Two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is called back from Australia by the Ministry for urgent news. Just when she feels like her blood doesn't define her in the wizarding world, Hermione is thrust into a new world based on blood status. Working with unlikely allies, can she navigate new societal challenges, better the wizarding world, make her friends all get along, and fix her parents? Dramione, enemies to lovers slow burn. (my note - this one is a self plug, but only because my Theo Nott is one of my favorite characters I have ever written. Theo Nott and Narcissa are both major players and get explored way more than in canon. Not finished, but I usually update every few days.)

  A Death Eater's wife, Draco's mother, Bellatrix's sister and the witch who made an Unbreakable Vow with Severus - but who was Narcissa really? Canon-compatible, (books 1-7) following Narcissa from her seventh year at Hogwarts in 1972 through to the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. All chapter titles are named after constellations and their myths. Complete.

** My friend and I are writing an SI fic where the SIs are a bit older than the trio, so they do feature the minor characters more heavily, including Cedric, Narcissa, and more recently, Andromeda.

  The fuckery of Lyra Malfoy and James Stark, two idiots who can't agree on how their thrust into the wizarding world should be handled. Double SI. Co-written with darienqmk.

** Can't recall the link but it's a Harry/Fleur story where she comes to Hogwarts to teach a Dueling Club. It's easy to see Fleur had a lot of potential than what was in canon and the story shows her as the badass she is. She is arrogant and all too aware of how good-looking she is, but it shows her other qualities too.
