Are there any stories where a single Petunia Evans raises Harry? No Snape sympathies, no Lupin and no random friendships with the Weasleys before Hogwarts. Also please no canon pairings.


** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept" comes close. Snape's an asshole, Petunia raised Harry and Dudley after divorcing Vernon, and lots of world building and OCs.
