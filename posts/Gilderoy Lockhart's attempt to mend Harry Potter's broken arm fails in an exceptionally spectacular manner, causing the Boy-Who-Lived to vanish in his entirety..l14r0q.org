Lockhart brandished his wand casting a spell at Harry as Harry pleaded for him to not heal him.

Everyone looked at the pitch where only seconds ago Harry Potter had laid. Now only grass and the conspicuous lack of Harry Potter remained.

"Oh Dear..."

Humans are amazing little creatures. Creatures who have lied so effectively to themselves they have managed to convince themselves that the only thing beyond the horizon is more of the same.

As they age they become more sure of this, even those who try their hardest to remember that there is /something else/ just over the horizon.

Which makes wizards an even more interesting creature. A human who knows their is /something else/ beyond the horizon.

Yet they also know it is something they can master, that it is something logical and understandable (by wizard standards at least).

So they still lie to themselves enough to force reality to stay nice and calm for them. Yet they do not fully convince themselves of this lie. As such they retain a microscopic ability to adjust reality in its true form, yet still have the filter of lies to keep them grounded in the human state of /reality/.

Harry woke feeling strangely amazing. It wasn't until this moment that he realized how much pain he had been in his whole life. The sudden absence of it all was shocking.

It was such a jarring experience it took him several minutes to notice three important facts.

Firstly he wasn't wearing glasses yet could see far more clearly than he ever had with glasses. There were more colors than he had even been aware existed as well.

This fascinating experience could help explain why it took him so long to notice he had no idea where he was right now.

Oh, and his arm was fine now.

Still the room was incredible, a shifting kaleidoscope of colors as the dimensions of the room ever so slight changed as he watched them.

He had been laying on a ?bed? of air that was strangely solid. Like how he had imagined a cloud would feel when he was younger.

Carefully he sat down on it and relaxed fully on it when it held his weight easy enough. He couldn't find anything even resembling a door or window so he was stuck here for the minute. Taking a chance he called out to the room.

"Hello? Is there anybody there!"

~~~

"Curious. ^{single} ^{strand} ^{communication.} +no intent behind speech.+"

"Speech unknown. ^{further} ^{proof} ^{being} ^{from} ^{outside} ^{Assembly.} +defence against hyper-reality existence possibly.+"

~~~

Harry felt a mild headache for a split second as a door came into existence along a wall. Two beings walked into the room each seeming surprised for some reason.

They were tall beings who looked like an elf from The Lord of the Rings. Blonde hair, green eyes, pale skin, and pointy ears. Harry found them beautiful and blushed from the tight fitting clothes showing off their bodies.

~~~

"/What just happened?/^{+my+} EXCEPTIONALLY *CumMinCAtiOn DIffIcULT* +form+ STABLE! +is locked!+"

~~~

The elves started talking back and forth to each other. Whatever language they spoke it wasn't one Harry had the slightest about.

They spoke rapidly for a full minute before paying attention to Harry again. He started off with his name to get this rolling.

"Hello, I'm Harry, can you understand me at all?"

They replied in that strange bubbling flowing speech again and Harry knew this was going to take time.

~~~

Harry gets transported randomly somewhere in the universe and picked up by a curious group of aliens. Vanishing something just randomly teleports it somewhere in the universe.

Cluthlu style verse idea where humans are completely oblivious to what is going on in the universe. Wizards fractionally less so.

Aliens find the obscene amounts of eldritch and hyper-reality beings infesting humans/Earth to be horrifying/interesting.

We exert our (unconscious) willful ignorance of what is the truth on the universe around us. So any beings/aliens/whatever, have to fight off, with minimal success, our version of reality enforcing itself on them.

Just an idea bopping around that this seemed like a good reason to let some of it out.

** Harry once apparated to the school rooftop as a kid, casually breaking the laws of reality and space-time, and as canon points out in book 3 he is ridiculously overpowered with his fancy NEWT spell.

It stands to reason that Harry once again and manages to save himself by apparating himself towards the right dimension again. Because why should the wizarding world only break the space part of space-time, and only within the reality they know already?

Bonus points if this is the start of either a 12- year old time or dimension traveling Harry fic.

It'd also be fun if he would end up in a reality where James and Lily lived.

*** Actually, un-vanishing is pretty much canon, or at the very least strongly implied. In book 5, after an order meeting Harry's eye catches a blueprint of a building which is collected by Bill, who then proceeds to vanish it along with other documents. Makes sense that Bill would be able to make the documents appear again for the next meeting again, wouldn't it? Unless one claims they'd procure new documents each time they meet of course, which sounds... well.

***** As far as I'm aware, the only way to 'conjure' food is for it to already exist in a location you know, and then spell it to arrive at the next location. Why would the reverse not exist to? Being able to teleport the item to a location in your mind should work in theory.

** Vanishing instead just pushes objects out of phase: when Harry suddenly finds himself surrounded by hundreds of years' worth of "vanished" crap, and where no-one can see him, he's pretty much stuck being people's undetected shadows.

Except for Fawkes: damn phoenix thinks it's amusing to basically sit on Harry's head -- people are freaked out when a sitting phoenix randomly floats around by itself.

*** Okay that's an interesting idea, but if vanishing things puts them out of phase with reality, wouldn't Harry be suddenly left in the empty void of space as gravity no longer affects him, and his final moments be watching the Earth go flying off into the distance without him?

*** Voldemort promptly finds himself, moments after his resurrection, teleported into a solid wall of rock. His new body doesn't exactly die, but it becomes somewhat difficult to control when meshed with stone.

Harry looks around at the DE's and asks them if anyone wants to be next.

Crazy DE starts casting the Killing curse, joins his Lord. Does not survive.

When a second one does the same, Harry sends them all into walls/etc.

The second wizard blood war was short.
