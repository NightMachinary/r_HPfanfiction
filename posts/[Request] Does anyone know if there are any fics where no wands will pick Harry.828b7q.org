I don't mean that he's a squib; the thing I was thinking of just now is that since horcruxes are abominations that an "innocent", untainted wand would be repelled from one. It was something that came to mind while reading a couple of recent posts discussing wand choices. The closest I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summoner's Stone) but in that one they don't choose him because he's already accidentally gotten himself a focus.


** i only know another fic where no wand chooses harry because he already got a focus. are you interested ?

**** linkffn(9097983) and its unfinished sequel linkffn(10412381). be warned though that there are a lot of deviations from canon. the first story mainly shows harrys upbringing at Azkaban and how he gained his focus while the sequel has Harry starting at Hogwarts. i like the nice lovecraftian elements.

  Ruby Rose lived to be a Huntress, wanting to be just like her Mom, Summer Rose, however her last name wasn't always that of the one she saw as her mother, she was once known as Ruby Potter. The Wizarding World has no clue where their savior is, but a Death Eater decides the Goblet of Fire is the best way to bring her out of hiding. Ruby Rose is Fem! Harry.

*** Thanks, I'm guessing this is a RWBY crossover?

EDIT: on my phone I didn't see the follow up link with the tags, so I was guessing from the title alone.

  A simple question from Harry during his vault visit in book 1 changes his life, as Harry accesses a family vault. And a stone there that will change his life, even more than finding out he is a wizard did.
