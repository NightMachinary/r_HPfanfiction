I have become addicted to Scorbus after the shameless baiting of Cursed Child, I would have liked it more if they left a possible romance up to the audience instead of forcing Scorpius' puppy crush on Rose and had Albus use Snape's trademark "Always" quote regarding their friendship (which Scorpius did use) at an ending scene with them boarding the Hogwarts Express.
