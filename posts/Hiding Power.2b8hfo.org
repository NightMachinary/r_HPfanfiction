I read Arc of Sacrifices and The Art of Hidden Personas and wonder if there are any other ficts out there where Harry actively hides his true intelligence/power/political savvy/etc. Slash/Gen/Het but preferably no romance please!


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]] he kinda forges several false personae as he goes to hide his true capabilities from Dumbledore and Co. Fortunately, no slash and not much romance.

**** If it was about another story, and I've mentioned that I personally find it fortunate that there are no unnecessary sex scenes in it, would you say that I am being a sexophobe?

It's one thing to fear something and be against it, and it's another to fully enjoy it and like finding it in your media.

***** Yeah but there isnt much a difference from disliking it to not wanting to acknowledge it exists so you dont look like a bigot that you are.

  so you dont look like a bigot that you are.

  implying that I'm still a bigot though you've just acknowledged my argument that was designtspecifically against it

This doesn't make sense to me. To use the same analogy with sex in general, I acknowledge its existence but still don't want it showing itself in my Pixar movies, books, or pretty much anything not specifically sex-oriented (e.g. porn). That may be my personal preference, but how does it make me into a bigot?

**** Beg your pardon, but I think if someone prefers stories without slash, it doesn't per se mean they are homophobic.

***** Not enjoying slash is different then going out of your way to say, thank goodness there is no slash

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7724057/1/Family-Bonds]] I think this is just what you're looking for. It isn't finished yet, but it's still a long read. Severitus, living Potters, wrong bwl, but nicely done. No real pairing, but there is a bit of romance between Harry and Fleur. It's a great fic :-)

*** It's not really off to a good start with an A/N almost as long as the chapter but well hell, I have nothing else to read at the moment. Thanks.
