Does anyone know any good Dudley has a magic child fanfics? Read a few,but they were really badly written. I'd appreciate it. Thank you!


** Linkffn(Dudley's Memories) and it's sequels are pretty good.

For the future, I'd put the actual request in the title instead of making people click on the post to see what you're asking. A lot of people in this sub straight up won't look at your post without an accurate title

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

*** I adore that series of one-shots. Dudley and his son crop up in several others particularly in "musing on heraldry" which is the direct sequel!

  The first thing Luke Dursley did when he got his Hogwarts letter was dance a triumphant war dance around the sitting room. The second thing he did was write to his cousin Lily. The third thing he did was take the Smeltings stick his Grandad Dursley had given him for his birthday last week and plant it in the flowerbed with the Smeltings hat and coat hanging off it - for the crows, he explained to Mum. No, not to scare them off. For food. It was a symbolic gesture, Mum.
