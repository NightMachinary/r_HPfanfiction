Dumbledore has a different idea in mind when he picks up Harry from the Dursley's...

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Tied to a chair, wand nowhere in sight and throbbing with pain all over; Lord Voldemort blearily awakened to an old fashioned living room (decor dark and dust coated) with a sworn enemy sat in a stool before him,

"Potter?!" Incredulous, a sibilant snarl at the pained looking teen (a boy he'd last seen a month earlier in the Ministry Atrium, "How is this possible?"

Harry Potter shook his head, taking a moment to clean his glasses with the hem of his oversized shirt,

"I Imperio'd Snape and he lead me right to you. It took an Invisibility Cloak and a Stunner." He shrugged, expression plain. Completely indifferent to the feat he'd accomplished, "I'm pretty sure only Nagini know's you're gone, if she's still alive."

Incredulous, the back and forth between the two enemies was hot and cold. The increasingly heated roaring of the Dark Lord met with the frosty indifference of his prophesised adversary, falling into silence after Harry's lackluster responses.

"Tom." The Dark Lord visibly inflated in anger, a hairbreadth away from another tirade before Harry's next sentence brought him crashing back down to earth, "You've been here for six days."

His shriek of,

"Impossible." Was met with a head shake and sighed clarification,

"I captured you almost a week ago. You've been awake and Obliviated since then."

The ghost of a half smile the only display of emotion he'd given in this entire conversation, quickly replaced by a harrowed, distant expression, "I've had the time to... take out my anger on you. As well as pump you for information."

That half smile returned. Bigger, firmer and crueller.

"You didn't last long."

His expression was a delicate balance of bemused and grave. The indifferent mask Voldemort wore (hiding the inferno of rage beneath) cracked and shattered as his heart sunk. Each syllable Harry would then go onto utter further tearing him down,

"We know about the Horcruxes, Tom. The first thing I got from you is how you survived and returned. The Order has them all and a few of them have already been destroyed."

His whole life: The orphanage, the Hogwarts years, his glory days, the humilating time as a shade and the criminally short time he'd spent in this form. All of it flashed before his eyes when Harry's hand dove into his pocket and yanked out an object that proved he was neither bluffing nor lying,

"Though, Kreacher gave me this one..."

It called to him, a warm pain in his chest calling to the shard of his soul locked within. Harry dangled Slytherin's Locket before it's owners face, the object swinging hypnotically before his cat-like eyes.

He cursed himself for his pathetic tone, but he had ask,

"Did you awaken me to gloat? To lord over me, as I would others?"

"Dumbledore wants to give you a second chance." The response was immediate, "I want to see where that leads."

"A... a second chance?!" He roared, pulling against his restraints with spittle flying past his lips, "That old man would play with my life? Would ALLOW me to become another of his sycophant pets? Dancing to the tune of his benevolent mercy?!"

His tirade was cutting and brutal. Not only directed towards Dumbledore, but Harry himself, a target he was more intimately knowledgeable of. He made it clear, in no uncertain terms, what horrors he would commit should he ever be released from this chair and into the cuatody of Dumbledore's 'second chance'.

Not once did Harry flinch. Unmoving and silent until the Dark Lord had screamed himself hoarse,

"You're hired as the new Defense Professor. You'll be back under the name Tom Riddle. No one will know who you really are, perfect opportunity to reinvent yourself." A scowl briefly danced across Harry's lips before he continued, "He also said it'd a waste of your skills to just off you right away. And I think killing you now would be letting you off too easy."

Had Voldemort not been filled with such writhing disgust, he would have capitalised on the flicker of pain and unrest on the young mans face. Filing it away for later as Harry made a clear motion of his exit,

"Personally." Harry's words delivered through grunt as he rose to his feet, "I hope the jinx gets you."

"That 'jinx' is my own." He sneered, only for a bark of laughter to rip up Harry's throat and an equally acidic expression sent back at him,

"Even better."

A more savvy response to the prophecy leads to a very different hiring for the DADA position in 1996.
