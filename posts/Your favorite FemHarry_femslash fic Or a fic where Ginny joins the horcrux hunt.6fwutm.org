** I like linkffn(the long game by inwardtransience) even though the author rambles a bit about linguistics/culture often. It's h/hr right now but fem!harry hooks up with a few other people and it doesn't look like h/hr will be endgame.

Linkao3(the girl who lived (again)) is a really sweet transgender girl Harry canon rehash, and she and Ginny are very cute together.

Linkffn(the silent world of Cassandra Evans) is basically an edgy!harry crack fic and the entire fic is populated by lesbian couples after second or third year. Not great writing but if you like tropey edgy asshole Harry (one of my guilty pleasures is power lesbians who get away with way too much shit) it's a fun ride. Harry/Susan.

Linkao3(10382739) is pre-femslash & a hilarious, well written crackfic. Harry is a reincarnated naruto rage demon, Hermione is her only friend. Sequel just started.

Ginny joins the horcrux hunt in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958-1/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm]] Buffy crossover.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

*** There are several options:

1) Harry was more politically adept and used his temporary favor with the Ministry to have the Trace broken for all Ministry Six in Year 6.

2) She pulled the same trick as Tom Riddle in 1943 and bypassed the Trace by using a different Wand.

3) Ginny refrained from using magic at all.

4) They fled the country.

**** Well, Voldemort did take over the ministry, so he could always change it back. Plus, I doubt they would lower the age restriction because anyone underage will most likely be at Hogwarts. They could also monitor them to see if they are in trouble.

***** A visit to Knockturn alley to remove the trace then. There are plenty of ways to make it sound reasonable. Besides, from what it looks like in canon, the trace doesn't trace actual people but locations. It's why Harry got in trouble with Dobby. So technically, Ginny could have always used magic at her parents house because it would have just thought it was her parents doing it.

** Ginny goes with them in my story "What If?", but the hunt is shorter and begins around Christmas time. Before that the trio and Ginny return to Hogwarts. Not a seventh year canon rehash for the most part. But the same Horcruxes, and the final battle is definitely similar.
