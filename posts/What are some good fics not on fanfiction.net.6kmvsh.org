Almost all of what I've read is on FF.net or AO3, and even the AO3 ones tend to be duplicated on FF.net. I'm aware that [[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/][Fiction Alley]] exists---discovered [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dethryl/][Dethryl]]'s and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lunalelle/][Lunalelle]]'s stories there a long time ago---but haven't really explored it. There's also [[http://fictionhunt.com][FictionHunt]], which is mostly a mirror of FF.net but might have some of its now-deleted stories, and [[http://fanfics.me/][Fanfics.me]], which is in Russian but has [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=16879&chapter=0][some English fics]]. Any, I'm curious what I've missed that is simply not available on FF.net. Any recommendations?

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

Livejournal used to be a really popular place to post fics, especially when this fandom was in its heyday (back when the book series was still in-progress). This author wrote a lot of nice little Harry/Luna one-shots, of which this one is by far the sweetest.

** Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived- fantastic non magic spy school AU, completed. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

By the same author, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm]] Ginny Weasley awakens as a Buffy-style slayer at the end of book 6, goes on the horcrux hunt.

Prelude to Destiny. Lily POV of her sixth year at Hogwarts, featuring wonderful OC friends. Completed. A bit of purple prose at times but the characters are A+. [[http://unknowableroom.org/39/1/]]

** Linkao3(Tomorrowland by winterfool) is, in my opinion, the best Harry/Luna fanfic in existence, and the vast majority of time I spend on AO3 is to see if that fic has updated.

Some might say Contemplating Clouds is better, but it's a one shot.

Certainly Conlaodh's Song (sequel to By the Divining) is a better fic, but the Harry/Luna here is only a minor ship.

  In the aftermath of the war, Harry still has plenty of demons left to fight.Post-DH, not compliant with the epilogue.

** Well, at the risk of sounding like a broken record (I've found myself recommending this one thing fairly often as of lately), I think that “Happy Birthday, Mr. Dark Lord” is a nice story if a bit short (it's a one-shot). It can be found here:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/after_the_rain/HBMDL01a.html]]

Now, I haven't really got around to reading that particular author's other works, whatever is the reason for that, but if you find yourself liking this one-shot you might want to look at their fic list and see if anything else sounds interesting to you.

** Sugar Quill seems pretty obscure, or maybe just old.

One story, /Mind's Eye, Souls's Reflection/ is superb. A wonderfully written Luna
