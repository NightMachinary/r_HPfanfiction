I'm interested in reading original stories with new characters. I've watched many original films on YouTube and they are awesome! I'm 40,000 words in to a story I'm writing. Anybody know where I can read original stories?

*** Yes. I mean completely new creations inside the world. Unrelated to HP. For example, John Smith the American Auror tracking down stolen dark artifacts in London in 2019. Maybe light cameos, but a story independent of the main canon

  In the United States, the fertile era of Satanic Panic left no child with the seed of magic in them safe in their hometowns. Emmet Tames, a child not only of potential wizardry, is born with a boon of something more unique.He can see spirits.He travels to the other side of the world to be introduced to the hidden magical society of Britain courtesy of his mysterious older brother-a talented painter who produces live moving portraits commissioned by purebloods. As Emmet steeps himself further into his brother's life he realizes the troubles brewing in the dark structure of Hogwarts and the magical district has unnerving connections to a darker secret embroiled in his brother's home

** Of all the stories that I have read, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) has the most original characters. Every second character is completely original, and the remaining characters are either canon characters like Harry, Hermione or Voldemort or real people like Bill Clinton, Osama Bin Laden or Kim Jong-Il. The plot is quite original but more geopolitics than magic school adventures.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?

  Harry Potter had many questions. He wondered about everything around him. He was quiet, shy, polite, and thoughtful. If you knew what had happened to him two years before, you would be surprised at how he acted.Severus Snape has questions. Why was this boy so different from his parents? Why was he always writing in that journal? Why was he living with the Abbotts'? And Why is no one talking about his past? He is going to find the answer to all questions, and find that the past doesn't always define us. That strongest people are sometimes the quietest.As their worlds intertwine, Severus is determined to figure out what has happened and how. Bringing in an old rival, they had no idea they would uncover a hidden agenda and a more accepting world.
