Pretty much what the title says. It could be either that James died or they divorces or any other reason.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  “Heard from the pup lately?” “Got a letter from him just this morning, actually. He's doing well, his Potions class is more tolerable after my subtle intervention, and there are some new friends he's considering asking over during the summer hols next year,” Lily said with a smile. “That all sounds good,” Sirius remarked, carrying a couple plates and a handful of silverware into the dining room. “But what's this about you and *subtle* intervention? The way I heard it, you sent Snape a Howler, and somehow got it to him right in the middle of breakfast at the Great Hall.”

***** Ah, that explains it. You put the chapter number in the first time, not the fic number.

On another note, the fic you wanted to link? I'm 3 chapters in and so far it's a good one. Kinda a shame that it's incomplete and last updated last year - really wish it got picked up again.
