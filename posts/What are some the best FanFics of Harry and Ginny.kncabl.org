Im a huge romantic and there simply wasnt enough Harry and Ginny love in the books for me. I need more! lol. Any help would be appreciated.


** Anything by gryffindorhealer, jenorama and Annerb stand out for me. And id suggest going to FloreatCastellum's tumblr page and checking out her many ficlets, believe they continue on from her Not From Others story. Ive written a few stories too, different tropes, lots of Potter family stuff

**** All my faves for so many different reasons so best you search them out and see what YOU like, Annerb's Changeling is a Slytherin Ginny story with (I think?) 3 sequels, so far. Jenorama has a timeline of stories, dating back before JKR finished writing hers, mostly one shots till you get to the brlliant California Dreamin' which is about 50 chapters, and then there are about 5 or 6 that follow on from that (Im always hoping for more from her Potterverse). Gryindormischief writes a lot of one shots and short stories, and has teamed up with another writer for the brilliant Muggle story, Kindle. There is a small one shot set after and they have just started posting Aurora, a second sequel that looks like its going to be a multi chap. floreat Castellum's Not From Others is set in Ginnys 6th year under Snape and the Carrows, and on her tumblr page she has written lots of snippets that tie in with her brilliant story The Aurors. Im loving her current WIP Wood for the Trees, set in the same Potterverse, about James Sirius starting work at the Auror department under his father. And you will find me on SIYE, ff.net and A03 under Pottermum. There are a few stories that are only on SIYE but the rest should be on all of them, I have quite a vareity of tropes to choose from, but writing the Potter family is my fave. Good luck with the searches, hope you find something xx

** If you don't mind post-Hogwarts AU, I highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7919536/chapters/18096517][/California Dreamin'/]] by Jenorama. I don't usually like the mystery genre, and I'm extremely wary of non-Britain locales, but this one was really well done.

** Changeling is about Ginny as a Slytherin at Hogwarts. The two sequels delve into her developing relationship with Harry.

**** Read it anyway. Slytherin isn't just a bunch of death eaters or Hogwarts wouldn't have kept it as a house. And Ginny is very conflicted about how she was sorted there, but she never ever goes to the dark side. Trust me, it's a great story and the sequels go all the way to a couple of years after Voldemort's downfall, which the original books never did.

**** I like all of Northumbrian's works, the changeling/Armistice series, and backwards with purpose, but I guess mostly I like harry/ginny stories inside larger stories.

** I have to recomend [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]] one of my favorites. Though imo it kinda jumps the shark with Harry's super overpoweredness near the end it's still a fun read with very little of the angst you usually see
