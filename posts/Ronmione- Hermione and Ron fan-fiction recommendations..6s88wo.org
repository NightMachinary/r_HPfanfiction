As the title says, please and thank you ðŸ˜˜ (Australia,TKYITLY, Price of love all read so far)


** Divided and Entwined]([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/]]), linkffn(11910994), is an excellent, 640k words long, war epic and polit-thriller.

The same author also wrote [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), featuring a very different world after 1981. Ron and Hermione met well after Hogwarts and were initially on opposing sides of the war.

However, my favorite R/Hr fic is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which plays out in a non-magical AU. It's one of the handful fanfics I enjoyed more than the original, and I even spent some time writing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/6c2ice/fanfiction_friday/dhsgu2p/][a detailed decription]].

Are you also interested in Harry/Hermione/Ron romantic Trio fics?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** The very first fic I wrote was Ron and Hermione getting to know each other after a long time apart. It pretty much started my whole little Potterverse. linkao3(7069768)

I tend to write mostly Harry/Ginny these days, but I've got few Ron and Hermione fics.

  Separated by long years, Ron and Hermione meet again and get to know each other. Originally published 12(!) years ago, this is definitely an alternate universe work.

** I absolutely adore Ron/Hermione. It's my favorite pairing, but not one that gets a lot of love here. Like... at all. Lately I've been working through a specific authors's favorite fics on ff.net. I'll link the author's main story, but I'm not gonna lie, I haven't read it. I didn't enjoy the first chapter all that much. Just go to JeanAndBilius's favorited fics, sort by longest, and work your way through! linkffn(10394794)

  Ron Weasley, now at the height of his powers as one of the best Aurors in the world, is on the cusp of cracking the greatest case of his career, righting a twenty year wrong that has secretly haunted him since his earliest days in the Ministry. But, right at the moment of triumph, he discovers something that threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Disclaim: All J K Rowling's
