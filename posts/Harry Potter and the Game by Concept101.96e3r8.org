  A really, really good story, with great worldbuilding. Some parts may ear dark, while some appear childish. It has many deviations from canon. But the best thing is even though Harry has the Gamer abilities, he s not god. There are people who are more powerful than him. Definitely the best Gamer crossover I've ever read.

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.

** I didn't begin this story at first because of the summary but when I finally got into it I was positively surprised.

As for gaming crossover I also really liked "The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited" linkffn(9708318). Some aspect of the skills, xp and stats are in my opinion better handled. It's just damn sad it's on hiatus. And after reading and following so many fics, hiatus don't sound good if you want an actual end to a story...

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

*** Video Game: Exploited is somewhat amusing, but caution: Harry's personality is nothing like canon, and he swears like a sailor.

**** Yeah but with such an AU at this point I'm not too bothered with his personality depiction. But the application of RPG mechanics on the HPverse is quite interesting.

***** Read that and liked it. But both the fixs are different. Hp and the game has a Harry who has gamer abilites while the other has Harry whose life is a game. First is great but second is the most funniest.

** I haven't read the newest chapters yet but the story flows a lot better so far than the original. I really hope the author corrects a few errors and doesn't continue with the whole making a real Pokemon type game.
