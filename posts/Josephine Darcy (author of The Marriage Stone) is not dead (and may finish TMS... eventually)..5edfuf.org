*** I checked my email and saw I had an update for The Marriage Stone and had a double take. I'm super excited and happy it might be finished one day!

** I'm running on fumes at this point and honestly thought I was hallucinating when I saw the email notification. That, or I fell asleep at my computer and was dreaming. Again.

I'm so relieved that she's alive and relatively okay.

Also, the slight chance that TMS might eventually be continued literally made me cry. I wish I could blame that on exhaustion and sleep deprivation, but I suspect I would have teared up even if I'd been wide-awake. Gods. I'm going to try my best not to expect anything, but I can't lie and say the hope isn't there.

** 8.6 million distinct hits on her story? I severely underestimated how many people read fanfics and am very pleasantly surprised. :)

** On a somewhat related note, I've seen that a number of people have written their own take on the ending to TMS. Anyone have a good rec for one of these?

Edit: Wow. Just read her note. That's some horrible stuff she's gone through. :(

  One fan's take on how Josephine Darcy's abandoned but wonderful story, The Marriage Stone, might have proceeded. A powerful Harry, a surprised Severus, all the others, and a really bad Voldemort!
