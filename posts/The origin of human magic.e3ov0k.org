I recently was thinking about where human magic comes from, and why only a small portion is capable of using. (Considering how small the Hogwarts student population was, let's be generous and say 10% of the human population) So why is it like this? Well, I've come up with a scientific explanation.

Humans are not magical creatures. This should be obvious with how few are capable of it. So where did it come from. Well, as science and archeology has shown, our ancestors 100,000 years ago were not shy about interbreeding with Neanderthals. They did so much that just about all humans have a little bit of Neanderthal DNA in them. Is it so hard to believe that they did such with other anthropomorphic creatures? Or even (if legends are to believed) mythic animals.

As such, same with the Neanderthals we should all possess a bit of 'creature' heritage. However, it is so mixed and matched together (along with natural evolution) that it is essential flavorless magic. Or perhaps white magic. Like the color, it is the equal representation of all magics. This leaves it free to be colored by culture, religion, and personal beliefs/personality.

The reason why not all humans have magic is because this mystic heritage is dormant in most humans (90%). This is because, as a species, humans are not inherently magical. Magic came from foriegn species. However, on rare occasions a mutation will occur that awakens this mystic heritage. Thus, muggle-borns are born.

There is evidence to support this theory in the potter verse. Flitwick is part goblin. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are part giant. Fleur is part Veela.

What is everyone else's opinion on this theory? I for one think it is a sound theory.


** I subscribe to this theory as well.

  "As for you, Harry," Hermione spoke up, breaking his concentration, "none of this would've happened if it weren't for your weird... fixation."

  He lifted his gaze from the book. "Excuse me?"

  "She was a mermaid," Hermione said in an exasperated tone. "How could she have possibly enticed you? Unlike veela, they have no innate magic of that kind."

  He'd expected something to this effect when he told them the unabridged story, of course. Snapping the book shut, he rose. "I was merely following my manly calling, Hermione."

  She furrowed her brows. "You've lost me."

  "It is in the wizards'---nay, all men's---nature to yearn for adventure, for excitement, for new frontiers to conquer---"

  "With our dicks," Tony quipped, earning a cuff on the back of his head from Padma.

  Harry cleared his throat. "To appreciate everything our vast world has to offer, and to seek beauty in all its forms. Hence, my attraction to other Beings is not only perfectly natural, but also a part of the pioneering spirit that drives the wizarding world forward!" He stood tall and proud, gazing towards a horizon only he could see.

  Hermione sighed. "What you just said has no basis in reality."

  "You want facts? I'll blow your mind with facts," Harry said, folding his arms. "Humans are the only ones who procreate with other species. You never see, say, goblin-veela hybrids, but half-humans are everywhere. There's even speculation that wizardkind's powers originate from our creature heritage---that we essentially obtained magic through hot, depraved cross-species intercourse!"

  "That's a fringe theory," Su said. She ducked her head when everyone's eyes turned towards her. "It was in Illustrated Witchcraft."

  "See? It's even making the big-time magazines." Harry grinned. "Think about it: maybe we can only cast spells thanks to a daring ancestor who got really drunk one day and boinked a dragon."

  Hermione snorted. "I'm impressed at how far you're willing to go to justify your perversion, but there's no way you can convince me it's normal."

  Harry raised a hand as he gathered his thoughts. "Flitwick is part-goblin. There are rumors that Sprout has dryad blood in her lineage. It's practically common knowledge that Hagrid is a half-giant. Do you hate these fine people, Hermione? Do you hate Hagrid?"

  "Don't be ridiculous!"

  "His parents, then? He's a product of a union between a man and a giantess." Harry tilted his head as he considered the mechanics of such a coupling.

  "Of course not," Hermione said. "I mean, it should be impossible from a scientific perspective, considering the vastly different gestation periods, but---"

  "Your cold equations are missing something crucial. Love. Science is powerless in its presence." His cheek twitched, but he refrained from laughing. "You wouldn't deny two Beings tragically separated by the barrier of species the right to love one another and make lots of cute monster babies, would you? Just imagine... the instant you lay eyes on each other, something stirs deep inside you, something you never felt before... and though you know that it's wrong, that no one would understand... you succumb to temptation, and when your sweaty bodies tangle together at last, all you can think about is how right it feels."

  Su fanned herself with her hand.

  "Goodness, that's..." Hermione shook her head so hard her hair whipped her pink cheeks. "Obscene! It's all good if there's love, but all you're doing is fetishizing non-humans!"

  Harry adopted an affronted expression. "Fetishizing? I simply don't discriminate between something as superficial as species. Do try to be more broad-minded."

**** It's from my crackfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb][/Weeb/]]. For context, Harry is a pervert with a thing for monster girls like mermaids, and this is his attempt to justify himself.

But on a more serious note, interbreeding is canon (at least with giants, goblins, and veela) so this theory makes sense to me.

** Yeah I have a similar theory. Hagrid and Maxime are much closer to human than giant. We don't know Fltwick's ancestry, but the only thing distinguishing him as goblin is his height. That suggests that the genome of magical creatures are generally recessive.

Likewise, the magical gene is probably recessive (like red hair). Muggleborns are possible, the same way brown-haired parents can produce a red-headed child. The 'creature-heritage' part is optional --- the magical gene could have occurred by mutation.

- This theory would imply that squibs aren't possible; they would have to be the result of infidelity. We do know that squibs are rare and shameful, so it's possible this is the case. Wizards don't have the best understanding of genetics but they can smell a rat when a wizard and witch produce a squib child.

(This [[https://www.livescience.com/59542-harry-potter-wizard-genetics.html][article]] suggests that the wizarding gene must be /dominant/ because giants can't perform magic, while Hagrid can. That's really weak reasoning --- genes can be suppressed or expressed differently depending on other genes. Maybe /all/ giants have the magic gene, which works along with the rest of their genome to make them ...giant.)

*** I'm inclined to believe that the wizarding gene is recessive. I do not think all Squibs are a product of affairs though, and I will explain below.

Epigentics time.

Basically, I think that very rarely, the magical gene can be turned off. This produces a Squib. Since I think all cases of accidental magic take place once the baby is born, we can assume for the sake of argument that the genes in question can very rarely be turned off during the pregnancy itself.

The result of this, is a 'magical' child... who cannot interact with magic. A Squib. This child will almost certainly go out into the non-magical world, to have a family and often times children, due to rejection in the magical world.

Now, these Squibs are still magical, its just turned off. They have the magic genes. They are now spreading the magic genes out into the general population. My theory would then be that, you need magical genes from /both/ parents (Squib ancestry somewhere back down both trees) and also a dash of luck during the pregnancy to re-activate the currently dormant magical gene.

** There was one interesting fic that talked about some type of DNA bit (I don't know biology) that is present in all humans but is turned "off" in muggles. Muggleborns happen when a pregnant(or not yet?) muggle encounters magic unknowingly, like a muggle repelling ward or an magical item they come in contact with, which switches the DNA bit "on". I thought it was cool, don't remember the name.

** I think your numbers are off, but this is what I've head canoned for ages.

The only difference I'd make is that, not all humans have magical creature DNA, probably the overwhelming majority do not. I suspect that all muggleborns have squibs in their ancestry, likely only a few generations back at most. After all, a lot of Squibs join non-magic society, and with the Statute of Secrecy it seems likely that they just wouldn't bother telling their children about a world those children couldn't really be a part of.

But yes, I agree that all witches and wizards are distantly descended from a variety of magical beings. Magic is not inherent to humans, its something that became part of a very small subset of humanity due to the interbreeding between non-magicals and magical beings in the distant past.

*** I always wondered about Genesis 6.2:

#+begin_quote
  [T]he sons of God saw that the daughters of humankind were beautiful. Thus they took wives for themselves from any they chose.
#+end_quote

That would explain that some human genealogical strains had some a little bit extra. “The sons of God” being probably some kind of angelic beings.

And from in-HP-Universe explanation I like linkffn(13022404).

**** Since Harry Potter is 'neutral' to the idea of Christianity, although it clearly implies there is some form of afterlife, I'd be inclined to stay away from specifically saying "Witches and Wizards are descended from angels."

That said, I think it makes as good an explanation as any, and interestingly doesn't technically contradict the hypothesis that 'all witches and wizards are descended from non-magicals and magical beings doing the nasty'. Since, angelic beings are probably magical.

Man never thought I'd be talking about angel sex when I got up this morning, lmao.

***** I am not forcing it on anybody, but let me just say that I find [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/religionless-universe-of-harry-potter.html][religionlessness of the HP Universe]] a bit shocking. How come the ultra-bookworm Hermione Granger in the nation with the established Church so at least minimal school education of the Bible doesn't recognize where “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” and “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” quotations come from and what they mean? Thus my headcanon that Grangers were secular Jewish family (although linkffn(6494461) is sweet, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/636071][“Hermione Before the Beit Din” by facingthenorthwind (spacegandalf)]] is at least interesting).
