What the title says. I've been reading mostly gen fics for the last few months, so I don't know it any good Harmony has been published at the the same time. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!


** Warning: the list below is very subjective and they are incomplete stories, in some of them the actual romance hasn't started yet.

linkffn(Of Time and Saints by Temporal Knight) -- from the author of "Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path"

linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona)

linkffn(Division of Power by Pyrrhical)

linkffn(Lord Hermione? by ALRYM)

linkffn(Right and Easy by TeamPotterForLife) -- was good until the actual romance. Bunch of cliches after.

linkffn(World Changer by Ariel Riddle)

#+begin_quote
  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

** "Right and Easy" is one I found a few days ago and (despite the lemons that began in more recent chapters, which are at least somewhat realistic) I've quite like it. linkffn(12720625)

I started a(n eventual) H/Hr fic, "Break the Limits". I'd like to think it's promising but I'm biased and it only has 2 chapters right now, heh. linkffn(12834801)
