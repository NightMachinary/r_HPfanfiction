(*Edit*: this post contains links to 101 seperate fics or fic series)

I recently made a post in which I shared from my library of fics every fic I had in the pairing of "Flowerpot" that being Harry/Fleur. It ended up being 40 fics in all and was quite well recieved. So, I decided to go ahead and go all the way. I have a fairly massive library of Harry centric fics, and thought I'd share them. Enjoy.

(PS. I just don't have enough time to write out the descriptions. If you want a full description ffnbot! Would be happy to get it for you.)

(PPS. Please keep in mind that not all fics are created equal, some are better than others, and some are worse. Appreciate them for what they are and you'll have a much better time than if you were being overly critical)

<HP>

why did I do this? It took forever and in the end I gain nothing from having taken the time to do this. So why did I? Because I love Harry Potter, and I want to share it with everyone.

I didn't list my entire library, many fics in it are not categorized by pairing but some other qualifier and as such don't fit in this post. Additionally I have folders for Harry/Hermione and Harry/Daphne but elected not to include them as they deserve their own post each.

<HP>

Yours truly, Valirys Reinhald

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.

** Decent lists. I would also recommend adding/reading these fics as well that seem to fit with your categories/preferences. Feel free to disregard as well though.

​

Harry/Fleur:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)
- linkffn(What You Leave Behind)

​

Harry/Luna:

- linkffn(Conlaodh's Song) (sequel to by the divining light)
- linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son) (this is a harem fic that bashes the idea of harems in general, but Luna is Harry's focus most of the time. Very dark fic.)
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure) (Luna is definitely OOC, but its still entertaining all things considered).

​

Harry/Daphne in your category:

- linkffn(Days to Come)
- linkffn(Contractual Obligation; Uncle Harry)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
