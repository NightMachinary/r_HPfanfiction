:END:
It's been years since I thought about this fic but for some reason I can't stop thinking about it. All I can remember is that it was either a reader insert or an OC story where the reader/OC made her own wands. The fic starts out talking about the wands she makes (because her brother had broken hers? and she needed to make a new one?). The reader/OC isn't muggleborn because of her affinity for making wands but I can't remember if the rest of her family follows her interest in wandmaking or not. I think they do but I can't be sure. It was definitely a love story set during Harry's time at Hogwarts but I can't remember who the reader/OC was paired up with, just that it was a male. Knowing what I read at the time means it was most likely Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Ron Weasley, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, or Neville Longbottom. I'm 90% sure this fic was on Wattpad and if anybody can help me find it I would greatly appreciate it!
