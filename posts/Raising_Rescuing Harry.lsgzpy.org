Or even good Dursley's/good Petunia.

I'm not a fan of Snape or Death Eater-centric fics.

Some of them that I've read (I have read a lot of them, so this might be useless)

I'm sure I've missed some. I would prefer complete works if possible. I already have a lot that I'm waiting on.

I appreciate any suggestions you could give! üòä

*** This story contains one of the most wonderful lines in all fanfiction stories:

#+begin_quote
  When Petunia was frustrated with Lupin's moping or Molly's frenetic energy, or the way Dudley tagged along behind the twins, Petunia would go tug the covering down off the portrait of Sirius's mother and they would scream at each other until Petunia felt her stomach settle.

**** My own favourite

"Dudley had big fists but clever fingers. His mother and her craning neck had taught him how to look. Being the kind of boy who people thought was stupid had taught him the importance of listening to everyone in a room. He was one of Fred and George's radio's best informants"

A really insightful look into the world, I love it. It's so sweet and interesting

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Ah, you're reading A Marauder's Plan, too? I'm on the 5th World Cup chapter, but I'm taking a break from it, reading some others because the chapters are SO DAMN LONG!!!

*** It really is. I read it a while ago, and it's good. It's just so long. If you like this and the Marauders, I would suggest reading a bond of family. The word count for the series is a lot, but it's broken down. I think there are like 30 parts to it.

**** Here's one I recommend that is sadly incomplete.

Harry Potter and the Dogfather. I'm on the second one, so I suggest reading the first one first. The second one hasn't been updated since October 30th of 2019. Can it really be considered to be on hiatus at this point?

You could say my (planned) series is, too, (My flair alludes to it) but I've just been updating really slowly. The motivation's there, progress has just been slow because the computer belonging to a co-writer I picked up (whom is even more green than me) died back in December. And he's getting a new one that he's making from scratch. Last ‚Äústatus report‚Äù from him through Discord was back towards the beginning of February: He's waiting for parts to get delivered.

***** It sounds like a hiatus to me. I haven't updated mine in a little over 3 weeks now because I'm stuck on the chapter I'm working on.

I have been waiting on Reclamation of Black Magic by Shayalonnie to be updated for so long. It is officially on hiatus, and even though I subscribe for updates, I keep checking back to see if anything changed üò≥.

****** Fanfiction.net, story's titled The Elder Scrolls of Ice and Fire. Screenname is VarnusJulius.

Generic name, I know, but I'm trying to think of something more original and inventive to change it to. But I'm hitting a wall there. Title of the planned series is A Song of Scrolls and Wizards.

Under the revised title, it should look something like this:

A Song of Scrolls and Wizards I: [Insert Subtitle Here]

And for Book 2:

A Song of Scrolls and Wizards II: Harry Potter and the [Insert Subject Here]

I'm thinking either ‚ÄòModern Roman' or ‚ÄòRoman Dragon'.

I actually wanna try to open Chapter 1 of that with a sort of prologue pertaining to a prophecy being delivered by an ancestor of Dumbledore to Julius Caesar and Mark Antony after the Battle of Alesia.

I'm probably gonna change my screenname, too. And eventually make an AO3 account to have it up there, too. Chapter 10 is actually mostly complete, too.

Admittedly, this subreddit is actually the first place I've publicly revealed that what I'm writing is going to eventually involve Harry Potter. I mean to present this as a question in the A/N to the next chapter if I should reveal this.

Also, pay attention for the words ‚ÄòConcealment Charm' in Chapter 3, and the words ‚ÄòMemory Charm' in Chapter 4. Subtle hinting at HP, it's part of the result of the... latest round of revisions.

** I suppose that does happen as a subplot in [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]], although the focus is more on Harry's interactions with the Weasleys than the Dursleys.

I read one recently where Petunia died suddenly, a heart attack or something like that, without having told Vernon about magic, and he ends up raising both boys himself, not doing a very good job and yet still being more concerned about Harry's well-being than in canon (which is, after all, such a very low bar). Can't remember the name now, though.
