So . . . how many of you have guilty pleasures and confessions to make?

I do. One of my favorite early fanfic reads was Cassandra Claire's first installment in her Draco Trilogy. I found her approach to Draco and Harry--at that time--to be refreshing and original. I even liked her treatment of Ron. Of course, subsequent events colored my opinions--but I still can't quite get that first fic out of my head.

I don't want to start a Cassie Claire flame-war, but I do want to know--what are your guilty pleasures? What stories do you love . . . really love . . . stories that stuck with you . . . that you somehow wish hadn't?

** Superpowered!Harry fics. I know he's really just at best a slightly-above-average wizard, but I can't help but love the fics where he outsmarts the Dursleys, befriends the goblins, reads the whole Black library in one weekend, works out every morning, kicks serious ass, and drinks Death Eater tears with breakfast.

** Well actually it's... most of fanfiction in general for me. In particular though it's those 'soul bond' fics. I just like to read them and I always do wish I could find more well-written, and complete stories in that genre.

**** Best complete one that I can think of is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][Bonds of Blood]]. Basically it's that the two people share a super deep link. In this case it's Harry/Ginny. I don't know how to best describe it, but it's enjoyable to read. Especially this one. There are some others, but they're not finished/abandoned.

That makes me sad.

** Oh, and I really do like the idea of Dramione, though Draco is a horrible, hateful, bigoted troll. There is something about their chemistry--their opposite natures--that promise a very compelling opportunity for character development. Granted, fic execution is often very poor.

But I swear the promise is there. I wouldn't ever root for them as a long term couple, but unrequited Draco!crush or some other kind of way of bringing them together could really create a great story.

** I love indulging in an outrageous concept now and then, like those stuck-on-a-desert-island, masquerade or Bachelor/Bachelorette plot fics. Something fun about the predictability and obligatory close contact, I suppose? I haven't actually read any that I thought were well-written, but they're pretty entertaining to turn a mind off to!

One of my fics is a total guilty pleasure to write; I write whatever I feel like at the moment into it and it's somehow morphed into this absurd trashing of fandom and fangirls. It's great fun :D

** pandame, always wishing this sub were more active and enjoying all the new posts. (: no worries!

Drarry is my guilty pleasure... Like k8_mcrmy, IRL people would die if they know. haha.

I started reading fanfics and quickly fell in love with Draco/Hermione. I've read a lot of the classics. Those are the ones that stick with me. (:

I still have them saved on 3.5" floppy disks somewhere...

** I feel in itself Drarry is my guilty pleasure, if my family knew and people irl they'd freak, I know my ex-boyfriend did but he was a brony so he couldn't say much :P

Turn by sara's girl is a story that has stuck with me....but because it is so inspiring, I'm even thinking of having a tattoo because of it like some of the other readers

** My reason for feeling guilty about the Cassie Claire fanfic has more to do with the fact that I still /like/ it even after the whole plagiarism debacle. ::sigh:: After all, I have taught college writing and had to punish/turn in/fail students for plagiarizing.
