I see a lot of Harry harem fics on this sub and was just wondering if there were any with Hermione having a harem. Or any with a female lead in general.

*** I'm reading that now, about ten chapters in, and it's a bit strange.

When Harry gets a harem, he is automatically in charge. He becomes the political and financial leader of his family. His partners manage the home, and sometimes they serve as sidekicks or backup when the going gets tough. At other times, he protects them.

Here, Hermione gets a harem, and Orion and Cygnus seem to be in charge. They handle the politics and finances, while Hermione picks the dishware and keeps track of the household's inventory and isn't allowed out without a minder.

The numbers are reversed, but the roles are not, so the effect is similar to reading about a harem headed by one of the Blacks where Hermione is one of the harem members.

It's still a less common perspective, but it could have been so much more.

  There are legends among the pureblood families about Keepers-special witches who have the power to restore a fallen House. If any House needed a Keeper, it's the Ancient and Noble House of Black. Hermione/Multi (Cygnus, Orion, Sirius AND Regulus). Polyandry.
