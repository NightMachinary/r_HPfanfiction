Heya!

I'm looking for fics where post war Harry returns to Hogwarts to teach in one of the classes. Don't care about pairings that much for this topic.

Cheers :D

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

** The second of frombluetored's series It's TeaTime is Put Your Curse in Reverse, and its set after CC. Harry decides to finally take up Mcgonagalls offer to teach at Hogwarts, where his 3 children are students. Great writing, love the OC's, most of which are the Potter kids friends, and they continue in the third story. Slash for Scorbus is included but nothing NSFW. Link is for first story in series
