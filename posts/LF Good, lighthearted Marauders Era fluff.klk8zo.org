Would prefer James/Lily


** There's a few oneshots?

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13779576/1/Independent-of-Time]]) linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13772250/1/Dorm-Rule-Number-79]])

Both are essentially craic fics. The first, James gets antlers stuck on his head in the dorm and can't fix it. The second is the boys replying to words on the Marauders map. They're easy reads.

Edit... I don't know what the bot is doing...

  ""Here's the thing about Magic, it doesn't care. It doesn't care that it's a map. Doesn't care for time, or logic or reason. Someone spoke to the map, so the map showed the words. it didn't care who to... or when to..."" / A oneshot from the other side of Snape's interaction with the Marauders Map in PoA. And why the Map never spoke again.

  "Well what's the alternative Moony? That James is secretly a giant deer, don't be ridiculous." Sirius said sarcastically. "Besides, from Lily's perspective, permanently sticking antlers to his head is a very 'James' thing to do." / "Trust me, after this there's going to be a very strict 'No transformations in the bedroom' rule." A oneshot craic!fic for the fun of it!
