  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

**** it's a crack fic, obviously. and a very amusing one. primarily a HP/Marvel crossover with some other stuff thrown in for shits and giggles occasionally. i was on my phone earlier, so i didn't post a link.
