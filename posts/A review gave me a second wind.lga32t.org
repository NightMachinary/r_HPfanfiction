I just wanted to say thank you to all those who leave nice not necessarily detailed reviews but longer than "good" I visited my HP Fic to reread it and saw a missed review that basically asked why more people hadn't read it and my style of prose is nice to read. It spurred me into a 2nd wind and its all thanks to some kind words


** I always try to leave reviews when I really enjoy a fic, especially if it's unfinished. A lot of the time I'm sure it never gets noticed, but it's nice to think that my stumbling compliments will make someone feel nice

** I would also like to say thank you to everyone who takes the time to leave comments. I've been really lucky with some great fic readers who have kept me going with a few simple words. It's made me return the favor and leave detailed responses whenever I read a story now instead of ghost reading like I used to.
