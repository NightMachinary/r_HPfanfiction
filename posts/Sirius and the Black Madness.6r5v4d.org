I am looking for fics where someone realizes that Sirius is actually crazy and has more than a bit of the Black Madness in him. It's obvious to me when he tried to get Snape into the Shrieking Shack that he had problems, and Azkaban couldn't have helped. In the books and fanfic as well, the "madness" that runs in his family is overlooked, and he seems either emotionally healthy or kind of endearingly odd. Are their fics like this out there? Bonus if the stories have Remus or Harry figure it out.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): after eating Wormtail, Sirius had no choice but to join Voldemort later, and he seemed to honestly enjoy mayhems and destructions along side the Dark Lord. Hagrid also joined Death Eaters when Voldemort broke him along his minions out of Azkaban.

******** I don't think you understand... Let's pretend for a second that he is thinking rationally. Which he isn't. If Sirius somehow manages not to get kissed in the process, what happens when Pettigrew gets brought in? He says five little words... "I was hiding from him" and that's gg for Sirius given what we see of the farce judical system so that's that idea out of the way. What you've got left is either letting Pettigrew live, keeping him prisoner somewhere himself, or killing him. I'd like to stress that Pettigrew is /not/ someone he can leave alive and free or with any chance of getting free. We don't see much of it in canon, but Pettigrew is someone who can go anywhere and do /anything./ Nobody thinks twice if they see a rat and unless there is some way to magically rat proof your house you're utterly fucked because he /will/ find a way in. Lose track of him and he's nearly impossible to track.

tl;dr Pettigrew lives and everyone is mega-turbo-fucked.

This is a little incoherent but hopefully it gets the point across since I don't have the patience right now to edit it down.

A big possibility is that he may use the three unforgivables. But certainly not have him in his stomach. Think about it, would Sirius /eat/ *Pettigrew* of all people? The thought is disturbing. Besides, he is too disgusted by him to even let pettigrew touch him let alone live in his stomach (he's technically dead).

** I wouldn't really say that Sirius is mad because he tried to see how suicidal Snape was.

Did he tried to get Snape to meet a werewolf? Yes.

Is this a sign of madness? Probably not. He's just a teenager who does not really think about the long term consequences of his actions.

Is Snape at fault because he was stupid enough to walk through the magical equivalent of a minefield clearly set up to keep someone out and expect no danger behind it? Yes. Imagine sneaking through a minefield surrounding a military base because someone told you how to get around the mines. The guards inside could still shoot first and ask questions later. And the magical world is a lot more dangerous than what we know. Or at least I have never heard of a high school where people are taught to use potentially lethal weapons and have access to more than enough highly potent chemicals to build devastating IEDs from the age of eleven with shockingly little oversight.

You have to remember that Snape at this point openly supported the pureblood cause and already called his best friend a racial slur while she defended him. His entire social circle besides Lily were radical bigots that more or less openly supported either genocide or at the very least deportation/enslavement of those they deemed unworthy of magic. The dick move on Sirius part was not to bait Snape into the Shrieking Shack but that Remus was inside it. But then again, teenagers do an incredible amount of stupid shit without thinking. He saw it as a way to get rid of his nemesis and did not think far enough to consider what would happen to his friend.

Snape's potential death or lasting injury would not have been a reason to shed tears at this point . With his prodigious abilities with potions there were few closed doors for him. He could have left the country and found employment everywhere. He has a wand. He could have made his way on any plane or ship without getting noticed. But he chose to join a racially motivated terrorist organisation which he supported and sympathised with for some time. He is not opposed to their members despite their attitudes. Ask yourself, could you be friends with someone who openly supports ISIS or the KKK? Would you spend enough time making nice with them to catch on to their ideology? Snape could and that says more than enough about his character.

Wrong. The Werewolf Prank happened before Snape's Worst Memory. He hadn't called Lily anything and even if he had, attempted murder is not justified. Also nearly getting Snape killed was not enough for Sirius to stop bullying him when he was bored. I think there were signs of mental instability already there.

Are you seriously justifying Sirius trying to get Snape killed because of what he could do later and the fact that no one would miss him? That is really fucked up.

**** It happened before he called /Lily/ a mudblood. To me it sounded like he barely made a teeny little exception for her. Even Lily knew that he wanted to be a death eater before that incident, and have been making excuses for continuing their friendship for quite a while...

Snape knew - or at least had a very good idea of - what awaited him on the other end, and for all we know, Sirius could have underestimated his desire to out Remus. (We only hear about it in hindsight from a Sirius who was clouded by the hate he felt for Wormtail at that moment.)

***** This is all fine but I still don't get how it is okay for Sirius to send Snape to a Werewolf. Snape was not a Death Eater yet. Even if he did call other people mudbloods, how does that make it okay for Sirius to try to murder him?

And as far as we know Snape had suspicions of Remus. We don't know what those suspicions were. At that point in time, the Marauders had been bullying him for years and he was likely seeking dirt on them. Sirius then thought it would be funny to have Snape come in direct contact with Remus on the full moon, a fact he shows no remorse for even decades later. The idea that he purposely went to get killed by a Werewolf is preposterous.

****** Sirius wasn't exactly taught the difference between right and wrong by mummy and daddy, and therein lies the issue; it doesn't have to be genetic.

Sirius might have been a bit of a bully, and James and Snape had some sort of Lily-based rivalry going on (both hated the thought of Lily spending time with the other), but there are no definite canon proof that Snape was mercilessly bullied constantly by the quartet of Gryffindors.

Most fics have Remus and James reacting very harshly at it though. James wouldn't have saved Snape's life if he was half the bully that Severitus fans make him, and they probably had to convince Remus not to quit school, or worse, take his life.

Snape knew very well that he was a werewolf. He's not that stupid - well, he was stupid enough to listen to someone like Sirius, who doesn't exactly wish him well.

What do you think Snape's Worst Memory was if it wasn't merciless bullying?

The chapter says that he reacted so fast it was like he was expecting it, proving that it wasn't a one time thing. They attacked him while he was leaving, choked him with soap and then flipped him upside down exposing his underwear. They called him Snivellus from the first train ride. Pottermore explicitly calls it relentless bullying. And again, this is after the "prank". Like, I get being immature. But shouldn't that have set some boundaries? How are they able to go back to bullying him like nothing happened?

That's the thing. We don't know what Snape thought. All he knew was that they were upto something (which they were, letting Remus loose while he was transformed in Hogsmeade) and Sirius took it as chance to push Snape further. He was with Remus as an animagus during transformations. He knew full well what a Werewolf was capable of.

For the record, Sirius is one of my favourite characters as is Snape. But people tend to whitewash Sirius's flaws far more than Snape's. They were all shits. But the idea that Snape was somehow /asking/ to get bullied and murdered is disgusting.

It's not whitewashing, and I'm not implying that what Sirius did was OK, because it very well wasn't, but there has to be more about it than Snape being poor and ugly. Maybe he implied it one time too many in Sirius presence - he might even have sought out Sirius alone, since James got wind of it almost too late -, and Sirius just snapped and blurted it out? I mean, it doesn't have to have been attempted murder.

**** Whoa hold up I am pretty sure that Snape attempting to discover Remus's secret happens year 6 since they only mastered the animagus transformation in year 5. Second Snape clearly suspicious that Remus is a werewolf thus Snape is complicit in the act therefor it is suicide not murder. Yes Severus Snape is evil and everyone would be better off if he had died and no one found out how. Think about it for a second how much better his life would have been thrown up with James and Lily instead of the abusive dursleys. Let Snape die it's for the greater good.

***** There was a conversation between Snape and Lily in DH which implies that the werewolf incident took place before Snape's Worst Memory:

#+begin_quote
  ‘What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?' demanded Snape. His colour rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

  ‘What's Potter got to do with anything?' said Lily.

  ‘They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?'

  ‘He's ill,' said Lily. ‘They say he's ill --'

  ‘Every month at the full moon?' said Snape.

  ‘I know your theory,' said Lily, and she sounded cold. ‘Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?'

  ‘I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.'

  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.

  ‘They don't use Dark Magic, though.' She dropped her voice. ‘And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there --'

Who's to say Voldemort wouldn't have eventually killed James and Lily without Snape passing him the prophecy? Or that he wouldn't have gotten the prophecy another way?

Or, better yet, maybe if Snape died and Voldemort never heard of the prophecy, he might have eventually won the war instead of dashing himself against Harry's plot armor just a few years into it.

**** Wasn't the worst memory at the end of fifth year while the werewolf incident was early sixth? Because that's what the fandom wiki says. And that makes the difference between possibly killing an innocent and potentially killing a sympathiser if not a supporter of a genocidal maniac with a racist ideology. The first is a despicable act while the second one is what happens if people stand up to genocide.

And let's not forget that even before both incidents Snape had shady friends that creeped out Lily. Even beforehand Snape was having no issues hanging out with bigots and already had a hard on for the dark arts.
