Not necessarily evil, just constantly figuring out the most effective way to achieve their goals, no matter how ethical. Kidnap and impersonate classmates. Self activating disfiguring curse on all co-conspirators. Deadly laser charm to burn straight through enemies who didn't cast a highly specialized shield charm. All-consuming replicating transfiguration nanobots. Gemino cursed Napalm.

No need to suggest The Arithmancer or anything from Starfox5, those I've already read.


** She's scary in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822&rewrite=true][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. The following conversation happens shortly after the Death Eater attack on Bill and Fleur's wedding, held in France:

#+begin_quote
  And perhaps she was not subtle enough, because her boss finally said, “Ms. Granger, please do not attempt to capture any more Death Eater tech, a term Charlie apparently picked up from you and your team. The French captured two cube vans with full-sized mind-control systems, and both were boobytrapped. Both exploded while DPSD boffins were studying the equipment in situ. Both vans were destroyed, and the French forces nearby were contaminated with radioactive materials.”

  Hermione checked, “Just vans destroyed, men in the vans killed, and a small radiation clean-up site around the explosion?”

  ”Ms. Granger, that sort of threat does not go with the word ‘just'.”

  She insisted, “I beg your pardon sir, but it does. Those devices probably have several kilos of possibly-fissionable material as a power source. If I was designing those boobytraps, I would aim for a low-grade nuclear detonation, say a tenth of a kiloton up to half a kiloton.”

  There was a long pause before he finally said, “Ms. Granger, I would quite appreciate it if you would refrain from becoming our next supervillain or domestic terrorist.”

*** I've never read this, but I'll second it purely based on the author.

I will say that it's also a non-Magic AU, but that it takes place in a world that eventually joins her massive crossover series, League of Extraordinary Women, or something like that. It's honestly one of the best pieces I've ever read, bringing in a semi-canon HP world, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a spinoff DC Comics universe, The Six Million Dollar Man, Stargate SG-1, and The Secret Life of Alex Mack (from early 90s Nickelodeon). You can read HGatBWL on its own, but I cannot recommend the rest of the series highly enough.
