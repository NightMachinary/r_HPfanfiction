Hi, I'm looking for some good crossovers from any site. I don't mind any Romance as long as it's not slash. I'd rather the main character be Harry.


** linkffn(8933408)

Is the best one I've personally read, and it's average at best. Definitely a "Harry solves everything through sex or passing out" type of story. But it does have it's interesting bits, and it's worth reading if you can see past its faults.

  A Weapon. A Hero. But now... a loose end. Harry Potter resolves to destroy the enemies who betrayed him on his terms, only to find all his plans torn asunder when he's summoned to a new world plagued with the same enemies as his own.

**** It's marked complete, but that's because the author took a 4/5 year break on it, and "came back", continuing the story in a different posted story. The story just stops and is split, so this "part one" isn't even a self contained thing.

  Sick and tired of the magical world, Harry decides he needs a drastic change of scenery, and what's a more drastic change than an entirely new world? On to the next great adventure!

  He fought their battles for them. He led the resistance for them. He won the war for them. It made him strong. Strong enough to be called the Incarnation of Magic itself. Far too strong for their liking. He asked for peace. They called him a Dark Lord. The Master of Death decided enough was enough.
