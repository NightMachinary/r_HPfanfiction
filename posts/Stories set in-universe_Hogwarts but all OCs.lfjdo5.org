Forgive me if this is a frequent or obvious question, it's just that Google is so drowned in Potter and fanfiction terms that it can't seem to answer me.

Is there a branch of stories in which a whole cast of original students attends Hogwarts? So, the writer uses the setting, some of the teachers, the lessons and so on, and follows their own characters through an original story?

I see many stories using the book/canon characters, as well as some that insert an OC into the tale to interact with them, but I've not yet found one set in Hogwarts which simply inserts some new students and formulates a whole new tale.

I mean, someone must surely have done this. The upcoming Hogwarts legacy game shows a great enthusiasm for a Hogwarts story without Potter or the Riddle-related events, and the Hogwarts Mystery mobile game takes the setting, the teachers and a couple of canon students but populates the classroom with new characters, as well as a new plot. "Wizarding World" fanfic, perhaps?

Any examples? Also, is there a way to describe this kind of tale? I tried "original OC" but that just brings back original characters inserted into the traditional Potter/Volde story.


** Not really. You'd be most likely to find stuff through the 'original OC' or 'non-canon plot' type searches (or 'stuff like Alexandra Quick' in fic searches) but there's no specific term.

Most people are into fanfiction because they liked the canon and want to see more of it or different versions of it or a specific change made to it. Not really a wide swathe of interest in 'completely new plot and characters but in the same setting', especially in Harry Potter where the setting is basically only made up of stuff that supports Rowling's plot and very little else.

*** This has actually quite surprised me. Like I say, I was inspired by the concept of the HPHM game, which is Hogwarts-set but a different plot and characters. Seems a perfectly natural extension. Yet in all the years of Potter and of fanfic writing, all the millions of stories, only a handful of people have ever gone 'I'll write an original story set in Hogwarts'?

I wonder if people have but there is no platform for it, or perhaps the work is posted more in arenas of roleplay?

I was considering writing something, but it seems it would be a struggle to find an audience.

**** Pretty much, yeah. Like I said, not many people think "I wanna write about Hogwarts" rather than "I wanna write about the Golden Trio".

Probably also elements of the fanfiction structure in there too, come to think of it - we're amateurs and we're already building off other people's work in everything but story, so taking away that ease of (lack of) design-needs to have to make all new characters (which is one of the hardest elements of writing, IMO) could feel a bit masochistic to most.

And it wouldn't struggle any more than anything else. Getting an audience in this fandom is pretty much threefold - publicity (ie. post your story to multiple places and rec it in request threads), time (the big fics have generally been around a few years at this point), and decent writing (the fewer typos the better, and pace things decently).

Being different is also a help, but people differ on what exactly counts as 'different', so I'm not including it in my main three. :)

It's important to remember that this sub is not representative of the fandom as a whole. Not everyone is here, and we tend to skew more male than female (which is flipped for the rest of fandom). Even if it wouldn't be something people here are interested in, there will be an audience somewhere.

** Hard to find stuff like this at Hogwarts. *A Squib at Hogwarts*, *Nimbus Albacore and the Curse of Blood*, and *Hide My Name In Fear* are pretty far enough away from canon events that they should fit your criteria. *Betrayed*, which is one of the strangest fics I've ever read, also works, although it has Harry in it. They're all readable, I didn't find any of them really exceptional.

*Hogwarts Houses Divided*, *The Divide*, and *Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake* are all set at Hogwarts in between book 7 and the epilogue, so you get some canon characters but the students are mostly OCs. These are all quite good.

Alexandra Quick is on another level and I highly recommend it. It's not set at Hogwarts, but still in the Wizarding World (America), and it's easily the best mostly-OC story in the fandom.

**** Can you be clearer about what you're looking for? Is it original stories in the Harry Potter universe, or is it "all OCs"? You bring up Hogwarts Mystery, but it has heaps of canon characters in prominent roles: various Weasleys, Tonks, Hagrid, Snape, other teachers... Even Dobby becomes your friend.

There are plenty of original stories that aren't treading the same old ground of Harry fighting Voldemort, but they do tend to focus on canon characters. The responses you're getting here are avoiding those, however, because of what you said about "all OCs"

***** Original in the universe, yes. Basically where Hogwarts is the setting, but the principal student characters are OP. The teachers are part of the setting, so they stay. I agree HPHM has canon characters, but they're secondary to the central plot. Stories set outside the canon eras - 1950s, 20o0s, for example.

I'm not looking to read, really, but more to determine how popular the genre is. I thought it'd be more so.

** I can't honestly think of any off the top of my head perfectly. There's some next-gen fics that uses the offspring we see in the epilogue (who in canon we don't really get to know) but that often also brings the original characters into the fold as the parental figures, so not sure if that would fit your bill. If it does, perhaps Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity might suit your needs, or the James Potter series by G Norman Lippert

There's also the Alexandra Quick series (again by Inverarity) which is only OCs (so far) and Wizarding America before Rowling started talking about what Wizarding America was like. So not Hogwarts, but also very much no OC inserted in an established story.

Then again, my knowledge of fanfiction isn't that broad, so I'm sure some other people here could hopefully put you in the right direction

*** Amazing! I'm happy to give the first a read if you like.

Do you find there is a small "Hogwarts fic" community out there? I'd have thought if nothing else the FB movies and/or the Hogwarts Legacy trailer would have got a few people writing 1890 or 1920 stories, just for fun. Hogwarts and the wizarding world is a fun setting, why not let some new students explore - though I agree there's a big challenge as a writer to get the reader to care quickly about your cast, but that's part of the fun and the attraction for me.

** I am late to this party, but I guess my story fits this niche. I actually started writing it BEFORE the mobile game (which I just heard about like two months ago and got kind of excited for - still haven't played it, is it good?) came out, and was really surprised that there weren't a lot of stories that deal with the time period between the wars. Mine follows Charlie's class (mostly OC's) through the Hogwarts years, with a lot of focus on the world beyond. It is, admittedly, not very focused on classes/relationships, but the wizarding world as a whole.

I'm going to save this thread and look up these stories because I really love the original tales that get told involving OC's thrown into the magical world at different points in canon.
