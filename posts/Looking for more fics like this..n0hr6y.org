I am looking for more fics like the Harry Potter and The Artificer Legacy by Kairomaru. If anyone has more fics like these, do link them. It was a really nice fic, if you haven't read it, here is the link. The best part about the fic is that harry is an artificer (one who makes artifacts) and he is quite good at that. He is sorted into Ravenclaw. There are very less fics about harry having an interest before going to hogwarts. He makes quite good artifacts and there is a very detailed description about his failures, artifacts and rules. The pairing is also unique with Penelope Clearwater, Nymphadora Tonks and Fleur Delacour.

** In Requests like this you really should write WHAT is so awesome about the story you liked, otherwise we don't know what you are looking for. Our Divination skills are mostly pretty poor, so we don't see into your head what you liked about the story. Was it passionate love between Terry Boot and a Blast-Ended Skrewt (they are females)? Detailed description of the distillery process of Firewhisky? What was so awesome?

** Harry being an artificer sounds pretty interesting, but that pairing is a no go for me. Too bad it's not a gen fic. The only thing I can think of is a D&D crossover Harry Potter and the Girl in Red, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6835726/chapters/15603322]], where the main character from the D&D world is an artificer.

** So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

I recommend it to you because Harry was sorted into Raveclaw and invents spells and he get's recruited by the Ministry to work as an Unspeakable which is also touched upon in detail

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

#+begin_quote
  HP/LV Slow Burn. Major AU. Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
