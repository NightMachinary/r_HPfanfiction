Looking for the scariest, most badass female villains. Preferably longer and well written.


** linkffn(The Human Condition by C.K Talons)

There you go. This is a post-Hogwarts, post-OttP story featuring Auror!Harry and a new female villain. It's a mystery with noir-ish themes and from what I remember the author was capable in creating a tense, urgent atmosphere throughout the story.

Actually written by a published fiction author, though years before she got published.

** Linkffn(Reverse by Lady Moonglow) has a good female villain. Not going to say who it is but it becomes obvious soon enough.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** in general? or HP specific? cause if your looking for Harry potter, you are pretty much out of luck. I would hardly count Umbridge as bad-ass, and I would say she is the most prominent female antagonist in the entire series.
