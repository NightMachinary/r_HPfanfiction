I am looking for a story i read a while back, I was able to remember the basics and got a summary from someone who also recalled more information but not the name or author:

Harry didn't know anything about magic, and worked as a cook at like a diner in a small town. It was winter, Hermione was running away from Death Eaters because they had taken over the country or were at least operating openly. She was starving and offered Harry her body for food. Instead, Harry took her home and shared his dinner with her. Hermione finds out who he is, and tells him that he's famous, all about magic, and that he has a mountain of gold in Gringotts. It ends with them planning to get to Gringotts and get his money. i think it was part of a one shot collection


** yo did you ever figure out what fic this is because it sounds cool
