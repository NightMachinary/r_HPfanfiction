Like the title implies, what is some truly sick stuff you've read?

You know...

Stuff like the classic "Hogwarts x Giant Squid", or the story where dog!Sirius uh...passes the time with Kretcher, or that beauty where Harry discovers his true love is Hedwig.

I'm in the mood for depravity, ya'll. (Actually, I just honestly want to see how horrible this fandom really is. Any pair, any genre...let's get the mental scarring started!)

** In the FFN filters, under the character section, look for stories with inanimate objects or animals as main characters and you'll find tons of fucked up fics. However, I'd say Barnes Potter vs Harry Potter is one of the weirdest fics I've seen.
