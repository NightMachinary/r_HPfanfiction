Basically, something with a dark protagonist, but without the mary sue stuff Jen seems to come out with. Preferably no bashing in general, but especially Dumbledore bashing. I'm sick to bloody death of Dumbledore bashing.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  let me be the first to list out a number of reasons why this pairing sucks while contributing absolutely nothing to the conversation and not helping the OP in any way at all

I'm waiting...

(Also the OP isn't about a pairing)
