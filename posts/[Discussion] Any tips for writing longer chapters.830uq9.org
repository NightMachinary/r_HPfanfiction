I usually write between 1,000 and 2,000 words by first planning out the dialogue, and then setting the rest of the scene. But my readers are demanding longer chapters, and I'd like it, too. So, any tips?

Edit: I had a link to my story as an example, but I'm in a mutual hate relationship with technology, so it's not working.


** Mostly a chapter should be about as long as you want it to be. It should accomplish exactly what you want it to accomplish. The length doesn't particularly matter.

That being said, perusing through said story, you're work is almost entirely dialogue. If you want to add length to this you could expand the conversations, have the characters talk about things other than the topic at hand, have conversations develop and then get to the plot, rather than just being entirely plot.

You can also add in more prose. Again, it's almost all dialogue, and quick dialogue at that. Another way to add in length would be to write more prose about the scenes, the characters, or the general goings ons around them.

You could also add in a more omniscient narration, if you wanted, to detail more specific character thoughts to certain situations. That being said, the limited narration does work on it's own, so it's not really necessary in my opinion. But it is a way to add word count.

*** Another tip with dialogue is to imagine the scene being played out with your favourite actors and actresses in the parts. What would they do? How would they react to what they hear? Adding some of that to a scene can really help with characterisation as well as pushing up the word count.

** Don't feel obligated to hit a set number of words. If it flows well then there is no reason to change. You are the author not your readers. The moment you change formats they will demand more frequent updates, you can't please everyone.

Outline! Make sure you hit everything you wanted to happen.

Ask yourself questions. What was this chapter supposed to accomplish? Did it? How does this progress characterization/plot?

TLDR: Short or long, the quality of a chapter is not determined by words but of content.

** I totally agree with [[/u/moomoogoat][u/moomoogoat]]. You're the writer, therefore you're in charge. We've all seen that movie where that last 20 minutes was completely unnecessary or read the book with the pointless filler. Quality will always top quantity and having a clear idea of where the story is going is key. If you're really worried about chapter length, try combining chapters, but that may not always work depending on the action.

As for advising you on your writing directly, the story link you provided doesn't seem to work.

** In addition to what the others said: Think if you can merge two chapters and if the story still makes sense that way.I noticed that it sometimes works better if I do that.

** I try to introduce three plots to chapters.

Plot a is the main plot: e.g., harry has the top cow power of the darkness. How does this affect the story? Plot a takes the whole story to be resolved.

Plot b is taken care of over a number of chapters. For above, it's a project. Making satchels, learning what fabrics to use, the spells, and so on.

Plot c is chapter specific. THat chapter introduces a specific element that really pnly affects that chapter. I.e., harry introducing BINGO to Hogwarts. This c plot affects a plot but can easily be left out or just glossed over but i write the story partially as a slice of life as much as an adventure.

Think of it like star trek ds9. We see sisko slowly coming to accept he's the emissary over the whole series. Specific episodes are c plot basically while arcs like the dominion war are b plot taking place over chapters/episodes.

It's angst-y and about Remus finally taking a role in Harry's life.
