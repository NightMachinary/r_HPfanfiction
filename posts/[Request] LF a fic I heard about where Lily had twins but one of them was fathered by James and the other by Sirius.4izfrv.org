** I was literally just reading one called Midnight Sun where Lily had twins but both James and Sirius were the fathers. Wasn't a triad fic though.

*** I remember reading Midnight Sun. For some reason I remembered it being several hundred thousand words, but it's only like, 80,000.

Decent enough fic, fairly cliche but not horrendous.

**** True lol but I seem to have found myself wanting to read all these clich√© fics so I don't mind it much.

It definitely seemed longer than it really was but I'm totally ok with that too =p

***** Yeah, I love those kinds of fics. Definitely a guilty pleasure for me. Plus Sirius is a main character, I can't get enough good Sirius.

** ...also biologically impossible? Twins would imply being birthed at the same time, coming from the same egg. You can't have two sperm impregnate the same egg as far as I know.

Well, whatever. I want to read it too, now.

*** there's more than one type of multiple pregnancy/birth. when a single fertilized egg splits, they're monozygotic/identical. dizygotic/fraternal multiples come from different eggs.

it's incredibly unlikely for two separate "donors"/fathers to be involved in one pregnancy, but it's technically possible. we won't get into how. of course, in this case the explanation only has to be "magic did it."

*** It is scientifically posssible for twns to have different fathers. Look it up.

*** Only identical twins come from the same egg. Fraternal twins (as would be the case here), come from two different eggs.... not that this makes this scenario more plausible? And furthermore, not that scientific plausibility really matters.

OP: Sounds interesting! Do you know where you heard of it? That might be a good place to start tracking it down.
