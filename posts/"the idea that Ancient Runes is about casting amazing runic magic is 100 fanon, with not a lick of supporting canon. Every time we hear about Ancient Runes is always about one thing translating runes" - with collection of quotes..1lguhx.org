** The same could be said for Arithmancy, which JKR said in an interview to be little more than a bit of numerology and fortune telling. Yet Arithmancy proficiency is a prerequisite for the Curse Breaking profession, indicating some utility beyond her WOG pronouncement.

Unlike magical cores, which have no basis whatsoever in canon, both Arithmancy and Ancient Runes at least warrant a mention in the story as options for career-minded types at the premier magical school. It's entirely plausible to invent some kind of utility for them, such as jbern's use of runes in setting up wards* in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]]. I find their fanon adoption to be somewhat less of a stretch than frittering over the sizes of characters' respective magical +codpieces+ cores.

*Incidentally, wards are also a fanon invention.

*** Wards* specifically yes, but what would you call surrounding a campsite with charms to keep people away and keep what is inside hidden?

Would you say you are "warding" off muggles / people?

And if you look at the 8th movie, or the battle of Hogwarts in general. Casting a self sustaining shield that can fend off multiple magical attacks without further intervention of the caster... Warding against attack.

Calling them "wards" is just short hand. If you can find a way to tie those charms and protective spells into something like a layline (assuming they contain magic), then they become permanent fixtures. Why not charge some runes to power them? Why not need a math of a sort, to calculate what type of runes and how much power will be needed?

**** Fair point, though one could say merely that I am casting charms upon the campsite to ward off muggles/people. Harry Potter canon already has charms, which are incredibly flexible bits of magic. Why bother inventing a whole separate subtype of charms and give it a different name when it's essentially the same thing?

As for the 8th movie, I never saw it and like most do not regard the films as canon anyway. Charmed shield clothing were canon (sold by the WWW) and covered without resorting to inventing a new kind of magic.

But I honestly don't mind the ward bit of fanon that much more than I do the logical extension of Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, since ward-like charm spells were certainly canon. It's certainly nice to know what canon says on the matter of any of these things, but these are perfectly logical extensions of the world.

When the magical system is made vastly different though, and I'd contend any story with Magical CoresÂ® is as vast a difference as Miranda's invention of Thread Magic and Blood Magic for her stories, then it should be identified for the reader early on that the tale is vastly AU. Not everyone likes reading stories so far away from canon. For many of them, surprise cores are about as welcome as surprise slash among principal characters.

***** I try to stay away from "cores" as an actual physical thing when writing, but they don't usually bother me much in reading.

I tend to think of magic along the lines of the ability to affect physics at the quantum level (where pretty much anything is possible), and that the ability to use magic is something like telepathy or telekinesis, a physical ability that is paranormal but not unexplaneable.

"Sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, and inversely, sufficiently explained magic is indistinguishable from science."

The "core" of a person could be their soul, and the ability to use "more" magic than someone else could be a physical trait (some are born with greater ability to use it, the same way that some are born with better genetics to be a runner), but that with time and training most people can catch up...that person born with a gift though, may always stay ahead of the game just because they had a head start.

Any metaphysical representation of a large "pool" of magic inside of someone could be just how they (or someone else) perceive their ability to channel it before they exhaust themselves. A "fractured" or "broken" core could just mean that they have gone past their limits, and will no longer be able to channel at the same level. (ie brain damage causing diminished mental capacity, bone or tendon damage causing diminished physical capacity) Fracturing the core, could just be seen as "did something that hurt the ability to use magic".

There is nothing cannon that states that magic is something that is all around us (not within us) and that anyone can be trained to use it. It is much more about the person themselves having some innate ability or characteristic which allows them to use magic. Which lends itself to a "core" idea.

I do agree though, that simply having a larger magical core than someone else which means, all other things being equal, that you just have to outlast them in a fight...is pretty annoying.

I may not have explained all of this in my stories, but I do typically try to stay away from "he's just more powerful, of course he won"...unless that was sort of a cliche joke...

As for Miranda...I love those stories, but they practically cease to be HP a couple chapters in (going so far as to change Harry's name). I don't have any problem with AU, as long as I know what I'm getting into. But I don't really consider the idea of a magical core to be AU...unless they go down the road of actual magical capacity.

** Even if Runes are just a language that does not mean that it can not be used to cast magic. The core of the Harry Potter magic system is that language is used to cast magic.

** Ancient Runes is a medium. While a medium itself doesn't do much, the spells it contains might. I have taken Ancient Languages in school and unless you go to become a priest (which is sadly not possible, being female) there's not much to do with Latin either. However, the texts we translate and the ideas in it, that's what makes it worthwhile.

*** That's a nice concept, but the point of this was to clearly distinguish canon from fanon.
