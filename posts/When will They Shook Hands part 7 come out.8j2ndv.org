Title says it all. Im new to HP fanfic world.


** It took almost eight months between Part 5 and Part 6, and over three years between starting 6 and finishing it. Plan on it being a while. I would bet on 2019 at the earliest given their posting rate. Maybe a teaser chapter in late 2018.

I am also not sure the author posts here. Send them a message on FFN and ask for a better timeline.

Finally, if you're new to fanfic, there are several “Harry in Slytherin” options to tide you over till Dethryl finishes. Check the wiki (on right) and the recs page. Good luck.
