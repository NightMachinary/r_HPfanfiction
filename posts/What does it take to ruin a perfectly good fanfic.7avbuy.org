We all have them, perfect little gems in a sea of lesser stones that you fall in love with (Why the hell don't you like it you b@$#%&) yet there comes a /&$%# that ruins the fic for you? What is it for you that ruins a good fic?

For me, It's Slash, too much bashing, Harem, Convenient OPness, 'we luv humans' goblins, falling in love within two chapters and a single dialogue and harems. (I will neither criticize nor blame anyone for liking them, except for harems, I criticize you.)


** Stories where nothing happens, i.e fluff that describes the happily ever after part. Reading a whole novel of someone else's happily ever after is just boring and if I'm a third of the way through and nothing's happened beyond like people getting married, getting jobs, having babies, buying houses, etc. I'm done. Also, I don't care how amazing your story is, if it's got bad spelling, mixed up homonyms, poor formatting (like for dialogue), bad grammar, or you ate a thesaurus trying to sound smart, I'm not reading more than a chapter. It could be the most original epic world-shattering story ever, but not if I can't read it because my brain stutters every other sentence from past/passed type errors or bad spelling or whatever.

** For me, the biggest issue is poor dialogue. I know dialogue is hard to write so I definitely do give a lot of leeway, but sometimes I just encounter those stories where every single character basically speaks in the same voice. Like you have dialogue for Harry, Dumbledore, Mad Eye, and Bellatrix Lestrange, but they're all basically just mouthpieces for an author to deliver information and there's no characterization to their voices.

The other big issue for me is when they write a well known character as a caricature of their canon self or don't adequately provide an explanation for a well known character to be acting so vastly different from canon.

*** Dialogue is such a big one for me. I am often unable to read fics where characters lack their own character voice or sound nothing like their canon selves. Its especally frustrating when someone like Snape who has his own unique speaking style has the same dialogue diction as Harry or even Lupin. I usually just stop reading no matter how good the plot is.

**** Bad dialogue can absolutely wreck a good fic. And sometimes it can be something small, like Snape saying 'okay' or something.

As you said, Snape is especially jarring when he's written wrong because he has such a distinctive voice that when it's off it's immediately noticeable.

Ohhh and when people 'holler'. Really?

Sometimes little word choices in smut scenes can also completely put me off. Like 'bellow'. Are you a moose? No? Then shout like a person you noddy. And nobody likes to have a penis 'crammed' anywhere, thanks.

To Harry, Hermione behaved truly like a annoying, caring, concerning, intimating, loyal, nagging, and well-meaning BIG SISTER. He would trust her with his life, he would protect her with his life, but he would not have her as his wife, especially when more attractive alternative existed.

People (Harmonians?) dismiss the Harry/Hermione brother/sister thing by saying they don't act like that. I guess, this being fiction, they imagine a sibling relationship full of hugs, reassuring talks and mutual caring. While all those things do happen occasionally, my personal experience tends more to rivalry, suffering and barely tolerating each other. My sister is one of the few people who can manage to irritate me withing seconds of meeting.

** Staying on rails of canon stations

Nowadays, before really getting into reading a fic, I'll open several chapters far up ahead trying to find the timeline points where the iconic scenes of the canon would've been hapenning and see how original the fanfic's storyline actually is.

My go-to scenes that usually serve as good litmus tests are

- the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hallowe'en_Feast][Hallowe'en nights,]] the final confrontations for each book (e.g. does Harry get shoehorned into the Mirror of Erised room(s), into Chamber of Secrets, into a variation of the Sirius-Pettigrew conflict, etc),
- the aftermaths for each school year (e.g. if Harry's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute][portrayed as]] very smart\powerful\etc but he allows some out-of-character idiotic decisions at each crucial moment just to allow the canon stations' status-quo to remain, then that story's a no-go)

There are just too many stories that have a superb writing style, good character designs, good dialogues, good jokes, etc --- but when you step back and evaluate how different the global plotline actually is from the canon, it turns out that all the witticisms of the fanfic's characters and all their superior abilities are just an insignificant plating, because they are unable to change most of the events that actually matter, if any of them at all.

There are also two other variations of stories like this

- one is when the story's suddenly railroading back onto the canon's plotline somewhere in the middle of the book, even though before it seemed to be developing its own original plotline;
- the other is when it finally starts to branch off into its own original direction --- and that's exactly when the pace of chapter updates significantly slows down or stops altogether, putting the story into an indefinite “hiatus”.

--------------

Too much screentime dedicated to boring\uninteresting\lame things like characters trying\failing to be funny (especially if there are so many bad jokes that the story itself turns into a bad crackfic); pranks, prank duels; quidditch events; romantic life (and all the related drama) of a teenager; etc.

--------------

When the story tries too hard to be grimdark, turning into a grimderp one instead.

--------------

When the dark\grey\ruthless protag gradually develops a needlessly violent\sadistic\asshole-ish personality. This is especially bad if the said character also somehow manages to keep moralising along the way, trying to justify the needless torture, violence, etc.

--------------

When the author tries to tell a story from an antagonist's point of view, but that antagonist somehow manages to feel guilty at all the right moments, ends up doing more good than harm, makes an artificial decision of changing their stance, etc.

--------------

The whole Thou Shalt Not Kill bullshit.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This Snape is sort of an AU one. He's not as disgusting as in canon and he gradually changes into a decent human being. Furthermore, this story utilizes a rarely used skill of Snape's; he's been serving two powerful wizards for decades and so, he knows how to "manage" a strong wizard. So when Harry showcases just how freakishly powerful he's becoming (by negotiating with the entire dementor swarm shortly after Voldemort's defeat), Dumbledore arranges the adoption, with the primary concern (imo) being that someone should be able to "pacify" Harry (whose mental state is still fucked up), lest he burn down the whole fucking country.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

OC Durmstrang girl that comes to Hogwarts to finish her 7th year

Most of these are not really serious, just a few dates and short relationships. Pretty realistic.

It's not that kind of story, where Harry and /girl/ get together and from then on it's true love until the end of time. The problems (magical, personal, supernatural) Harry faces and his life are the main focus of the story. Relationships are secondary, and of those, familial and friendships are showcased much more than dating.

***** (spoilers, obv)

Snape ends up dating an OC, and I think the whole thing gets handled pretty decently. No needless romanticization of his character, no retroactive removal of his character flaws, etc.

And regarding Harry, I just remember that he tried dating several people, and it was portrayed... realistically, I think? With nothing over-the-top happening to keep the reader's attention, with both disappointments and shifts into friendship, etc.

disclaimer: That's at least the impression this story left at me --- I may be misrepresenting or misremembering some things. And be ready that the pacing of the story will generally be rather slow

If one can simply swear on life and magic, why have truth serum? Why is there corruption? For that matter, why is Azkaban a thing? Recidivism would also be a thing of the past. Make convicted criminals swear to not commit crimes. Bam. Done.

At some point, one of the many rulers of MB or ministers would have made it mandatory to swear an oath to serve in the Ministry.

They're gamebreaking and incredibly lazy. Any deception can have an oath demanded. Any time I see one in a fic, I usually wind up noping out of the fic within a chapter or two.

The only time I have seen them done right was in a fic where each oath lays metaphysical bonds onto one's soul and the more you lay, the harder it is to function normally.

** For me, there's a lot of things that make me disinterested in a fanfic.

- the writing style is childish, lacks depth and has so many spelling errors and just plain clunky phrasing that it leaves me frustrated even /remembering/ reading it.

- It has far too many sexualized descriptions of characters in a non-sexual context. I don't need a retelling of Pervert!Harry every time he even catches a glimpse of Daphne Greengrass' "sublime buttocks" or Hermione's "voluptuous tits". It makes me cringe to read, and distracts from what could otherwise be quite an interesting plot.

- It's true love from the age of twelve, with grand declarations of eternal love and again, way too much sexualisation. Then there's the whole family aspect, e.g Hermione's father or the Weasleys taking Harry aside and telling him to treat their daughter well. Bitch, they're practically prepubescent, shut that shit down before it gets going, don't give him a dowry and your unconditional blessing.

- Excessive bashing that makes the characters into complete, simpering idiots that ignore every possible ounce of common sense available. Dumbledore being consumed by his own superiority, Ron turning into a mountain troll with anger issues and a jealousy problem bigger than Hogwarts itself or Hermione being turned into the worst version of Percy Weasley when it comes to rules and authority worship.

- Edgy Harry taken too far into the realm of [[/r/iamverysmart]]. Dear God it bugs me when the entire character is "smirking knowingly" as he pulls the sixty-third successive /Deus ex machina/ out of the Sorting Hat/the untouchable ether where previously unmentioned and excessively overpowered plot devices are stored.

- Casual bigoted opinions or agendas thrown into the fic at really out of place moments. I'm talking homophobia, sexism, racism, all that shite. I'm a gay male myself and I remember feeling physically ill at one scene in a fic where Harry starts randomly insinuating Ron and Draco were fucking and the entire Great Hall was laughing as he threw out homophobic slur after slur. Everyone was okay with this? This totally out of character, humiliating moment was just let slide after it appeared from nowhere with NO REASON or motive behind it than the author's préjudices. Screw that.

- Slash done badly. It seems like everything needs to be dominant and submissive binary poles, or everyone is unrealistically gay, or again, it's oversexualised to the point that I might as well be reading a porno script. Slash particularly bothers me because it seems like more stereotypes and poor characterisation make it into them than straight fics.

- Fics with no consequences. Where Harry can steamroll over everyone and have absolutely no repercussions, backlash or resistance. See: "I am the Lord of Most Ancient and Noble House of XYZ10PointstoSlytherpuffenclawffindor, bend over and take my sweeping decrees with no complaints at all."

- Motivations that are completely out of character, not fully realized or explained. Contriving plot devices to drive these motivations.

- White Knight Harry gets immediate sexual or emotional gratification from gentlesirring his way into the good graces of every damsel/remotely feminine creature in Hogwarts, and nobody sees it as creepy, patronising or impossible given age divides, house discrimination, professional behavior, etc.

- promises epic final battles and the use of several specialised powers or tools that have been hyped for several chapters by now. What we end up with: a short, disappointing climax where none of the things you wanted to be used were even mentioned, and you just have this complete letdown of expectations. +Sounds like my ex-boyfriend+

- Extended shopping/Gringotts scenes that have absolutely no effect on the plot. Goblins being automatically transformed into house elves ready to serve any vaguely respectful eleven year old that walks in to their dying breath.

- Child abuse being played up a lot. Vernon Dursley becomes a kiddy fiddler, Dudley turns into a sexually abuse sadist, all that kind of shit. It's unnecessary and a contrived, obviously method of demonizing them above and beyond what's necessary. Have some subtlety dammit.

- Everyone knows occlumency, meditates six hours a day and trains in martial arts/duelling for SEVENTEEN hours every day. And every second chapter is another training scene. And nothing is ever progressed and we never see them fully use it. Kill me. Now.

I can understand how as an adult one would not want to read this. However, if you cast your mind back to that age you will realise that actually this is quite realistic. Young people (i.e. those who are just starting secondary school) who are just starting to try out dating tend to declare undying love immediately and 2 weeks later they've broken up. Further, they are fascinated by sex and the main thing stopping half of them trying it out is constant supervision. At the very least they will talk and gossip about it extensively.

The most unrealistic in the depicting of these relationships is when one of the characters says "I'm too young to be doing X". Teenagers /never/ believe that they are too young to do something. They consider themselves adults trapped in the bodies of children.

One of the best fics i have ever read featuring Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as a pairing. The headcanon I have for Remus Lupin during the Marauder era is pretty much built from this.

Give me any others you have. There was one pretty solid but more smutty one where Harry is an auror tracking kidnapped children down and Draco is a potions master who assists him in fighting some enemies. There's something called a blood bubble protecting Teddy or something that was pretty interesting, and the characterisations were solid.

White Knight attitudes in fics are not like the stereotypical hero saves a damsel in distress. I'm talking Harry does something like pick up a book or smile at McGonagall and suddenly the power of chivalry causes her to swoon and every girl his age to immediately become focused on trying to get in his pants.

** Focusing on the question of stuff that can appear mid-way through a fic which has been good until that point:

- Inconsistency with a previously established point. If you give someone a skill and later on that skill would be perfect for getting them out of a situation, they better use it.

- Any comment made by a character, which apparently has author approval, in which they express the opinion that Muggles/technology have the ability to overcome magic or otherwise bypass it. (Half the time this happens it's not even relevant to the plot).

- Lack of moderation. It is common that authors who are writing good ideas will get carried away in the name of making things "epic", for romance, or for the purposes of humour. They should have slept on it first. Almost always moderating the excessive aspects of their idea would have made a better story.

- Sudden nerfing of magic.

- Sudden scaling up of magic, in the sense of making the spells much larger in area of effect.

- Really, any change to the HP magic system which fundamentally alters its character (rather than expanding upon it or correcting minor inconsistencies), unless that change was present from the start and is a stipulated AU element.

- Angst.

A good example of Snape being nice which I find very realistic is linkffn(Bound to Him). In this fic he tries to be as kind as possible to Hermione because he feels an enormous amount of guilt about what is happening to her (what he's doing to her), and is sincerely worried for her mental health. What I like about it is that you can see it's a real effort for him - it doesn't come naturally at all and he has to work very hard at not accidentally hurting her.

** Character bashing is definitely up there, as well as the main character (most often Harry) getting too OP without actually doing anything to earn it.

(You'd better start criticising me, because I actually don't mind harems. Oh, there aren't many, if any, harem fics that are GOOD... but I have a fascination with the subject. Might have somethint to do with my guilty fantasy of being a harem girl, even if I know intellectually that life in an actual harem isn't much fun.)

One thing that totally ruins an otherwise decent story is kind of tied to the character bashing thing... you know the stories when one character goes on long self-righteous rants about how WRONG the other character is, how MEAN and BAD they were, and they should be GRATEFUL that they're getting forgiveness and a second chance.

And the other character just bows and scrapes and says "yes, you're right, I'm total scum and you're a perfect paragon of goodness for forgiving me."

For some characters this might be perfectly IC, but it kind of irks me when the fanfic author can't see that their favourite character, who is generally doing the ranting, is not actually innocent and should in all fairness ALSO apologise for the crappy things they've done.

- Speaking of book canon, be careful with movie canon (is that the right expression?). Unmatched wands don't spectacularly wreck Ollivander's.

- Get the Potterverse spelling right. There's no stupify, alohamora, or Kreature. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3804374/4/][Stoppero]] is not a spell.

While I agree with you that the Grangers are a blank slate and could possibly be Catholic (though Anglican is also possible), I think I find the Weasleys the more likely family to be religious.

As for why I think that, if I had to guess, I think it may be Hermione's disdain for Luna--how she disregards Luna as "only believing things when there isn't proof," though that doesn't necessarily mean that Hermione's parents aren't religious.

Point being, while the students at Hogwarts might certainly eat pancakes, they wouldn't do so for breakfast. You don't cook your own meals at Hogwarts; you are served meals in the Great Hall.

**** I've come across it only a few times in HP fanfiction, and it really wasn't that bad.

"Harry Potter and the Iron Lady" has the Weasleys pray, somewhat awkwardly I might add since they are /not/ regular church-goers after an incident where Ron nearly dies. Charlie prays a bit more traditionally, and reveals he's been going to church services regularly in Romania.

There's problems with the fic sure--grammar most especially--but the references to religion are not one of them.

Linkffn(12212363)

There's also "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure," which isn't really about religion as much as it is about Divine Destiny. Somewhat Dante-esque (though not as much as the author's other fics).

Nobody swears by Merlin, nobody says just "Merlin" or "Merlin damn it" or "Merlin-forsaken" or anything like that... and Sirius is Harry's godfather, not his Merlinfather.

They do say "Merlin's Beard," which is like a "kid-friendly" swear (except Ron, who says things like "Merlin's pants" and "Merlin's saggy left--" before being told to watch his language).

Wizards do use the word "God" on several occasions. The one who says things like "my God" or "I swear to God" the most often is actually super-Pureblood Draco Malfoy.

They also celebrate Christmas, Easter and Halloween... and there's been some references to "christenings." So I'm thinking that wizards pretty much share Muggle religions... which makes sense, since most the major world religions were established long before the Statute of Secrecy was ever a thing.

My personal theory (not canon!) is that in the last century as muggle born equality progressed far more rapidly there was pressure to adopt their mannerisms and religions (if we account that wizarding society mirrors muggle, which had their second wave feminism and black/white equality movements in the early to late 1900's as well).

So that means the muggle born shouldn't have cell phones or DVD players (or even BluRay) or Vidya (this is less murky but Vidya in the 90s was more...shunned as kids got older so yeah. Sure they may have a NES or Genesis but a Piss1? N64? Nah bruv, GTFO with that).

If I'm settling down into a fic that delves into slice of life each summer as a break from the action packed school year or is just slice of life in general then keep your anachronisms out.

Nothing suspends my disbelief faster than it being dated 1995 and they break out the DVDs or call each other on the cell phone.

Yes. I'm aware those things were created and/or existed during parts of Harry Potter but cell phones (and or their bills) were crazy expensive up until around the the 2010s and even more so during the 90s. Paying per minute. Having to pay for roaming. And anytime a new technology is introduced like DVD its initial pricing is high. Only early adopters get in. Released in 1996 in Japan it took DVD almost 7 years to get into the everyday man affordable range.

And DVDs themselves were crazy expensive.

Ok. Ok. I know what I said about anachronism. But that sounds so bad it's good.

Like the worst thing ever. But so good.

That's hilarious.

** Constant flashbacks or constantly switching from viewpoint to viewpoint will cause me to loose interest in a story really fast. I have read authors where I have read every story they wrote and enjoyed them all except that one story I can't even get past that first chapter because of flashbacks or viewpoint changes.

** Harems: Stay far away from those.

Bashing of characters. Now if it makes sense then fine, but if it doesn't I'm staying away from it. I stay away from stories if the summary has written: Weasley or Dumbledore bashing. Because even if the story is good just because you have bashing characters in the summary really irks me.

Character being extremely smart or extremely powerful more then they were in canon. A little bit more then they were in canon is fine, but nothing crazy.

Hermione as the perfect character, don't get me wrong I like Hermione, but it just wows me when she is just absolutely perfect, just no please.

** When a story follows the stations of canon. If I want to read the canon plot I read the original books.

When an author is unable to ditch canon even though it wrecks their story or, if available but not used, breaks SoD, and instead makes up shitty excuses for it. Unbreakable Vows, Time-Turners, house elf powers, and so on.

When the author uses arguments that come straight from Nazis or racists to justify house elf slavery, pureblood superiority, etc. "Elves are not human, so it's OK to enslave them." "Muggles don't deserve the same rights as wizards." and so on.
