We all know that Gilderoy Lockhart made his climb to fame by interviewing people about their adventures, obliviating them, then writing his books about the adventures. But it turns out memory charms are much more dangerous than anyone could have predicted.

It started as a prank on some friends, a quick memory charm to make them think he was the next dark lord to whom they'd sworn allegiance. Just a bit of post war humor really. Spend a few hours with them worshiping him then revert them back to normal and everyone could share a laugh. But then they went out and recruited others to the cause, who recruited still more followers, until basically overnight all of magical Brittain thought Tom really was the next dark lord and a war broke out. In too deep to stop it now and explain it all Tom decided to just roll with it.


** "That prat Riddle that got Hagrid expelled is planning something. We overheard him under Charlus's cloak. He's going to charm his buddies into thinking he'll be a Dark Lord--yeah, with capital letters.

"So we're going to follow him and Confound him right when he does it, so he believes it too and doesn't remember to take the charm off. They'll all get expelled for being so obvious about their love of Dark Arts!" - Micean Mehn
