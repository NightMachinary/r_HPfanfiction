Is it Wizarding Britain, Jr. as JKR sketched it? How do the Native Americans influence the practice of magic? Are some states part of the US, Mexico, or their own territories? Do they use ridiculous words like No-Maj? There's so much that could be going on here! A treasure trove of ideas!


** I would imagine that instead of "Dreamless Sleep" potions, they have magical dream-catchers.

Pureblood supremacy is probably less prevalent due to families having fewer roots.

** It would have to be multiple smaller schools. One gigantic school for the whole country doesn't make sense. An east coast one would be in Salem of course, probably one near New Orleans too.

*** You only really need one school, about the size of a normal highschool.

Apparently the US only has about 5Ã— the population of Britain (which is really weird but it's about 330million Vs 66 million) and Hogwarts is very small, managing with only one teacher per subject, go for 5 per subject and it's easily done.

Wizards make up a tiny portion of the global population, which probably explains the statute of secrecy.

** It is as ridiculous as her ideas about magical world in Europe, which is product of her heritage: combination of French arrogance and English ignorance. Half of Europe (from non-Romance Swiss to Russia, from Greece to Norway; assuming that all Romance European attend Beauxbattons) attends the only school somewhere in the north of Sweden/Norway, while relatively small Great Britain (which is like fifth of that; perhaps Ireland included, but it is never clearly stated) has its own school. And so on.

** [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] always has an interesting take of Magical America whenever it's mentioned. Usually, each State has its own conclave and are at conflict with each other. They tend to unite as one when it involves fighting against outside forces beyond the Northern American conclaves. Or at least that's what I remember.

** The statue of secrecy was created before America was founded, so it would be cool if magical America was more divided. I don't see wizards paying much attention to what's happening on the muggle side, so it would be cool if there were no purebloods families that went to America and all the European American witches and wizards are descendants from muggleborns born in America.

The Native American would have no system in place to round up all the white and black muggleborns since they just look for magicals in their own tribes. The new muggleborn would have to form a society on their own trough trial an error.

*** Oh, that's a good point. Magicals wouldn't have a good reason to flee their home countries unless there was a wizarding war. Thus most magicals would be Muggleborns, or half-bloods if they mixed with the Natives. They'd be creating a completely new society with /maybe/ a little influence from Wizarding Britain, but mostly based on a combination of the Natives' and Puritans'.

** Currently in the Fic i'm writing where Harry and Luna travel around the Magical US the magical world on the East Coast, think the original thirteen colonies is pretty much the same as Europe, with all the racism and shit that entails, once you get past into the Great Plains you run into sparsely populated home schooled wizarding cultures, with no real school to call their own like Illvermorny, instead you have farming families that are basically like the weasleys, hedge witches, Native Nomadic tribes and African American groups as well, this is also where the Amish are since I'm going to make the Amish a magical community because it's fucking hilarious.

Once you get into the Desert you end up with the colonies of the Magical US that are a mix of both, with homesteaders who don't really have a school that they go to and instead focus on home schooled magic, tribes doing their own thing and of course Magical towns that are basically like Cowboys and shit.

Certain states like Texas and California are alot more modern than say Arizona or New Mexico would be, Alaska has no magicals at all since most of them migrated to Canada after Russia took Alaska and Hawaii has mainly Asian and Native magical groups. Nevada, Idaho and Utah have a thriving Mormon Magical community which is basically it's own independent thing from Magical America.

so the Magical United States would consist of the Original Thirteen Colonies and all the states until you hit the Mississippi river. everything past that is either independent native tribes, sparcly populated colonies by the MUSA, Thriving States like Texas and California, and an independent Mormon Magical country which would be Deseret, and would basically include Modern Idaho, Parts of Magical California, Nevada and Utah as well as a good chunk of Arizona.

Slavery for minorities wasn't a thing in the Magical US since Magic exists but they weren't against enslaving magical creatures so that's still a thing.

In the Magical US you'd have state funded schools that would act as primary schools for all magical kids in the country, including the people from the colonies in the great planes and native tribes if they choose to send them (most don't), you also have a hogwarts sized major school in Massachusetts called Illvermorny, but it's not the only one in the United States theirs a good sized academy in California somewhere and theirs also one in Texas. the Mormons have their own one in Utah that's based underneath the Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City.

** I think they have even less contact with the muggles/No-Majs than Britain due to Rappaport's law. Still not really sure about how they veiw muggleborn but I think the more conservative are against marrying muggles much due to the same reasons that had Rappaport's law come in place.

** More muggles believe in witches and wizards, like in the way of Mary-Lou Barebone, just not as extreme, and more subtle.

** Macusa only controls Northeastern magical America. Rest of the continent is nominally under their rule but in practice it is like a magical version of wild west.

There is 42 magical schools in America. Ilvermorny is just the largest, oldest and the most prominent. It has the world only useful divination class.

American wizards dont wear robes but they wear sixteenth century wigs.
