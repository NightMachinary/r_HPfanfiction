Point me in the direction of fics where Harry is a great dad..

â€‹

I figure Harry is very aware of what a crap upbringing looks like, so would take great care and pleasure in being nothing like the Dursleys..


** Can't go wrong with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me.]] Amazing Dad!Harry.

*** Amazing fic. He has his ups and downs as a parent, but who doesn't? Especially as he is still dealing with grief, loss and being a single dad of 3

** hmm... only one Fanfic currently comes to my mind: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4785338/Vimesenthusiast][Vimesenthusiast]]

Gotta warn you thou its a Crossover with Highschool DxD and some of the later chapters contain some Smut parts.\\
All in all considering what it is crossed over with its not all that much thou and it is more used as a devise to show the gradual deepening of the relationship between harry and his future spouse than it is used as a major plot point.

In the Fic Harry is single dad to Lilly after having broken up with Ginny. they moved to Japan and Harry is a Teacher at the Highschool in Highschool DxD.

while most Fanfics where harry is a dad sometimes seem to forget that the child(ren) even exist, Lilly is always an important part of this story.

*** Yes this! Like the story has a whole lot of other things going on, but it has one of the best Harry-as-a-father portrayals I've seen.

** Blank Space by Keira Marcos is a delightful Harry as a dad story. Eventual pairing is Harry/Hermione

** I recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive. It is complete.
