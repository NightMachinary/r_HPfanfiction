Preferably over 200k words I read very fast and if it's around 100k I'm done with it in a day. Realistic progression please, no just surprise he learned how to be better at transfiguration than Dumbledore after 3 weeks of training.


** Linkao3(Blood Crest) Apprenticed to an Enchanter/Necromancer, progression is quite reasonable.

** Its a mentor snape fic which I know some are against, but I love the potions apprentice series by murai-sakura

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13357839/1/The-Potions-Apprentice]]

Harry works hard to get the skills that pay the bills.

The problem of potions is also fun. Harry goes from terrible potions nucience to an above average potioneer.

** Actually, that makes me think of Mother of Learning, but it's not HP.

The length requirement makes it a bit tricky, but I suppose linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) is fairly progression-oriented.

** My story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" shows how Hermione learns the trade from a Gentleman Thief. It takes several years before she's ready to take her revenge, and not being at Hogwarts hurts her regular education. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron become Aurors with training from Moody.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
