** I'd just like to point out that a Cheering Charm has a similar enough effect, without the stigma, or the direct danger of losing control. Additionally, if someone were to use Imperious, studying would probbly be one of the orders, because the curse would remove the usual issues like boring material, loss of motivation, etc... The caster would then benefit from the target's perfect notes.

** Tangentially related, but I recall reading a fic long ago where Harry asks real Moody to put him under the imperious (which he consciously does not fight) with very specific orders - to study hard and prepare to fight Voldemort or something. He ends up killing Voldemort because he was infringing on his studying time, after which the Imperious ends and he blinks back to reality for the first time in years.

I can't remember the name of the fic, unfortunately.

** I can't remember if this is fanon or canon but the unforgivables have a strong intent requirement no? Like that's the reason they're classified as unforgivables, where you need to have the desire and will to dominate the other's person's free will in order for the imperius to work. That would make a cheering charm the easier option even considering that students can get the spell to work. Like that's a bit which isn't fully explored in canon I guess, how difficult is spell casting actually? Like it can't be as easy as doing the wand motions right and pronouncing the spell correctly.

** I remember reading a fic were Lavender asked Harry to put her under it so she could train to fight it. But actually she wants Harry to satisfy her fix to feel the bliss of the curse.
