I'm always fascinated about what people don't like, and how, sometimes, things they don't like subvert their expectations


** I generally hate edgy fics with a passion. And bashing fics. Especially this heavy bashing. This fic stands for everything I hate in the fanfiction community, but it somehow I quite enjoyed it. Just think of every single trigger warning you might need before clicking, it's most likely there.

He returns to Hogwarts after the death of his godfather seemingly unaware of the light's manipulations, but in the shadows the notorious assassin Sang Lys has arose. Dark!Evil!Harry. Major OOC!

** 1. Drarry fic. Not a fan of the couple, but this is so well written and stays true to the animosity between the characters while developing a believable story that I find myself rereading it every few months.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1360492/1/Eclipse]])

2.Harry/Hermione/Luna fic where they're sent back in time to prevent the war from unfolding as negatively as it did. I don't care for trio fics, but this really surprised me. It's lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously (almost crack at times), but is very well plotted and satisfying to read.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]])

1. The FF description says it better than i could. Harry as Lockhart is such an absurd concept but the writing is fantastic and now I can never see the character the same way. Strongly recommend this one.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

*** Heh. I've actually read /Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly/ and enjoyed that one a number of times. If you want something in a similar vein(though unfortunately abandoned, looks like), there's /Magical Me/ by Publicola.

I've also already read Faery Heroes, and while I generally don't care for ships in general, Harry/Hermione/Luna is one of my favorites.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.
