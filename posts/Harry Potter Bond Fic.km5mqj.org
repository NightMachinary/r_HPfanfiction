:END:
Ok so idk if you know it but I'm asking everyone I know sooo... there's this one Harry Potter fic and it features on bonding. Specifically bonding that comes from saving a life. It was a hogwarts era fanfic and on ff.net (all 7 years in 1 book) Year 1: Harry gets bonded to Hermione after he saves her from troll and they have to hold hands for 24 hrs and after that, they can feel each other's wellbeing and their location. At the end of the year, Harry goes home with Hermione and Hermione's parents adopt Harry because his home life with the Dursley's is bad

Year 2: Hermione gets petrified and her parents are like super mad. They also start arguing a lot with Dumbledore. Harry let's the basilisk go out because it's purpose was to protect. Ginny is now bonded to him too and she tells him that she wanted to marry him to get away from her mom who is very controlling.

Third Year: Nothjng major happens, but they do clear Sirius and catch pettigrew at the beginning of the year. Also there is a lot of talk about life debts and stuff since Harry is head of the House Potter. Sirius then becomes a major part of their lives.

Year 4: Ginny, Harry, Hermione and Sirius go to the Quidditch match together and they get away and go to the burrow after where there is a scene about molly being mad because Harry and Ginny were working out in Sirius's tent. Hermione's parents begin prep to transfer Harry and Hermione to Beuxbatons because of triwizard and debate with Dumbledore a lot. Harry also gets bonded to Gabrielle (Fleur's sister) and at end of year, Hermione, Ginny, and Gabrielle all apparate and save Harry. Draco tried to kidnap Gabby and they send him to the forest to the spiders. They also hide their secret with Fidelus charm.

So it is explained about their bond and Veela bonds and stuff. They get rid of his bond with Voly too. It also takes about their relationship developing and stuff (kissing, sex etc.) and they eventually all get married in France J believe. It's really well written and I'm so sad that I lost it! If you know of this fic, plz help!
