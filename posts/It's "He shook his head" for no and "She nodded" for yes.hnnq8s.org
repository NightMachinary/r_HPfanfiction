Don't write "he shook his head yes" when a character is agreeing because that implies a side-to-side motion, which means no. You nod your head up and down when you agree.

Edit: this is applicable to Britain, where the books are set. I am very much enjoying the discussion of other culture's body language! As an Indian, high five to everyone who mentioned the head wobble.

** I went to school with a girl from Bulgaria so I have no idea if this was specific to her or the culture. But 'yes' and 'no' were IDENTICAL movements. She'd like move her chin up and down like nodding but also moved the top of her head from side to side no shaking no. Also refused to use the words yes and no - absolutely infuriating. Would you like tea or not, Kalina?!?!

​

Since then I've just assumed all fanfic writers are Bulgarian and it somehow makes reading easier.

*** Imagine Krum trolling people with the reversed gestures:

Hermione: Would you like some tea?

Krum: /nods/

Hermione pours him some tea, and Krum refuses to drink.

Hermione: But I thought you said that you wanted tea? Can I have it, then?

Krum: /shakes his head/, and then passes the cup to a visibly confused Hermione.

Hermione: Do you think I'm pretty?

Krum: /shakes his head, leaving Hermione visibly offended/

And then Hermione picks up on the habit and starts using it on her peers, deliberately.

***** I've always headcanoned Krum as having a good sense of humour once you really get to know him.

The surly exterior is just because of his conflict between being shy and wanting to enjoy his fame. But once you get him out of his shell, he's a real swell guy.

Oh, and even though I'm a Harmony shipper, I'm totally OK with Krumione, too.

*** They have it reversed, same as Greeks, and while it's almost the same movements we use, just exchanged (so not like Indian head wobble yes) , the timing is different. "No" is like a sharper thrusting nod. Yes is quick and short head shake. At least that's what I saw with Greek in-laws.

Your comment made me laugh btw, sounds pretty frustrating :D

** This always baffles me when it comes up, especially when it's clear the character really agrees. My brain always tries to parse it as someone who instinctively shook their head but while trying to feign a polite "yes".

Or a case where something really shit or foolish happened. Like "I heard X threw a broomstick out of the window."

"Yes," sighed [character] with an exasperated head shake."

I mean, actually. No. No one in their right mind would write that, but I've seen it and done it.

** I read a fic last week, in it, Harry's arm itches due to a curse. Snape goes to get some cream and tells tells him not to "itch it" in the meantime.

I almost screamed aloud in frustration. It's the "Itchy and Scratchy" show for a reason, folks. You scratch an itch, you don't itch an itch. Jesus Christ. I've heard some rednecks here in Alabama where I live get the two mixed up, but I always figured it was because they didn't read, like, at all. Now people are writng this shit down. If it spreads the way "stepped foot" instead of "set foot" has, I might just need to quit fanfiction altogether and go back to published works where editors mostly don't let this shit happen.

I think the fact that it was an otherwise grammatically correct fic, and that it was /Snape/ who said it, a character that most authors take care to have speak with precision, just made it worse.

I've laughed my buns off at comedians who've shook their heads and then said "Yes", cuz it's a completely opposite answer to the physical negation!
