So I'm looking for a good length story with the will of Sirius black and all that I don't care about any thing eles it can be as cliche as possible I just want ones y'all think are okay and shit it's a guilt pleasure


** Uh I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the manipulator of destiny) has a scene about the reading of Sirius' will, but if I remember right it's one of those stories that you could play trope bingo with.
