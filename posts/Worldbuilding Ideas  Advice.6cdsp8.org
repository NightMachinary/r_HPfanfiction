** The split between Dumbledore and Grindelwald happened when Dumbledore took Fawks as a familiar. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald were sociopathic in that they did not have feelings of right and wrong but only goals and how they are accomplished. During a ritual where he was assisting Grindelwald, Dumbledore caught a glimpse of the afterlife. He saw what really happens to souls who walks down the path he is on and for the first time in his life he knew real fear.

He knew that as he was he would eventually fall prey to his own nature and meet the fate that he fears. He determined that if his own nature was not sufficient that he needed another nature to supplement his own. He eventually finds a phoenix that he was able to convince to bind to him in a familiar bond which he allowed to overwhelm him. From then onward Dumbledore had the emotional spectrum of a phoenix. Afterward he became incapable of comprehending evil on a fundamental level and gained a strong empathy for the good in all people. All of his failings stem from that.

** I am doing this literally RIGHT NOW :D

I have had so much fun messing about with the world that I keep getting distracted from polishing up my draft chapters... >_>

Since this is like, fanfiction, I really don't mind sharing anything and everything I've been working on. I'll give you a quick summary instead of infodumping. Also I don't want to accidentally blindside your new shoots of ideas.

- I assumed Magical Britain is a fair bit bigger than in canon for my purposes. I'm not good at pulling numbers out of the air, but that's important~
- I hit the politics from the History angle too. I reworked the political system with a lot of inspiration from: the beginnings of Parliament, the founding of the Corporation of the City of London and a few fanon tropes (hopefully done well). I'll go into more detail if you want me too :3
- Economy: I'm thinking of vaguely putting down restrictions on converting money, but not go into the details. I'm no economist bit I'm pretty sure just adjoining a gold-standard economy to our current day one would be awful for both. Will be adjusting the costs of things, or the value of the galleon. Wands are waaaay too cheap, short of a subsidy on a child's first wand.
- I'm naming Wizarding London "Diagon" with "Diagon Alley" being the high street. "Knockturn Alley" will be a web of streets. There are multiple links to the muggle world. The geometry of the space that Diagon inhabits isn't exactly... Euclidean.
- Magical tradesmen and craftspeople are regulated by Guilds. These have political clout but in some ways are just powered up Trade Unions. Lots of inspiration from the City of London, as mentioned.
- I have ideas for a couple of places like Godric's Hollow, one of them being in Wales; and one all-wizarding town in Ireland somewhere, possibly.
- Big cities with decent magical populations will have areas like Diagon.
- HISTORY: I had a lot of fun playing around with the cauuse/effects of the Goblin Wars in my head and how that led to the current balance of power. Goblins in my story will be one "clan" of an entire species of "Little People".

Going to put my brainstorming methods in a separate comment...

*** On the topic of money, there was that HPMOR gold trick where you melt down the Galleons, exchange them for Muggle money, exchange /those/ for Sickles etc. etc. which I think could be pretty easily avoided just by putting enchantments on the coins to stop them from melting.

**** I think even without that to worry about, unfettered exchange would still ruin the economies because of the muggle stock market... Again, I'm not an economist, though!

I had so much fun with the guilds! I discovered that before the word "guild" existed, they were called "mysteries": for example a mysterie of scriveners (not a spelling error). So I named the three bodies of the Wizengamot the Ministerium, the Magisterium (hereditary seats) and the Mysterium. A "full meeting of the Wizengamot" calls representatives of all three bodies.

** Ok putting that stuff into practice for you:

- check out government structures you like the sound of. Look at their history. Either graft to canon Wizengamot or trim and reattach your own one. I did a little bit of political theory 101 as well, but that was only developed very recently and a lot of older governments don't incorporate things like separating the judiciary and executive.

- How much control does your new and improved Wizengamot have? Are there checks and balances or do they have a slight dictatorial slant?

- What is /important/ to Magical Britain? I put secrecy above all else. Let your structure reflect this. JKR does it a bit already by saying that the DMLE is the largest dept

- Economy: what are your opinions on goblins? How did they get their monopoly? Or are there alternatives? How do people make money? What do they spend it on when magic can do so much?

- Diagon expansion is just having fun with locations, mainly. What do people want to buy? What would look awesome?

- Repeat Diagon expansion steps on other wizarding communities. How are they hidden?

I would imagine slight dictatorial slant. The wizarding world is in a constant state of emergency (due to the Statute of Secrecy), and countries in states of emergency tend give emergency powers.

** I think the best way to explore the structure of the Ministry, the political history of wizarding Britain, and the country's present economic state, would be a story focusing on a political campaign. We know that Ministers are elected so there must be campaigns of some sort. And showing these topics through a campaign would surely be better than info-dumping them through descriptive exposition in another type of story. It also gives you geographic freedom to visit lots of places.

With respect to the actual content of the worldbuilding you choose, I'd mention a couple of things.

1. With respect to magic itself, as always I recommend [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit?usp=sharing][this]] as a baseline for developing canon-like magical behaviour. But be aware that this document is intended as a guide for readers/authors, not for worldbuilding i.e. it shows how magic works but not how wizards themselves consider magic, which should I think feel more whimsical and pluralistic than the rules proposed in that document.

2. I would encourage you to keep the wizarding population relatively small, i.e. in the region of 10,000-15,000, and at the absolute largest 30,000. A big part of the attraction of the HP world is its unique charm and tone. Increasing the size of the world increases the necessity of more formal government, business, regulation, taxation, etc and also increases the weight and role of institutions (as opposed to individuals). I would caution you against destroying the main attractions of the magical world in your desire to give wizards a more complex society. There's plenty of interesting worldbuilding that can be done without resorting to scale and the mirroring of Muggle society as a substitute for creativity.

3. As an example for the above approach to worldbuilding, and on the topic of wizarding economy, see my post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/65uji0/fun_little_ideas/dgdb0q9/][here]].

4. With respect to complexity, beware! The problem for all worldbuilding is this: the real world is infinitely more complex, chaotic, and historically rich than any author can replicate. As a result, if you attempt to describe the wizarding world and its history comprehensively to readers, the inevitable result is that the world will feel shallow and simple compared to the real world. The solution to this problem is to /allude/ to complexity comparable to the real world through illustrative examples and drip-fed partial information. Your reader doesn't need to know every detail of your Ministry, or magic system. They merely need to have the sense that an appropriately complex and organically developed system exists and is known to the characters.

5. As a further elaboration of point 4, I'd recommend avoiding any worldbuilding that feels too neat or logical. In the real world, societies and institutions develop incrementally through thousands of individual events, each of which is guided by local and personal factors but which contributes unknowningly to what is later described as progress. This process does not lend itself to systems which are fully logical or well categorised. By way of real world example, consider the fact that the office of Prime Minister was never really created - it developed naturally, over time, as the First Lord of the Treasury steadily accumulated more power for himself at the expense of other Cabinet Ministers and the Crown itself.

6. On the subject of dark magic, I would invite you to consider [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=990279&postcount=1528][this post]].

** Continued: Brainstorming methods.

So I'm pretty familiar with canon, and I have a few changes in mind that I want to make to the world. Then I work out how to get from A to B, as it were.

Example: Wizarding world is too small. Make bigger. If it were bigger, would government be bigger?

- yes. There would be more Aurors. The size of the Ministry in terms of number of departments is right for what it covers, but misses stuff like Education and Health that the muggle government has. Why?

- Maybe St Mungos and Hogwarts are ancient and separate institutions which are funded and regulated by the Ministry, but not actually run by it. Currently unsure on whether these services should be free or not. I immediately put them down as free, but need to check my history for pre-NHS healthcare and the first schooling systems in the UK.

- Changes made: More Departments. Reshuffle of Depts. Wizards and witches like magical numbers, right? So 7 major depts (like canon) + 5 minor ones + the Minister's Office = 13. A lot of my hierarchical structuring follows magical numbers in this way.

- Health and Education are Minor because they are but regulatory bodies. Games and Sports is shifted to minor, replaced by Commerce and Finance.

Since there are more of them, what do they all /do/?

- Magical craft and trade. Based heavily off City of London livery companies.

- Make food. Grow magical stuff. Hunt magical stuff.

- Hogsmeade grew up around Hogwarts. Maybe it supplied their farming needs? I imagine the area to be self sufficient if under siege. Should Hogsmeade be walled or just warded?

etc etc.

**** Fanon tropes include stuff like hereditary seats/titles (that's the primary one), I'm subverting the binary light/dark politics with power blocs... Hmm maybe it's just because my sleep is messed up but I'm sure there were more than that.

Do you know what you want to be wrong at the beginning? If you know the kind of trouble you want the Wizengamot to cause then you can think about their motives and possible historical reasons. Then you can plan how our heroes could fix it :p

What aspects of history are you most excited about? Grindelwald? Goblin wars? Founding of Hogsmeade?

If the world building is fun then just go for it, even if it's just your own personal form of escapism.

****** I don't have a physical keyboard to hand and am not a fan of touch screens, so I'll describe enough for Google-fu to be your friend, for now, instead of swapping between apps:

- the political theory stuff I checked out specifically looked at dividing the judiciary and executive of a country's government - America, being newer, created its government to align with this. Britain, having had no revolutions of late, does not. General stuff on different political systems is helpful, too; it sounds like you're on that already!

- political history included topics like: the beginnings of the City of London Corporation, beginnings of parliament, the Roman patronage system, livery companies and how apprenticeships worked, how trade unions work, etc

- if there are aspects of real world politics you like, look up how they came about! Revolutions are always fun. You could use one to instigate the changes your characters want to make.

  - hp-lexicon and the Harry potter wiki are excellent for finding canonical and extra-canonical information on locations. Check out real world examples, too. For st mungo's, check out where the first hospitals came from in Britain. Check out the scumbles(sic) in York for a cool old alley, or seven dials area in London for something a bit more crowded.

** Some things from my background notes on a fic of similar complexity.

- Almost all raw materials are imported from the Muggle economy and from overseas colonies of Magical Britain. Because legitimate trade is prohibited, most of materials come from Confunding or Memory Charming Muggles in order to appropriate their supplies.

- Society consists mainly of six different strata: administration and bureaucracy, petit bourgeois small shops, service sector work in these shops, financial service sector work, and the aristocracy, which often doubles as a capitalist class. This means that the entirety of magical Britain, more or less, is basically the economic crème de la crème -- which is why the Weasley family lives so well despite being "poor".

- The price of a product correlates with the magical expenditure required to create it. There is a limit to the amount of magic a person can expend in a given time, for their power level.

- The Wizengamot is the highest court of Magical Britain, an assembly composed of the land-owning representatives of the Noble Houses, who appoint the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, able to be recalled with a 2/3 vote. These seats can be inherited, and one member of a House can control more than one seat, which is why Noble families tend to only have one child, why they tend to intermarry in order to concentrate seat holdings, and why pureblood ideology exists to justify this.

- There is an Interdict of Merlin (it's from HPMOR but it's my headcanon because it explains things so well) which limits the transmission of extremely powerful magical knowledge, making it so that it can only be transferred from one living mind to another (in a well-meaning attempt to prevent the destruction of the world from some dumbass using world-ending magic after reading about it). This has a number of effects, which explain what we see in canon /really/ well: magical lore gets concentrated into fewer and fewer hands until you're left with hyperpowerful game-changers like Dumbledore and Voldemort who know /all the things/. It explains why brooms keep getting better (because they're not incredibly powerful so you can innovate with shit) while we can't recreate incredibly powerful magical artifacts like the Goblet of Fire and Ravenclaw's Diadem. It also explains why purebloods think Muggles are "tainting their blood". They're not losing power -- in reality, they're losing knowledge.

- Because of the Statute of Secrecy, wizarding society is essentially permanently in an emergency war-time situation. They think of their discovery by Muggles as an existential risk. This is why shit's so fucked in the Ministry.

- There is no such thing as a magic gene. But there is such thing as a Muggle gene, which prevents people from using magic. Let me explain. What's more likely? A mundane, physical universe where some people happen to have supernatural powers . . . or a supernatural universe /made/ mundane? Damaged Muggle genes create wizards; sometimes two wizards mate and one of the damaged Muggle genes ends up repaired via chromosomal crossover. Since recent Muggleborns tend to have less damaged Muggle genes compared to old wizard families, the chromosomal repair is much more likely to happen among wizarding lines which recently accepted Muggleborns into their ancestry, than ancient pureblood lines.

Also, another speculative piece:

#+begin_quote
  Many (most?) of the great Muggle advances in technology have been due either directly or indirectly to war, fighting, and killing. Our natural tools available to us are simply too easily outclassed, that an arms race seems inevitable. So, drawing on that as the most obvious comparison, it raises the question of why artifacts and technology haven't played a greater role in wizarding combat than what we've seen in ANY of the 3 canons?

  My first thought was; maybe advances in dueling magic are more efficient than the creation of magical artifacts. But the presence of the Interdict suggests otherwise. For militias to be effective, the most powerful fighting magics need to be taught to multiple people. Which means that the relative power level of dueling-class spells would, after generations, be exponentially higher than non-military magic. But this just doesn't seem to be the case. Plus eventually you'd reach the point of diminishing returns and eventually start incorporating magical technology. Which also hasn't seemed to happen yet.

  Which suggests a different explanation: wizards simply don't fight on a high level often enough to justify the advancement of military magic. This makes more sense from several perspectives. A major factor is that Magic renders physical resources far less important than in the Muggle world. But furthermore, there are fewer wizards to fight with over these resources, which means not only are you engaging in magical combat less often, but your "soldiers" are far less expendable than in the Muggle world; one errant Avada Kedavra wipes out the equivalent of 10,000 muggle soldiers. Killing 25 wizards would be a death toll equivalent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.

  So the path of least resistance would be to fight using proxies: muggles, magical creatures, and the like. Which canon seems to bear out; Herpo fought with Basilica and Terrasqueue and Dementrices, Grindelwald fought with muggles, and the Second Figure is summoning an army of Unseelie (and reclaiming Herpo's creatures.)

  Which means that the primary application of military magic would be in a law enforcement capacity, which is a primarily defensive form of combat. Your goal as a police officer is to capture, not kill, and to defend yourself or others.
