**** I read it several years ago... As far as I remember, it wasn't a bad drop off point, just a drop off point. I recall being a little sad, because it seemed like they were setting up to bring Luna into the fold, and I was looking forward to that. And the revolution was just beginning. There's quite a ways to go, if the author ever decides to return to writing, /which she absolutely should/, yesplzthankyou.

**** The story has several completed 'arcs' of conflict between characters that are resolved (or mostly resolved). Those story arcs are excellent enough that I'd recommend the fic even though the big over-arching conflict with the main enemy was not close to being resolved.

The leaving off point is right after the main characters discover something crucial regarding the prophecy that may help them against the enemy. Hermione and Draco discover that they are part of the prophecy and that they have access to unprecedented magical power when focusing together. Acting on Riddle's plans, they intend to infiltrate Malfoy Manor during a Yuletide Gala to learn how to restore the Magic of every member of the conservative families who were taken captive.

** I've read quite a few manipulative Dumbledore fics, but in most of the ones I've liked he and Riddle are depicted as equally morally ambiguous.

Here are a few where Dumbledore strays further into the 'evil' category:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - In fourth year Harry realizes that Dumbledore has been using legilimency to control him for most of his life. linkffn(8163784)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Harry is forced to realize that the world isn't black and white after Voldemort successfully kidnaps him in year one. The truth eventually begins to surface about a horrific tactic Dumbledore used during the first war which made the original conflict more brutal and bloody than it would have been otherwise. linkffn(11358664)
