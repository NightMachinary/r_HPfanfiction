** Hagrid knows Tom Riddle as a different person. I doubt he'd make the connection.

If he met diary Riddle though...

Where does that idea come from? It was Hagrid that mentioned to Harry that Voldemort was in Slytherin. Of course he knew that Riddle was Voldemort.

At least that's what I remember.

** The longest 'grudge' we see Hagrid hold was towards Slytherin in general, and even that wasn't outright loathsome hate. Hagrid seemed prone to short term anger (e.g. his rage against Karkaroff, and his disappointment in Madame Maxime) but not so much a long term, hateful attitude. He couldn't even sustain his cold shoulder towards the trio (for dropping his subject) for too long in book six.

I like to think that even if he knew that Tom Riddle was Voldemort, well, he:

- Sort of moved on from his expulsion.

- Was just too good of a person to carry lifelong hatred

- Wasn't Snape, who kept lifelong grudges towards many things in life.

- Preferred to not think about or talk about it, as evidenced by him going 'mysteriously deaf' when the topic came up.

I don't think he managed to hold 5 minutes. Harry called him Sir (or Professor?) once and he quickly turned back into a mild, crying giant.

*** Fair enough. Truly a gentle giant.

But also the fact that he even got upset about the trio dropping CoMC was kind of an overreaction and nowhere near the same level of offense as being framed for murder and expelled

** As people have pointed out Hagrid did not know Voldemort was Tom.

But there is another layer here. As far as Hagrid knew Tom was just a concerned prefect thinking he found the monster and who was in charge of it. A teen who made a mistake a lot of other people, adults, happily ran with. Hagrid has no idea he was set up. - The attacks stopped after this, but Hagrid could have easily figured that the true culpit just realised he was handed an out through to Hagrid's "lucky" arrest.

And Hagrid is not the sort of person to hold a grudge afainst somebody who, as far as he knows, tried to do the right thing, I think.

** To be fair, Hagrid was expelled for raising a class XXXXX beast into the castle, which is a perfectly appropriate punishment. Tom Riddle may have used him as a scapegoat for the death of Myrtle, but Dumbledore protected him from the worst of it and it doesn't erase the fact that he brought a known wizard killer into the castle and was trying to raise it.

This is why he was not granted back the right to carry a wand, even after Harry proved his innocence.

*** Ah yeah, you're right. Dumbledore protected Hagrid by making sure that the murder charges didn't stick, since the only thing they had actual proof of was the Acromantula.

Also, I'm not sure if Harry actually proved Hagrid's innocence in the eyes of the law, just that he wasn't attacking the students this time around. Not sure if his name was actually cleared.

** For some unknown reason Dumbledore keeps Tom Riddle's identity as Voldemort secret. I have no idea why. Now as another commenter mentioned I don't think the knowledge of his identity would swing any inner circle/diehards away from him as they knew who he was in school. It may only sway a few bigoted purebloods away.

And it might actually backfire in terms of punishment. Eg try to get a law passed to have all marked deatheaters kissed/thrown through the veil. Tough enough when they believe Voldemort is a pureblood. But once it's known he's a halfblood and it's how can we give the ultimate punishment to these poor purebloods who were deceived by an evil halfblood. It's not their fault.

*** Yeah, most of the DEs only used pureblood ideology as an excuse to rape, torture, and kill. It was more of a front used for a power grab than anything else.

*** First of all, most of the Slytherin bashing is fanon. In canon, all we see is Hagrid's mention, Ron's on the train, people being cautious around Slytherins, and some of the Slytherins being pricks.

Also, in canon, we see Hagrid show resentment that his wand was snapped and he got kicked out. Why would he not hold a grudge against the person who caused that?
