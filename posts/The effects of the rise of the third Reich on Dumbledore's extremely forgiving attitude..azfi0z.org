A thought popped upwhile I was bored at work.

One of the cause that facilitated the rise of the Nazi party in Germany was the extremely harsh sanctions that were levied against the Germans in the treaty of Versailles at the end of the first World War. I can easily see a Dumbledore, scared by the horrifying atrocities caused by a people who were so ground in the dust that the only way they saw to dig themselves up was to conquer all their neighbors, deciding that the best method to prevent this happening again with the death eaters at the end of Voldemort's first rise is to be as lenient and forgiving as possible.

Discuss


** Dumbledore is never shown to be super lenient and forgiving to Death Eaters, with the exception of a teenage Draco. Honestly, if anything, I thought he was somewhat cruel when talking to Snape in Snape's memories.

*** Yeah, the idea that Dumbledore/the Order are super forgiving is a misconception, I suspect one which has been spread by those who wish to obscure the true force behind the "forgive everyone" philosophy in canon: Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Lupin looked aghast.

  "Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!"

  "We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago," Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm.

  "Yes, Harry," said Lupin with painful restraint, "and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under the imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!"

  "So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?" said Harry angrily.

  "Of course not," said Lupin, "but the Death Eaters -- frankly, most people! -- would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!"

  Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him.

  "I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there," said Harry, "That's Voldemort's job."

Not to mention:

#+begin_quote
  “Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my belief --- I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right --- that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.”

  “She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?”

  Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?”

  “No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother ---”

  “Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore gently. “Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother's courage. And now, if you will stand...”
#+end_quote

Harry denies that he felt pity for Voldemort, but it's clear that his first instinct /was/ to feel pity - only to be consciously corrected after Dumbledore calls him out. The nature of Harry's character is to be merciful.

Your implication here seems to be that he'd purposely fail a student's Newt, but he doesn't have any control over who passes or fails in Owls and Newts. And I doubt he does that to anyone outside of Harry.

Given that Harry's year seems to be around 40-50 strong that would fit with the top 10% or slightly more achieving the top grade. Not entirely unreasonable, given that, if you take the current top grade (9) in the UK system they were expecting 3% to get that in maths in 2017 and only 2% getting it in English Language. [[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/0/gcse-results-many-students-will-get-new-top-grade/]]

If we assume (and I think we may) that people weren't all aware that they could take potions with Slughorn, Harry and Ron have to be told personally by McGonagall. It doesn't seem too unlikely that most people didn't know, and some of course weren't interested in taking it.

So, overall, I'm not quite sure we can really say that Snape was that terrible.

************* The problem with comparing Hogwarts with Middle/High school is that we have no idea what kind of if any kind of universities they have. For all we know, OWL = High School diploma in the subject. NEWT = Bachelor or at least an Associate's degree. But what lies between NEWT and a Mastery(If it's canon I can't recall that term actually being used in there)

And sure, comparing 10% of 50 to 3% of a few million(?) is easy enough. But Hogwarts is one person teaching a class and seemingly deciding what his requirement for further studies are as well as what the curriculum should be. Vs a huge bureaucratic mess that might or might not care about the content of said books. Teachers that might or might not even base themselves upon said books. etc. etc. There are too many oddity with such a comparison to take it to it's full extent. At least for me.

************** That's a fair point. We've been told there are no universities and further education seems to occur on the job as it were.

However, the stylistic treatment of OWLs and NEWTs is very akin to my experience of GCSEs and A levels. It really doesn't compare at all the the British university system.

The term Mastery is fanon, not canon.

Often, in marking, results are weighted against the average. So that you maintain a roughly similar spread in each year.

If you're going to make the argument that they aren't comparable though you can't really say that EE isn't a good grade because you only have the data in the books to go off. Given that even Hermione got EE in Defence (Harry being the only one to get Outstanding, I think) suggests that EE is a more than respectable grade.

Snape's standards for NEWT level might be too high, but on the other hand he probably has a good point. Many of these potions are potentially lethal. If brewed incorrectly they seem to be able to turn into bombs/deadly acid. If you want people who aren't going to poison your rather tiny population then probably taking the top 10% is reasonable. Even more reasonable since that means that in a population of 3000 (according to Rowling) around 300 of them are sufficiently qualified to do the highest level of potions work (healers and aurors).

There's no denying that Snape is good at potions, and might know what makes an individual good at potions, as he did modify brewing practices and even altered ingredient processing. But we don't see anything about it before or after. All we here about Snape's teaching is: Brew This potion.

It's as if starting with proper handling of ingredient would be necessary. Also, we do see potion mishaps in the first few books as well. Neville managing to melt Seamus' cauldron being one event. So, would the potential catastrophe be a lot worse the more complex the potions are? For sure.

But it's been proven that it can happen in a first year class room as well. Too much haste is too little speed and all that. I know it'd make for a more boring opening to the first book. Or even the first few books. But just a bit of theory discussion even if just in snippets as we see Harry go over it in his head would've been a good way to show that it's happening.

Yes, as you pointed out it was second of six grades. Middle of the passing grades. It's good for getting a passing grade, but again. If you require one grade it wouldn't matter to you if it was just one grade too low. Well, IIRC most of the DA got EE's as well. Suggesting that it was Harry's boost to their DADA training that allowed them to reach that point. And we have no idea how much Harry's corporal patronus weighed into the calculation on that grade.

**************** Fair enough.

What we've seen of Snape's teaching is poor. I definitely agree with that. It's on a level with my biology teacher at school, or at least nearly (he was as useless as Umbridge). The problem is that I can't really remember any teacher at Hogwarts being much better. They tend to say 'do this' and then congratulate Hermione when she does that. If we read it solely with an eye to the information given inside the novels then I'm not sure Snape's teaching is any worse than anyone else's (not that they're any good). Buckbeak does injure Draco; in their first broom lesson Neville is injured; Flitwick does mention that bad things can happen in charms (though we don't actually see it) ...

I think it might be a failing in Rowling's writing really. We're kind of left to speculate, at which point our best option does seem to be to break down the numbers.

Regarded as a good enough grade by McGonagall and Slughorn to allow in. I do think the indications are that it is considered a genuinely good grade. I know at school I had teachers who when it came to AS levels and A levels said that you needed at least a C in x subject, and others who demanded a B.

For an entire group to get that (and for it to be seen as pretty good) suggests EE is actually good, is my point there. To get outstanding you REALLY have to be good.

EDIT: Hmm, wasn't in the book. Maybe it was the movie?

I can't speak about that as I only went for a GED after being out of HS for a few years so I only sat 1st year of (2) Chemistry. In which my teacher thought any less than a C would make the second year's workload too heavy for her comfort of having that student in class.

Which granted existed in WWI as well, but it was seen as a larger cultural part of Germany during and in the aftermath of WW2 that gave it this fear. Plus, a country that was de-armed and given what at the time was considered heavy treaty. Still was, Germany would've barely managed to pay UK back a proper percentage without the short term loans it got from the US. Which in turn allowed Germany to rebuild it's industry. Which allowed them to pay the UK. It was an odd cycle.

​

But nonetheless Germany re-militarized. And that fear continued. Which was IIRC one of the main reasons they were divided. So, you can't look at one without looking at the other.

*** Those are some great points. For his knowledge, we can suppose that he learned it from Grindelwald. That can also explain his lack of knowledge from Brest-Litovsk. As for your other point. Just because you believe something and act on it doesn't mean you are right. History is replete with cases of decisions made because people had incorrect information.

In summary, I'm absolutely using a cop out... But in all seriousness, this was more of a thought experiment on why Dumbledore thinks the way he did. I'm not saying that he is right or that the thought process isn't flawed but can you agree that someone (especially when not in possession of all the facts) could come to this conclusion, flawed through it is?

**** I'm thinking that you're positing a level of selective blindness that really does amount to bashing. He believes what the bad guy tells him about 1919, but not the events of 1945-46 that /he's actually present for at least some of?/

While we're here, what /is/ the canon support for Dumbledore's forgiving attitude? He's not in sole charge of the Death Eater Trials of 1981-82, Crouch the Elder is shown leading those. He's only seen speaking up for one Death Eater, and that's Snape. Who, however grudgingly and incompetently, is one of his intelligence assets.

** The obvious counterargument is that Versailles was not harsh enough. I mean, right-wing extremism and the belief of racial superiority are pretty much non-existent in modern Germany after we were utterly defeated by the Russians while the American and British razed our cities. The Dolchstoßlegende came to be because Germany had very little of its territory occupied by 1918 and had crushed the Russians in the East. It is hard to argue the same when up to 10 million Soviets cross your borders and storm your capital.

** If you want to go with the "Dumbledore wants to redeem everybody" narrative that a lot of indie!Harry stories like to go with, I think he might go a strategy of appeasement following the first defeat of Voldemort.

** Eh, sanction and reperations weren't as important to the rise of the Nazis as is often stated. If any economic forces did it was the great depression.

Italy and Spain did not have war reperations, and still managed to fall victim to fascism.

A counter historical parallel would be the story of British PM Neville Chamberlain, who sought prevent war with Germany with a disasterous policy called appeasement.

He allowed them to Annex part of chzechoslovakia, re-arm the military and place troops in the Rhineland. The British gave an inch, and Hitler took a mile.

The reason why Dumbledore is more forgiving and willing to give second chances to his enemies is to encourage defectors, and allow the society at large to heal after a conflict. This was not a concern in the lead up to the second world war.

*** And because of WW1, Germany got loans from the US to pay war-reparations to Britain, who in turn payed back loans to the US themselves. Germany's loans also paid for Industrial rebuilding. The Great Depression hit, and the loans stopped coming in. Germany didn't get anymore loans. They couldn't repay their debts as fast, and it all spiralled out of control. WW2, can be traced back to the Versailles Treaty. Mostly because the American's smelt a fortune in upping their Tariff's to stop the German from selling their wares in the US and using that cash to pay it back.

​

EDIT: Is this sub filled with butt hurt american's? That was the short explanation from a lecture on History from Versailles to the Great Depression.
