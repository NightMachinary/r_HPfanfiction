Title says it all. Got a positive result today and feel quite crappy. Fanfic is my best distraction, but I feel like I've read everything with my favorite pairing.

I'm trying to broaden my horizons so I am open to any recs. Any pairings/tropes/ratings. Darkness okay, but would like a happy ending.

All I ask is that they are LONG, COMPLETE with a HEA and YOUR FAVORITE.


** Although it's not cheerful in many ways (though the foregone conclusion is somewhat happy), I can't help but recommend the fanfiction classic that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] - it's Chamber of Secrets but told through Ginny's diary entries (it's been tried since by other authors but never bested). It's a slow start but it gradually descends into that's slightly uncomfortable to read but in a good way, and that will leave you hooked. Worth your time if you haven't read it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] is another one worth reading. It's got a sort of melancholy vibe to it with an open ending - the mystery is solved and understood with some lovely Dumbledore-ian wisdom but not truly ‘happy' in my opinion. Still with reading though - it's a mystery of a student that seems to have gone missing between first and fifth year with no explanation given in canon. When I've previously recommended this, someone else described it as a good fic for curling up with a hot drink while reading, and I think that's a fair summary.

Finally, on the lighter end of the spectrum, there's the wonderful [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][Pranking The Tournament]] - a decent funny read. It starts with a simple premise, namely “which school was Harry entered under into the Triwizard Tournament” and sees Harry go full Marauder in a brilliant way. Featuring gender-bending Harry, funny moments and a hilarious running gag where Harry pretends to try and seduce Draco Malfoy (it makes sense in context, trust me), it's well worth a read for anyone who wants a laugh.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]]- linkffn(2318355) - This is a classic story. My all time favorite because of how unique of a world that is created. Plenty of humor and fun references. The author has many other classic stories as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][Quoth the Raven, Nevermore]] - linkffn(6652537) - Here is another very unique and enjoyable story between Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe]] - linkffn(13326497) - Avengers crossover that is pretty well done and has plenty of good moments between characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD crossover. No knowledge about the previous series is really needed. This story is not complete, but it is under regular updates. However, it is probably one of the largest fics I know currently being just under 1 million words. Lots of happy, rewarding moments, interesting characters, interesting world-building, this fic has it all.

And yeah a small but hopefully interesting list.

And yeah, Post-Apocalyptic is a very strong power fantasy story, but I ended up enjoying the story for its character interactions and world-building. But I can see why people don't like it.

** First of all, I wish you a quick recovery. I had it myself earlier this year and it was actually what got me back into the fandom. While I was sick, I read NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series which I really recommend since, while it's written in the same spirit as the original series, the magic is way more different and the characters are also quite likable (maybe not "the Golden Trio" level likable, but then again I didn't grow up with the ones from this series). It's seven books so should keep you busy enough. I'll post the link for the first one in case you're interested.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][Unsphere the stars]] by cocoa artist is one of the absolute most engrossing and interesting fanfics I've ever read. It expands on the magical world, magical theory, Hermione's complexity, Dumbledore critique but not bashing, treatment of Muggles, older wizarding families before the rise of Voldemort, and turns so many things on their head. That being said, the ship is Hermione/Tom Riddle and a time traveling plot which originally made me almost skip it entirely but I'm honest that it completely took me by surprised at how rich and careful the story was. You'll speed through the 57 chapters!

** First of all, I hope you make a full and speedy recovery.

"All According to Plan" and it's sequels are a fun a long read about a time and demenision traveling young Bellatrix who is dedicated a chaos god. The series has lots of good world building and the MC Bellatrix gets up to some rather absurd things, dragging some canon characters along for the ride. There are two complete stories in the series thus far and a third that while incomplete is already 470k words. Fair warning the authors describe themselves as "wordy bitches" and there are points where it gets a bit much.

** Long fics coming right up!

linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) -- Sirius stays in Britain instead of fleeing the country after PoA and starts making moves to clear his name and get custody of Harry. Features lots of politicking and Black family drama.

linkffn(Heroes Assemble) -- Avengers crossover, Harry is in New York when the Chitauri attack and ends up joining the squad. Follows through most if not all of the MCU. (Haven't actually watched any of them myself but it seems to hit most of the key points.) Notable among Avengers crossovers (IMO) for retaining contact with the magical world instead of being a man unto himself.

linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes; Annals of Arithmancy) -- Hermione is a math prodigy and tests into Arithmancy in first year. Things snowball from there. Hermione-centric, obviously, with a large focus on spell and ritual creation with some hand-waved roots in actual mathematics such as linear equations and fractals.

linkffn(Long Live the Queen by Offsides) -- Harry petitions the Queen for help as a last-ditch effort for help with the Ministry's attempts to steamroll him at the beginning of OotP. She is not pleased when she learns of the state of the magical world. (EDIT: Bot picked up the wrong fic for this the first time around.)

linkffn(Harry Potter: The Lone Traveller; Stories of the Lone Traveler; Further Adventures of the Lone Traveler; Lone Traveler, God and Wizard) -- a /long as fuck/ series where Harry, following a botched attempt to set up a time travel fix-it scenario, ends up drifting between various universes (both HP and not) where his intervention leads to improving whatever situation he lands in. A couple of caveats: The writing quality is okay at best, the narration tends to come across as rather preachy at times (it's /very/ big on free will, and capital-G God becomes involved), and it tends to gloss over large chunks of conversation by saying what was discussed instead of actually writing dialogue. But if you're just after something long to binge on, it will suit, and it's largely episodic in format so you can easily drop it for the day and pick up later no problem. Also comes with a number of side stories that extend on scenarios already written in the main series. (EDIT: The bot only picked up on the first one in the series here, so I want to note that the rest are all by a different author, dunuelos, who picked it up.)

** Would you like to read a [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Web Serial]] about superheroes? The first story/book is the length of the HP series+50% extra stuff.

If you can handle some darkness and humans being really cruel to one another, you'd be a shoe-in for reading Worm.

Just, read the warning on the front page before getting too involved in the story. I was no kidding about the darkness and cruelty

[[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] is original and is a bit less dark, although it sometimes gets hard to keep up with the conversations between super-intelligent people.

*** Recommending Worm with a caveat---If you feel like the story is just running on Rule of Drama, and this bothers you... It probably won't improve as you go on. There were only a few cases where I thought “this is obviously just to make things worse for Taylor and/or the world in general,” and then it turned out that there was a decent explanation for it. Most of the time, if the author sees an opportunity to make things worse but has to contradict something that happened a couple hundred thousand words ago, he'll contradict it.

That said, this was a web serial that was being written on the go, with no editor, so inconsistencies like that are to be expected.

This fanfiction is one I quite liked when binge reading Harry/Fleur fics and the first thing that came to mind when reading your post.

Story: A Cadmean Victory [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957]]

It's, of course, a Harry/Fleur fic, though it includes it's own branch of magic and delves quite deeply within it ,which I found interesting. One of the few fics I've read that actually explains how Harry survived Voldemort. Well without the whole love thing.

Also look into anything by the author Debstheslytherinsnapefan. She has a lot of stories with 200k+. She is a very active author but I should warn you that she is mainly a Slash author.

- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1023625][In Care Of]] by Fang's Fawn). A Canon-Divergence Hurt/Comfort fic. In the summer before his sixth year, Snape gets into an accident in his animagus form of a bat and is nursed back to health by an unaware Harry. The Dursley's make that difficult, and Snape gets to see how spoilt Harry really is. 45,319 Words.
- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran. A Harry/Ginny Soul-Bond fic. This fic is without a doubt my favourite fanfic of not just Harry Potter, but all time. It's not technically complete, but it currently leaves off at the end of Harry and Ginny's second year, and it's a good enough ending point. The fic itself is your classic Soul-Bond story with added magic powers along with it, but its execution of telling a compelling story is just brilliant. I have physical copies of this fic for a /reason./ 629,386 Words.
- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker. A Canon-Divergence Hurt/Comfort fic. Harry's life with the Dursleys' was bad, that goes without saying, but what this fic does is take a look at the possible ramifications this may have had on a developing child. While the Dursleys' treatment of Harry is not any worse than canon, the results, certainly are. If you want a cry, bing this. Don't worry, it's a happy ending at the end of it all. 316,056 Words.
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21064049][The Last Black]] by Toboe1087). A Harry Potter/My Hero Academia Crossover. Voldemort is defeated, but Harry still has to go through the aftermath of it. Including going through the Black fortune that he inherited from Sirius. There's a problem though, Harry needs the signature of the last Black alive, who just happens to be Aizawa Shouta. 93,848 Words.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] by Paimpont). A Canon-Divergent Mystery fic.

What happened to Sally-Anne Perks? 36,835 Words.
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/365648][To Recollect the Future]] by oliversnape). A Peggy-Sue Found Family fic. As Harry wakes up in the Forbidden Forest after being hit with Voldemort's Killing Curse, he finds himself in his eleven-year-old body along with Severus Snape. Harry and Severus work together to destroy the horcruxes and hopefully not kill each other in the process. 71,511 Words.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds The Image]] by RubbishRobots). A Doctor Who Crossover.
