I was thinking about fan fiction earlier and whilst I don't really love fics about existing characters, I do like the idea of universe expansion with a whole different group of characters, just with the same core wizarding theme. I was then thinking about mash-ups... like, which non-wizard film, show, book might be awesome to be 'twisted' into the wizarding world.

So, I thought a bit more and came up with some initial ideas, I would love your thoughts. I'm no writer, but I'd love to read these...

1. Hunger Games Mashup: Voldemort wins the war and takes over. For his own amusement he pits 12 young mudblood wizards between the ages of 11 and 17 into a Hunger Games style fight to the death. The winner gets 'half-blood' status and gets to keep their wand.

2. Line of Duty: I love the idea of mixing a police drama in with wizards. The story follows the role of AAC12 (Anti Auror Corruption 12) as they track down a dark wizard, thought to be one of the higher ranking ministry officials.

There are so many you could choose from, but these two really peaked my interest... anybody got any other great mashup ideas?


** Here's a few fics with scenes about aurors at work:

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has a few scenes from the perspective of aurors who have to deal with Voldemort's followers in the ministry and in their own ranks while also enforcing the law that the Wizengamot can't agree on and hunting down Hermione.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Harry as an auror later on, dealing with stupid uncooperative coworkers, hunting dark wizards and finding thieves.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) starts with Hermione as a soldier/guard in a dystopian AU Britain where Malfoy won the war after Voldemort disappeared. Lots of investigative work.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
