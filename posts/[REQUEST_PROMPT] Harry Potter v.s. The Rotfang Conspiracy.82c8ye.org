I feel like reading some humorous action, so if there's a fic where The Quibbler is mostly real, and Luna accidentally drags Harry into her quest to blow the Rotfang Conspiracy wide open? Bonus points if they break out of a Rotfang Stronghold via Snorkack.

Preferably no slash? It's just not my cup 'o tea.


** Wait. I remember a nice fic that started off with Luna outside the ministry. There was some spy action or something. Really good. I'll try finding it, can't remember the name at all though.

** I'd love to see a story where all of Luna's conspiracy theories are real - not just the weird animals but the Rotfang Conspiracy, Fudge's goblin pies, the Heliopath army, the Tutshill Tornadoes torturing people for Quidditch, vampire Scrimgeour, hell even Sirius being undercover as Stubby Boardman rather than in Azkaban.

It would be hilarious and potentially fascinating rationalizing all that and putting it to a plot.

*** Now im just imagining a pair of scenes, the first being "sirius" begging the Minister to release him, that he did nothing wrong, and the Minister laughing at him. The second scene is Dumbledore reading an article about 'The Boy-Who-Lived, Adopted by Pop Singer' and flipping out

** Alternatively, a story about Harry and Luna investigating the conspiracy theories from the Quibbler, and stumbling into a real conspiracy would be amazing.
