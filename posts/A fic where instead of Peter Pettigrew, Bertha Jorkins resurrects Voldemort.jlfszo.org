:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a fic whose name I can't recall, although I'm certain it exists, and that I've read it, albeit not to completion.

It's probably a fix-it fic of some sort, maybe even a time travel fic, and this is just some event that happens during the story.

The thing I'm looking for is that, when Harry is transported to the graveyard at Little Hangleton, Bertha Jorkins is there, and does the ritual, possibly because Pettigrew has already been taken care of earlier in the fic.

Please help me find this fic.

Thank you.


** I think it's linkffn(11446957)

The graveyard stuff happens at chapter 35.

*** Indeed it is.

Explains why I couldn't remember the fic.

In the psychology business (where I am an avid consumer), we call that "repression".

**** Eh, to be fair while not a good story when taken alone it /does/ make a good inversion of the universally hated Indy!Harry trope by having everything go worse and worse the deeper Harry enters the trope.

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a remastered version is coming to my Patreon! (For free)
