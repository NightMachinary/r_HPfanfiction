Hi all! So I read a lot of fanfiction but clearly I haven't read them all. Recently, I've been in the mood for a bad-ass Harry. By this, a competent, I-Could-Get-Creamed-In-My-Next-Fight-But-Ill-Try-My-Best Harry. I find that I like really good duelling scenes, clever wand work, some sort of story arch that makes sense, even if it's AU. With that...what's your favorite scene from a story? I'm willing to give most stories a try at the moment. I'll take any and all recommendations!


** Oh yeah, as a note, here's one of my favorite scenes. This comes from The Merging by Shaydrall. Something about this scene always gets me excited lol

Begin Quote:

He walked over to the end of the table and leaned on it, staring down its length. The Ravenclaws nearest to him, who looked to be in one of the younger years, fell silent at once, watching him warily. But he wasn't paying attention to them. Instead, his eyes were focused on the High Table, where the professors were sitting. Most of them were absorbed in their meals, but Professor Dumbledore was watching him closely. Their eyes met, and Harry tilted his head ever so slightly to the side, his expression cold. Dumbledore's eyes narrowed, but he did nothing back, his only action being to place his fork beside his plate and interlock his fingers in front of his face.

"Well, how about that," said Harry to himself, finishing his scan of the staff table. "No Umbridge."

"Of course not, Potter, no one's seen her all day," said one of the older students who was closer to him.

"Brilliant, now I won't get expelled for what I'm about to do," he said cheerfully, pulling out his wand. "Well, I hope not. Exolesco!"

The yellow spell hit the table and spread rapidly, making its way to the other end in less than a second, causing the Ravenclaws to make sounds of surprise. Moments later, the table began creaking ominously, causing quite a few students to jump up from their seats in apprehension. In less than ten seconds, every single Ravenclaw was standing well back from their table, having followed the lead of the others. The table, finally unable to support the weight of all the food and dishes, split down the center lengthwise, dropping every single thing onto the floor on either side of the table with a deafening crash. People all over jumped away to avoid the mess but not all of them were so lucky.

"Harry Potter!" came the astonished shout from Professor McGonagall as she looked on in complete shock. Her voice stilled the shouting that had started among the students around the hall. The crash had brought half the professors to their feet, including his Head of House. "What do you---" But she cut off as Dumbledore held up a hand to silence her, motioning her to sit down. She threw him an incredulous look but obeyed nonetheless. The other professors also sat back down, watching him with varied expressions. Harry made a mental note to thank the Headmaster later. And to stop giving him so much hell.

"Well, now that I've got your attention," began Harry, twirling his wand a few times, "Who took the butterbeer cap necklace?"

There were a few small gasps from his right, most likely his own table, but he kept his attention on the Ravenclaws. His friends from that House were looking at him in utter shock.

"Harry, what's the meaning of this?" came a voice from halfway down the ruined table. Roger Davies. "Why did you just destroy my House's table?"

"A table that seats a bunch of petty thieves really isn't much of a table at all," he said with a scowl, drawing a number of angry retorts from the group of students before him. "SHUT UP!" he shouted, his voice booming out over them, enhanced by his wand. "You all shut the fuck up! I'm done with Ravenclaw right now. I'm not here to talk, just make threats that you'll all bloody well listen to. Now, I'll say it again... Who took the necklace?"

People were looking back at the professors, but they were all focused on Harry and the Ravenclaws, who were becoming even more unsettled now that Flitwick and the other professors weren't defending them at all.

Slowly, a girl stepped out of the crowd about midway down the ruined table. The area around him had long been vacated of Ravenclaws. They were now all at least a third of the way down the hall.

"I---I did," she said in a timid voice.

Harry pointed at the doors. "Go get it," he snapped at her coldly, pointing at the door. "Bring it to me here. Now." The girl quickly ran from the hall, without a second glance.

"So," he continued, as if he hadn't just destroyed a House table and practically held them all at wand point. "I don't know how deep this runs, but it's going to stop now. I'm disgusted by the lot of you. The ones who have been actually taking her things, her homework, her clothing, her personal things... don't let me find out who you are. The rest of you are just as bad. I know you all know what I'm talking about, and the fact that it's still happening means you just let it go. Fucking ridiculous. This is our home!" he spat at them.

Silence followed this. Ravenclaw was being crushed under the collective intense stares from everyone else in the hall, not a single one made a sound. The Houses at Hogwarts were more than just names to a handful of groups of kids. Each House was a self contained family that failed and succeeded as one. Like any family there they all had their internal problems, but it was base treachery to go against one another like that. Well, sure there were the bad eggs like Malfoy who would back stab his own mother, but for an entire House to let one of its own suffer like that was just flat out cruelty, and not something easily forgiven. To him it was purely unacceptable.

One of the reasons he'd never forgotten how Gryffindor had taken to his being a Parselmouth.

Just then the girl from earlier re-entered the Great Hall, completely out of breath, a familiar necklace clutched in her hand.

"Sorry," she mumbled, aware that all eyes were now on her. She pushed the necklace into his hands and ran back into the group.

Harry merely turned and walked back to the doors, stopping before he crossed the threshold.

"Every single thing that's been taken. Return it tonight, or else. If this ever happens again, I'll personally remove Ravenclaw Tower from this castle. See if I won't."

The doors closed behind him sharply, causing many to let go of the breaths they had been holding. What on earth---

"And five fucking thousand points from Ravenclaw!"

Which was followed by an explosion of metal, wood, and glass that could be felt through their seats.

** linkffn(A Beautiful Lie; Realignment; No More Games; Honour Thy Blood; Hogwarts Battle School; The Other Boy Who Lived; Eclipse of the Sky; The Legacy by storytellerspw)

This is what I remember right now. I also loved the Merging, btw.

ABL - Every scene where he goes off Hogwarts with Dumbledore, pretty much.

Realignment - There's this quote, that I'm paraphrasing, where he says to Grindewald mid 3-way duel against him and Dumbledore (all on their own sides) "I've killed immortals before" and it just chills the bones. Also, fantastic fight scenes and new spells, Hell, the first chapter is bonkers.

NMG - Parts of the TWT were nice, and I loved how the 3-war duel between Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort near the latest chapters went.

HTB - Harry was in France chasing Wormtail and found like 8 DE trying to rape/kidnap a Veela Coven, and lets just say, this scene earns the bloody/gore warning. Also, the final battle between Harry and Tom is really really cool. So is the battle against the giants with Sirius.

HBC - My favourite complete-AU fic combined with elements of one of my favourite book series, Ender's Game. There's 2 scenes that I found to be fucking awesome, one is near the end of the first year (its actually the third school year, but first of the story) during a competition inside the Forest. Also, every single battle is awesome, and there's a lot of them. The other scene is the second Task of the TWT.

TOBWL - Pretty much everything after the halfway mark, where the war begins in earnest for Harry. It has a sad ending though, if you don't want that, don't read.

EOS - Well, this is just a clusterfuck of battles. The ones that I found awesome that come to mind are: The Hogsmead Battle, all Horcruxes battles except the Tree one, which is sad. (they are completely different from canon, both in quantity and defenses and what they are, they are also complete bad-asses) The Battle in Grimwauld Place; both battles in the Forbidden Forest, one after Hogsmead and the other in the 3 latest chapters, the battle in Dublin... Hmm, that all I can remember. Complete with this, it has one of my favourite OC characters and I love the way the romance goes in this fic, and it is quite the focus for it. Remus and Tonks are adorably crazy and funny too.

The Legacy - Harry's wedding day(cmon, you can't say its a spoiler when the description states its a marriage contract fic, which is completely different than the fanon trope, don't think its that usual shebang) and the fight against the Notts, which is Harry against 6 people. It has a lot of innovative magics that Harry and Hermione develop, and cool applications of common magics.

Guess thats it.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

** This is pretty damn good. Harry has a lot of power(more than even Voldemort, or Dumbledore), but he would straight up lose to Dumbledore in seconds, because of how experienced he is in the many types of magic. I'm in the middle of it right now, and there was this awesome fight scene between Harry and Dumbledore involving lightning, the cursed fire(I can never spell it right), water, and all sorts. I know from the beginning tone it sounds like a bashing story, but remember this is through the eyes of an angry teenager. It gets so much better by the half way point(sooner maybe) to the point where Harry, and Dumbledore are friendly(actual friendly, not putting up with you friendly) with each other. I don't want to ruin it, but i'd suggest reading it.
