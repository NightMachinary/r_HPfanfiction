The fic starts with Harry kidnapped in the Chamber of Secrets with Voldemort having won the Battle of Hogwarts, and Harry has to learn wandless magic to escape.


** That story is called *The World I Leave Behind*: linkffn(5189189)

It's a pretty dark story though, and I never fully understood some of the plot developments, such as how Harry survived that one AK.

It's quite simple. Voldemort served as an effective horcrux to Harry in canon. While Voldemort lives, Harry cannot die.

#+begin_quote
  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. *His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you* and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.
