So; I have this headcanon, it may or may not be considered as strange; that is that other languages make the magic stronger.

French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, et cetra; even Parseltongue make magic stronger.

Any story that has this element in this?

Note no UnGodly powerful Harry (Harry as more powerful than canon is fine, but make it realistic enough

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

No Seer Luna

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Harry is Lord/Heir to whatever

No Harem Harry

Little to no character bashing; if there is character bashing please don't let it be the Weasley's as I really love the Weasley's.

Other than that whatever is in it is fine. Would rather have it as completed though


** I don't really understand what your idea is. You can't say whatever translations of an incantation you want and expect it to work. The incantation for something is (or resembles) Latin or English or whatever, and that's it. Change the incantation and that's a different spell.

My point is, there could imaginably be, for example, spells whose incantation is in Parseltongue. (Well, I doubt there /are/, but a gifted spellcrafter could certainly invent some.) However, they wouldn't be a more powerful version of the spell in Latin/English/whatever; they'd be entirely new spells, which may or may not be powerful.

** Im not sure if its an explicit evidence to your theory but I think the infamous, "its Le-vi-OH-sa not le-vi-oh-SA" could be an indicator of that. At the very least pronunciation does matter in getting the spell to work, which makes me think that if they bothered to pronounce them in proper Latin the spells might have have come out easier for them.

*** I know, my theory isn't exactly supported in canon; but it's just something I've always thought of. (I think a large part of it is because I wanted Parseltongue to be more important in the books than it ended up being).

I couldn't be bothered to read all your requirements. Hope this fits.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I'm lost. Are you wanting there to be other spell languages or for Harry to say a spell in parseltounge and it be better? Or are you wanting just parseltounge spells? If the last I can't remember the name but it's got an amulet that lets Harry teleport around the castle but the further he teleports the more energy it takes. The title is something to do with the amulet I think. Pretty sure it's on hpfanfiction or whatever.
