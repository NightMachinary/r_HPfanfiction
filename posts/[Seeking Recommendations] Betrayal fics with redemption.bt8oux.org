I've read too many betrayal fics where 13-14 year olds make a mistake and somehow end up ruining their entire lives because of it. Can you recommend any fics where people actually learn from their mistakes and maybe even end up happy? Maybe one where Harry (let's face it, he's usually the one being betrayed) learns that forgiveness, without being taken to fanon extremes, is a good and healthy behaviour.


** I believe linkffn(Earl of the North by Lord Silvere) would be something of your liking.

Betrayal and amends is a focal point in major parts of the story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3995826/1/The-Hidden-Hero][The Hidden Hero]] has a Harry who, disguised as a muggleborn, still goes through many of the trials the original Harry faces but is betrayed by the wizarding world multiple times over because his background. The dynamic between an embittered Harry and a remorseful/defensive wizarding world -- once his true identity is revealed -- is quite satisfying to read. linkffn(3995826)

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny
