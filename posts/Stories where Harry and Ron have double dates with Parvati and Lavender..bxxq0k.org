Just thought this concept up and I love the idea of Harry and Ron bromancing over dating 2 of the most attractive girls in their year who are also besties. I think there's some fun potential to be had there.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

** " The double date had been a good idea " Harry thought to himself as he faked a smile at Parvati . The two of them sat at a table in Madam Puddifoots between two that were occupied by Lily Moon and Roger Malone ( both laughing loudly at some joke Lily had made about Pansy Parkinson's new perfume ) and his own date's twin and Michael Corner ( both making some snide but humorous comments about the proprietor of the establishment ) . But the double date had swelled into including every single couple in their year group ( and some students Parvati and Lavender thought needed an extra push to admit their feelings )

Neither Harry or Ron ( or any other boy involved by the sounds of it) had been informed of this arrangement until they had stepped into the restaurant and seen every single one of the heart shaped tables had a " Reserved " sign on it.

Harry turned to look at his best mate on the other side of the building. Ron was also faking a smile in Lavender's direction and was clearly dreading the return to the castle. Fred and George had stumbled upon the sign the third years were in and had run off to tell everyone they knew how " wuv was in the air "
