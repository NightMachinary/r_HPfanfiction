Preferably short (less than 15 chapters long) and complete. I like canon-compliant fics best, but AUs are fine. And I'm a SUCKER for angst!

No noncon or explicit sex scenes.


** for some great Scorbus, id recommend starlightpeddler's The Quietly series, starting at Hogwarts and going through to wedding and kids. And LittleRose13 has a series called I Knew It All Along, currently 2 stories but shes writing a third. As for Hinny, id recomend jenoramas California Dreamin', or anything Floreat Castellum and gryffindormischief writes, the latter esp for one shots. Enjoy!!

**** Forgot to add hwimsey's The Coven of Echoes, think youll find it only on PhoenizSong, its Hinny AU and also written before the book series ended.

** It was fun to look through my fics and to try to check all your boxes! Here's what I came up with.

For canon-compliant Romione that's not too long and not explicit, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8543501/bowtruckles][bowtruckles]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4721967/19/Biscuits-A-Love-Story][Biscuits: A Love Story]]. Other authors like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1146256/TMBlue][TMBlue]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]] write stuff that's a little longer and a little more M-rated, though TMBlue has a bunch of short one-shots as well that are rated T and K.

For Scorbus, definitely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991/chapters/17639245][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]] (5 chapters) and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474][Put Your Curse In Reverse]] (14 chapters). You should also check out FloreatCastellum's [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/185703779261/when-do-you-think-albus-and-scorpius-got-together][little one-shot]] about how they get together.

And speaking of Flo's ficlets, she has a ton of fluffy, canon-compliant Hinny drabbles in her [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][list of ficlets]].

I don't actually know of any Scorlily fics, but based on your pairings, I really think you'd like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11203193/1/How-to-Charm-a-Witch][How to Charm a Witch]].
