** My fic is a Gryffindor/ Slytherin pairing. Hope you don't mind me shamelessly suggesting it to you.

*** This is one of my favorites! Is Graces the best name ever? Probably not, but the character development and plot line are phenomenal.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

**** Graces is a horrible, no, /abhorrent/ name. Even Grace and Gracie is better. Or if we're looking for the kind of naming the Blacks and Malfoys do, then maybe Callidora, Elladora, or Lucretia would have been better.

  Ginny Weasley is haunted by the past. Tom Riddle looks forward to the future. Such obsession always leaves traces. A two-shot Gin n'Tonic.

** Here's a Tom/Minerva one that I love. It manages to keep both true to their characters and definitely puts emphasis on their respective Slytherin and Gryffindor qualities. It's also an excellent period piece, but sadly abandonded.
