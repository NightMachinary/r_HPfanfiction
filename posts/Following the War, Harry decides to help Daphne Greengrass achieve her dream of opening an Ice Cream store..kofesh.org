Obviously this is a bit of a play on the whole 'Ice Queen' thing, but in a different direction. There has been fics connecting the Ice Queen to Ice Cream, but only with Daphne liking Ice Cream - not making and selling it. But yeah, Daphne would be interested in opening an Ice Cream store, and Harry helps provide some of the money to start it up as Daphne isn't rich. Harry also decides to work there with her just to get his mind of the war and to have something to do.

This could be a good one-shot for just a Harry/Daphne friendship or romance. Preferably there wouldn't be any bashing either, just some good wholesome fluff and friendship :)


** I am still waiting for a sequel to this.

** At this point, the "not Ice Queen, *ICE CREAM*" Daphne fics are becoming more of a trope than the ice queen ones.
