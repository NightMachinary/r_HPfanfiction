I'm lookin for the fic where Harry can flick his wand 3 times and everybody on the battlefield are dead. I am tired of fics there is said that Harry is super powerful but he always struggles with opponents which are considered much weaker than him. Where he is always injured in every minor scufle. Where he can raise mountains and turn the sun off, but he can't finish off the opponent. I understand that is done because author wants to add some intrigue and excitement. But this shouldn't be done on such excuses such as Harry couldn't use his full power, didn't eat his pancakes and ect. I'm waiting for your recommendation and sorry for my English. P. S. don't recommend me the Windshear, it's awesome, but I already read it. Thank you.


** It would be great but it needs a good explanation to become a good fic
