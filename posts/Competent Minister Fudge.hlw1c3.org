We all know the fics that slam Fudge for arresting Hagrid, not believing the Trio about Sirius, ignoring Voldemort's resurrection, and putting Umbridge in Hogwarts. What if him saying "I have to been seen doing something" isn't the act of an incompetent politician looking to keep his job, but a seasoned politician who believes he is the best person for the job looking to defend it from those who would wreak havoc in office.

** I think there was a fic called “The Greatest Minister” that kinda does this, but it involves a grown up mod Harry from another universe.

  The Lone Traveler arrives on the even of Fudge's election. Instead of pelting Dumbledore for advice, the new Minister listens to a new viewpoint. Much is changed.

** Are you familiar with the Václav Havel's verison of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beggar's_Opera][The Beggar's Opera]]? The logic of “if I won't do the evil thing, somebody else will and he'll be worse than me” is something very familiar to us who grew up beyond the Iron Curtain. The answer is obviously the one from the Lord of the Ring “Do not touch it, Frodo!”: if you do it, you are becoming to be them, and in the end you end up as Nazgûl.
