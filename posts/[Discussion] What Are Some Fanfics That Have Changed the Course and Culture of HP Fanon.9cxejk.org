I read somewhere that Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy is largely responsible for the rise in the 'Draco in Leather Pants' trope which also contributes to other cliches like 'Ron the Death Eater.' As a result of this fanfic, many now have a distorted view of both Draco and Ron's characters in canon. Unbelievably, some fans who haven't revisited the canon novels for awhile will swear down that Ron physically abused Hermione/called Hermione a mudblood in the books due to the perception of Ron which has become popular in fan fictions.

I wondering what other stories have spurred on tropes that have either muddled canon drastically or have lead the charge for other fanfic authors to promote a particular idea or agenda that has gained noticeable traction in the Harry Potter fan fiction community.

Bonus points for any historical background perspective from those of you who were deep into the fandom during the 2004-2006 AKA the 'Harry Potter Mania' time period!


** The Shoebox Project was the origin of the Remus being obsessed with chocolate trope - I know he fed the kids it in canon, but it made sense for sugar to work them up after a shock, and this took it a step further.

** Also, around 05-07 (when I was first getting in to the fan fiction myself), there was a massive wave of "Horocrux Hunt" stories, so if you want to, you can consider HBP in the list of things that spawned tropes. It mostly died off in 07 when DH came out, but I know personally, I'd read so many Horcrux Hunt stories, that Deathly Hallows was a bit of letdown for me. The only surprises was how many people died, Harry the Horocrux, and the Deathly Hallows themselves.

Most every other bit, from the Ministry falling to the year long camping trip had been done before. The rest was set dressing.

Edit: Also forgot, the wand lore was a nice addition. Don't think I had seen that specific ending before hand. I remember being very meh for the bulk of the book, but most impressed with the final duel.

  Edit: I must say that although the Sacrifices Arc includes a number of tropes I normally find intolerable Lightning on the Wave used them masterfully and it was probably one of the only works with those tropes of which I managed to read a significant portion.
#+end_quote

I am a very late-comer to the HP fandom, but it is my opinion that LotW did these tropes /before/ they were too tropey. I honestly feel like, poking around older fics, that Sacrifices was one of the more original examples of many different tropes. Looking back, it is full of some pretty terrible things, but the skill with which LotW brings them together gives this fic a warm place in my heart.

** One highly influential story in the early aughts was Barb/B.L. Purdom's Triangle Prophecy trilogy (plus prequel), which was written between 2002 and 2004.

The SSHG ship was essentially launched by one writer: Sphinx/TextualSphinx, whose one-shot "To Sever the Silver Lining From a Cloud" and sadly unfinished "Decoding the Heart" set imaginations afire circa 2001/2002. Around the same time, Riley's (also unfinished) "Pawn to Queen" got a lot of people talking. And of course, ChellyBean's 2003 Marriage Law Challenge spread far beyond SSHG.

I feel terrible for Riley because she was one of the first BNWs to be chased out of fandom by wank from her stories. Sadly, it's the same BS that TJLC stirred up in the Sherlock fandom: accusations of rape apologia, fake feminism, etc.

I mean, I was a hardcore male!Blaise proponent before it was canon (PTQ featured female!Blaise), but I took that shit to discussion boards, I didn't piss all over reviews section of a story I was enjoying, and so many people did.

Did you read at Witchfics? I loved so many of the stories archived there. I even got my spouse reading Anna/ColdCoffeeEyes's Roman Holiday/Jewel of the Nile stories. And Vulgarweed is still writing!

Agreed that people suck. Every now and then, I revisit the MsScribe unauthorized biography just to remember how glad I am that I was hanging out in such a tiny, unfashionable corner of fandom at the time that was going down. I mean it got heated enough at the HP4GU and WIKTT Yahoo groups without weaponizing sockpuppets.

Here's hoping that Riley has gone on to writing amazing o-fic and landing on all the bestseller lists.

** "After The End", written from May 2001 to June 2003, therefore during the Three-Year Summer of the HP fandom, is basically the "classic" fic of SugarQuill.net, which was a H/G and R/Hr shipping site (it's still possible to access the site, but it is inactive as of 2009). The fic did a lot to cement SQ as the main canon supporting site, especially since it was written by some of the main founders, notably Arabella and Zsenya.

** As far as I can tell, from May 2008, "Partially Kissed Hero" by Perfect Lionheart Linkffn(4240771) was the start of the EVIL!Dumbledore craze. Up until then, from what I could see, mostly Dumbledore was obstructionist, not evil. YMMV on the rest of the story, but the set up for the reveal of Dumbledore as the antagonist was well done. So well done, that to this day, I still see evil Dumbledore fics that copy the rationale for the shift to antagonism. Pity they generally miss the build up for it.

Also, from October 2005, we had "Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past" by S'TarKan linkffn(2636963) was at the very least, the first big (if not outright the first period) "Harry goes back to fix everything and save the girl" fic. When S'TarKan stopped updating, we saw a massive boom of copycat stories.

*** Can't name a good example off the top of my head, but there was definitely evil!Dumbledore way before 2008. Order of the Phoenix (2003) really sparked off a wave of independent!Harry and manipulative (and then evil) Dumbledore and I was strongly primed to see the evil!Dumbledore in the Goblet of Fire movie (2005).

I've been reading 'redo' fics since the beginning and it's still one of my favorite tropes. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2114097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Time-Mage][Harry Potter and the Time Mage]] (October 2004) was the original 'redo' fic, which sparked off the wave (including Nightmares of Futures Past). As a side note, other fics that did not fix /established canon/ (starting or rejoining the canon timeline after the then-current canon) existed before then, such as [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][Mirror of Maybe]] (2002).

It was also one of the first stories where Tonks was the love interest. The R series also comes to mind in that regard.

Neither have aged particularly well, but they are still readable.

** I'm a bit of a late-comer compared with some of the posters in this thread, but in my experience, the things that have most influenced the fanon haven't been stories; they've been /challenges/.

You have the WIKTT "Marriage Law" challenge from 2003, which started both Marriage Law and Sevmione. Reptilia28's "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge dates to 2007/8, and while it doesn't predate /Nightmares of Futures Past/, it codified a lot of the time travel and Evil!Dumbledore tropes seen in later fics. Paladeus's "Champions of Lilith" challenge also contributed to that and probably to Lunar Harmony, too. And I feel like I might be missing one or two more. These all had a much bigger effect than almost any single story.

This last point isn't a fic, but an interesting note to see which pairings have gone in and out of vogue as more books and media have been released and JK has filled in data behind the scenes. A popular early pairing that has fallen by the wayside these days for example was Dumbledore/McGonagall, while on the flipside Harry/Luna and Neville/Luna /surged/ in popularity after Evanna originated her in the movies.

I wish I knew the origin of some pairings like Snape/Hermione and tropes like evil!Weasleys that use love potions.

It does not follow.

1. A description is not a name. The map is to be used for the purpose of marauding and so it is the marauder's map.

2. We have no way of knowing whether James & Co intended to pass the map on.

Also this part is not correct:

#+begin_quote
  As they were the 'marauder's' referred to by the Map

"Marauder's" cannot refer to any "they", because it is singular.

There is no contradiction here.

They called themselves the Marauders, that's why they called it the Marauder's Map -- this is the in-universe explanation, which is now canon.

JKR decided to have James & Co call themselves the Marauders after fans had already used the term -- this is the out-of-universe explanation, describing how JKR came to determine that item of canon.

The two are not contradictory, but rather complementary.

She's asked if she borrowed the idea from fans, and she simply states that they called themselves marauders an therefor named the map that way. Certainly not 'oh yeah, I sure never thought they referred to themselves as such until those trusty fans came in, thanks guys!'. They called themselves Marauders, were referred to as Marauders, and were always such. The fans didn't influence shit.

** I feel like /Old Soldiers Never Die/ (2007) really popularized the "magicals using muggle weapons" trope. It might have been around before then, but this is the first story I can think of that was widely read and emulated.

Snape/Harry (where Snape becomes nicer) seems to have been largely determined by Cybele's /If You Are Prepared/ series (2002 and on) and Telanu's /Tea Series/ (forget the date).

I don't recall developed/completed Azkaban!Harry fics much prior to /Redemption/ (2004), /Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy/ (2005) and /Betrayed/ (2005).

EDIT: Also, I feel like 2007/2008 was the heyday for dimension traveling fics (e.g. /A Stranger in an Unholy Land, Across the Universe, The World Without Me, A Black Comedy)./ There'd been some before this (e.g. /Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/), but around that time a bunch popped up that collectively influenced the genre.
