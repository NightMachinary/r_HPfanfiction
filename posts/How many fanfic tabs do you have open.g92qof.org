I have about 40 open right now, but that's just because I went and opened a lot of them because I was looking for a trope I like.

Honestly reading on a device with Internet is the worst way to finish something you read. I used to download a few long (like 200k-800k) fics and put them onto an mp4 type device where I would read them one by one. Now I rarely finish reading them unless they're really good, and for some reason I always drop out when I'm only a few chapters away from finishing.

Anway reiterating the title, how many fanfic tabs do you have open?


** I've had as many as 20 but now I'm big on just downloading the fics and having them waiting on me on my ebook reader.

I also have the tendency to go back on fics I like and just rereading. Basically I treat fanfics like I treat regular books: takes a while to start new one and I go back to classics.

** Firefox on mobile doesn't show a number higher than 100, but when I transferred from chrome I definitely reached the placeholder for over 100 on both, roughly in the middle of the transfer.

So my best guess is ~250

** I used to have over like 20 tabs before I realized I would never go back to those tabs and made a notice board for myself to tell me tropes that I'm interested in looking into later.

Now a days, I limit myself to 3 or 4 but maxing at like 7.

** Well, I closed one right before I came here, so 14.

I often have more open than that, but periodically I copy all the URLs into a text file for later. Then I end up opening more tabs that I eventually add to that URL list when I close them....

My URL list currently has (goes to count)... 104 fics, 52 author pages, and 30 rec lists.

** Usually just one, but that's because I can't focus on too many plotlines at the same time. Even having one story on my phone and one on my laptop makes me confused sometimes. I've got a very simple mind.

** I currently have 93. When I get burnt out, I switch to another fandom for a while and then get sucked into that fandom until I get burnt out.

I once had the same story open three times with like 20 tabs between them.

** I mainly use my desktop to search for fanfics to read. I have about 20-30 tabs open on chrome at any given point. I use an extension that allows me to download them as an Epub that I then use to read on either my phone or tablet. Keep all my fanfics in folders on my computer and google drives for access on my devices. Convenient for reading when traveling and feels more natural.

** Up until recently, I had nearly 500 tabs open on my iPhone. Not all of them were fanfiction, but I'd say the vast majority were fanfiction-related (either the fanfiction itself, pages of search results for a specific tag I liked, an author's page, etc.). I liked keeping them open in case I was in the mood for x tag again.

This was the case until a few days ago, when I accidentally hit a button that apparently closes all tabs open in Safari on an iPhone. I was really upset about it for a couple of hours because I also had some manga tabs open. I've since learned AO3 has features built in for what I was doing, so I'll probably never get that many tabs open again.

** A good 65 or so, but that's only my app-less fics that I haven't caught up on, such as the ones in space battles and sufficient velocity.

I have 687 fics in my fan fiction reader app, which is for fan fiction.net only and another huge chunk of fics in my subscribed to list on sv, sb, ao3 and royal road.

Nowadays, I either download them (so they are on my desktop for later reading) or copy paste the fanfiction link in my "Fanfic List" word document, so that I don't have to keep a lot of tabs open

** Only 9. I keep pretty meticulous track on a Google doc of what I've read (and when), what I'm reading, and what I'm planning to read, which, in conjunction with my being pretty picky and quick-to-decide with choosing what fics I read to completion and what fics I drop, helps keep that number of tabs dedicated to fanfiction under control despite the (to be frank, disturbingly) large amount of fanfic I consume regularly.

Just the fic's themselves, 2.

I'm on an IPad, and it gets laggy if I have more than two or three dozen pages open, at once.

** I've also been dropping out of fics, or saving fics for later but I've actually got none open. In part due to being strict with myself, but mainly because I downloaded a tab clearing add-on. Well, I actually have two, but I only use 1 tab which stores all my tabs in a list. Until I delete them.
