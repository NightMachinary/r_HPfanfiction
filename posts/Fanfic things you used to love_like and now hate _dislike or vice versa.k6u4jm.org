It can be ships tropes types of stories and characterizations etc

For me for example

I used to really like power fantasy stories. Super strong or smart Harry or Hermione usually. Or lord Potter political Harry etc. It was fun. Now I'm more bored of it. Prefer the talent to be spread out over a group have then work together to overcome obstacles and have more flaws. Stories that get too focused on making a character seem smart often ends up really awkward to read. Especially when they are like 11 but it sounds like adults who trying too hard to seem smart and end up obnoxious.

Harmonie I used to be very big on the ship now its pretty meh.

Hogwarts aus Like seeing Harry be sorted into a different house or Marauders time in school. Now I'm much more interested in seeing what the characters do out of school.

What about you guys?


** Honestly, same. Nowadays I prefer ‚Äúwhat-if?‚Äù oneshots that can or have been expanded. I read more crossovers too, but not so much crack fics.

*** I definitely appreciate oneshots more now. I used to not touch anything but long fics.

I do love what ifs too I think I appreciate more world building than before. I used to not like it much where the plot explored things that had little explored in the books.

**** I feel the same about one-shots. There was a time when I wouldn't even start reading a fic below 50k, but now, I learned to appreciate short stories and one-shots with 2k words. There are some real gems hidden there.

** I used to be super into crossovers. Like the reason I actually read Harry Potter was because it had the most crossover fics with series that I liked. Now crossovers are just sort of meh to me. Part of it is because it's so hard to find well written or original idea in fandoms that I actually want to see cross over.

For example, every Doctor Who crossover is either "The Doctor has landed at Hogwarts and is a professor now!" or "Harry was The Doctor all along!" or "Barty Crouch Jr. was the Tenth Doctor!" and the majority have very poor prose.

*** I used to read more Harry Potter crossovers because it seemed like back then every fandom had a Harry Potter crossover it didn't matter if they had anything in common. Sometimes it meant you'd have to redefine magic to be like the combination of powers and magic from like way different stories. To be honest it was really an excuse to sort characters from diff shows into different hogwarts houses. But i really liked doing that. But often I didn't find very good crossovers it was harder to find decent crossovers than it was decent non crossover fics so I just stopped trying.

**** Absolutely. I was reminiscing about PJO the other day, and decided to try a crossover, and they're all either "Percy and X other characters are in Y house!" or "Look how much more competent Percy is than Harry!" the latter of which I happen to agree with, but that doesn't make for good reading when it's the core tenant of your story.

** Hermione centric, MarySue!Hermione, OP!Hermione, Hhr etc

That was when I was younger around early 2010. I had a crush on Emma Watson and very into the smart/nerdy girl archetype. I got away from HP fanfiction and covid brought me back because I have less things to do.

A lot of portrayal of Hermione remains the exact same.

Harry in another house: still best friends with Hermione

Harry is "gray": Hermione goes gray with him and they're together

Harry raised by someone else: No problem, he and Hermione hit it off.

Harry not the main character: It's Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, Hermione/one of the Marauders.

Hermione in Slytherin: The girl who goes to the toilet and cry because of a mean off-hand comment somehow survives a place where she's treated like shit. The only reasonable outcome of canon Hermione being sorted in Slytherin is to beg her parents to transfer her to some other magical school after first year.

Hermione knows more magic than Voldemort and can outfox manipulative!Dumbledore despite being a schoolgirl. Hermione is the first muggleborn ever to think about "revolutionizing" the wizarding world. No one has ever tried. Hermione somehow becomes the most powerful politician after Hogwarts despite awful people skills and having no ability to compromise. Hermione becomes the sexiest witch even though she's only ever considered beautiful after putting in hours of work.

** When I first started reading fanfiction, I was barely a teenager. I liked stories where Harry was more powerful, doing cool stuff with magic, time travelling and fixing everything I didn't like in the series. Now, I'm out when I see the first signs the story will include overpowered characters or where Harry (or anyone else) gets some special skill or talent that makes him op.

I still like time travel, but I'm much pickier when it comes to fics with that trope, and I absolutely hate when Harry goes back in time to fix things, and it all goes swimmingly.

I used to like the nobility trope, but now, it seems rather ridiculous, and I laugh every time I see 11-year olds speaking like old politicians.

When I was younger, I also have a big problem with Dumbledore, so I often searched for fics with Dumbledore bashing. Now, I ran away when I see the word "bashing" in the tags or anything that would lead me to believe the story will contain bashing of any character.

Lately, I focus on more character-driven stories. Character characterisation is one of the most important things for me, and I love when authors give their characters flaws and make them human.

*** Ok I always wanted to know, Why was Harry/Ginny so big before ootp? It has been a while since I've read the the books but after book 2 and before 5 I don't really remember Ginny being a bigger character than like Lavender Parvati or Neville. Like reoccurring sure but not given than much focus. So it was weird to me finding out that the ship was big between books 4 and 5.

**** I think it was because we had enough background about her family to know something (she's a Gryffindor, got a good family and she's lovestruck) but not enough that we were able to treat her as a bit of a blank slate (unlike Hermione, who was pretty well defined). She often joined the trio to either replace or supplement Ron. She fulfilled the tomboyish girl-next-door and patiently-waiting-for-dense-male-to-notice-me stereotypes. This was also the era when soul bond fics were popular so the CoS episode was an easy way to tie into that. I also think fics in that era explored the possibility of Harry and Ginny bonding over their trauma (Ginny helping Harry get over Cedric nightmares in the Burrow / Gryff Common Room scenes were a dime a dozen) which canon and modern fics, in their hurry to follow the stations of canon, completely ignore.

Back then, remember, Ginny was also THE main alternative to Hermione so people who disliked Hermione flocked to her. Other characters like Tonks, Daphne and Luna hadn't been introduced. Cho had a bit of a following but not enough to be a real threat especially after Cedric died. She def had the third biggest following.

now, i still love me some Indy!harry, but i definitely have to be in the right mood, and i often read genfic. one of my favorite tropes now is slytherin!harry for reasons, though I'll accept Ravenclaw or hufflepuff harry if done well and I'm in the mood.

Malfoy redemption stories but now I dont really like him to be friendly and all buddy with the trio or anyone not in Slytherin. I like seeing him as the antagonist

Crossovers. I dont really like them anymore and avoid them at all costs

Do overs are boring now

I used to have a couple female characters I liked but now I only liked a few select male characters lol

And while I still enjoy romance, now I more so want to see friendships because it almost feels like that barely happens anymore (well, maybe not /barely/ but you know what I mean)

I feel the same I'm more ok with romance if it emerges out of a friendship that gets explored alot before the romance for the most part. Especially if they are still in hogwarts. Like it just is weird to me seeing overly romantic 14 year olds.

** I used to really like "do other" and Peggy Sue fics when I first started to read fanfics. Now most of them bore me to death (though I don't remember seeing much of them recently, maybe the trope kinda died?).

The MC (usually Harry) either completely ignore his future knowledge because "Must protect timeline", or deal with Voldemort in 2 chapters before spending the rest of the fics bashing Ron and having a creepy relationship with the mentaly much younger Love Interest (whoever that is in the fic). I'm also not a big fan of the "Manipulative Dumbledore" trope, which is pretty much always there in this kind of fic.
