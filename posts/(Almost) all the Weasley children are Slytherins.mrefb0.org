** For my sorting Bill, Charlie are Gryffindor, Percy is Slytherin, Fred, George are Hufflepuff, Ron is Gryffindor, Ginny is Ravenclaw. Makes for a fun mix and rivalry especially for the quidditch matches. Plus it expands the possible friendships and character interactions through my series.

*** I honestly see Ron in Slytherin too (if it wasn't for all the bloodpurism in that house). He is ambitious - see his reflection in the Mirror of Erised. He was also the one who wanted to be an auror first - that wasn't Harrys idea. Auror is one of the most difficult carrier-choices you can make and even if he didn't stay there, he was an Auror for some time. He is also cunning - being good at chess means he is at least a bit cunning. It was also him who tricked the Slytherins in OoTP so they could get to Harry and Hermione and it was him who found a way to cheat at Divination.

On the other hand I see Fred and George in Ravenclaw. They are geniuses, even if not in the conventional sense.

Ginny on the other Hand is the epitome of Gryffindor for me. She is very brave but also very impulsive. We know she got into the Slug-Club because she hexed someone - in front of a teacher. She did it to defend her friends, but it wasn't a very well thought plan. She also led the resistance against the Death Eaters in their own school.

On the question who belongs to Hufflepuff? Aside from Percy I could imagine everyone of the Weasleys there. They are all very loyal.

**** The Ron argument makes sense, just had to leave him as Harry's dorm mate for later storylines.

I put the twins in Puff for their loyalty and willing to toil to build their craft and future empire, which plays heavily into my series. Plus the Puff and Slytherin dorms are in the dungeons and I have a head cannon they set up prank mazes in the maze of halls between the dorms so they would love the spare practice and they can sneak out to meet with Percy and my oc to plot what they are up to through everything that goes on in the school.

Ginny I put into Ravenclaw for the same skilled dueling reason you had listed as she studies various charms and hexes the others don't in the series to help the order and da when she sees that the fight is coming up.

But your placements are really good, mine were just fitted to suite my story and really as the prompt listed they really could go for any house on several traits. With the exception of Bill and Charlie who sadly don't have as much to draw from in the books to fill them out beyond the typical Gryffindor cookie cutter shape they were typed as.
