So I've been browsing this subreddit for a while and I've noticed a lot of (often sound) criticism. Magical cores and soul bounds seem to catch a lot of flak. And that got me thinking- what tropes /do/ you enjoy?


** Peggy Sue is the trope I like the most. Soulbonds is the trope I dislike the most but that still doesn't cause an unconditional drop (mpreg does this, among others). Abusive relationship used to rank even worse, but is now part of the list of tropes I avoid unconditionally.

** When written well, I love the whole 'lords' system. For me it really feels like a good way to show how different and behind the times the British magical community is. The downside is that a lot of writers go too far with this and then you have a lord Gryffindor-Slytherin-Emrys-Le Fay-Potter who is all powerful.

*** Looking at universes like Game of Thrones/ASOIAF or House of Cards, it is easy to see why the whole Lordship thing is never done well in HP fanfics. Such a system, especially when it's supposed to be the source of conflict and not just the backdrop, is incredibly complex and almost impossible to fit as a side-plot. Also, most writers (myself included) are not keen to write something similar to the red wedding, which in turn keeps the stakes in a political world low. Hell, I bet it'd cost you a lot of readers if you build up Neville as Harry's brother in all but blood only to have Harry find his severed head in his office halfway through because he pissed off Lord Malfoy.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** The only one I can think of atm is a marauders plan, but again in this case the writer goes quite far with the amount of lordships/descendants. Maybe it's more a case of a defined pureblood society than just the lordships. I think such a closed off and small community would develop very rigid and pronounced rules of etiquette, traditions and rituals. An example would be the traditional way of line of succession (lords/ladies, head of the family, heir presumptive, scion, etc) and a formalized way of greeting others of a different station (certain way of bowing, the way you adress the other).

That being said I love it when a story calls attention to his flaws rather than treating him as some avatar of pure goodness. That being said it is incredibly annoying when the opposite extreme is taken and Dumbledore's wider good aims are ignored while his narrow lapses and atrocities are magnified.

I've always wanted to read a story where a more independent Harry has his own agenda and the author doesn't deliberately side with one or the other, with each character having merits and justifications for their plans and actions. A twisted web of alliance and betrayal and a Wizarding War where everyone is in it for their own reasons would be dope.

Not necessarily, it depends on entirely on how "big" their cores are and how long it takes to replenish. If the average spell takes ~1% and they recover ~5% per minute...

Tbh I think the argument can be made that they already have mana pools. If a wizard cast spells nonstop all day, he'll tire out more quickly than if he had relaxed all day, no?

If they do something intensive for a short period of time, they'll get exhausted much more quickly. If a wizard does this with spellcasting, they've effectively used up their mana pool and need to rest for it to replenish. If they push themselves to the point of utter exhaustion and/or passing out, there's your fanon magical exhaustion.

***** the whole magical core thing is fine and it's interesting to see all the theory about it that people come up with. The problem is when they make a persons core measurable such as Dumbledore's Grand Sorcerer is a level on the scale of magical core size from muggle to Merlin. It's like if you could scan some one and place them on a scale of precisely how fit they are from 1 to 1,000 without running actual physical tests. Magical cores are great and can add some interesting parts to a story but when you can measure someones core does it become a horrible trope.

It's a female Harry with no pairings. The first three books are complete and the fourth is ongoing. It starts a bit slow, but it's really good and I love it. Give it a chance when you have time. There is no mad terrorist Voldemort, but there is a cunning and ruthless politician Tom Riddle.

​

Anyway, in this fic, the purebloods are the larger part of the population and have more refined or precise magic. The muggle-borns, on the other hand, might be more powerful but their magic is wilder and more difficult to control. Lily Potter has to wear a charmed bracelet to suppress her magic because she's afraid of accidental magic well into adulthood.

** In no particular order:

- Harry in any other house than Gryffindor, if done well. I have a particular soft spot for Hufflepuff!Harry but there haven't been too many interesting fics there; I remember there was one where he was in Hufflepuff because he was too lazy to fit anywhere else. That was interesting but not really what I envisioned. There's another one I remember that had a core theme of "Hufflepuffs never win the House Cup because they don't have visionary leaders, but when they do they win the cup 7 years in a row" and I'm trying to find that one again to see if it's any good

- Indy!Harry, who takes no shits from others. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed but he at least thinks for himself instead of just responding to events

- Time travel; BWP/NoFP/OGNA are my favourites

- MoD fics, but for some reason I only really get into them if they're crossovers. MoD doesn't hold that much purpose in the HPverse, but if he's now in the MCU... :3

- Stories with a strong Grey faction. Light and Dark represent ideals, but ideals are just that and don't always have a basis in reality. Similarly, stories with less focus on Light and Dark magic as the usage is far more important than the label - A Levitation Charm can kill someone if you drop them from high enough; an Imperius curse used on would-be murderers can save lives (sure, it would be overkill, but it CAN be used for good).

I love Peggy Sue fics and the “for want of a nail”-type AUs (where something in canon changed and as a result things are different), probably as a result of being a comics fan and loving time travel/continuity porn fix-its and What If/Elseworlds-type stories.

I also weirdly like evil!Harry fics - not grey!Harry or indy!Harry but just straight up evil (I have an odd fondness for “actual good person eventually knowingly goes full-on villain for reasons” type stories). Perhaps going along with this, I do like Tomarry and Harrymort, but I do need Tom/Voldemort to be his sociopathic asshole self and not be warm and fuzzied up too much.

I'm fine with manipulative!Dumbledore fics, though I do roll my eyes when they make him straight up cackling evil. I also eyeroll with Weasley-bashing and noble misunderstood Draco and Snape.

I hard-nope immediately out of harem fics, WBWL fics, and full unrecognizable AUs (like nonmagical coffee shop AUs or “Harry is a hooker and Draco is a john”-type AUs). I also nope out of fem!Harry fics unless they involve canon!Harry in some way (like Harry gets genderswapped, or meets an alternate-dimension female self). Fem!Harry all too often feels like a totally different and unrecognizable character from canon!Harry to me, even if she is actually much less of a departure than some of the male!Harrys out there (which I am aware is my weird thing more than anything objective).

And it is utterly hilarious because the narrative tone does not try to convince you that Dumbledore is a rapper called Fresh Dumbledore, who just released his album "Grandmotherfucker". It aims purely to entertain.

Because that's what makes bashing fics awful, you can see that the author actually genuinely holds those opinions rather than just made up something to make you laugh. You can feel the disdain for the characters leaking through the words, the deep hatred for Hermione, Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did-- everyone thought they were the height of cool

Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong

Not to mention they helped make the mauraders map which tracks AND IDs anyone at anytime even though they were in the school 20 years ago.

I know the author is a teenager or very early adult, and he/she fights with his own role in this weird world, but please let me stay away from solving his/her issues. I am not a Victorian hypocritical prude, I know how the babies are made (I have two of my own), there is certainly a place for sex when the plot demands it (there might be even a place for awful sex, like a rape scene, /when the plot requires it/), but that is not what I am talking about.
2. super!anybody and that includes lord!anybody (political power is a power as well). One of the beauties of the HP universe is its middle-class modernist-rationalist feel. It is mostly the world of shop-owners, ministry officials, cops, etc. Nothing hurts this original feel like crossover with the spirit of the Marvel Universe or some cheap life-of-the-top-ten-thousand trash. That also includes anything too mystical (Harry is some kind of God, Atlantis, Master of Death, Illuminati, etc.). That just doesn't work in the HP universe. When used in very small amounts and sparingly it doesn't have to be such disaster (stories by White_Squirrel), but usually please just no.
3. dark* apologist (that includes most of the grey magic), that includes most Draco/Snape/Malfoy/Bellatrix (bleh) apologists. Yes, it is possible to write (and I would love to read) a good redemption story, but the prevalence of cheap junk apologizing for something which just should not be easily forgiven is so big that I rather avoid this whole trope to keep my sanity.
4. soul bonds. OK, this is even more simple. 99.9% of them are just another way how to get to #1 (or even to pre-teenage sex, just ewww!), so no. There are few (*very* few) exceptions, but linkffn(9818387) (sorry, I meant linkffn(8490518)) has been abandoned (and I would love it to be finished in terms of discussion of arranged marriages and their advantages). And yes, it could be written, I really like *the beginning* of linkffn(5435295), but it gets to #1 too fast.
5. magical cores. Again, 99.9% it is just another word for #2, so no. Yes, it seems obvious that wizards/witches should get tired when doing too much magic, or they do something which they shouldn't do, because it is just too much, so it has to be just a fact somewhere behind, part of how things work, not the key element of the story and explanation why Harry alone can defeat army of Death Eaters (Voldy included).
6. bashing. That's a very difficult issue. I do not want to claim that for example Professor Dumbledore is absolutely perfect (although as far as we know he said “for the greater good” last time when he was a teenager and regretted it ever since), and if he was (or if we talk about other person, which is canonically more or less flawless like Molly Weasley, Ginny, or Hermione) it is certainly perfectly OK for the author to create AU where he is not. I myself am in the process of writing a story ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][*very* unfinished draft]]), where I try to be as canonical as possible, he is more or less a good guy, and still Harry feels really strong need to distance himself from him. So, I don't have a problem with some of our beloved characters to a bit worse than perfect or really bad. However, that is not what I am talking about when he is not.

/Bashing is when the author paints some characters dark just because he is not able to invent more realistic plot./ That's the case I am afraid of most Ginny-uses-love-poiton-on-Harry stories. Author just wanted to write a Harmony story, but he was too lazy to terminate Harry-Ginny relationship properly so he wrote this plotcrutch (if you want Hermione leaving Ron I wrote even the template in linkao3(20141410)). Or the author just projects his teenage rebellion and rejection of all authorities and the result is bizarre bashing of all canonically good persons (e.g., see my [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][review]] of linkffn(11916243), which otherwise is a relatively nice piece of writing and linkffn(12373273), its semi-sequel in the later chapters avoids this problem completely). Or he is just not able to come with a dramatic plot for his story, so he steps down to bashing from pure laziness (that's what I am afraid happened in linkffn(6439871), author wrote a nice setup of the story, but then somewhere in the middle of chapter three Voldemort truly died, and the author didn't how to carry his story further so he started bashing Dumbledore).
