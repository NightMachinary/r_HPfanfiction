Hello,

I'm looking for a fanfic I read a while ago. I don't remember anything about besides that there was an artefact in the teachers room that lights up if a student has a crush on one of the teachers.

It took place over the course of most of the hp years because there was a part of it that had Lockhart in it. The artefact kept lighting up for lockhart or something.

Anyone know the fic? Or maybe knows some fic finder communities that are still active?

Thank you ðŸ˜Š


** Ohhh I want to read that fic now!

*** Found it in the best place for HG/SS searches. ([[https://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/]]) Can't believe I didn't ask there first.

:) Not sure if it'll live up to expectations but I'm hopeful. I remember it being pretty lighthearted.
