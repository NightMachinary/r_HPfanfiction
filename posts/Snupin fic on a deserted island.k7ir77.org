:END:
I already asked in the slashHP sub, but didn't get an answer. I hope slash is allowed here. sorry if not.

It's either Snape POV or both of them POV switching. but not only Remus POV for sure.

the fic starts with Lupin and Snape crashing on a deserted island. I'm pretty sure it was a plane and the other passengers were either death or the plane broke in half and their half ended there? there were other passengers, because Snape finds a chick lit book in one of the trunks. don't know if muggle plane or some made up magical one... (it could be a boat though)

the island has a cave and a lake so they have water, and they don't live together at the start because they hate each other. Snape gets the cave and Lupin is on the beach. maybe inside of the wreck. for Lupin's transformation they dig a hole in the sand. one of them gets sick and after that they keep living together. they have a pet chameleon or some other such animal. Snape is reading the chick lit book he found, sometimes out loud to Lupin.

I think it's set during or after the first magical war, but it could be the second... they were going somewhere for order business, it wasn't an AU and they knew each other.

pretty sure they get out of the island in the end. I don't think they were particularly long there, I remember that one transformation and possible a second one.


** Heyyy, this is very old but I think I know which fic you're talking about! Is it this one?
