I'm aware that there are pros and cons to both sites, but I'm mainly concerned with which site would get the most traffic for my (currently hypothetical) fic. Is one site more active than the other for HP fanfics?


** They're not mutually exclusive. Post it to both.

That being said, FFN gets way more traffic.

** For HP fics? [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] seems to be more popular.

Some authors have complained relatively recently that FFN has some problems with email notifications for feedback. The other downside is that the quality of comments seems to be lower. A03 has ways to control the comment section and control via restrictions on who can comment and if the comment shows up at all (great for controlling abusive comments). Also the kudos system for sending general "likes" instead of mixing with potential constructive feedback is a nice change. I mainly use A03 so I haven't messed with those options (if they exist) on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]].

But there is little downside from crossposting to both [[https://A03.org][A03.org]] and [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]

** Crosspost to both. FF.net for views and wide audience but AO3 for meaningful reviews and constructive criticism.

** I agree that you should post to both but I also want to mention that I have had the complete opposite experience from what most people are saying. On ao3 I get short, one word or phrase comments, while on FFN I get literal paragraphs of well-thought out critiques/opinions/predictions etc

It may be just that I've been on FFN longer and have somewhat of a reader base but I'm actually just completely surprised that ao3 reviewers are usually more detailed according to reddit when that hasn't been my experience at all.

*** I've experienced the same, and I suspect that a lot of the people commenting on "more detailed AO3 reviews" may not actually be authors or have any experience with people commenting on their stories. There's also often a perception that a smaller/more specialized community is better for feedback.

There are some things that Ao3 does well, like replying to comments. There are some things it does poorly, like tags. And there are some quirks that are due to the readership base and the kind of stories they're looking for.

** Both have their pros and cons, but I'd like you to check out a small, growing community called HPFanfictalk.com and it's archive for stories, archive.hpfanfictalk.com. They're a great community that was created in the after math of the HPFF drama and closure. Everyone is super nice, all amazing stories with multiple fandoms (but typically the common thread is HP) and original fiction as well.

** Depends on the nature of your fic.

Harems, edgy indy!Harry, power fantasies, and bashing: post on FFN.

Smut, slash, and artsy pieces with all-lowercase titles and written in present case: post on AO3.

** I tend to post to both sites. With my latest series, I've gotten more views on ffn, but more comments on ao3. For my first fic, I got more views and reviews on ffn. I think crossposting is a good idea, just keep in mind that you may get fewer comments/hits/etc on one of the sites.

** No reason not to post on both, as others have said. However my own fics get such an abysmally minute number of views on Ao3 that I won't bother posting on there again. Some people do well there though; I think it depends how popular you are. And they like smut on Ao3. That always does well.

** I've heard a lot of people say A03 gets more reviews and hits, and others say the same about FFnet, there isn't a reason why you couldn't post at both. Personally, I only post at Ao3.

** The reason i pick ao3 is because it has a tag system. Not only that but it has less sttict rules on smut. You might as well post it on both
