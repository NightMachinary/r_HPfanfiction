I'm looking for fanfics where a poker game or a series of weekly/monthly or the like of poker games are the cause of a drastic shift in the way things go in the series

two examples

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081016/1/The-Poker-Game]]

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-23613/Chilord+Poker+Knight.htm]]

these are two of the ones that really set me looking for more like them though there was a naruto one i read awhile back that i'd like to read again if i could find it anyways i'm looking for more such fics for nearly any series though i'd prefer series with magic or something akin to magic in them (buffy (the series not the character) has magic naruto has jutsu which might as well be magic under a different name and so on) though it's not a hard requirement
