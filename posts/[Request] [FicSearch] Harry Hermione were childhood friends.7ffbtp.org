Hey. Looking for fic where Harry decides to spend time at the Grangers during the hols and the Grangers turn out to be old neighbors of the Potters. Hermiones mom and dad even show Harry and Hermione an old album of birth of them as toddlers spending time together.


** One of better fics by robst, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871), fits your criteria nicely.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

**** If you like close relationships between Harry and Grangers, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382;9863146), are both better stories than the one I recommended above.

My guess is this one, Hermione parents were obliviated this scene from their memory. Read chapter 27 for when they find out about it.
