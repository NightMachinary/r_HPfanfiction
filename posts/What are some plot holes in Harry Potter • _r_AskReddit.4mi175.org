That kind of distance, should just kill them with the fall.

** I was trying to think of things that actually contracted the established lore, not just characters being obtuse or demonstrating poor decision making.

For me there are two big problems.

1) Sirius Black avoids a nation wide man hunt and avoids both detection and capture while staying close to Hogwarts for months. In book five he is basically under house arrest and can't help the Order at all, which leads to his death.

This is handwaved away by Harry thinking that /maybe/ the Malfoy's know about Sirius's animal form.

But in book 7 the trio modify Ron's looks with some charms and it's enough to get them inside Gringotts. Why didn't Sirius do that? Besides he would have acted in a surveillance capacity for the Order anyway so being spotted would have been a problem for any member.

2) why do wizards speak modern English? They never experienced the Norman invasion... England is still full of different dialects today. A secluded population of 3000~ who considered themselves a superior species would surely have their own branch of English.

*** The second point is easy to answer:

Readability. Don't forget the first books were meant for children. Anything other than very easily explained deviations ( either from context or by parents with more than one brain cell) from standard English would be defeating the point. the later books simply followed the trend.

There's been a lot of Muggleborns that have enter wizarding society since the Norman invasion. Also, the wizards may have slowly kept up with Muggle technology and customs until the 18th century, as they also have newspapers and those weren't around until around 1700.

*** That's because British wizarding government sucks as much as the worst muggle governments today and most readers/viewers hate it with a passion. The softness of the Order despite Death Eaters' viciousness infuriated many as well. The incompetence of the adults in this story (intended by JKR) also upsets tons of people.

To be honest with you, I also think that the *failed state* known as the British wizarding world was long overdue for a violent overthrow in the style of French revolution.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1624376/ARedHair][ARedHair]] on FFN posted a huge essay about every plot hole/inconsistency in each book. It's almost as long as the first book.

A specific plot hole is the Halloween 1981 gap.

#+begin_quote
  The timeline is flawed. - The book (PS1) says the story starts on a "dull, grey Tuesday", but according to the calendar, Halloween, October 31st, 1981 was a Saturday - not a Monday. So either JKR hadn't decided the year was 1981 or two full days have passed since the attack and a third will pass before Harry is left on the Dursley's doorstep. Later in the book Harry's 11th birthday is on a Tuesday, but in 1991, July 31st was actually a Wednesday. It does not appear possible for both November 1st one year and July 31st a decade later to both be Tuesdays. - Minerva McGonagall is watching as Vernon Dursley goes to work and spends the day watching the home (or following Petunia around). - On the way to work and during the day Vernon sees people celebrating. This establishes that this can't be Halloween day, since people couldn't be out celebrating until after Voldemort met his downfall attacking the Potters on Halloween night. It is implied that Vernon didn't notice any celebrating the day before, so it must be the first day the news of Voldemort's downfall was known. - On the evening weather report, Jim McGuffin says "Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it's not until next week folks!" This is incorrect. If Tuesday is November 1, then Bonfire Night (aka Guy Fawkes Night, November 5th) would be on Saturday. If Halloween were earlier, then Bonfire Night would also be earlier. In no case would Bonfire Night be "next week" after a Tuesday in November. For the story to open following Halloween (November 1st or later) and for Bonfire Night to be next week, then November 1st would have to be Wednesday or later in the week. - The Dursleys go to bed. - Dumbledore and Hagrid arrive. - Dumbledore is expecting Hagrid, but asks where he got the motorbike. - Hagrid says Harry fell asleep over Bristol (to the west of Surrey). This suggests Hagrid didn't take Harry to be checked by either Madam Pomfrey (at Hogwarts in Scotland, to the north) or St Mungo's (in London, to the east) before taking him to Privet Drive. - Harry is left on the doorstep. - There is no explanation why it takes a whole day (or perhaps 3 days) for Hagrid to deliver Harry to the Dursleys. Harry would need to have been somewhere safe. The only other safe place we know of is Hogwarts, but if Hagrid had taken Harry to Hogwarts why Minerva wouldn't have wondered about the Potters and why would Hagrid have approached Surrey from Bristol? - Petunia is surprised when she finds Harry the next morning (no mention of him being wet despite the weatherman having said "I can promise a wet night tonight").

** I guess one that's always bugged me is. Yes, Harry has to go back to the Dursleys every year. But in the first three books he gains: unlimited invisibility that he carries around with him, ability through Polyjuice to look like other people, access to his own /huge/ amounts of money, and lots of magically powerful and/or smart friends including adults. The magical world is falling over itself to do nice things for Harry Potter.

Why does he not use any of these things to make the six weeks he has to spend at the Dursleys' easier on himself? He knows exactly when every year he has to go back. Why doesn't he take some time at Christmas or spring break to get some things organised to go to London and get some money, or to otherwise make life easier for himself. Maybe Petunia and Vernon wouldnt've made him do all the chores if he paid them to leave him alone.

They would have taken the money, and made Harry suffer anyways. They aren't nice people. When it comes to him, they aren't reasonable.

Also, I don't think Hogwarts has any breaks other than the Winter/Christmas break. No such thing as an Easter Break (as you see in some fics) or a spring break is ever mentioned.

*** he doesn't have to go back. it's just easier for everyone but Harry and the Dursleys if he does. He was perfectly safe at 12 Grimmauld. He was safe in Diagon Alley living at the Leaky for a summer.

I've never understood it either, his passivity is stunning. Among the 20 or so stories I've started is one where Harry posts flyers in the Claw, Puff and Griff common rooms, "Free to a good home.. the boy who lived.. Death Eaters need not apply"

**** Thank you! I just find it incredibly unrealistic that an abused child, suddenly literally transported to a magical world where he's safe and has resources and ways to make his life more comfortable, will then willingly return back to the abusive environment every year, without making a shade of effort to make life easier for himself there, if he knows he /has/ to go back.

So many options. Buy a trunk like Moody's and stash food/entertainment in it. Use invisibility cloak to take daytrips out or hide from horrible aunt and uncle. You can't use your wand underage, fine. But surely you can buy enchanted items in advance? Hogsmeade is right next door.

And when I talked about money... Well who knows. Maybe Vernon and Petunia would be more amenable to him living in their house if he paid for his food at least. Canon is hazy on this, but it does suggest that Dumbledore dumped a second child on Vernon and Petunia - who'd only recently had a child of their own - 's doorstep and just expected them to handle the now doubled bills. I'm not saying it would have solved everything, but Harry just offering might have softened their attitude towards him - at least then he'd be a hated paying guest rather than someone who lives in their house /and/ lives off Vernon's income.

That's why they entered Harry into the tournament. That's why Crouch Jr. helped Harry to win. Hell, they chose Moody because nobody would suspect him as the perpetrator.

Of course, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ll6mz/alchemy_is_apparently_an_optional_class_thats/d3om8o0][I believe there were other reasons to choose Harry as The Enemy]].
