I know exactly how the next three chapters of all my works are supposed to go but working seventy hours a week with only a half day off is killing me.


** I totally get this. I tend to write bullet point plots during my breaks at work. Super rare for me to actually write it out though.

** I've put out so many notes I feel like there are too many for one fic already. Yet for me, it's not even not having the time - currently got the week off, but I just sorta forget to write. Like I want to, plan to do it when I get home, and then just get distracted and do something else.

** And this, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic reason for the creation of plot-bunny collections.

...speaking as someone who has three said collections of his own and currently no real ability to expand the concepts into actual stories...

I hate my muse sometimes...

** Ive struggled big time with writers block the last 2 years. I have started several Hinny stories but get to chap 3 or 4 and begin to have doubts. Still, I'll keep plugging away and hope to one day complete a multi chap story

*** Start smaller. Do oneshots. Then two and three chapter stuff. Then expand those. I like to use ABC Plots for chapters to help me keep stuff moving. A plot is the overall story, all chapters are part of it. B Plot takes places over a couple chapters. C Plot is chapter specific. E.g., a: ginny is expecting harry home for dinner with his boss. C: her robes are missing and she has to find them while trying to b: track down their kids and get them home. While tracking down the kids, c plots like finding gnomes in their couch or her bits of lingerie being stolen by fairies happen.

** I always get these Ideas when I go to sleep involving, bit not limited to, OC's, SI's, genderswapped characters, standalone scenes whose only purpose is to set up the ships I want, cool battles between wizards just to showcase what my imagination can do, and most often, steamy scenes between fem!characters and me.
