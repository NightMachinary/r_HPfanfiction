How unequal and discriminating the wizarding world is, is something that is often briefly addressed withing fanfics, most likely with Hermione voicing the complain, this Prompt is what if she actually does something about it as Minister.

And the many potential consequences it could have, when you grant various groups with very different ways of thinking the right to vote, like just imagine the stuff creatures like Dementors, House-elves and hags would vote for.


** House-elves would vote for banning wizards from doing any jobs/work.

Dementors-One kiss a month

Goblins- Increase transaction fee, right to take away goblin made steel from vaults.

Merpeople - Make great lake great again.

Centaurs- don't care about useless humans and their elections when mars was bright.

** I'd love it if there were more of a non human group than wizards. Eg they find out there are more goblins or elves than wizards... or maybe they just have a higher percentage voting... and suddenly the next minister is one of them and wizards live in slavery and who knows what else

*** I mean there totally could be more of them than wizards, like we know that there aren't that many wizards with high estimates being about about 20000. And apparently Dementors alone number in thr multiple thousands. Just imagine a Dementor becoming the minister for magic.

****** Is it specified that the dementors do that? I've always just assumed there was a small human guard as well, and they were the ones who reported that.

******* The Dementors were specifically called them Azkaban guards, not just a part of it, not to mention that there isn't any indication of human guards.
