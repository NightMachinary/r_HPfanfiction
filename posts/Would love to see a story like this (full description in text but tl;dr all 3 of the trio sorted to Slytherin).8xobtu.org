Even if they don't end up dark, there's at least a plausible reason for all three to end up in Slytherin, and I feel like they'll all end up treading the morally grey line and dip into dark (by mistake or on purpose, who knows) at least once.

*** If Hermione wouldn't survive, Harry wouldn't survive in Slytherin either, I think - he's pretty much the poster boy for the "blood traitors".

It depends on Dumbledore and Snape, I think - do they take measures to protect a muggleborn in Slytherin? I'd like to think that Dumbledore would both be aware of the danger, and take steps, drastic steps if needed, to protect said muggleborn.

***** Ah, I knew I had written a snippet about this:

*Hermione in Slytherin - Dumbledore loses it*

“I didn't do anything!”

“Do you take me for a fool, Mister Malfoy?” Dumbledore wasn't smiling. His eyes weren't twinkling, unlike on his Chocolate Frog Card - they were blazing as he stared at Draco Malfoy. Hermione Granger took a step aside just so she wouldn't end up as collateral damage when the bigot was blasted to smithereens. “Do you think I am stupid? Do you?”

“N-No...” The little git was shaking his head frantically, Hermione noted with vindictive glee.

“So why are you trying to treat me as a fool, Mister Malfoy? Why are you trying to lie to me?”

“B-but... She's lying! We didn't attack her!”

“So, she decided to hex herself, in her own dorm, to get you into trouble? In her first week? Using advanced hexes?” Dumbledore's scorn rolled off his tongue like in a play. Hermione still filed the plot he had just dismissed in her mind - if she learned the right hexes, it was a possibility to strike back at her tormentors. Although, seeing the Headmaster lambast Malfoy, she doubted that she would need to stoop to such means.

“I'm a first year too!” Draco said, close to crying now, in her opinion.

“Which is why you made others do it, Mister Malfoy.”

The idiot gaped at the Headmaster - which as as good as an admission of of his guilt than anything else short of a full confession, Hermione thought - before closing up. “I didn't!”

“Really? Miss Granger has given me a copy of her memories - of the incident in class that apparently made you go after her, of your little ‘discussion' in the Slytherin common room, of the attack on her, as much as she could see before she was struck blind, and of your gloating this morning.” Dumbledore scoffed as the bigot paled even further. “I have to say I am appalled and disgusted - no, outraged - at your behaviour and your slurs. To think that barely ten years after Voldemort was defeated, someone would dare to act like this again, in my own school!” He shook his head. “Did you know that my mother was a muggleborn, Mister Malfoy? Did you?”

Draco was trembling as he frantically shook his head. “N-No...”

“Or a ‘mudblood', as you called her. Did you insult my mother, Mister Malfoy?”

“I didn't... no...”

“Really? She was born to two muggles, just like Miss Granger. And you think people like them should not be allowed into Hogwarts - my school, Mister Malfoy.”

Malfoy was crying now. Hermione would have felt pity for the git, if she weren't still in pain from the spells she had been struck with by the boy's friends.

“Now, Mister Malfoy, you will tell me everything. Who helped you. Who hexed Miss Granger, Who knew, and did not stop it. Who cheered with you at her misery. You will give me all their names.”

“My... my father...”

“Really? Do you think your father will help you? Defend your actions? Do you think your father will step up, and openly defend cursing a young muggleborn witch? Against my word and evidence?” Dumbledore smiled now, but his expression made even Hermione shiver. “I'd like to see him try, Mister Malfoy. But I think he will be smart enough not to incur my wrath.” He shook his head again. “No, I think Lucius will not even lift a finger to help you.”

He turned to Professor Snape, who hadn't said a single word so far. “Severus. We will get to the bottom of this. If the students of your house are espousing the same bigotry that allowed Voldemort to almost take over the country, then we will do what is needed to deal with this.”

“They learned this from their parents, Albus.”

“And from the older students in their house, I wager.” Hermione had the distinct impression that the Headmaster would be talking to her Head of House in private, later. He went on: “I do think the most of those children are simply stupid - they do not know what crimes, what horrors they are supporting in their blind ignorance and bigotry. I intend to rectify that.” Dumbledore's smile was positively feral now. “They will be shown what their words mean. They will see for themselves, in my memories, what Voldemort did.”

“Their parents will not like this,” Professor Snape pointed out.

“They don't have to like it - but they will have to accept it. It seems Britain has forgotten the lessons that were painfully learned in the last war. It's time to remind them, I think.”

With a much kinder smile, he turned to Hermione. “I must apologise again for this, Miss Granger. I didn't expect that things would be so bad.”

Hermione shook her head. “No, no... thank you, sir.”

Dumbledore hadn't done anything wrong, she thought. He had asked for her memories and after watching them - what a marvelous device, a Pensieve - he had acted at once. Her parents had been right - telling a teacher helped.

But only if they could use magic to see your memories.

Slytherin isn't about blood. It's about cunning, ambition, and power. In-canon Hermione shows bountiful amounts of those qualities, so I would posit that not only would she survive in Slytherin, but she would prosper, possibly becoming a second Tom Riddle.
