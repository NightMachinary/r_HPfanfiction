I love canon as much as the next person but I really love to read different takes on the HP universe. I'm not looking for stories where every item is overdescribed and overpowered (ex: the magical expanding trunk with 89 compartments including a whole mansion inside and like 1,000 other small details)


** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent)

Very AU, but VERY good worldbuilding.

Salazar Slytherin rules the wizarding world as its immortal High Lord, wizards are divided into castes based on the old Hogwarts houses (with the Serpent caste being on top, of course), Tom Riddle is Headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbledore is an outlaw and revolutionary, and the wizards are at constant war with Dark creatures.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** GMW Wemyss did a wonderful set of post-war fics rooted in a Restoration of the Monarchy's control over wizarding Britain.

The Royal Family are squibs, the "International Statute of Secrecy" was pureblood secession, and the post-Statue Ministry or "Secrecy Regime" was traitorous. The collapse of both the Ministry and the Death Eaters (the "Riddle Rebellion") allowed the Order of the Phoenix to re-integrate wizarding Britain into the Empire, eventually with the Golden Trip being infiltrated into Parliament (Harry and Ron as Tories, Hermione as Labour) to make sure there was a wizard PM to eventually integrate the country.

(Astoria and Ginny die in a post-Epilogue terrorist/DE attack, allowing Harry and (Minister for Magic) Draco to be together.

It's wonderful because it's so vividly different, so intensely British, and yet so carefully fitted around pre-CC canon. Attention to detail and the density of the language and references make me swoon. He even redeems Dudley!

Unfortunately, he's a Tory, and Jo Rowling a committed member of the Labour Party. The political differences got to be too much, so he renounced his relationship with the fandom and removed everything he had online. I managed to find one piece with Draco Malfoy prosecuting an extradited Dolores Umbridge for treason that pegs where most of the people we know in canon are circa 2006:

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: no-magic AU, Hogwarts was a spy school, and the kids were scary. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/6c2ice/fanfiction_friday/dhsgu2p/][More detailed summary here]]. This story is chronologically the first one in a massive AU called the "Terawattverse" featuring superhero Alexandra Mack. The 2nd installment of the series, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]], the Trio would join Alex's team to fight some serious villains. The next story, "Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament", is still in the planning stage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is very very AU, including the Muggle world where nuclear weapons were never developed and the political landscape in Europe was thus very different. In the magical world, James and Lily were prepared and got in a lucky shot on Voldemort. They then ran off to the continent and Harry never went to Hogwarts. Instead, he pursued a career in the British military and seized his opportunity when Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008.
