My first one, really. Harry knows he's magical, and is visited by Snape who shows him a rather interesting display of magic and Harry is beyond impressed. I'm not sure what that magic is, however, and it's not the main point of the story anyhow. If you've got any ideas of magic that would blow Harry's 11 year old mind, let me know. I'll be sure to credit you and your suggestion should I use it. I've got a few ideas, but I want it to be aligned with Snape's character if at all possible. Kinda showy, but nothing that would really cause Harry harm...maybe levicorpus? It's just a tad cruel, but Harry doesn't care because it's the first example of real magic he's really seen - and his excited reaction shocks Snape.


** You could go with something for which Snape is already known:

Legilimency

It could be done in a funny and lighthearted manner where Snape pulls out answers before Harry gives them. Legilimency is pretty impressive.

Another obvious possibility: Patronus Charm.

If you want him to be a bit more mean/dark... do something to one of the Dursleys: maybe use Levicorpus on one of the Dursleys when they inevitably get agitated

Much more important though: Why is Snape visiting Harry? Make sure you give some satisfying explanation for this. Canon Snape would rather rip out his own toenails than do this.

*** Most fics where McGonagall gives Harry his letter involve transfiguring something into something intimidating.

It's possible that the Heads of House take turns visiting incoming students, and it just so happened to be Snape's turn that day.

**** Yeah no that's not enough. Snape would flat out refuse for some random student (he's a potions master and spy, not some errant boy)... if it is Harry he'd probably think someone was trying to prank him.

"Dumbledore, surely you jest. Send someone else."

"Well, my boy, no-one else is avail... "

"Read my lips: I. Don't. Care. Send someone else"

"Surely you would do this for the child of Lily Evans!"

Snape grits his teeth and stands up. "This conversation is over."

Billowing his robes Snape storms out of the office. One thought keeps going through his mind: /I told him he shouldn't eat those shrooms from the forest. Now this is what I get... the old man is delirious!/

******** That may well be true, but Dumbledore would still be smart enough to not ask Snape for something he'd never ever do. Snape was barely willing to teach Harry occlumeny (something that actually interests him) when it was a life or death, "we might lose against Voldemort if you don't do this", kind of situation.

** Why magic at all? Why not a magical creature? Maybe he brings a humble house-elf who can pack by snapping his fingers, to help Harry pack up and leave Privet Drive for the school year?

Or maybe he brings his owl, who might be enchanted to talk or sing? Singing owls are pretty magical, especially if they're baritone.

Or maybe something like a Boggart or a Salamander shows up in the Dursleys' house, drawn by the power of the magic within the wards, and Snape's the one sent to clean it up (and maybe collect the salamander eggs)?
