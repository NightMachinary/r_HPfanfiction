Can this sub fulfill requests? Obviously, there are no time limits and i haven't seen anything like it or similar to it. Anyways if this sub takes requests here it is:

I was watching the latest season of supernatural and came across how supernatural dealt with the cain and abel situation. Not sure if the spoiler tags work here so i won't say how they handled it. Anyways what i wanted to point out was cain's mark was what gave cain his power and the conduit for that power was the weapon that cain used to kill abel appropriately called the 'first blade'.

Now the first blade is obviously a powerful artifact, but it wouldn't work without the mark. Now what i was thinking that could this be written be as the power he knows not.

What do you guys think about the concept? I would try to write it but i wouldn't so it justice.


** Spoilers can be done as follows:

[spoiler warning text](/s "text of the spoiler")

which makes: [[/s][spoiler warning text]]. Hover your mouse over the spoiler warning text and the spoiler will appear.
