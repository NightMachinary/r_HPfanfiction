In 1759 the Dark Lord _____ manipulated the Wizardmont into being Minister as well as Chief Warlock at the same time.

In 1783 he finished construction of the Forge Of Souls in the bowels of the Ministry, and creates a black ops group to run it known only to the Chief Warlock and the Minister a secret kept by oath. The aim of this group is to bring all magical girls to the Forge at the exact time that they celebrate their 5th birthday and imprint their Soul onto the forge and imprint the forge into their souls. This allows the master(s) of the forge to manipulate their desires and emotions far more strongly than any potion or charm, as well as keep any secrets the master wishes kept, though changes take a few months to become apparent. These are done in such a way that's impossible to detect through cast magic. Strict instructions are given to ensure that no boy is ever treated this way, though the reasons why he takes to his grave.

In 1823 the Dark Lord was ousted from his positions in the Wizardmont, but the changes to wizarding society had already progressed too far for his successors to not hold onto the power that he gave the position.

By 1923 the instructions were just a tradition, and pure blood houses knew how to “buy” their wives if they came from “lesser” stock by appealing to the better nature of the Minister or the Chief Warlock.

On the 5th birthday of one Harry James Potter the Chief Warlock stole Harry from his relatives and imprinted him on the Forge of Souls having used the forge to great effect during the last war against Voldemort.

I suggest that it has something to do with becoming the owner of the Forge vs just being the master.


** is this a crossover idea? Is Forge of Souls from some story?

*** So far as I know, I made it from whole cloth myself. So AU rather than crossover.

**** Cool. Could be interesting to bring in a new kind of magic or artifact into the setting. But you might need to detail it a bit more.

Do you have any more thoughts on tying it into the way magic or souls or such work in JKR's world?

From what you wrote it seems like a long-lasting Imperious? One that can maybe work from a distance once applied?

***** My thoughts were that the Dark Lord was a Mysoginist and wanted to break the power that covens had during his time. So by kidnapping children at the age of 5 (for a few minutes) and linking them to the forge he prevented them from joining a coven. It also allowed him to manipulate the soft power in the country (bedroom talk, and ideals)\\
I figured it would also explain the male/female teacher/magical staff ratio in Hogwarts, and why McGonagal was so unhelpful to Harry throughout the books. (9 permanent women, 3/4 men + the defence professor of the year, 1 ghost, and 1 squib)

****** Hmm, is it applied to muggleborn? They don't normally connect to the wizarding society until 11.

If not, it might explain the entrenched antipathy toward them. The leaders or whoever don't trust them because they haven't been linked, nor their mothers who influence them so much... this second point might be why all half-bloods were also viewed with suspicion despite only those with muggle mothers being suspect initially... hmm, actually, all females not born into wizarding society would be suspect, and also those who they married and have some influence over...

Wow, building to a super controlled society here.

---

But I think the power balance outside of the topmost leadership would go the other way - the only ones they can really trust are the linked women. Women would be in all the highest positions of power and men would be pushed over the centuries to mostly focus on taking care of the women and children or doing whatever wizards think of as 'grunt work'.

This would be a great basis for something that looks like a pure matriarchy while actually being crypto-ultra-patriarchy...

---

Hmm, can women be in control of the Forge? If so, this could end up devolving to the point that once an order is in place it continues on through the generations forever, as the leaders would be bound to enforce each and every law they were given upon the next generation etc.

---------

So, you have my imagination running with this, but I keep twisting the society into something unrecognizable.

******* Given that only 2 people in the entire government ever know about the forge it wouldn't affect the perceived power balance that much. There's also the time delay in effects taking place. Finally, there's also the danger of a woman getting hold of one of the positions that need to be given the secret.

I figure that the secret is some sort of fidelus charm with a binding oath. Something like "On my life and magic I swear to pass on the information that I learn in this conversation to my successor and the Minister of Magic/Chief warlock before obliviating myself of this conversation if I am no longer the Minister of Magid/Chief warlock. I will also do everything in my power to ensure that the knowledge gained in this conversation is confined to the positions of the Chief Warlock and the Minister of Magic."

With muggleborns, I would imagine that it depends on when their first bout of accidental magic takes place.

******** I was writing about the eventual actual effects on who gets put into power.

- Choice A: a good diligent guy who shares your beliefs and plans for the government.

- Choice B: a woman who you have near absolute control over re what she wants to do and how she does it.

Unless the woman is significantly incompetent, the choice is obvious.

It might not happen immediately, but it will be an obvious preference to any Minister/Chief whenever delicate policy or close votes come up. Step by step, the people in positions and the general social culture around gender roles will almost have to shift to this.

At least that's how it seems to me.

********* So you have Umbridge as the senior undersecretary, but you don't control the wizardmont so you have limited ability to vote in who you want, just the people that you have the personal ability to hire and fire. It's also only been around for a few hundred years, so that sort of change is probably not going to be that large. There's also going to be the fact that you want to limit the changes you make to keep the fact that changes are being made secret, while you also don't want any of the previous incumbents affected women around until you can be sure of their loyalty. Finally, most Ministers of Magic don't last that long in the position, however Dumbledore has been chief warlock since shortly after world war 2.

********** Wait.

Are the women linked to any master of the Forge or just to the one in power when they were linked?

If they only to the one who linked them, then a very long game is necessary.

If to any Master, then there is NO question of loyalty, they just are or will be made so immediately.

*********** They are linked to the forge. Think of the forge more like a supercomputer, and the women have a chip implanted that links them to it, but the "masters" of the forge have to use a console to access it. Except it's a magical artefact and they use wands instead.

************ So yeah, every Minister/Chief should be doing everything they can to pack all leadership positions with linked women.

As for the Wizengamot, just have all linked women tell their children that it would be best to have women in positions of power (calmer, more level-headed, able to reach agreements, etc - all of it 100% true since they are all controlled by the Forge), maybe even convince husbands/fathers/brother/etc and encourage them to vote for favorable legislation.

I can't help thinking that within a century the women will hold the reins to everything.
