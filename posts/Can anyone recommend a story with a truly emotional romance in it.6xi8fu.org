and maybe linkffn(The Pureblood Princess) might be up your alley if you can stomach the Daphne. Her portrayal seems to polarize people, if you dont warm up to her within the first few chapters its probably not worth continuing but i dug it.

** linkffn(the yellow submarine by deadwoodpecker) has slowwww burn Harry and Ginny, who are both recovering from extreme trauma. It covers some serious topics though so a trigger warning may be necessary. The romance is emotional and wonderful. The story isn't technically completed but the major plot points are tied up where it leaves off.

** My Deliverance by Twin Suns

Marauder Era, canon & James/Lily - slow paced and mature. A more grave, solemn James. Takes place 7th year. Characters are heavily affected by the war. I'm a huge marauder fan and I'd say it's the most realistic, well developed marauder fic I've read. James and Lily grow into each other through a deepened maturity.

Incomplete , but worth the read.

** I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for, but the most mature romance/drama fic I've read is this:

linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) - it's a bit of a complicated story and I think not everyone would like it but give it a try.

Also try these: linkffn(7217938) linkffn(5071058).
