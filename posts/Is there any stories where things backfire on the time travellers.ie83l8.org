I prefer the time travellers to be the Next Gen. But I can take Harry's generation, too.


** This one is short, but qualifies. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12872926/1/Remus-Lupin-Werewolf-Hunter]])

  Remus Lupin is an anti-werewolf bigot like his father, but Hermione and her time-turner can fix that. J.K. Rowling still owns these characters even in my alternate universe.

** The sequel to Backward with Purpose has this. I currently can't remember its title so here's the link to BwP instead.

linkffn(Backward with Purpose)

The first part has Harry, Ron and Ginny traveling back in time, as stated in the summary.

The sequel reveals that someone from even further in the timeline prodded Harry, Ron and Ginny to go back in time to have the events of the first part take place. This someone encounters a lot of problems.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

** I recently read a story where the Ministry figured out a way to observe events across time for historical research purposes and an adult Teddy figured out how to use it to fake Remus' and Tonks' deaths so that he can pull them into the future with him. Problem is, his doing so damaged the time machine and injured one of his colleagues - and since he was hiding what he did, he got accused of sabotage and once the truth came out, conspiracy to alter history.

To say nothing of the fact that his actions created a very dangerous precedent, with Teddy justifiably being called out along the lines of "/Why do your loved ones get to live but not ours? Who are you to decide who lives and who dies? How dare you have the happy ending thousands of others were denied?/"

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** I'm going to do some shameless self advertising but I do have a fic that applies. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11044260]]

In it a group of time travelers from the department of mysteries go back in time and screw up big time and have to fix it. It is a very old fic of mine. It's a one shot but has a sequel involving just what they do to fix things. The sequel has not been updated in years sadly.
