*** I like these quite a lot:

linkffn(9644106; 4455612; 8288368)

*Potter's Bones* is a nice Harry/Susan piece\\
*Wizards In Winter* starts very slow with Hermione learning some special magic, gradually becoming a H/Hr romance\\
*Harry Potter and The Magic of Music* is massively AU where Harry and Hermione are musical prodigies and much of the canon story is bypassed.

Most of her fics are very fluffy with some good ideas and very light on bashing, where it does occur it's mostly Draco.

  Harry and Hermione are child musical prodigies and discover their talents before starting school. A close friendship develops before Hogwarts and the magical world will not be the same. A/U for the most part, with very little canon content. Friendships will be different but no character bashing. Well maybe Draco, but nothing untoward.

** I don't understand why a writer would delete their stories. Its not costing anything to have them hosted. Simply post that you are no longer writing, and any stories unfinished will remain so, and if you are feeling generous, tell folks they are welcome to take some of the stories over and finish them.

I get the idea that you don't want people bothering you about them, but there are ways to prevent that quite easily. Not checking the site... disabling responses.... changing email associated with the account to a spam email, or simply blocking things. Plus after posting that you are done, likely fewer would try and contact you.

What is the point of deleting.

*** As an author, I have deleted things in the past because they were super embarrassing. Poorly written, and they were rightly ignored or mocked and derided. I've also deleted stories that i realized I was never going to finish and didn't want constant alerts for with people begging they be updated.

** Serious question: why would you announce that you were going to remove your stories before doing so?

If it was me, I'd delete first then explain on my profile. Seems to me that if you are giving everyone the chance to copy or download the work anyway, you might as well leave it where it is, so at least you still have a measure of ownership. Surely deleting means you don't want people to read it any more - or you need it gone because you are looking for traditional publication in some way? Or are there reasons I'm missing?

*** From what I understand her health is not so good, and she doesn't want to deal with the stress of people demanding updates any longer. As someone who has unfinished fics himself, I'm well aware of how rude and obnoxious some people can get...

Since I posted this she has indicated she may leave the completed stories up and only delete the unfinished ones.

****** But that's my point. If you want people to still read your work, why delete it? And if you delete it from your account but someone has copied it and reposts it as their own work you have no way of proving it was yours in the first place. It's potentially much more complex than it seems.

******** It's anonymous on the internet. Ignore it. Hell you can even disable notifications. You literally never have to see a review or a PM if you don't want to.

The previous poster brings up a rather valid point, there's no reason to tell people you're deleting your stories before deleting them if you want people to read it. If you're done, just turn off notifications and let your anonymous internet profile fade into the abyss.
