Title


** Ahem.

Let's look at the general romcom pairing: usually bickers a lot, tension, opposite personalities, etc. IE Harry/Draco.

Other reasons: possible redemption arcs, snarky humour, pretty men fucking, comfort and understanding arcs, troubled history arcs, each has had periods of times where they were obsessed with each other (Draco overall, Harry in their sixth year, yeah, it might not have been romantic but shipping don't care), fun pair to explore heavier themes with, fun characters to explore deeper aspects of their personalities that may not have come out during canon, hilarious reactions from friends, families, and enemies at their relationship, aaaaaand lots of other things yet.

They're a surprisingly versatile couple.

*** This. For comparison, why are there so many Daphne/Other Female Slytherin fics? It's a similar reasoning. I'd also say, how many other male characters are there Harry's age that are featured frequently in the series? Ron? Neville? Hah! Draco seems like an obvious choice barring the fact that he's a little shit.

Think about it this way, if Draco was a female, she would be just as popular a pairing choice as Draco is now.

***** There is a very small number of Harry/Pansy fics.

She's a useful character in that we no almost nothing about her other than she's a Slytherin with all of its attachments. So you can flesh out her character in a number of different ways. Whereas Draco is his own character with a clearly defined story.

Which is a shame. I've only come across a few and none were very high in quality so I couldn't enjoy them.

Anyway, I think Harry/Pansy would be a fascinating pairing to play with if done right. She doesn't have much background but that's the great thing about fanfiction--authors can /create/ that.

I really like the idea of Harry ending up with a Slytherin, be it a girl or a boy. Unfortunately, the majority of the het ones I've come across turned the girls (usually Daphne, sometimes Pansy) into huge Mary-Sues, removing the very thing that makes the idea so appealing.

I don't want to read about this perfect Slytherin princess who's oh-so smart and oh-so "cunning" and is secretly really kind but is forced to hide it because of her house/family. What's the point? The kind of girl who'd give up a fellow student to save her own skin--now that's an interesting character!

** Because they have a fascinating dynamic and are polar opposites, that's why. I've always been a fan of the "rivals-turned-lovers" and "opposites attract" tropes, and Harry/Draco epitomizes that.

Both characters have different personalities, backgrounds, motivations, values, goals, etc., and it's fascinating to think about two such vastly different characters falling in love. Their Romeo-and-Juliet-esque circumtances only adds to the intrigue.

The fact that Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton are incredibly attractive and look really good together doesn't hurt, either.

I also am a fan of rivals turned lovers and opposites attract at times, but in this case I completely disagree, not that I dont get the idea behind the pairing though.

If you are talking Slytherin house (bearing in mind I am not interested in M/M) I am partial to Harry/Daphne or Tracey, or even occasionally Pansy pairings though.

*** Sadly right - they often play it up as "sexual tension" (utter BS if you ask me, but that's what I've seen in (undeclared/un-tagged!) slash fan-fictions (I don't read slash normally, I don't like it if a characters sexual orientation is changed in most cases (sometimes I make an exception for fem-slash, but only if it's really well done!))) despite the fact that (as in the case of Harry and Draco) they really dislike/hate each other, not only because they just don't like each other (I would have not much of a problem if it were just that) because they are so fundamentally different (and I don't see Draco changing, even in the end...he just throws his lot in with the winning side and instead of an open bigot, he becomes a closet bigot!).

I mean: Draco is a pureblood (born and raised that way) and Harry is a half-blood (so in Draco's eyes he's worth less than most purebloods and it's only his fame that compensates for that - oh: and his old family name!) raised by fucking bigotted muggles (hell: Sometimes I wounder why Harry doesn't hate muggles, I mean no one saw the - OBVIOUS! - signs of neglect (if not outright abuse!) and nobody helped him etc....I mean Tom Riddle hates them and I'd wager that his orphanage was a better place to grow up at than the Dursleys!)...hell, Draco insults Harry's mother (indirectly at least - don't remember if he ever did it directly - by calling one of Harry's best friends a mudblood!) on a regular basis (and he insults Harry's other good friend regularly, too (note: It's one of the few things I actually agree with Draco...well, I just don't like Ron and think his parents are so poor because they are either too proud or too stupid to use contraception (they have too many kids IMHO and they should have known better...hell, I'd say that this upbringing is what drives their children (except for Ron and Ginny) to leave their home ASAP and even seek employment in other countries!))) so is it ANY WOUNDER that Harry doesn't want anything to do with Draco (I know that he wouldn't want to see him hurt, at least not really - I mean that Sectum Sempra spell was an accident (and Draco was trying to hurt him, too so it's actually self-defense IMHO))...

I think Harry would be aghast at being paired with Draco (ok: He'd be aghast at being paired with a Slytherin in general probably, but then again: If it's a girl and if she's beautiful and has similar interests etc. he'd be less shocked and less against it than being paired with Draco - I mean let's face it: He ain't gay and he hates Draco!) and he would probably rather leave the country if someone tried to force it!

Hermione and Ron are polar opposites. As are Molly and Arthur, James and Lily, Dumbledore and Grindelwald, Remus and Tonks, etc.

Once again, Lily hated James and they still ended up getting married. People grow up and change.

As for him being gay...well, it's fan fiction. Why isn't it okay to make a canonically straight character gay but it's okay to do literally everything else to him? Writers can make him godlike, make him dark, make him an intellectual genius and that's totally okay, but make him fall in love with another guy and /gasp!/ Now it's too OOC, too uncanonical, too uncharacteristic, too different. BS if you ask me, esp. if Harry's personality remains true to canon and literally the only thing that changes is his sexuality.

I hate it when slash haters try to justify their dislike of slash pairings/slash in general by coming up with ridiculous, often hypocritical reasons and excuses. Just be honest and admit that you don't like the idea of a guy with another guy, ffs.

***** Interesting? They'd kill each other if someone forced this (or one of them would run away, flee the country or live inside a property under the fidelius or something)...they might become friends or learn to respect each other if you put them through something they can (and did) only survive because they worked together, but love?

Don't know...it's just my view of course, but I could never forgive 6 years of name calling, abuse, threats and harrassment etc. (at least not enough to love somebody who put me through something like that!)

It's ok (in a way), I just prefer not to read that :) (I have nothing against gays, hell I am in favor of gay marriage (if straight people are allowed to gamble with their lives this way (statistics say that most marriages fail these days!), why shouldn't gays and lesbians be allowed the same "privilege"?) and rights to adopt children etc.)

It's not hypocritical if you don't want Harry paired with someone who basically thinks he and his friends are less than the dirt beneath his boots (even if you make him grow out of it he still did call them names, threaten and harrass them for several years - I can't forgive that, at least not enough to love somebody...I migh let bygones be bygones, but I'd never forget it (I'd not turn bitter like Snape did, but I'd probably hold it against Draco forever, just like his becoming a DE and then getting away without punishment...fucking rich prick!))

Ron and Hermione is crap, too (Even Rowling isn't convinced anymore after all!), that relationship would either not last or it would turn very very sour because he's holding her back (IMHO) and she's constantly nagging him (and questioning his culture and heritage etc.)

James and Lilly...yeah, don't like those two together either (I don't like Snape much, but he'd probably turn out better if he got together with Lilly)...it's kind of Ron and Hermione of the last generation (with the exception that James had talent (which he didn't use all that wisely IMHO) and money)

Yeah I am a man (yeah, check - man-bits confirmed!)...I am just not comfortable reading about gays (I try to be as open minded as possible and I don't hate/discriminate against gays in RL, but I don't have to or want to read about them, it's just a preference!), it's outside of my comfort zone (and I don't think that's weird, as many straight men are "wired" this way it seems)...I mean I've tried (not only once, but several times) over the last 10 years...hell, I looked through slash-fanfiction recommended for "beginners" (and people not into slash)...but I couldn't finish one -.- kind of sad, I know, but it just is uncomfortable to read that for me :(

** I think it's partially because canon Draco really does seem to have a mild obsession with Harry (though Harry doesn't reciprocate). The idea that it was romantic obsession is a leap, but not a massive one. He seems to be fairly appearance-conscious, has an obsession with a boy in his year, and seems to have only a passing interest in a girl who is very obviously into him. So if you believe that Draco is gay and you like Draco as a character, you naturally want to give him a happily ever after. So you pair him up with the object of his interests, regardless of Harry's canon sexuality.

I've never had a big problem with believing that Draco might be interested in Harry (or Hermione), but I do have a problem with the idea of either of them reciprocating.

** I am not a fan, but I get why there is a following (likely more-so among female readers).

Not that I agree with the reasons often used to justify it. Opposites attracts is a useful excuse, but in this case I feel they are just TOO opposite for that to be realistic. Both attractive young males? Yea i guess, but thats a fairly shallow reason to pair them. On and on, I guess I just dont see any real excuse to pair them personally other then just wanting to force it.

Now that said, if you adjust their personalities some, or the world around them, that can change the ball game. And since FF is all about exploring ideas, both within and outside of canon, and the traditional storyline... people can and will make this pairing happen in a more realistic way.

I dont personally enjoy Harry/Draco one bit, but I do enjoy most Harry/Slytherin pairings (although I prefer F/M)... although that may be because in the back of my mind I always kinda wanted Harry in Slytherin.

** For the same reasons that Draco/Hermione is quite popular: because swarms of fangirls think that they can somehow "change" a "bad boy".

Also because of historical reasons: one of the yuge fics back in the day was Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy: which was very much influential in giving popularity to the Harry/Draco ship. As I've commented before on this sub: one must also not forget that Cassie and her Draco-loving clique were the "Big Name Fans" back in 2001/2003 or so and thus they had the monopoly on which interpretation of his character was favoured, since fandom at that time was very insular and centralized. Everyone wanted to be one of the BNFs, so what did you have to? Write the ships that they preferred, those being of course Harry/Draco, Draco/Hermione and to a certain extent Harry/Hermione too.

This is something I find seriously ridiculous, and it's something that I think more heterosexual men should /really/ think about.

Why is it common for gay men to ship heterosexual pairings but it's uncommon for straight men to ship gay pairings? I find that that the idea of them "not being able to relate" is weird as hell considering how many /heterosexual women/ are open to the idea of /gay men being romantically/sexually involved/. In fact, I even know several /lesbians/ who write/read/draw slash fic/art, so clearly it's not entirely a matter of relating to the characters/situation.

*** I will never understand why people think a single three fics can have that much impact on FF as a whole. It is not in the least bit surprising that Harry/Draco is a popular pairing, because literally every single popular piece of fiction that has a main character with a rival will have fans that ship them together. Do people really think that if it wasn't for the Draco trilogy, there wouldn't be a horde of fangirls who want Harry and Draco to vigorously fuck?

The only reason I know the existence of the Draco trilogy is cos people just love to go on about the impact it supposedly had. It may have been the most popular fic on Fanfiction.net (at least I think it was), but this was in around 2002 I think, where being the most popular fic was significantly less of a big deal. It would be like a 10th of Harry Crow's popularity.

**** I think you underestimate the amount of influence CC had during her prime years. She wasn't just any popular author like Robst; she was a major Big Name Fan during a time where much of the fandom's mainstream interpretation was being established. During the early years, the fandom was much more centralized, where most major authors knew each other. She, along with several of her friends, was a part of what was called the Inner Circle, which was a group that literally everyone wanted to be close to. One of the main reasons why FictionAlley began was to host The Draco Trilogy, which was banned from FFN.

Her influence comes mainly in her characterization of Draco as a misunderstood, sarcastic, and attractive antihero. You said being the most popular fic was "significantly less of a big deal" back then. It's the exact opposite. You see how tropes like manipulative!Dumbledore being recycled over and over as readers read the old fics and get inspired to write their own. It's like that, except the majority of the fandom was doing it at the time. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that most, if not all fics out there that portray Draco in a positive manner are directly or indirectly influenced by CC's trilogy. Sure, H/D would have still been a popular pairing even without CC's influence. But it would not have been to the point where there are more H/D stories than H/Hr or H/G.

****** Yeah. A massive shitfuckery, it was. The e-drama on the subreddit seem tame in comparison to the wanks they did in the past. What a fucking troll...

For those who are interested, read [[http://charlottelennox.livejournal.com/887.html][this biography]] of the greatest troll in the HP fandom.

*** She's less responsible for H/D slash and almost completely responsible for the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] trope. (warning: TVTropes link)

**** Indeed, but the Draco in Leather Pants trope, which I have described in my original post, inspired many/most H/D fics where Draco is portrayed as a misunderstood, attractive character, not the cowardly bigot he is in the canon. Also, while the Draco trilogy features H/Hr, there are enough slash undertones between Harry and Draco, which further inspired more H/D fics.

*** Maya also wrote tons of Harry/Draco around the same time of Cassandra Claire. I liked her writing, and thus to this day, still read a ton of H/D. Never did and still don't like anything Cassandra Claire kicked out, ugh.

**** I wasn't a fan of CC, either. As for Maya, the only fic of hers that I enjoyed was "Underwater Light" and I still don't consider it to be a favorite of mine, tbh. It was good, but I've read far better.

***** Agreed re:Underwater Light. And I've read better has time has marched on*, but it was the first I read that I remember. I did very much like her Ron/Pansy story (the title escapes me) and I do recall liking Drop Dead Gorgeous. Draco, in my head canon, will always have a coffee dependency thanks to her, heh.

*I truly wish that Mirabella finished "The Shadow of His Wings".
