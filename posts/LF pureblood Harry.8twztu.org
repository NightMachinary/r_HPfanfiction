Hey guys, I am looking for a Complete Fanfic where Harry was raised to be the heir to pureblood family, I prefer grey/dark Harry, but at this point, I'll take anything. Thanks in advance!

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** Well, technically and legally, he's a pureblood in my AU "Patron", and the Head of the Potter Family. Although the raising part is, in the first two years at Hogwarts, mostly self-taught, before Sirius takes over as his guardian. However, while Harry does adapt to the pureblood culture, he certainly isn't a supporter of the system. The story does have a distinct pureblood culture, though, which is more progressive than muggle culture in parts, and more archaic in other parts, and not monolithic - French purebloods have a different culture, as do Bulgarian purebloods, and there's a mainstream and a few fringe cultures in Wizarding Britain, too. Not to mention Magical Scandinavia, Jamaica, and the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

****** Tell me about it.

About a year and a half ago I read a fic called /Prince of the Dark Kingdom./ It's an AU, Voldemort won the war and becomes a mentor to Harry. I really enjoyed it, and it's like 147 chapters long, and it stopped on a cliffhanger and hasn't been updated in 4 years. Pissed me off soooo much. I spent weeks reading that bitch. The world building is phenomenal and then it just stops on a fucking cliffhanger.
