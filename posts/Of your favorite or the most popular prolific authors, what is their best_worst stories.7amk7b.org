There are several fanfic authors that I regularly read who have written dozens of fics. Even though I enjoy them overall, I usually find that some fics are better than others.

So of your favorite or the most popular authors who have written several stories, what do you think is their best and/or worst fics?

For example, I think Northumbrian's Strangers at Drakeshaugh is overall his best work, though Aurors and Schoolgirls was most interesting. And while it was better than most, Grave Days was a bit of a bore.


** Can Taure be called prolific if he starts a lot of longer stuff but never finishes it?

Anyway, The One He Feared is easily his most polished story, but also the one with least potential. In Essence Divided is definitely the best one plotwise, and Alexandra Potter character-wise. Both are much more interesting than TOHF. I liked the premise and setting of Lords of Magic, but the outline of the supposed plot was rather disappointing.

However, I just couldn't get into Patron, even though a lot of people think that's his best work.

*** Hmm. Here's my ranking of Starfox stories.

*A+++* /Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water/ Fantastic story, really well thought out, a crossover that shouldn't work (but does), awesome battles, great pairing.

*A+* /Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution/, massive points for the first actually coherent fic that had all of Voldemort's sympathizers executed. Loved the European muggleborn/pureblood war.

*A-* /The Dark Lord Never Died/ Solid story, really liked the structure of how Hermione discovers what's going on.

*B+* /Patron/ Well written & reasonably interesting but it does drag on at times.

*B-* /Harry Potter and the Lady Thief/ It can go either way but seems interesting enough so far.

*D-* /Divided and Entwined/ Just... meh. I slogged through half of it and skimmed the rest. Too long, bloated and considering fox's earlier fics, more of the same. Harry felt like a tertiary character at best. Abertforth was one of the few reedeming features of this story.

So. I guess what I'm saying is great job Starfox5. You're gonna go far kid.

******** Look. I understand it's more complicated than what we're discussing.

If it's gonna be professionally done you need an agent. And the editor comment was for yourself. A publishers editor isn't going to overhaul your book.

And there's a myriad of other factors.

So yeah. I get it.

I'm just saying with a little push and lots of work it can be done.

And if all else fails self publishing is a thing and people can live off it.

******** Have you read that Highlander series or whatever it's called? Lady goes back in time to Scottish war and falls in love. With plenty of bigotry and rape along the way. It got a series on Showtime or some other similar channel. Starfox's writing is worlds better than that super popular series. From world building to lack of plot holes to prose to consistency in characters, their writing is more coherent and more enjoyable to read. You don't have to be a “good” writer to be published (and not just self-published). And we don't even know if that's a goal of Starfox's. So maybe stop trying to shoot them down when you don't even know if there is anything to shoot down?

********** Here's the reason I think you're getting negative reactions: you're only saying the author's writing is bad without giving any concrete examples. We've all seen people online be contrary and negative just for the sake of it. When you repeatedly bash something without justifying why, that comes off as entry-level trolling instead of constructive criticism.

Yes, I like the one Starfox story I've read, but that hardly means the author is my favorite and I will defend them until I die. I like them for how original their world building and plots are compared to other HP fanfics. For me, that's plenty of reason.

You don't need to love them, but that also doesn't mean you need to be negative just for the sake of being negative. If you can't stand them, don't comment. Or if you feel the need to, then comment constructively. Say why their writing is sophomoric. Because that could spark actual debate and get people thinking. And you'll sound intelligent instead of mean spirited.

Read this, it was terrible. It's just a combination of plot conveniences to sort out canon plot in an instant. It can't be seen as canon "what if", because too many elements of the background were changed. It can't be seen as a good story in its own right because there is no conflict. At least Super Harrys can be entertaining, but Bones Ex Machina? It's a waste of time.

Also tried to read Arithmancer. Had some nice stuff ideas about Hogwarts, but arithmancy and approach to magic in general made no sense, and the whole thing dragged on and was rehashy at that.

** Hmm... i think I agree with you that "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" is definitely Northumbrian's best work. I like "James and Me" too, as a many-years-later follow-up to that story.... but I find that a lot of his one-shots are just kind of dull and insubstantial. Most of them I just can't bother to finish.
