I'm looking for fics in which Dumbledore doesn't wait the obligatory 9 years for Harry to turn eleven and acts in advance instead of sitting and twiddling hid thumbs. Whether that ends up in his premature death by way of the ring horcrux or some freed Death Eater's being disposed of and their children being raised differently, it's all good as long as canon events are derailed enough from the standard stone, chamber, prisoner, cup timeline.

Same goes for Voldemort actually tasking someone to resurrect him prematurely, or attempting to steal the stone before it's a convenient plot device for a Harry obstacle course, or Tom Riddle Jr. got bored with staying in the diary or Malfoy plants it earlier.

Also fics that Harry's parents or Dumbledore left clues/failsafes/letters, something to guide him and diverge the story.

TLDR: Looking for fanfics with huge butterfly effects that come with a premature character death (Dumbledore, Pettigrew, Weasleys, any of the Professors /hint/ Snape), or a different decision that has long reaching consequences (the mentioned deaths, a zombie apocalypse, missing main characters, newly taught subjects, drastic personality change, other species taught in Hogwarts) ultimately derailing the standard canon cookie cutter formula.


** There are very very few fics in which Dumbledore followed up the tactical victory on Halloween 1981 with decisive actions.

Well, *Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure*, linkffn(9824342), mercilessly bashes canon Dumbledore. It has a version of him from an alternate dimension taking over his body. The new comer immediately got down to business and fixed many mistakes before Harry even got to Hogwarts. Unfortunately, this fic has been abandoned.

*The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877), has a very proactive and strong Dumbledore, although this Lucius Malfoy was very cunning and manipulative, too. [[/spoiler][After Harry and Co finally graduated from Beauxbaton and were combat ready, Dumbledore directed Snape to resurrect Voldemort and set him loose on Malfoy, and Dumbledore planned fully to exploit the resulting carnage to defeat them both. However, Hermione's actions forced him to modify his original plan significantly.]]

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): the Potters didn't trust Dumbledore at all and killed invading Voldemort with a nasty trap. The story then dived into extreme AU territory, even Muggle world was AU here. There was no BWL, Harry never went to Hogwarts, and the Trio never became friends. [[/spoiler][Ginny would become Harry's nemesis for a long time]]

*Tyrant*, linkffn(5324704): Sirius got a lucky shot on Voldemort that night, and things became completely different. This fic loosely mirrors that of Caesar and Octavian in the form Sirius and Harry. I wrote a review on FF.net about how I think the HP characters would be mapped into historical ones.

*A Black Comedy*, linkffn(3401052): In the other dimension, things went significantly different. [[/spoiler][Sirius and Harry were killed by Voldemort, the Potters survived, Neville was killed by the Diary, but the Diary Riddle fought against Voldemort]]

*Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853): one of the very few fics in which Voldemort got his body back early. But there is a twist in this story, which benefitted Voldemort greatly.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Very long fic yes, but it gets preachy and boring because the author.. does a lot of explaining using physics and jumps through a lot of hoops.

I honestly wouldn't recommend this one as I couldn't get through more than a few chapters.
