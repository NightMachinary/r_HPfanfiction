:END:
Crossover where Earth is conquered and Harry ends up as a slave for the Empire but gathers all of the slaves together and tries to storm the Death Star. Other details such as impersonating a Captain of the fleet and serving that role. Forgive me if crossovers aren't supposed to be asked for here but any help is appreciated


** You are looking for "Revenge of the Wizard" by Darth Marrs

One of the best HP/SW crossovers out there. Enjoy.

linkffn(10912355)

And crossovers are a big part of the fandom and are absolutely supposed to be asked about here :)

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

*** Never did finish that one. I have read other Darth Marrs fanfics, but not that one.. How does it compare to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577249/1/Magic-of-the-Force][/Magic of the Force/ by Vimesenthusiast]]?

**** That would be one of my other favorite ones. Both are very different in tone and plot though, so it's hard to draw any comparisons.

But for what it's worth, Darth Marrs himself keeps saying that this one is his best HP/SW crossover whenever he shows up in a thread here. And I agree, even if I enjoy "The Lord of Light" a lot too, apart from the weird ending at least.

So if you like his other fics, I would definitely give this one another try, I enjoyed it a lot.

****** Dude, all stories by the author of magic of the force have terrible writing, a lot of repeating phrases and are super slow. Even tho the plot itself maybe okay, they are impossible to read. The once I recommend have far superior writing even if you don't like the plot. Anyway, nobody gives a shit if you disagree with my fics preference. I bet you are one of those people who enjoy a cringfest like 'in the mind of a scientist'.

** The closest thing I can think of is Linkffn(In All Things Balance) and Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of the Dark Side) and both of them have force users coming to the uncharted section of our galaxy (where earth is) and adopting baby Harry.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture
