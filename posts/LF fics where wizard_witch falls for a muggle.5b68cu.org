*** I read this fic yesterday based on your recommendation here and loved it, which is strange because I don't usually like OC's or stories with small kids.

Really well written.

  Working in the Ministry archives, Julia finds a document she really has no business seeing. When she discovers that the Muggle world is threatened by an ancient and terrifying evil, she seeks Albus Dumbledore's help. He sends her to Twelve Grimmauld Place where she has to persuade the enigmatic, troubled, and very bad-tempered Sirius Black to help save the world.

** linkffn(4828328) was the first one I thought of. I read this years ago back when it was first published and I haven't read it again since, so I can't say whether its stood the test of time or not, but I remember that I did enjoy it a lot back then so maybe you will too!

** "Cold Blood" features a muggle/wizard pairing, but it's not a main plot.
