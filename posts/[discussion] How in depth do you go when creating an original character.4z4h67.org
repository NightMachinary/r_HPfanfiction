I've gone as far as drawing out the character's physical features to their wand characteristics. I feel that it helps me get a better idea of who this person is, and it allows me to really see them as I write.


** I write down their external traits (how they are perceived), their internal traits (how they think), their quirks, desires, goals, MBTI personality, habits, flaws, manner of speech, tv and music they enjoy, food they enjoy, clothes they enjoy, their upbringing, psychological profile, etc.

*** Oh wow! I haven't gone into that much detail, but that's really impressive!

*** I don't go quite this far, but I write down my character's strengths & weaknesses, physical characteristics, desires, and maybe quirks. I also daydream about my character in random situations both related and not related to the story and from there I can usually get a good mental image and feel for the character.

** I use character forms that go into their backgrounds, their positive and negative traits, their ways of viewing the world, their habits and quirks, etc... It's on Mugglenet Fanfiction Beta Forums if anyone wants it.

I actually don't go into too much detail describing the physical appearance of my characters, even though I have a very clear idea of them in my head. I usually pick two or three defining features and use them to say something about their personality. If you go into too much depth you end up focusing too much on trying to get the reader to imagine it exactly as you do, and it's not necessary.

** Hmm ... well, I'm not writing actual fanfiction so every single character I create is an original one, but when I do it my approach depends on whether the character is a major one or a one-scene-wonder.

In the latter case it is simple: I treat them as tools to advance the plot so I just write the scene with the character in question when I need it and leave it in if it feels right to me.

In the former case I put in a bit more effort: I write down the list of noteworthy traits of that character, and then for each trait I write a short scene (that wouldn't be seen by anyone) that showcases the trait in question. If I cannot write the scene then the trait simply will not be there as that means it doesn't fit the character as a whole (and indeed, it had happened on a few occasions). I finish it off by writing a scene that is narrated by the character, to show how they think. It takes quite a bit of work with each added character that way, but it does give me a bit of consistency to begin with and a frame of reference if I ever think I lost the character's image and something I wrote might have caused them to become OoC. I do note that if the character changes throughout the story there will be scenes in the story proper that will show the change, and I copy those into the characters' notes too to have an easier time finding them; and if the change is not visible to the readers at first then the scene will still be written but not shown.

** For OC's or canon characters that are just a name or a few lines of text, I try to think of what good and/or bad personality trait the character stands for and which 'archetype' they represent and what function they have in the story. Then later I will think of the individual details that make them more real and less of a caricature, and their relationships with others. For some characters I had already a strong feeling of 'who they are' based on loose images. But I'm not really good at original characters, not at all.

** I keep it pretty basic. I'll define characteristics such as age, eye color, hair color, family name, etc. For personality, I'll usually use a combination of other known characters. For example, in the fic I'm currently working on, I have an older wizard that I describe as "magical version of Tywin Lannister entering their twilight years, dismayed by the fact that their body is betraying them in old age, but hides it well."

I try to keep things pretty lose, because I can write a character before I even write a word of the actual story, but 50,000 words later, things may have worked out different than what you originally plan, and it's important to let a story flow naturally.

** If the Original Character is not very important to the plot (e.g. it will only appear in one or two scenes and won't say many lines), I won't put much thought on them. The maximum I will do at these cases is making sure I have cohesive physical description of these particular OCs.

However, if it plays an important role (let's say, an OC who is pairing one of the main Characters and/or definitely plays a role in the story), I think it is very important to give some nice background story to them.

Where did this Character came from?, Who are the OC parents and grandparents? What did they do for living? Does he/she has any siblings? Who are their best friends? What are they good/bad at?, What are your OC hobbies? What does your OC really love/hate? What are their dreams, ambitions, fears? What is the most important thing in the world for them? What would your OC risk their life for? And the list of questions goes on and on...

I believe that in order to a character feels like a real person, they need to have a real story behind them. Of course, you can always expand the story if you feel the need. You might never end up using the details... or you might go back to your OC family tree when you need to write that 'it was Uncle Johnny - who works at the knockturn alley - who sent your OC that rare ingredient that he/she needed to brew that illegal potion'.

** I don't. I let them develop themselves. If I need a complicated backstory I might make notes I suppose.

I have used two major OCs - OCs whose POV is used to tell the story or part of it - and I have concentrated on their personality and thought processes. Physical appearance is only mentioned if the story switches to another POV and they are being observed by someone else. So what is described is what the other person notices. No more, no less. I use a lot of minor OCs but there I only work out the details I need to know. How old they are; marital status, occupation, general social demographic. Everything else happens naturally.

I wrote a multi chapter story where I never described the OC's appearance - because the whole story was from her POV and she is not vain enough to spend a lot of time looking in mirrors. And it was a deliberate decision to leave her appearance in the mind of the reader. I had one reviewer say they would like to know what she looked like, and another who thought she was beautiful :) When I wrote the same plot but from another POV I had to decide what she looked like. Until that point I hadn't really considered it because it didn't matter.

I tend not to decribe clothes unless they make an important point - in a historical story, say. But designer clothes or how tight and black someones trousers are (a la Janet Evanovitch) no, no definitely not.

** Depends on how major/minor I intend the character to be. Some of the more major ones I'll write up a little few-paragraph bio, I like to know a little about their family history, their personality type (usually Myers Briggs or something just to get a more general sense if they're feeler vs thinker, introvert vs extrovert etc), what motivates them, some strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, friends/love interests/enemies, what happens to them after the story ends so I know where their arc is going. I'm also vaguely aware of what they look like but tend to give a few details and leave it up to reader imagination.

Minor characters I don't really develop outside the role in the story although for some of them I may know more because the back story got cut or the characters role got reduced.

** I pick a couple of really defining physical features, and tend to use those when describing them vs. going into massive depth. Though I have a clear picture of how they look in my head, I think it's really important to allow the reader to build up their own image of the character in order to identify with them better. I focus a lot more on who they are as a person -- what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how they might react within a particular situation. I find it really helps to come up with certain defining points in their background as well, to illuminate what has shaped them into who they are today!

** Well, I don't do it this way.

I play out a scene from my story in my head and imagine as if it were happening in real life. I'd play that scene back from all the characters in that scene -- portraits in Hogwarts, witch, wizard, maybe even a door or window -- and then I write the scene pulling in different unique points from each character or object.

The reason I do this, is because I believe that a story is so much more than just exchanging dialogues. Everything about a scene (like how a characters hand moves while talking to someone -- say his enemy --) will give the readers more clues to what might unfold in the future and helps by being an aid to the readers' imagination.

As for my characters, I generally stick to canon behaviour, but if I'm writing AU, then I like to look at the motives or events that led to him acting so OOC and then put myself in those shoes and enact a couple of scenes to ascertain how the character will feel.

I picked these up from my friend and guru -- Ann Charles. That's what she did when she wrote the Deadwood series.

** I base all my OCs off other characters in other media. I rarely mention their basis unless they're basically throwaway characters like the Archer characters in Darkness Ascendant. I did mention in A Trek to the Stars that T'ryl is named after Teryl Rothery and looks like Rachel Riley.

Edit: just realized my edit didn't take. I basically take a dnd chara sheet and use that to expand on all characters so i know what they have, what they act like, and what they look like
