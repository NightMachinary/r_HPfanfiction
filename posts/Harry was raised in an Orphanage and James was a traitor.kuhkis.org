** The only traitor-James fic I know of is The Odds Were Never In My Favour, but Harry was raised at the Dursley's and was a Fem!Harry. Not sure if it is your thing, but you might enjoy it.

Is the fic you're looking for one you've read before, and do you remember when you read it/what site it was on?

**** Thought not, but good to have it confirmed. Glad ARJ139 found it. I'll be checking that one out as well. :)

*** I got too bored by that story, so I haven't finished it, but I suspect he wasn't really traitor after all, was he? (similar to how Sirius was suspected)

**** No idea. I haven't finished it either. But he's introduced as a traitor, so it's at least semi-relevant to the OP's request. :)

***** Sure it is, and I really liked the setup of the story, before it fell into weird super-Harry and the paranoid world manipulated by the higher powers. I wish somebody wrote from the same setup better.

****** I liked the paranoid world being manipulated, personally. I admit, it seemed to get a bit big too quickly - it really was a paranoid 'world' - but it worked well for me. I just got caught up in real life and haven't had the time to read it again. :)

Big, shadowy, manipulated world is definitely an under-utilised trope though, I absolutely agree. I'd love a few more Magical Illuminati stories. :)

******* Sorry, you misunderstood me. I absolutely abhor any Illuminati-style worldview and stories driven by it. I guess, we have to agree to disagree on this.

******** Ah, apparently I did. Fair enough. I suppose we do have to agree to disagree, then. I played the Deus Ex games far too early in my formative years to not enjoy the shadowy manipulators trope. :)

**** Correct James didn't betray the Longbottom's it was a relative trying to usurp the main line.
