  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I saw this post earlier and figured, though I hadn't read this story at all and ones like it aren't usually my cup of tea, if it was treated like this it must be good.

Now it's a bit after 2am but I've just read all 23 chapters posted, and I'm so glad I did!

Edit: is it just me or did Abey lose 20 IQ points for this chapter?

*** Hey, I'm the author! I heard about this subreddit from some people and finally got an account. I just wanted to say that I get why you'd view it like that, and it that's my own fault, really. I didn't want Hermione to just info dump for 5 straight paragraphs and knew that it had to be broken up a bit by dialogue or Abby's thoughts. And unfortunately the only semi-interesting way I could think to do that was just have her be like 'wtf is going on' the whole time. Apparently not the best route.

I'm assuming you're talking about the part with Hermione, but I could be wrong! In general though, I think she was just very overstimulated in this chapter which caused her brain to freeze and tongue to loosen so that she was essentially questioning everything.

That's just my two cents though, but I thought you'd appreciate knowing that I was aware of it as well.

**** Well, a tax adviser might speak to you in simple English sentences with some unknown words, and plenty of people might as well be mentally handicapped in that discussion.

Expecting perfect intelligence continuity in this kind of situation seems...unreasonable.

Though Abby's discombobulation could be worded a little differently so it's not as jarring to Her Royal Readership.
