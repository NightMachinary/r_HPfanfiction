I think I read every fic with this couple but maybe I missing somothing?

Also, If you know James/OC story then please, let me know!

One time I read Hermione/James where Hermione was Lily's younger sister and she tutor James. I wanted something similiar. You know, James fall in love with wrong sister (meaning Lily! I don't like her very much), then he met Hermione or any OC and the story begins ;D and you know... Marauders... Especially Sirius in the story and his jokes. I love this ;D

Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter.

Not sure if you read this one. This is the only JamesXHermione fanfic I have read so far
