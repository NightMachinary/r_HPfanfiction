Specifically, Harry is still the son of Lily and James, but at some point Snape takes Harry under his wing and cares for the boy as a son.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][Secret Language of Plants]] series on AO3 is quite good, imo. Basically, Snape sees how Petunia and Vernon are treating baby Harry, kidnaps him without telling anyone because that isn't the type of thing Dumbledore would allow, and then brings him to Remus Lupin for safe hiding, and the two of them raise him. It's a completed series too, over 370k.

***** Haven't actually gotten to it yet... I honestly try to avoid stories, well written or not, where characters have different parents unless there's a good reason for the change. Part of what makes Harry Harry is that, genetically speaking, he is the son of Lily and James. I'm reading one right now that's really good and it was revealed a few chapters in that Lily went to Snape because James was impotent. This fic is an exception to my rule because of that.

** My favourite "Snape is Harry's dad" fics:

Blood Magic by Gateway Girl - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911]]

A Very Slytherin Harry series by geoffaree - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019/chapters/1078847]]

A new place to stay by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1008166/chapters/1999790]]

And of course, the "Like None Other" series by AspenInThe Sunlight, which is extremely long. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

These should keep you busy for the next year or so if you read them all.

If you are new to the genre, I would recommend "Blood Magic" or "Digging for the Bones" as places to start.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.
