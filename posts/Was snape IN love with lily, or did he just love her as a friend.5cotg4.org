They grew up together and were best friends, but was it ever really made clear that he was IN love with here rather then just love her?

Every fic ive seen so far treats it as if he was in love with here yet i cant really remember that being the case, he loved here - that was clear, but that could just have been him loving her as basicely a sister/best friend rather then anything romantic?

Dont have the books at hand so cant look it up (nor would i tbh, asking is much faster i think).


** He wanted to raiload her like the Hogwarts Express.

...I've always wanted to say that.

The thing about Snape is that he---like Harry, Voldemort and Dumbledore---is a broken individual (see his behavior as an adult, joining a terrorist/revolutionary group, his attempt to seriously hurt Petunia when a child and so on). He 'loved' (whether or not it was a healthy love is another) Lily, this is clear from that portion of The Prince's Tale where he tells Lily that James liked her. The way that was emphasized, shows Snape's feelings for Lily. However, Snape didn't have it within him to tell Lily his feelings, most likely a combination of his own issues from growing up in an unhealthy home, and a certain level of emotional cowardice.

***** For as long as you are trying to change it, I think it's more courageous to admit to it than shameful to have a problem.

But maybe it's just the way I see it; emotionally, I'll never be a gryffindor.

** My understanding, and deduction, was that from his side it was an almost possessive love. Not a girlfriend, but almost more, like the love some people develop for those who help them out of very dark places. From what we know Lily was a small beacon of light in the relatively dark life of Snape. Such love borders on worship. Loosing the approval of this person can push someone quickly down the deep end.

So Snape may have been in love with Lily, but first and foremost he loved her as a friend and later maybe even as a symbol/saint-like figure. Lily was a symbol he was able to dedicate his life to at an almost fanatic degree. He'd have to in order to spend seventeen years working to make her life not lost in vain.

Definitely. I know a friend who has these kinds of feelings and they're borderline obsessive.

  The female form of her husband's Patronus. We later learn that Severus Snape, in love with Lily for nearly his whole life, also had a doe for his Patronus.

*** I read an interesting take on that a while back. Lily and James were perfect for each other, so they had matching patronuses. But Snape loved Lily in a possessive way. He wanted her, he didn't want to be with her.

**** I have a similar opinion. Personally, I like to think he was in love with an ideal. To him, she represented his childhood and innocence. He loved her, but he never would have been in a relationship with her because doing so would have destroyed that ideal.

** To be honest, it's a bit hard to say which it was; I'll use the concept of “four loves” (the original one, not the one expanded---and changed---by Lewis) to explain why.

You see, the thing with what Severus felt towards Lily is that during their time at Hogwarts he no doubt fell three of the four loves, to varying degrees: Storge, which is about familiarity (they'd known each other for a long time), Philia, which is about friendship, and Eros, which is about physical attraction; and yet, there does not seem to be much Agape, because he seems unwilling to change his path just because she does not like it. That's all nice for us because we could see which of those he shows now and use them to extrapolate ... only we cannot, because upon her death all of those changed into Agape, the sacrificial love, making Lily for Severus into less of a person and more of a memento of the past and the reason why he cannot simply do nothing. That does not actually diminish what Severus felt towards her (at its most extreme, Agape is the “for this person, I would do /everything/” kind of love), but it means that the way he loves her now is vastly different from the way he loved her before.

Now, my personal interpretation is that she was basically to him what Hermione was to Harry, that though there is no denying that there is at least a smidgeon of “being in love” it's still a mostly friendly and familiar relationship, the way one would feel about a friend or perhaps a distant cousin. But, as presented in the previous paragraph, for as long as one does not pretend that it's all more than their interpretation I think it is fine to go whichever way as the way Severus's feelings towards her manifested changed greatly when she died and as such we cannot say which version is true and thus we also cannot say that any of the versions is definitely untrue.

** He had romantic feelings towards her, that much seems pretty clear. You could argue that he thought he was in love but didn't really know what that meant. I'm sure he loved her as a friend too, but there were romantic feelings on top of that.

*** I 'ship' H/Hr to a reasonable degree but in canon Harry loved Hermione like a sister. It was explicitly stated so. Comparing them to Snape and Lily isn't realistic. There was a bit of tension but it stemmed from the emotional jab that is your best friend abandoning you. Quite similar to when Snape called Lily a mudblood.

***** Nah, Harry has always found Hermione too abrasive on their own. GOF made that clear when Ron was avoiding him and Harry grit his teeth around Hermione throughout that period. Also he dislikes arguments and Hermione enjoys them; as someone with a similar personality to Harry, argumentative friends are fucking irritating in large doses.
