Hi, everyone,

After the positive reception the audiobook project received last time I posted about this, I just wanted to let everyone know that the project is a go. I'll need some help editing, so applications for that will be going up shortly. Let me know if anyone is interested in helping edit by submitting a response to this form.

​

​

The first fanfiction I'll be doing is Cauterize by Lady Altair, followed by Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man, with permission from the author. This will be concurrent with the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave.

​

Thanks,

​
