** Kiss from a rose[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6571673/1/Kiss-From-a-Rose][Kiss from A Rose]]

The first 200k+ word story i have read. Its a Snape and Hermione Story. It also has a lot of Ron bashing in it. Its amazing and I'm currently rereading it. There's a sequel but it's not for me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FIC

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry's mental link to Voldemort is stronger than ever. Can Snape teach him to control the nightmarish visions? And is their connection the key to ending Voldemort's reign?

*** Worfe hasn't written much, but it's good stuff. I particularly appreciated finding the Nightmares of Futures Past one-shot.

** Let's see... Most of what I'm following is quite long and actively updating but not complete... And A Study in Magic is a Sherlock crossover... The Arithmancer series is an option, but books two and three are stronger on the world building than the plot... Methods of Rationality is very thought-provoking, but probably not the right choice if you just want a story fix... How about linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)? The complete life and times of Severus Snape, canon compliant but canon is only a small fraction of the story. It really gives a different perspective on canon events (waiting until the very moment of awarding the House Cup to pull the rug out from under Slytherin House's feet was a jerk move) and Harry's behaviour (which was often impulsive and violent). Plus, the author has written another story that's an alternate ending/continuation where he survives the Battle of Hogwarts.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** At the risk of recommending something you've already seen, [[http://www.hpmor.com/][this]] one is so good it has its own fanfictions.

[[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix/][I hear that this rewrite of the first couple chapters are generally well received.]]

Esit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][this is the most popular continuation fiction.]]

[[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56][Also, it has an audiobook.]]

*** It's a good read, but I probably wouldn't recommend it just for scratching an itch. More for if you want some serious food for thought.
