***** In essence, yes. Harry was never a true horcrux, because there's some sort of ritual or preparatory spells that have to be cast on the container or object to 'prep' it to become a true horcrux. Harry was a pseudo-horcrux. That's canon, that was outright confirmed to be true on Pottermore.

Dumbledore's glint of triumph was because he realized that Voldemort had just made a massive mistake. He had inadvertently turned HIMSELF into the same kind of pseudo-horcrux that Harry was, but for Harry.

Harry's scar was a pseudo-horcrux for Voldemort, but because of the way Voldemort chose to resurrect himself, his body also became a pseudo-horcrux for Harry. As long as Voldemort's body existed, Harry has a degree of protection against death. Harry basically had a bootleg horcrux of his own starting at the end of book 4 and leading up all the way to the end.

I would also make the argument (this isn't canon, but it feels correct to me) that the prophecy was not in full effect until Voldemort made that decision. By accidentally binding Harry Potter to himself with the resurrection ritual, Voldemort truly ensured that "neither can live while the other survives." Up until that point, the events predicted by the prophecy were avoidable. But Voldemort's resurrection truly locked in place an eventual direct confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. By becoming pseudo-horcruxes for each other, there was no longer any way either of them could avoid a fight to the death.

Voldemort's paranoia destroyed him. Dumbledore was right. He could have avoided the entire prophecy by not caring about it in the first place. Instead, he walked right into it.

It misses the point of that story, however. The reason why he committed suicide to be with her was precisely because she was a genuine shade of the dead person, one who found existing within the living world a torment because she was supposed to be dead. It was not the stone per se which led him to his death, rather, it was his failure to accept that death is a part of life; an acceptance which Harry makes in DH, thus marking him as the Master of Death.

*** I have a theory about that.

I think the wand AND the stone are both cursed to try and kill the people who hold them, and that only the cloak of invisibility doesn't actively try to kill it's wearer.

It's not really canon or necessary for canon, but in the /Tales/ story of the three brothers, the oldest and middle brothers both end up dead in short order after coming into possession of their hallow. Only the youngest brother, who took the cloak, lived a long and happy life. Everyone remembers the story of the eldest brother, and his dramatic duel and subsequent murder. This clearly demonstrates how wand operates: it makes the wielder unbeatable but dooms them to death by treachery.

However, everyone seems to overlook the death of the middle brother. He took the stone, used it, and then */committed suicide/* after speaking with the dead people he wanted to see.

What if that's just what the stone does? What if it, too, is cursed? I can't prove this, but it makes a good deal of sense. The stone lets you speak with images of dead people, but all they do is erode your mental stability and encourage you to kill yourself. You use it thinking you'll be able to reunite with your lost loved ones, or speak with long dead masters and learn their knowledge and secrets. But it never really works out that way. The shades always use your desires to encourage you to kill yourself.

The /Tales/ story of the three brothers may, I suspect, be as much a warning to any prospective seeker of the hallows as it is an account of the lives of the brothers themselves. People who find the wand will die violent deaths of treachery and betrayal. People who find the stone will kill themselves. Only the cloak is safe to use. Only owners of the cloak will find themselves living long and happy lives.

I find it extremely suspicious that Dumbledore comes into direct possession of the stone, and then in less than eight months he has arranged for his own death and died due to those arrangements. And then the very next person to use it is Harry, and after using it */he also/* arranges his own death to the best of his ability given his immediate situation. Sure, the Horcrux cursed Dumbledore, but does anybody really think that after going through all that, he did not, at the very least, use it once to speak to Ariana?

What do you want to bet that Ariana encouraged Dumbledore to kill himself, just like the shades of Lily, James, and Sirius did to Harry?

I think the stone and the wand are both traps. Or at least I strongly suspect they are. Only the cloak is safe.

If he was consciously trying to screw over the brothers by cursing the items, it makes sense that the one Hallow that didn't seem to work that way was the one that had been a part of Death himself (and hence might have been difficult/inadvisable to similarly curse)...which makes the third brother seem even cleverer.

***** I think that's a fair insinuation. It was around the time that he murdered his wizarding relatives and used their deaths to make the ring Horcrux that he stopped using mundane things like the diary and the ring, and suddenly wanted huge and elaborate things.

That is also, by time, around when he seemed to lose all subtlety and tact in his methods, and lost any semblance of a reasonable or coherent goal. What was Voldemort trying to accomplish? Nothing, as far as we can tell. The only goal we know for certain he had was to inure himself against death, but with multiple Horcruxes he was already extremely safe, and going for the seven-part soul could have been done in total secrecy. Nobody would notice seven random and unconnected murders over the course of a decade or two. The grandstanding and megalomania are explicitly counter-productive. And more importantly, they are not traits Voldemort had before. He was entirely content to fade into the background and achieve all of his goals alone and in total secrecy. Why the sudden switch? Why would he start openly attacking citizens and flying some kind of skull-and-crossbones logo over sites of terrorist attacks he orchestrated?

At some point, he stopped being Tom Riddle and became what we see as Voldemort. And we were never given a good reason for why.

In canon, we were never given a real reason for any of this. Voldemort is a villain without a motive, and is a rather weak character because of it.

Most fanon assumes that he became unhinged because he made too many Horcruxes. And that's a fair assumption to make. That is probably the answer Rowling would give if anyone asked her to justify this.

But the timing of Voldemort's contact with the stone is terribly convenient, isn't it?

Dumbledore came into the possession of the wand, and was able to avoid the curse for a long time. But it did eventually catch up to him in the end. He did end up dying the way one would expect a bearer of the Death Stick to die: weak, trapped, betrayed from an unexpected angle (Draco, who he did not expect to disarm him). Not killed in any honorable fight, but executed.

Perhaps Voldemort is to the stone what Dumbledore is to the wand. He's a long holdout. He managed to avoid the immediate consequences, but his behavior became increasingly suicidal. He alienated as many people as possible, he acted out in ways that would get him killed, he put himself in the spotlight for no reason and dared the world to kill him. And after narrowly avoiding true death at the Potters, he doubled down instead of becoming more cautious. He even went so far as to torture and torment his own followers, practically begging someone like Lucius to assassinate him.

I don't think Rowling cares about justifying any of the decisions and choices she's made. But it's interesting fanon to suppose that the stone and the wand, and the curses they bare, are the broad scope villains of the big picture. The wand is what got Dumbledore killed. The stone turned Tom Riddle into Voldemort. The wand is probably responsible for the conflict with Grindelwald. Who knows how far back they could both go?

  Dumbledore came into the possession of the wand, and was able to avoid the curse for a long time. But it did eventually catch up to him in the end. He did end up dying the way one would expect a bearer of the Death Stick to die: weak, trapped, betrayed from an unexpected angle (Draco, who he did not expect to disarm him). Not killed in any honorable fight, but executed.

...Is it coincidence that his sudden decline and dishonorable death happened when he came across the Stone? Either from the Stone being more dangerous, or from having two Hallows in one place.

********** I guess? I mean, he was MoD, owner of all three Hallows, and they killed him. After that he abandoned the stone and buried the wand with Dumbledore (or broke it in the movie), and he survived just fine.

That said, the Hallows are largely ridiculous anyway. Especially the wand. Harry attacks Draco from behind when he isn't even wielding the wand and it changes allegiance to him, yet Voldemort flat-out kills Harry and it does NOT change allegiance to him. It's a plot contrivance that doesn't even make sense by its own rules. Therefore expecting the Hallows in general to make any sense is asking a lot. They, much like the Horcruxes and the prophecy sphere, are basically McGuffins to drive the plot for the latter three books because JKR apparently got tired of telling stories about actual magic.

  Because Harry's own parents, Sirius and Remus endorsed the idea of Harry going into that forest.
#+end_quote

But weren't the ghosts brought back by the Resurrection Stone only 'shadows' of their true selves? So they would try to persuade the person in possession of the Stone to kill themselves? My understanding was: Harry's family (in the forest) wouldn't really endorse his sacrifice with the ulterior motive that he survive, but instead with the assumption he would truly die.

I always thought that in the fairy tale Death was angry at being beaten so he gave them objects which while fulfilling the brothers' requirements would still somehow result in their deaths But maybe that was just a fancy interpretation of 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'.

It may well be that parents who have already given their lives for their child, who know there's an afterlife where they will be reunited, who are in fact watching and waiting for the day they'll hug their boy again, might have a different perspective on watching him similarly sacrifice himself to protect hundreds or thousands of others from torture, oppression, untimely death, and so forth.

They wouldn't want him to throw his life away, but giving it in the best possible way /and/ coming back to them? Doesn't seem like such bad parenting, to be happy about that.

********* i know you're not asking me but i think it's a bit of both.\\
There's this weird sense of "knowing" that all shadow forms of witches and wizards seem to have. Because thinking about the muggle caretaker who comes out of Voldemort's wand he seems shocked and surprised to be there and not really know what was happening but everyone else did...how? I think there's a lack of knowledge about how magic interacts with the afterlife (hence the department of mysteries and the death room being studied) because the shadows always seem to know more than they should as if they've been watching the entire time and seeing the events as they've unfolded like we have (as readers)

So back to your point ^{(i'm so sorry i ranted}) i think they knew that 1. harry's sacrifice would enact lily's protection and 2. that harry couldn't die because he was the unintentional horcrux. So their only goal in that moment was letting him know that they supported his decision and that he wasn't alone even if he couldn't see them they were still there.

*** In regards to Sirius, Remus and his parents I sometimes wonder if the Resurrection stone works properly.

Does it actually show you the person and let you converse with them as they would be or is there an element to it where the stone manipulates ten called person inot making death seem like a nice option. I say this because we only know of two people who use the stone and both proceed to die right after, so is it possible that Death made it in a way, if the story is true, that it will always tempt the user with Death.

**** All these theories are interesting. But as far as I remember, the thing about the Hallows is that they weren't made by Death, but the three brothers who were described by someone as truly gifted but also dangerous (can't remember who, maybe Xenophilius or Ollivander or even Dumbledore in the After life).

The first brother died because he gloated about having the most powerful wand in existence (yet someone cut his throat in his sleep) and took it from him.

The second brother died because he tried to get his fiance who had died young back with him, but noticed she was "sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil". If we go by that, the stone brought her spirit back but could not really bring her back to life, so he killed himself because he was driven mad by grief.

Then the third brother lived a long life because he was humble and prudent. But he still died at the end, the way it was supposed to be -- naturally.

So I think in the case of Harry, they were truly his parents and Sirius and Remus, but just their spirits or something like ghosts are described by Snape, I think: an imprint of how these people used to be but not truly them as if they were alive.

Not really shades though, because a shade would be more like what happened with Voldemort's wand in the fourth book. He killed them and the wand kept some kind of registry, if that makes any sense.

I'm talking from what I remember Dumbledore explained to Harry about that phenomenon caused by the Priori Incantatem. So those James and Lily, and even Cedric, Mr. Bryce and Bertha Jorkins were not truly them.

But I'm not about to reject the whole suicide part of the stone as a power. At least not completely. Because maybe it could be some kind of secondary effect if you use it for a long time, something Harry did not do. And he used the stone to get some kind of support, because he already had made his decision.

I think what made Harry different from Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Hallows part (though I think Voldemort didn't even know about the Deathly Hallows legend) is that he didn't seek power.

Dumbledore did in his youth and that was what ultimately killed Ariana, no matter who fired the curse that ended her life. And Voldemort even if he seemingly didn't have a cause, he wanted to be the most powerful wizard alive and evade death no matter the cost, because he saw it as a weakness. Remember how he believed his mother had been the Muggle one when he first started Hogwarts, because how could a magical person just die the way she did.

Harry, on the other hand, never sought power and he never ran away from death. In the end he even accepted it and understood that it was part of life itself.

Also I think we can't forget how Grindelwald and Gregorovitch died decades and decades after losing the Elder Wand. They were murdered by Voldemort who was seeking information about it. They didn't have it and if it were cursed in some way, wouldn't it have killed them when it was in their possession?
