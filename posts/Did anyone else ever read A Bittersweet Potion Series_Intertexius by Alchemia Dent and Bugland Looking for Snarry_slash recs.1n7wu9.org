It's by far my favorite fic of all time. It's Snarry, very angsty, dark, depressing, but amazingly well written. But of course it's been abandoned since 2007. I was heartbroken when I realized.

I did some snooping and found that the author's livejournal ([[http://alchemia.livejournal.com/]]) is still being updated every few months with posts about her life, etc. It seems that she and her partner (Bugland, the other author) are both chronically ill which makes it difficult to continue to write. She has stated, however, that it is /not/ abandoned, but on long-term hiatus until she finds the strength to update. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed. Just wanted to let you guys know, because this fic was extremely popular back in the day, especially among the Snarry community.

--------------

But anyway, I haven't been keeping up with fanfiction for probably about 1-2 years and would love some new recommendations. I love most slash pairings, including femmeslash, but my one true pairing is Snarry. I've read many of the classics: Cambiare, Tea Series, Civil War, etc. Still reluctant to start "If You Are Prepared," because I know it'll be super duper sad. I've heard it's absolutely fantastic, though.

So please, link me to your favorites! Even if I've already read something, I'm always up for a re-read.


** I left a list of recent Snarry fics [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1mn5si/ive_been_out_of_the_fanfic_scene_for_about_5/ccb7lr4][here]]. I don't know if you're familiar with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/102577?view_adult=true][Commonplace Magic]] by Acid and Sinick, but it's one of my absolute, all-time favourite non-magical AUs. Beautiful, beautiful writing. They've written some glorious stories, most of which are archived at [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org][www.walkingtheplank.org]]. It's the best of the Snarry archive sites since that's all they host there. AO3 has a lot of good stories, too.

I hope that helps!

** Have you read [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree by Philo?]] It's not perfect, with one plot twist I don't see the point of, but overall it's great Snarry with a powerful Harry, and a believable Neville Longbottom subplot that will make you swoon.

The second by the same author is worth a read as well.

*** I'm a little wary of reading it, the first chapter starts out a little too unrealistic for my tastes. But I will definitely try it, thank you! I've heard a lot of great things about it, so I'll will give it a chance.
