I guess I can post in this in [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] but I am writing one for HP (it is pretty difficult if we are being honest) and I figured it would be a bit more relevant.

Is it the OOC-ness, lack of accuracy, bashing?

Edit: if this isn't allowed, let me know and I will delete


** Well, there are some obvious turn-offs: bad grammar and spelling, too much or too little dialogue (some fics read like a stage script, while others read like a shopping list or an essay), and bad writing in general.

But what I look for in any fanfic - especially a Harry Potter fanfic - is originality. I really don't want to spend my time reading what is basically the same story for the hundredth time.

So, a writer can turn the magic system on its head, or introduce a pairing with little to no canon basis, or even have a main character who is totally overpowered and absolutely outclasses pretty much everyone in the setting - as long as it's original and the author /can make it work/, I'll likely read it.

If, on the other hand, it's just another "Harry is betrayed by everyone but finds out he's a Magical Lord" or "Daphne Greengrass is an Ice Queen who secretly likes Harry" story - nope, sorry, not spending my time reading that.

Oh, and it would also be great if the story was either finished or regularly updating - but that is usually too much to ask for.

*** Originality is a huge point that a lot of novice fanfic authors fail to hit. There are so many fics out there were Harry is slightly more competent and as a result just cruises through all of the stations of the canon with nothing else changing.

Change things up! Make it so Umbridge is still an evil bint, but she's not a blood purist and loathes Voldemort for the threat he presents to the Ministry's stability just as much as she loathes Dumbledore.

Make it so that Lockhart is still a fraud but he doesn't do it by obliviation. Or, make it so he's still a fraud like he is in canon, but he has enough actual skill to back up his claims that no one figures it out.

Really, the stations of the canon are a pitfall of their own.

** I dislike when romance is shoehorned in. Sometimes, characters just have good chemistry and romance happens. But sometimes the romance is forced which just ruins the whole story.

Also, it's annoying when writers don't make the necessary changes to make their plots work (or make unnecessary changes without explanation). If you want to bash Molly, then adjust her actions and the actions of those around her to better fit your plot. She's an interfering busybody? Then show that, and no, her keeping track of everything her kids did and giving them insistent 'advice' is not abnormal - it is very normal mom behavior. I actually found Arthur to be abnormally laid back, though maybe it's because Molly carried the weight there, which is unfair to her being the 'bad guy' all the time.

** Lack of accuracy is always annoying, but most of all, I can't deal with bashing, particularly any form of Weasley bashing.

Good spelling is a must. Especially getting words and names from the wizarding world right. I can't deal with McGonnagal or Virginia instead of Ginevra, or Fluer or Pavarti.

Write characters that, even though the plot diverges from canon, their personalities are at least somewhat plausible.

I am also very picky about pairings, so I will quit any fic that shows any hint of a pairing I don't like

** Short and simple. What turns me away most from fics are extended author notes that completely give everything away. I love to read author notes, but when you write almost as much as you did in the chapter and give away exactly what happens in the next chapter (not subtle hints) you've lost me.

** I look for canon-compliancy when it comes to magic. One of the biggest draws to HP for me is the magic system. I find systems that change it, to change it for the worst as well (magical cores anyone?).

I look for it to be a story. If the author is using fanfic to write a commentary about their beliefs (HPMOR anyone?), it's not a good fanfic.

I look for the story to remain consistently well-written with no sudden twists in theme. For example, Fate was a story about Ron, who got visions of the future and became a prodigy to fight Voldemort. Now, it's an angst ridden. The twist came suddenly with no warning.

I look for grammar. iF you're writin luks somethig lide thid, I'm not going to read it. No one expects perfection, but if you're going to publish something, take the time to edit it.

I look for interesting characters, premises, world-building, etc. Anything interesting is nice.

I look for original characters that are complex and serve a purpose.

I look for conciseness. Don't write 100,000 words detailing how Harry hates Binns.

I look for it being a good story that doesn't fall into the common pitfalls of bashing, too many tropes, etc.

Basically, I look for an HP fanfic written by someone who is clearly a fan of HP and has taken time to write a good fanfic. The fan of HP is especially important. I can always tell when the authors think they would have done a better job writing Harry Potter. Spoiler alert, they wouldn't have.

** I primarily read fics for specific ships, especially wolfstar. Sirius and Remus don't have much to go on for guessing their entire personalities, especially when interacting with each other, so I don't usually get turned off by OOC things. Overall writing quality and general adherence to cannon are the most important to me.

Also, if someone can find me a realistic Remus + Sirius raise Harry fic, I will die happy. I think I might have found all the ones worth reading.

** I like clever characters and good writing. There are some genres and categories that don't interest me (most crossovers, etc.) so I don't start reading them in the first place, but that's different from "turning away". Yesterday though I started reading a shipper fic that started out pretty good, but by halfway through it had gotten so mushy that I had to stop reading. Oh well.

** Generally, every fic that I read I tend to evaluate on 'the opener'. That's basically (depending on length) the first couple paragraphs or up to the first five chapters. A good opener basically sets up your story just enough for people to want to know more (ie. to ask questions about it - "I wonder why they're like that?", "How will that turn out?", "Wait, that did WHAT?") and then promises that if they keep reading, they'll get the answers.

That's what usually makes the difference between 'grabs my interest' and 'turns me away' first in a story. If it sets up too much detail (ie. no massive lore dump expositions of Harry Potter canon or AU info like I'm getting a ten-minute Star Wars title crawl), or doesn't offer up the detail it has in an enticing way, then I'll usually drop it. The actual specific detail doesn't really matter too much to me, but that's moving into the realms of personal taste rather than anything archetypally helpful to you.

Unless I've been recc'ed the fic and know there's something in later chapters that'll interest me. Then I'll usually forgive an uninteresting opener and keep going.

Later on, tends to be sudden drastic tonal or plot or character changes. Anything from 'suddenly, everyone at Hogwarts died!' to 'suddenly, Harry was a homophobe!' that turns the story from what was promised into the complete opposite is generally a switch off. Genre/Tone shifts can be done well and keep my interest, but that generally requires a level of writing skill beyond most of us here in Fandom. But yeah, if you promise fluff, don't suddenly turn it into Saw with no warning, and if Harry isn't a bigot, don't make him suddenly one. Growth and development is key. I'd also add sudden crossovers there too, but that's personal taste again. I've read too many "-and suddenly, Avengers!" fics.

Lack of Accuracy doesn't bother me because I don't know enough about canon to really nitpick like that. Fics in need of britpicking can be confusing if they use too many americanisms, but google solves that problem. My second favourite dictionary really earns its keep there (Urban Dictionary ftw). OOC-ness I can live with so long as its consistent or actually developed.

A lot of people will say good grammar and good writing are what draws them in, but I've not seen many people actually define what they mean by 'good writing' (that term is so open and relative that they could mean anything), so I can't really offer any insight there.

They'll also say no tropes, but they really mean cliches (which is an overdone trope we're tired of now) because a story without tropes is utterly impossible both by definition and sheer volume. If anyone can come up with something that isn't on TV Tropes already, I'll be incredibly impressed. :D

** There are many things, there are usually two points an author can pique the interest of a reader.\\
First there is the short description / summary, as an example if the summary already says "Sorry I have no idea / can't write a summary." then in 99% of the cases I don't look at it any further.\\
Yes, I usually read the summary before the title. What is the next point? Meaningful and / or interesting title for the 1000th time "Harry Potter and ..." or variants of it are not very meaningful.\\
The next nogo for me is Slash in all its variants (femHarry also falls under it for me), I have no problem if it is a side character or happens subliminally in the background of a side character. As an example "A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold" is one of my favorite fanfiction and in it typical vampires are more or less portrayed as bi.\\
I don't have a problem with that, especially since it doesn't define the story itself.\\
Which I think is the biggest problem with slash fics. And yes I tried to read some on recommendation. Most of the time I didn't get very far because of the problem it just doesn't correspond to my orientation.\\
Please no inquisition because i grant you your fics, please grant me my, I just ask all authors to label their fics with slash if they are.\\
Otherwise I give most fics a chance if they meet my first criteria. I read the first chapter. After that you can usually say whether the story is just a copy of something that has already existed and whether you find it generally interesting.\\
The pairing is also not so important for me, whether it is a Main or side character.\\
However, if something like Herminie / Draco is there then it must be justified in the summary because it makes no sense in connection with the canon.\\
To stick with it Herminie / Snape or the like makes zero sense for me and I would probably skip something like that.\\
And yes, Snape is not one of my favorite characters either and I don't understand why he is liked so much in fanfiction.

** I like to read new takes on themes/tropes/background characters. So if a story sounds as if I can already predict 9/10 twists from the description and tagged characters, I am not going to read that.

That being said, I agree with Impossible-Poetry that the magic system should not be fundamentally changed.

The story should also include at least 1 character I am invested in as a protagonist. You could write the best story about Draco Malfoy, Voldemort, Lupin and Snape, and I'd still rather watch paint dry than read that.

It should also not include any relationships I find infeasible or dislike. Which means no:

- Hermione/Death Eater

- Harry/Death Eater

- Hermione/any Weasley

- Harry/any Weasley other than Ginny

- Tonks/Lupin

*** Yeah I agree with most of the responses so far regarding good grammar, spelling, spell consistency, I am pretty open to ships if the story line is good and the ships are secondary. Like if it is a Harry centric fic but Ron and Hermione happen to be together in the background then I am okay with that. But alas, that is not common and ships seem to be central.

I started writing a fic am trying to figure out if there is a line with readers. For example if it a Hermione/Draco or a Harry/Hermione story, if there is any trace of Hermione/Ron will that turn the reader away?

If it's Hermione/Draco, I am not clicking that anyway since he falls under Death Eater. As for traces of Ron/Hermione, it depends. If it is more than "we had some UST, we shagged, we had nothing to talk about afterwards", I am not interested. Also not a fan of infidelity arcs (unless Draco gets cuckolded).

****** Yes, because that pairing nukes my suspension of disbelief. I mean, the average depiction of Ron/Hermione in Harry/Ginny fics is the reason I dislike R/Hr, but unfortunately it is also the likely outcome of that relationship since they have no shared goals or interests other than Harry and fighting Voldemort. I can't see their relationship work unless you make big changes to the characters, at which point you are writing OCs with canon name tags just for the sake of making a ship work.

** My favourite fanfics have a scene where powerful or complicated magic is cast. It's very compelling to imagine it in my mind's eye. Pretty lights an all. If an author is great at writing and verbose, it'll practically give me spine chills when they write scene involving epic magic.

What turns me away from a powerful Harry fic is if the author has no sense of majesty or originality, it's dull. It's just stupefy but like a lot more powerful, and both combatants are just gunning at eachother in a boring manner.
