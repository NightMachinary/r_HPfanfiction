  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** It's post Hogwarts and it's accidental, but he does manage to effectively resurrect his parents plus Sirius in linkffn(you did what! by nonjon).

Oh also note that the fic is the third part of a trilogy, so you might wanna read the previous two first: linkffn( Where in the World is Harry Potter? ; The Untitled Cheekquel Project )

There used to be a fanfic author by the name of Werewolf_Warrior who had published these two popular fanfics called "Dragon Lily" and "A Big Happy Weasley Family", but for whatever reason he suddenly deleted all his works a couple years ago and was never heard since. I came to know from some old posts that some people on this sub might find those works useful, hence I've uploaded them from the EPUB copies I had for you to read:

***** I agree with what you wrote here, but I don't understand why you are trying to weaken what [[/u/Sardonicest]] said. Fanfiction does not have to limit itself to "coming up with alternate explanations that might be plausible". We can just write an AU where Dumbledore never said that.

I honestly don't understand how you come to that conclusion. My point is that even without using the 'fanfiction' argument, the canon itself leaves the door open to resurrect the dead.
