Ok so, yesterday I was thinking about what would have happened if Harry was as Snape though he would be, something similar to Dudley or Draco. Do you know any fanfics with this ?


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14595594/chapters/33732771#workskin][Letter]], Harry acts just as Snape thought... a carbon copy of James/Sirius.

The fic is short and only 8 chapters, but it's definitely a version of Harry I haven't seen anywhere else.

*** I really enjoyed Letter, thanks for the rec. This is a very believable Harry in character, merging Sirius's influence with his own experiences. Pity it isn't longer.
