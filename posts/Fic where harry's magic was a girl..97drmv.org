Trying to remember something I read years back but can't really remember it.

The gist was his magic is a girl. Later on Harry finds out that his magic is wandless magic. I think Salazar Slytherin gets involved too.

I think there was a few chapters explaining how he couldn't do magic like the rest of them and was really good at it because he could just tell her what to do.


** Is it this one?

I think it fits what you are trying to describe. The Horcrux within Harry kinda messes up with Lily's protection to form a female companion trapped inside Harry

*** No, I just read it and it's defo not, and FUUUUCK that story, such a good idea and build up but the author gets bored on chapter 24 and decides to finish by chapter 25 with a complete bullshit ending. I'm not kidding, chapters 1-23 are great and it's all good, and then the author decides to cut it off, and has the fucking GALL to say shit like 'don't be mad for the ending, I had it planned for ages' bullshit he had it planned, the story had a BUNCH of subplot going on until he decides to just kill off Harry and end the story. I'm not even joking, he just ups and kills harry in a shitty fight in chapter 24,and spends 25 just saying how happy he is in the afterlife, and suddenly daphe has a teen pregnancy as a (and I shit you not this it what he said) 'consolation prize'. I don't even know if it's the same author??? I'd 0refer to think his account was hacked and that's why it's such a shitty ending.

Except is not really an ending is it, the story is called complete, but that's like eating a half-baked cake and saying its finished since you ate it. No. It's not been fully baked yet, even if you eat it.

Ugh, I'm just so poised at that shitty ending for a good story. It's hardly even and ending.

If you choose to read, stop at chapter 23 and just tell yourself the story was abandoned, you'd be doing yourself and the author a favor to ignore that shitty 'ending'.

Harry's magic was a girl in this one. I don't really remember anything else about it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.
