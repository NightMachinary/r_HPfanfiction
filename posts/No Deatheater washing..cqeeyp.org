[Request] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cpvue3/request_fics_where_mugglewank_and_martial_arts/][Fics where muggle-wank and martial arts get subverted hard]]

I mean fics where jumping around in a duel makes your spell work sloppy so you shouldn't do it.

Where it turns out guns are ineffective.

Please no death eater washing.

Also, this is a request thread. No arguing the prompt isn't canon.

    Harry was struck by an intense stench.

    A young blonde boy smiled at him. He was filthy.

    "The name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," he said.

    "Ugh, Malfoy," said Ron, "Take a bath!"

    Malfoy preened and sneered. "Of course you would say that. You're a muggle lover, Weasley. Everyone knows True Wizards never need to wash to preserve our natural magicks."

    He stared down Harry. "Join me instead of this washer, Harry. You'll soon find that there are some wizards are more of a right sort than others."

    "I think I can smell for myself who the right sort are, thanks."

      Ron had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open. A stinky boy and a girl entered. The girl was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes, which were smelling of roses.

      "Has anyone seen a skunk? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.

      "Nope, we haven't smelt anything," said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.

      "Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then. "

      She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

      "Er -- all right. "

      He cleared his throat.

      "Spearmint, Parchment, Grassy flower,

      Make this stinky, fat rat get a shower. "

      "What was that name he called Hermione?" Harry asked.

      "He - he called her 'Pureblood,' Hagrid," Ron gasped, in between mouthfuls of slugs. Hagrid's expression turned stormy.

      "What does that mean?" asked Hermione, her voice small.

      "Some wizards, like Malfoy, reckon that their blood is better than most. Thicker with magic, since they don't bathe, shower, use deodorant, shave, launder their clothes, brush their teeth, or use any beautifying products aside from hair gel," Hagrid explained, through grit teeth. "They call themselves Mudbloods, see - the magic in their blood is as thick as mud. They think anyone from a Muggle family's washing off their magic, so they call them Purebloods - pure Muggle ancestry."

        Hagrid combed his conditioned and gleaming hair back using a comb made of olive wood, the other hand skillfully creating a braid from his beard.

        "Of course, that's all rubbish. Even Dumbledore says so, and he's the cleanest wizard of all time, so if anyone knows, it's him. Don't listen to the malfoy lad, hermione, he's just sayin' what his father told him and his father told him before that. A load of old-fashioned rubbish, that is. Magic doesn't care about your appearance."

        With that, Hagrid tied the braid off with a small rubber band, its color matching the brown of his freshly laundered coat perfectly, and sent the kids on their way with some fresh rock-cakes.
