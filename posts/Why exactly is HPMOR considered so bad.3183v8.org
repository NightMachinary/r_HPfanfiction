** I don't think it's neccesarily bad, its entertaining but at the same time deeply flawed. However there were a few issues that The pacing was pretty terrible sometimes and the characterization was inconsinstent. Everyone besides Harry and Voldemort had no agency. Harry was too much like a Mary Sue etc

I'm on a phone so I can't go into too much detail bit the story is very much a first draft that has the potential to be good but isn't there right now.

*** I like it, but I also agree with everything else you mentioned. The author's compulsive need to describe everyone's reaction to a major event is ridiculous. A few times over, Harry is defeated by his flaw of thinking of others as NPCs, yet the story seems to agree with him by the way it describes events and things that are happening.

I also wish that there was a bit more action. It seemed like the plot, when it was moving was more than 2/3's plotting, and another 1/6 posturing. Would have liked to see more battles with constant thinking and tension. Harry having to think on his toes rather than planning a single action long in advance.

I think the dislike is probably directed towards the fans around it and the obsession people had with the story when, in my opinion, there are far better fanfics out there.

It peaks when [[/spoiler][Harry defeats the Dementor. I honestly don't remember much after that.]]

But it had it's moments. Just a shame the author couldn't get out of his own way.

The thing that got me to stop reading it was a fairly small inconsistency that doesn't bear repeating here.

** The first couple of story arcs are terrific, as most will agree. Around the halfway mark, the quality noticeably drops, and by the end it's just a pamphlet for the author's personal brand of 'rationality', devoid of character, plot, or humour. I honestly couldn't finish it.

Also, there were a few instance where the author asked for donations in order that he could take time off work to devote to the story, along the lines of 'if I don't get x money by x time, I won't be able to finish the story', which were widely interpreted as a sort of blackmail.

That said, the first half of it is definitely worth reading, and maybe if you read it all in one go, the early quality will carry you through 'til the end.

  Just like Grey became legal even though stuff in the book was originally said by copyrighted characters.
#+end_quote

The difference here is that E.L. James didn't try to make any money off of her Twilight fanfic. Instead she retooled the story to include original characters bearing no resemblance to the original intellectual property. Ebinezer Yanakovitz or whatever his name is didn't make that transition. If he reworked HPMoR into a new IP then he could attribute the quote (or not) to Character McOriginal and be fine. The fact that it comes from another person's IP /even without an attributed quotation/ makes it wrong.

#+begin_quote
  “Infringement” is a legal term for an act that means breaking a law. IP rights are infringed when a product, creation or invention protected by IP laws are exploited, copied or otherwise used without having the proper authorisation, permission or allowance from the person who owns those rights or their representative.

  All of these acts will constitute a civil infringement but some copyright and trade mark infringements may also be a criminal offence such as the sale of counterfeits *including clothing.*

***************** I'm sorry to disappoint, but there is nothing in UK copyright law that prevents original authors ownership over the entirety of derivative works.

#+begin_quote
  Permission.
#+end_quote

- Legally only the copyright owner has the right to authorise adaptations and reproductions of their work - this includes the making of a derivative work.

- The copyright owner is generally the creator of the original work, or it may be someone the creator has given copyright to (i.e. next of kin).

- Unless you are the copyright owner of the original work, you will probably need the permission of the copyright owner before making a derivative work.

Exceptions that do not require permission

- You will not require permission if the making and use of derivative work is carried out in a way that is expressly permitted in your country's copyright legislation:

- A typical permitted use would be within an educational establishment for the purpose of instruction and examination. Rules surrounding permitted actions are based on national legislation and will differ from country to country - please check you country's legislation for further details.

- If copyright has expired (under UK law this typically means the author died over 70 years ago), the work will be in the public domain, and may be used as a basis for a derivative work without permission.

- You may not require permission if the original work has a licence that explicitly allows the creation of a derivative work. The licence itself may also specify rules and conditions that must be adhered to.

Since JKR is still alive, and we're not operating within an educational framework strictly speaking she retains copyright and we're all boned. The fact that she hasn't done anything is a good sign and I think your acknowledgment of the insanity of such an outcome is quite right.

****************** That basically means that the creation of fanfiction is illegal should the copyright holder choose to exercise their rights. It says nothing about the original copyright holder gaining copyright on the novel content of (unauthorized) derivative works. The quote is original content created by EY that, placed on a shirt by itself, does not contain any of JKR's IP. JKR does not have copyright on it even if it was originally created in the context of a derivative work that was not (officially) authorized. As you pointed out, she could retaliate by exercising her rights over the content she does have copyright on, but I don't think there would be a legal basis for targeting the sale of the shirts directly.

  Provided it is significantly different to the original work the derivative work will be subject to copyright in its own right, and you will own copyright to the new content you have created as a result of your actions. Bear in mind that to be subject to copyright the creation of the derivative work must itself be an original work of skill, labour and judgement; minor alterations that do not substantially alter the original would not qualify.

  Any copyright in the original work remains unchanged; the creation of the derivative work gives no right to the original work being adapted. You cannot extend the duration of copyright in a work by creating a derivative work. If the original work is in the public domain, it will remain in the public domain; you cannot prevent anyone else using the same public domain work for their own purposes.
#+end_quote

Even if it's an unauthorized derivative, I don't see how you can interpret the copyright on the new parts of the derivative as belonging to the author of the original work. At worst I would think they would simply not be protected by copyright at all since the work they were created in was illegal.

** This is sort of a frustrating question for me. Overall I had a positive experience reading the story and watching the fandom that sprung up around it.

It uses writing strategies that I wish I'd see more often, including: actually writing from the perspective of other characters (as opposed to just using different pronouns and having information), describing truly intelligent characters, and devising plots and puzzles that the reader can actually solve^{1.} Sometimes the writing itself is beautifully crafted.

It's not perfect. A redditor took a stab at rewriting the early chapters to be more consistent with the tone of the later chapters. The result was fairly well-received by the HPMOR subreddit, so there's some room for improvement. HPMOR tries lots of things, and they're not all obviously compatible: for example, there's tension between Harry's demonstrated immaturity and the intention to teach the reader, often from what science Harry knows. (I don't think either failed; there are good things to be learned.)

So where's the fire? Lots of people heralding it as the most amazing thing ever tends to raise expectations. It's not a story for everyone, so some people will hear about it and be disappointed. Some [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3183v8/why_exactly_is_hpmor_considered_so_bad/cpz6ywr][people who write other things that I like]] will have mixed feelings about it, even.

If nothing in the story has made you particularly want to stop, and you're through about chapter 10, just go ahead and keep reading. Maybe the answer to your question is 'nothing'.

1: You should give yourself a chance to do so, although I imagine the temptation to just click through to the next chapter will be very strong.

** It is simultaneously blazingly popular and an example of outsider art -- a work not considerate of the fanfiction styles and little fan-fiefdoms already in place. Compounding in an annoying fanbase drawn from outside the HP fandom automatically makes it a target for die-hard HP fans and internet haters in general.

Still, it isn't anywhere near as offensively lazy and poorly plotted a monster as, say, /Harry Crow/. A similarly popular fanfic with many, many more problems in its prose. HPMOR is an easier target, though.

It discusses very involved scientific issues in unwavering, concrete ways, which gets the usual anti-intellectual reaction from people. Words like "arrogant" get used by those who can't come up with actual literary criticisms -- of which many could be made. It isn't put together perfectly and wavers in several places, falling back on cliches for major plot elements at sometimes unfortunate times.

In general, its biggest problem as far as popular opinion goes is fan expectations. Many look to fanfic for escape in formulaic emotional stories, not cold hard truths about reality wrapped in a fantasy story milieu presented by an outsider. More care could have been taken to make parts of the story less jarring for those with different expectations, but it wasn't designed from the beginning to be the breakout success it became.

It discusses "involved scientific issues" and then proceeds to get them wrong more often than not, which is annoying for readers who happens to be real scientists (which I am) and rather spoils the narrative.

"More often than not"? A rather strong yet vague and unsupported statement. I thought you said you were a "real" scientist. Not impressed.

HPMOR clearly doesn't get that much wrong. At most, it overstates and misstates a dozen or so issues throughout the entire story. Much of that because it doesn't spend /more/ time talking about the subjects and overgeneralizes. That would genuinely spoil the narrative in a story already longer than the first four Harry Potter books combined.

I didn't say it was getting those issues all correct. I was noting how they were /presented/, which is a flaw in the story in my opinion. Without having a MagicalScully to the MC's RationalMulder, we lose the effective tone and everything is as subtlly presented as a bat to the head.

You don't need artificial plot constructs to constantly contest HPMOR Harry's view of reality, you just needed a character to show the author keeping him honest. That would give the reader something to hang their own counter opinions on, even though most of what the MC says is backed up by reality.

So by not addressing my point, you admit you were overreaching and incorrect? Then you try to awkwardly smear me with the same brush? A foolish gambit, plus a backdoor false equivalency fallacy to cover up your overreaching statement. You are a poor scientist.

Am I wrong? Go ahead, you made the claim. Burden of proof is on you. Present a fair population sample of HPMOR statements of scientific fact, more than half of which are incorrect. Should be easy to do. Someone in that last thread about scientific failures in the series (that the author themselves posted) only had a dozen or so listed. Someone already linked it ITT. But you've got more, right? Unless, of course, that claim's not factually correct. /As I suggested was clearly the case./

******* Don't lecture me, cupcake. Not all of us have an indefinite amount of time to reply in detail to every online post and (now that I do have the time to respond properly to your a-few-posts-ago reply) if I felt I were dealing with anyone other than the special kind of overly excitable snowflake who goes apeshit/pedantic/ad hominem over a throwaway turn of phrase, I might well have walked back "more often than not," qualifying it more accurately as "frequently enough to be really fucking distracting for me, a professional scientist (and my record of posts as a subject-matter expert in [[/r/science]], [[/r/askscience]], and [[/r/askphysics]] more than establishes my credentials), distracting enough, in fact, that it spoiled the reading experience for me." But I don't. And I'm nowhere near OCD enough to tally errors in a story I wasn't invested enough in to finish.

I think I'm done responding to you in this thread, TLPG, and I'll let you have the last word (which I've no doubt will be entertaining). Moreover, I'll refrain from interacting with you in any future [[/r/hpfanfiction]] threads since I think that you and I just don't click on some fundamental level. I regard fanfiction as a fun hobby, not a thing over which I wish to invoke a lot of stress in my life. In particular, I don't enjoy interacting with people more interested in picking fights (for the record, slandering my professional qualifications over a post in a fanfiction sub is about as far from a measured response as one can get) and going "Gotcha!" than trying to work out what I really meant in a casual post on a tired subject on a casual sub. Contrary to the Monty Python sketch, I came here looking for discussion, not an argument. I get enough of the latter, enough needing to fret over every blessed word I write with my day job. I'd just rather relax when it comes to fanfiction.

As we part ways, I'd like to say that I honestly think you are a talented writer with an interesting and entertaining story going with your time-travel H/Hr story. I wish you the best of luck with finishing it.

I think you're right, but that's not the whole reason readers read fanfiction. It could be that they're seeking to alleviate the cognitive dissonance seeded by several foibles of canon. Or as an easy way to hone their own writing skills. Several Big Name Fans have also used it as a jumping off point for their own original fiction. I think you're painting with a fairly broad brush but I understand where you're coming from.

I made people read and think instead of posting the usual "me too" vanilla opinions. Some people hate that. So I get downvotes, mostly without further comment, reddit edicate be damned. As always, I love my little red cross. Better to me than +1 and no responses. Means I've made people react. I was explaining why HPMOR was vocally decried as "so bad" by explaining some sources of those reactions. Seems like I hit a nerve with some people.

As for my comparative references, I've actually read most of robst's stuff, and liked most of most of it. /Most/. Some story elements show odd disconnects, but overall he's a solid writer. That's why I don't get /Harry Crow/. It went seriously wrong part way, in both tone and plotting, and instead of heading back towards sanity it just started rolling around in it. I'm even reading his latest, which has red flags but is still fun to read. At least it hasn't shit the bed like /Harry Crow/ did. Yet.

There is a way to disagree with scientific claims of fact, and it isn't by throwing around insults or fallacious and emotional arguments because it uses big words sometimes. That's the anti-intellectual part, not the disagreeing itself.

If you dismissed it with transparent excuses because it intimidated you, then yes. You'd be a Luddite. But you're not, it seems. You say some parts didn't seem well connected to surrounding narrative material or plot? I think that's fair. You're not just saying it's arrogant and preachy, without giving reasons and with an unstated message of being intellectually threatened.

That's what I have a problem with. Idiots who want to drag down anything they find threatening. Someone calling it "elitist," for example, just boggles my mind. That word isn't a pejorative in this context. That's essentially saying you're not smart enough to get it, you know it, /and you don't like it/. That should be a shameful thing to admit out loud, and is certainly not something to blame on the story. And that happened ITT.

Certainly. But those are the types of people I see frothing at the mouth at HPMOR. It's also why I said "many." Not everyone reacts this way, but a vocal segment do. It doesn't tick the right boxes for them, intellectually threatens them, or stomps in and kicks over some of their preconceptions about fanfiction or reality itself, so it gets a really harsh and irrational reaction.

Ultimately, HPMOR's worst faults are in the novice writer areas, not in some insurmountable Mein-Kampf-esque conceptual garbage pile underlying everything.

***** I am quite certain that I heard this exact conversation in the common room of the dorms in uni after a few guys on the floor first encountered Ayn Rand. Seriously, swap /Atlas Shrugged/ with /MoR/, "collectivist" and "second-hander" with "Luddite," and it's the same discussion--including the "you're just too dense to understand these awesome ideas" dismissal of anyone who might disagree.

Didn't convince me then either.

In contrast, the author of HPMOR wrote some real criticism of Objectivism a few years ago.

******** Regardless of quality, anything can be criticized arbitrarily lazily. TimeLoopedPowerGamer identifies a lazy critique of HPMOR that's common, then compares it to more thoughtful critiques that can and have been made, including one from Eryr_Gwyn_Fanfic. Not all critics are accused of being anti-intellectual.

You've seen this defense used for Objectivism, and you side with the critic. Now the subject is HPMOR, but the conversation looks the same to you, so you favor the critic again. I imagine that in your example, a non-lazy Rand critique was attacked as though it were lazy, and the other guy even said the critic was "too dense to understand."

I don't think that matches the current situation: there are both lazy and non-lazy critiques of HPMOR. TimeLoopedPowerGamer has a response to the lazy ones.
