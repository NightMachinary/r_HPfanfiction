I know of only one that does it wonderfully with a Minerva gone young, though i forgot its name and can't find the bookmark.

But yea, is there /anything/ out there that is even remotely good. My quick search through fanfiction.net's filters got me nothing.


** Well there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][Forever is a Long Time]] where MaccyG gets de-aged. I think that's the one you're thinking of?

I also have a vague recollection of a time travel story which set up a Harry/Minerva romance in the 40s or 50s. It never went anywhere though.

Most of the rest is smut.

Exactly.

Thanks for the recommendation and no, this wasn't the one. Makes me excited to read it.

edit: Hmm... its not very entertaining, to be honest. Its just a retell of 4th year. Sometimes to the point of flat out rephrasing entire scenes.

  complete: To protect Harry Professor McGonagall relives her teenage years. What seemed like a good idea at first is swiftly becoming a bad one. This is a rather twisted romantic adventure that is sure to please. I think. Read Please:

*** I think you misunderstood me there.

While Harry McGonagall is a good read, its a Harry/Hermione pairing. I'm looking for a Harry/Minerva pairing. As odd as that might sound.

**** Ah, so I did - I thought about Harry McGonagall and just got too excited :p

I've not seen any Harry/Minerva pairings before and it does sound somewhat interesting so I'll be keeping a keen eye on this thread!
