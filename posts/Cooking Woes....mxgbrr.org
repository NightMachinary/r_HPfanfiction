A light-hearted prompt I thought up (woo for painkillers!):

Harry loves his wife/girlfriend/fiance. They are hopelessly in love with one another to the point where their friends complain that they're going to "catch diabetes".

There's only one issue: her cooking is awful; as in "eat this and you'll spend a week at St. Mungo's" awful.

However, she has such pride in her WMDs that he hasn't the heart to tell her, instead silently suffering, becoming increasingly creative in disposing of meals (as in Bender from Futurama styles of disposal), and quietly sneaking off to eat home-cooked meals at the Burrow.

Mrs. Weasley outwardly clucks her tongue, but she knows it's not her place to interfere. Plus, she loves the visits from Harry, so she's not complaining too much.

His significant other, however, is becoming suspicious: She may think he's having an affair or, more innocently, he's "eating on the side".

It could be Fleur, whose, ah, "creative interpretation" of French cuisine sends even her beloved sister into tears.

It could be Ginny, who didn't inherit the skills from Molly, and who unintentionally terrorizes her family as she muses she should cook for them more often.

Hermione, who sticks to the recipes in the books too closely, and she can't understand that her food is bland and somehow worse than mass manufactured meals. She's too stubborn to admit anything. Or, Sweetie Belle ("liquid toast").

Tonks or Hestia, whose idea of cooking is slapping together instant meals from a muggle microwave or kettle but somehow even fowling those up.

Padma, whose attempts at coking traditional Indian meals end up being spicy to the point of being toxic: Parvati, whose food is surprisingly bland and inedible.

Katie, who tries to make traditional Scottish cuisine. Yeah, enough said on that, hah.

Daphne, whose attempts at "high society cuisine" would make hardened Death Eaters weep for their mothers.

Cho, whose attempts at Chinese fusion cuisine make Klingon food look appetizing.

Lisa Turpin, whose attempts at Mongolian and other esoteric cuisines cause constant magical mishaps that Harry has to deal with.

Hestia and Flora, who literally have to battle their unintentionally animated creations when Harry isn't looking ("Steamed clams" -- cookie if you get that reference!) in the kitchen, pantry, et cetera.

Luna... oh man, the chaos she'd create unintentionally, and Harry doesn't want to do anything to make his Little Moon upset... Nargle pie and 'Heliopath' Surprise, come to mind.

Susan lives up to her namesake, and when she isn't looking the chicken and other roast meats with bones come alive to attack Harry.

(An older) Gabrielle, who likes to liberally use alcohol in things; apparently she has enough veela in her compared to her sister to make alcohol consumption very ineffective on her; however, she can't eat avocados, apples, or (much to her horror as a Frenchwoman) anything in the onion family (leaks, onions, shallots, garlic). People begin to think Harry has a drinking problem, but he does such bizarre (and useful) shit while half-cut, they're torn between saying something and not saying something.

Go nuts, haha.

...This could be an amusing part of a light-hearted, more humorous marriage contract fic: his wife-to-be tries to show she'll be a great provider for them both and their future kids.


** Parvati being immune to her own spices I can buy. Hestia and flora having to fight their food before serving is hilarious. Gabrielle cheerfully getting Harry drunk of his ass is genius.

On the other hand, Ginny, Hermione, Daphne and Cho remind me too much of lame anime plots. If their cooking is just bad, they should realize they are poisoning everyone the moment they try their own food.

**** She cooks every day her world-famous freshwater plimpy soup. One can only have so much freshwater plimpy soup... ideally never.

***** Alternatively, Luna may be an excellent chef, seeing as her mummy dying would have meant Daddy Xeno would be cooking...leading to Luna learning how to cook out of necessity.

** Does she pull out a mallet from who-knows-where and bludgeon Harry with it whenever he insults her cooking? Possibly while screaming out "Harry you idiot!"?

It's a funny concept, but this is an */ancient/* anime fanfic trope. I'm talking Ranma 1/2 ancient.

** Luckily Harry is not married to Hannah, who in true spirit of being her uncle's niece, only knows how to cook dishes whose names consist of a combination of soup, house and leaky.
