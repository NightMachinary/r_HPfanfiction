:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a book that's kinda Snape's POV. He sees harry stealing a bar of soap from detention and after that it all unravels. He finds out that harry steals "trash" (almost empty toothpaste, floss with like an inch or to left, the bar of soap) He whatches harry hide food and soon he gets harry to tell him about life at the Dursley's and how his aunt and uncle didn't send him anything he needs to "keep clean" how he has no toothbrush or tooth past (I dont think he has a brush) he has to use broken things for school because he doesn't have the money to replace them. Snape finally looks past the "son of James Potter" and sees Harry a boy who is in clothes three times too big for him.


** Did you ever get a response to this? I see there are none on this comment, but I thought you might have gotten one elsewhere. (I know I saw this request at least twice.)
