Krum, because Rowling is bad with ages, is an old 7th year (18 in the summer of 1994 according to Goblet of Fire and Pottermore), who despite being decent to Harry, dates a 4th year 15 year old Hermione.

Hermione has quite a bit of criticism about her, mostly from how she treats others.

Is there any fic that criticizes them both?

*** It may be because I'm going after Krum as well.

Seriously, I've had so many people try to convince me in my other thread he was 17 or that Hermione was 16 during Goblet of fire.

**** 18-15 doesn't seem that bad tbh. Most sensible places have Romeo and Juliet laws that minimise or waive statutory rape punishments for couples that are close in age and where consent seems freely given despite one member being underage (INB4 MiNoRs CaNnOt CoNsEnT! I'm just referring to the conditions the laws set for this). [[https://definitions.uslegal.com/r/romeo-and-juliet-law/]]

And really they just went to a ball together and wrote some letters, that's really nothing to get upset about, unless your name is Ron Weasley and you haven't consciously acknowledged the crush you have on Hermione.

I think the relationship was just a way for Rowling to show to the reader and to Ron that Hermione was a girl and, Harry's non-attraction notwithstanding, was quite a catch.

***** They did make out though, and were presumably dating during 4th year.

It's not the friendship that bothers me. I like quite a few aspects of Krum as a character, except for this. It's that this gets handwaved away.

It's that it's really creepy. Not 40 year old male, 12 year old girl creepy, but someone at a different level of maturity taking advantage of a less mature person.

The age gap is 4 years. That's not really a huge difference IMHO. Krum isn't portrayed by the writing as taking advantage of Hermione, or pushing boundaries with her. He's respectful and affectionate whenever they're seen together. So I'm not too fussed about this personally, but that's just me.

Teenage girls often do date boys who are years older than them, and I think Rowling was very true to life in this regard. Whether it's an advisable thing is another story.

******* We'll agree to disagree. I do think Krum has great aspects. He's very humble and protective of Harry.

Krum is a good otherwise character and had Hermione been a 5th or 6th year it wouldn't bother me.

I did get triggered on the other thread more by incorrect citations of their ages.

********* It's admittedly in a very murky area. It might not be illegal, but as you said, the question is where it's advisable.

It's terrible when it happens. Quite a few people tries to convince me Krum was 17 and this one person kept trying to say Hermione was 16 at the yule ball.

** I think this may be both a generation and regional thing. I'm Harry's generation (born 1980), and I'm German. In my teen years, having a boyfriend who was a couple of years older was absolutely normal. Not normal in the way as 14-year-olds getting married in the 1800s-normal, but really just completely unproblematic and fine. Consent was a big thing, so was sex ed in school. Boys were a bit more immature and girls more mature, so 2+ years of an age difference made perfect sense. Many of my girlfriends had older boyfriends, and I would not think of any of them being somehow coerced or pressured, or the boys as creeps.

To analyse why things are handled well and beneficial for youths here as opposed to, say, the US, would be an extremely complex topic. I have some thoughts on that issue, but it would take forever to pin it down. And I'm not sure we're not also experiencing an "Americanisation trend" here, today, as well. There's a lot of dehumanisation, sexism and objectification of women and girls happening lately, globally. While there are more laws protecting women today than 30 years ago, things feel like they have gotten a lot worse. Like the mentality of men (and sadly young boys) has shifted towards treating women like objects, feeling like they're entitled to them and them granting them sex. And then there's a hyper moralism on the other end, and I think it's rather making things worse than improving them because it takes away agency from girls and women and makes them more of a subject to be protected and shielded from evil men, which then again becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and enables the men to act shitty.

So, yeah, as I said, complex topic. Whether a 14/18 relationship is problematic depends A LOT on the social circumstances.

*** Well said. This has to be the best dissenting argument I've read in a while. You approached it from an angle I honestly didn't consider.

Krum wasn't even bad (you see him concerned about Hermione and Harry), but it does depend quite a bit in societal norms. He's from Bulgaria, which I have no clue about.

I do disagree with the whole difference in maturity thing though. While girls do enter puberty earlier, life experiences up until that point pretty much even out. A couple of years isn't that weird even nowadays. I haven't been in high school for quite a while, but so long as the person wasn't 14, 2 years wasn't unusual.

Quite a bit of my issue is that it wasn't just a couple of years. It was 3-3.5 years. For all her vaunted maturity in canon, barring grades, Hermione was at the exact same stage as Ron and Harry emotionally. Krum was an adult (18 and a bit) well-adjusted Sports Star.

It does have some ambiguity. Krum might actually have an excuse of it not being unusual, but on Hermione's end, she's a child by any viewpoint in the UK. Whether was right or not is often irrelevant. While you get those extremes with hyper-moralism and hyper-objectification, I was approaching this more from the age difference.

One is the equivalent of 9th grader (14-15 years old) and a 12th grader (17-18) who is even older than usual (18 in the summer).

Thanks for your viewpoint though. I'm hoping I sound a bit less harsh on them both.

**** I disagree on your take on age and maturity. The average person at age so-and-so might be at a specific level of emotional maturity, but there are vast differences between individuals. Hermione is very mature for her age, and most of all, highly responsible. She is not easy to manipulate or would do something reckless. She's not naive either. Ron, on the other hand, is extremely immature in many ways. He had a lot of growing up to do before being a match for Hermione (and even then many fans argue it wasn't a good one).

As real life examples go, I'm always thinking of this one couple I knew in our clique. She was 14 (nearly 15), and he was 18/19. Sounds wrong on so many levels, but it was a really sweet, consenting and responsible relationship. When they started dating, they took their time with everything, were cautious and safe, and both really happy with each other. Eventually, after around 2 years, the girl broke up with the guy because he was too immature in her eyes. In Germany, such relationships are in a legal grey-zone, depending on consent, on the parents being okay with it, and so on. If someone had reported them and it had gone to court, child psychologists would have determined the case thoroughly and - I'm very sure - come to the conclusion that it was alright.

And then I saw 16 or 17 year olds (legal age of consent in Germany) who were really immature and careless in their relationships, slept around, got into potentially dangerous situations, did drugs, nearly got pregant etc.

While I hate this argument being used by old creeps, age /is/ just a number in many regards. Some kids are mature enough to make their first romantic and sexual experience at 14, 15. Others aren't even mature enough at 18. It depends on too many individual factors to put it in a category solely based on a number.

***** We've got quite a bit of evidence for and against Hermione being the most mature in canon. But since we're using the subject of relationships, let's use that.

Hermione dates Krum in book 4 and parts on amiable terms with him due to distance and other factors.

Hermione also sends birds to attack Ron when she after she sees him having fun with Lavender at a party and brings McLaggen (who she confunded to help Ron, because of her crush) as a date to spite Ron.

Harry breaks up with Cho over her insecurities over Hermione and Marietta. Wasn't the most well done, but they ended up being amiable.

Harry and Ginny date, then he breaks up to protect her. Very well done, and possibly my favorite scene of Half-Blood Prince.

Dean, Ginny's ex, does not hold a grudge in deathly hallows.

Ron, possibly the worst, goes after Hermione for dating Krum because he has a crush on her during the Ball, dates Lavender to spite Hermione for making out with Krum, and tries to get her to abandon the mission (while under the influence of a Horcrux) because he's insecure.

Oh yeah, Harry and Ron are meh with their dates at the yule ball.

Harry ends up looking the best with relationships.

Age might be just a number, but it's a very useful number.

*** 3-3.5 years is quite a bit at that age, especially with one of the participants as a legal adult. Just because it isn't illegal doesn't mean it isn't wrong. They made out according to canon when they were together.

They're at different stages of life. Krum may be a 7th year, but he's canonically older than that (born in summer of 1976 compared to September 1976 to August 1977) Hermione is a 15 year old girl. Their relationship is inappropriate by most societal standards.

And just because it's legal in Scotland doesn't make it right. If they went to meet her parents in London, the laws are different. I can legally drink all I want at home, but I don't.

If Hermione were a bit older or Krum a bit younger, I wouldn't care. But high school freshmen do not make decisions like that.

** It's still 16 in London. It's still legal in London. This isn't America. This is Britain. Have you ever been to a British school? Because, we have much bigger age gaps. The average age gap in Britain for a couple is 4 years. Had Hermione been 13-14, I would've seen this as more of an issue. However, by the time they start making out, if you consider her use of the time turner, likely hood is, she is most likely already 16.
