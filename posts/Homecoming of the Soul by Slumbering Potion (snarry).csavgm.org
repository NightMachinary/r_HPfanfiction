This may be a long shot but I was wondering if anyone had a copy of this fic. It's been taken down offline and sadly I can't find it anywhere. Any help would be amazing!


** It's still available on the Wayback Machine, although I didn't check to make sure that every single chapter was represented:

*** Unfortunately, that links to a dead end. The author must have requested that it be removed from Fictionhunt.

**** Aww, I suck. I'm sorry! It looked promising, but I'll admit I didn't bother looking to see if it was a full story.

You must be right, the author had it removed.

***** Nah, you don't suck. Fictionhunt is a pain in the ass anyway, because it scrapes stories out of ff.net without the authors' permission and reposts them. Basically it archives creative content whether the writers agree to it or not.

...and by damn, there are two of my fics on there. I thought I'd managed to have them all taken down. Time for an email to the archive manager. At least they're cooperative about deleting fics if the writer finds out and requests their removal.
