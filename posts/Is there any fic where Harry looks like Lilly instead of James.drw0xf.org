#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Several, but they're all fem!Harry stories. Except for Harry Potter and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl Who Lived, where Harry is physically male but under some weird curse that makes everyone magical perceive him as a girl... and keep saying how much "she" looks like Lily.

Other than that, I got nothin'.

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
