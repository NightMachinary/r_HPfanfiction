I would like fics set after probably Ron Weasley dying or Arthur Weasley dying . Basically fics where people who are not dead in the original books dying in fanfiction


** Well, BajaB once wrote something like this for a one-shot challenge. One character who died in canon lives, one character who lived in canon dies.

It's short, but here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4106581/1/Death-of-a-Nobody]]

** My first fanfic took place after Arthur died. I expanded on Vows by starlight.moon.princess on FFN. It's not all that great as I look back on it and it's not complete, but I may revisit it. I don't know how to put a link through mobile but it's titled "Learning to Cope Without Arthur" by WeasleyObsession on FFN.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
