Why does Rowling hate halfbloods? Because CLEARLY halfbloods aren't deserving of a kind and loving family. Don't believe me? Here are the five main examples:

Harry-Lost parents, lives with emotionally abusive relations

Snape-Abusive father

Umbridge- hated her mother so much she had to lie and say she was a pureblood

Tom-hated his father so much he had to lie and say he was a pureblood (then he killed him)

Albus-lost his sister mentally through bullying, his mother from his sister's uncontrollable magic, his father to Azkaban, and then his sister again physically through the fight between himself, Grindlewald, and Aberforth.

Jesus Christ, is it such a task to make them happy, Rowling? Damn.


** We can probably add Seamus to the list too.

*** Dean doesn't know who is father is, so he was always uncertain about his blood. His mom is definitely a muggle though.

Edit: in DH chapter 15 he says “Not sure...my dad left my mum when I was a kid. I've got no proof he was a wizard, though”

**** Rowling revealed that Dean's father left to avoid his family getting caught in the war and was later killed for not joining Voldemort.

***** Ikr? Tryna think of a single person who had a good life in Harry Potter is impossible. Because y'know... WW2, then two consecutive civil wars.

In fact, pureblood families experienced all three wars, so they arguably had the worse trauma to their families across the years.

Draco Malfoy? Pampered as a kid, but also... Dark family, Voldemort, and unloving terrorist dad.

Ron and the Weasleys? Lots of dead family members.

Susan Bones? Parents are super dead.

Neville? Well shit man everyone knows Neville had it rough.

Sirius? Family is full of dark terrorist supporters, he's disowned, his whole family dies, and that's not even touching the maurauder drama.

**** It is not mentioned in the books but Rowling said halfblood in an interview as a compromise since she had thought of Hannah as a pureblood but had written muggleborn on the classlist that she showed in a documentary.

** Happy characters aren't generally interesting characters and since blood purity is one of the driving issues with the antagonists, it makes sense that a lot of the important characters in the books would be affected by it.

** There are a lot of problematic subtexts in the canon which I'm sure Rowling didn't intend to be there. They perhaps say more about her subconscious thinking than she would want to admit. Don't go looking for those things, you'll drive yourself mad.

** I think she likes those characters a lot because all (well, not Umbridge)of these characters have the most (tragic) elements of her life. It's also realistic in a fantasy world where most wizards hate or severely infantalize muggles and those of muggle descent, and most muggles despise magic despite even knowing it exists it makes a lot of sense that those with one foot in each world would have a harder time of it.

Harry gets her birthday . Also J.K Rowling has said her mother's death shaping the Harry Potter series in theme and plot. The saintly dead mother that saves the child's life from beyond the grave with her love for him.

While Tom Riddle doesn't share a lot of aspects of the author he does illustrate a lot of the writers philosophies on life love and death. Also his story arc showcases her contempt at the institutionalization and abuse of children, which her charity Lumos combats.

Her experience of abuse (domestic violence and sexual abuse) is a recurring theme not only in HP, but The Casual Vacancy, the FB film series, and Cormoran Strike books.

This is also the case with most of the father figures in the series being abusive, flawed or dead . This is reflecting of her tumultuous relationship with her father (they only reconciled recently, he sold a personalized draft of HP for 10K pounds) Arthur Weasley is one of the few good men in the Harry Potter series (and JKR has said that is why she changed it so he didn't die in OoTP like planned.)

Albus Dumbledore is basically the Voice of the Author. He says all of the lines that are basically J,K Rowling sharing her thoughts on a subject.
