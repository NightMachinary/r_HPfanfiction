The head title says most of it

Also if it does have a pairing then harmony or haphne

Long would also be nice :)

Thanks if you can meet the (imo hard) requirements


** linkffn(10382653) ... not sure what's the pairing, if any.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily

** Quite a few wrong BWL follow a similar theme. You should check out some of them. One of them is something along the lines of “Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw.”

** That actually sounds interesting.

​

In my opinion Lily would be smart enough to know "No Body = Not Dead" and might start training Harry in wandless magic. Lily is supposedly one of the most intelligent characters of her generation so it wouldn't be surprised if she has found a way to survive with her son, like a compulsion on her nursery floor in a runic array making someone use only stunners or suffer greatly. With Voldemort really wanting Harry dead he will be able to cast the killing curse at him and his body will still be destroyed.

​

Another thing I think is that Lily would be smart enough to test him for any cursed magics, dark magic, residue magic, etc. and hire the goblins to purify him. Thing is, when hey discover the Horcrux they might sense that it isn't the only one and the goblins would decide to move the 'parasite' to another object before purifying it and using a 'wholesome' ritual which merges/fixes all parts of the object, both physically and metaphysically.

​

I'm now thinking about writing this... INSPIRATION RULES! Thanks for the idea. Is it okay if I make it be an x-over with Hunter-X-Hunter in terms of Magic being 'like' Nen? I love the rule system of Nen and, in my belief, Nen is pure life force combined with aura. Magic is a minor form of aura.
