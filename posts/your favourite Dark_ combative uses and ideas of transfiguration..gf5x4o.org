So I have seen some pretty cool uses of transfiguration in combat with animals or animated objects. One really cool story which I forgot the name of had Harry learning Grindelwald 's method of human transfiguration on his enemies. But I feel like it's still under used: it might be interesting to use to make prisoners harmless, it might be a pretty cruel way of killing (everyone jokes about turning people into toads, but I doubt most of the victims off such a thing would live long enough to find a nice safe well to survive in until a princes comes to safe them), it might also be a solution to the whole immortal Voldemort thing (I did think I've seen that done at some point) but why not incapacitate the guy as a tree or a cute bunny while taking care of the horcruxes.

So what are your favourite uses of transfiguration in fanfiction? Do you have any cool ideas you'd like to see used?


** The Unforgiving Minute has some /great/ examples of using Transfiguration in combat.

linkffn(h[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][ttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]])

Beyond combative uses, The Art of Self-Fashioning is almost entirely about Transfiguration as a magical discipline.

** One of the best (worst?) ways that I saw transfiguration used was that Voldemort had captured Remus Lupin and transfigured him into furniture. It was just like when Slughorm did it to himself when Dumbledore and Harry visited him, but Remus was unable to wandlessly reverse it and he was still aware of what was happening. He was forced to watch as Voldemort tortured Harry. Harry escaped because he always does, but he later realized that Remus was there too and it destroys him that he left his friend behind.

** For whatever reason, ff authors completely ignore Transfiguration in fights and stick to expelliarmus and stupefy shit.

Something that I once saw was an HP summon a huge amount of water and imprisoning Tonks inside a water sphere prison and proceeding to wave a sparking wand in front of her.

Raising earthern shields from the floor can be considered transfiguration, I guess. Same with conjured stuff to block incoming spells.

Some stuff I'd like to see is using transfiguration to hit enemies from behind - transfigure giant fists or something and smack them from behind (or anywhere else).

And yea the earthen shield thing makes sense. I've seen it done with either transfiguration or conjuration in order to block unforgivable curses.

That really bothered me in the fantastic beasts movie (on to of everything else in the movie) when Grindelwald fights all the American aurors by using a shield charm even though they're known to use killing curses.

Protego Totalum and Horribilis are definitely stronger variations of the basic Protego spell. You could say that they're the same spell, just a better variation, but I was specifically talking about Harry using only the regular Protego against Voldemort, who could just use a Killing Curse to rip through it.

Salvio Hexia is also a stronger, area of effect shield.

Perhaps I wasn't clear in my wording - the regular shield charm only deflects minor spells, making it a basic shield.

#+begin_quote
  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx,
#+end_quote

If it can only deflect minor curses, it is a basic shield. A more advanced shield should be able to deflect/shield against more advanced spells. That was what I meant.

If offensive spells can have tiers, why not shield spells?

******* Salvio Hexia is a protection charm of some kind, but it's not a shield as far as we know. And as you say, Protego Totalum, Horriblis and Diabolica are all variants of the Shield Charm.

The Shield Charm doesn't only defect minor spells. When it is introduced in GoF, that's all it can do because Harry isn't very good at it.

But as he gets better at the spell, we see his Shield Charm get significantly stronger. By the later books, Harry's Shield Charm is blocking spells cast by powerful individuals such as Bellatrix, Dolohov and Snape. Similarly, the Shield Charm is the defence of choice cast by Order members such as Lupin and Tonks when they are attacked by Death Eaters in DH. It's also the charm Bellatrix uses to defend herself in OotP.

There is no limit to what the Shield Charm can block as far as we know - with the sole exception of the Killing Curse.

Additionally, we have seen the Shield Charm used to block physical objects, mental attacks, to reflect things as well as to block them, we've seen it placed on objects, or cast like a wall on spaces (Protego Totalum). It's clear, I think, that the way the Shield Charm is depicted in the books is the universal shield which wizards use, which is flexible in /how/ it can be used, and which can be either very weak or extremely strong, depending on who is using it.

There /are/ other defences wizards can cast, of course. But those spells do different things. Flame freezing charm for fire; impervious for projectiles, physical shields like Voldemort's silver shield in OotP for the Killing Curse.

What we /never/ see in canon are multiple spells which have the same effect but with different levels of power. This is because the nature of the HP system is that spells do not have a fixed power, but rather power is determined by the magical ability of the person casting the spell.

#+end_quote

The line I quoted was about how the spell was supposed to perform, not how it actually does when Harry is practicing it (because his attempt fails quite easily). I'm going to go out on a limb and say that that is the textbook definition of the spell, seeing as Harry is practicing with Hermione, who likes getting the theoretical aspects of the spell down on her way to mastering the spell.

If the textbook definition says it can only deflect minor curses, then it can only deflect minor curses.

It's far more likely that Rowling forgot about that one line (it is just one line, it's not as if there's a huge text block behind it or anything) or just decided to change the spell itself and decided to make it an all-purpose general shield that can do anything as long as the caster is sufficiently powerful, even if there are specific spells for those specific scenarios that you described.

Also, having one general all-purpose shield charm when each and every single spell has a distinct counter-spell feels unbalanced.

#+begin_quote
  What we never see in canon are multiple spells which have the same effect but with different levels of power.
#+end_quote

Expulso, Bombarda, Confringo and Reducto? (Yes, only two of them are in the actual 7 books)

They're all essentially the same spell with varying degrees of power. Reducto is used in the DoM to make shelves and spheres explode, and Confringo makes the bike's sidecar go boom in Book 7. They're essentially the same spell.

Same thing goes for Diffindo and Sectumsempra. Both of them have the same effect, albeit in vastly differing power/area of effect.

Also, Episkey and whatever spell it is that Snape uses to heal Draco. Episkey is a three syllable word, while Snape sings the spell to heal the lacerations caused by Sectumsempra. Both are similar spells, used to heal cuts, but again with differing areas of usage.

Again, for Evanesco and whichever spell Lockhart uses to remove Harry's bones from his arm.

********** Protego Diabolica is not mentioned in the books. It is the weird Fiendfyre/shield hybrid spell used by Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 2 in the finale. The spell is not named in the film, but the official released screenplay calls it Protego Diabolica, so the name is canon.

If you didn't see the film, it basically works like this:

The caster summons a ring of hellish dark blue fire around himself. It will burn anything and anyone except people who are 100% loyal to the caster, who will pass through the fire unharmed. The spell somehow detects the malicious intent toward the caster and burns to death those who try to deceive it. The caster may release the spell, and it will run around like regular rampaging Fiendfyre and burn everything.

It sounds like it was ripped from fanfiction, but that's what we saw in the new films (which are also canon).
