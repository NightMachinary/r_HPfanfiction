I've never come across any good Wood stories and just wandering if there are any out there!


** Order of Mercy has a fantastic Oliver Wood character in it! It's not the main focus of the story but he is quite prominent and very well written.

There is also this story called Full Stop which features Oliver Wood and Alicia Spinnet.

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...
