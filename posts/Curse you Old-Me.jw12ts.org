Going through my old stories and trying to repost them with better writing a solid outline in mind and a concise but eventful 4-5K words each. Then I go to work on a chapter that I already had an initial version for and say to myself "This shouldn't take long, I recall not much happens in this chap". Then, I open the file and notice that the initial version has 9.7K words.


** Can I read it?

*** It's not done yet. So far I have reduced 9.7K words to 8K.

It's a second chap. First one (Ron POV) ended in Dumbledore and first year Harry appearing in the Burrow after some major discovery by the Weasleys. Then, as I was reading the chap2 draft (in Harry's POV), I realized I was almost 4K words in and Harry hadn't arrived at the Burrow yet. My older self thought that for some reason it would be a good idea to write almost 4K words of Dumbledore picking up Harry from the Dursleys.

***** I actually have a story entirely on Ron's POV, he's the man! This one is more like a 4 POV thing.
