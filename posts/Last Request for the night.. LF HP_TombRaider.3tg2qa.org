** Here you go linkffn(10659456) /Harry Potter and the Sun Queen/. It is Harry (roughly 3-10 years post war) interacting with the events of the recent (2013) TR reboot, simply titled /Tomb Raider/. I'm enjoying it immensely. It's written by Steelbadger, an author or the highest quality. Seriously, read his other stuff /A New Man/ or /Shadow of Angmar/. Most of it has a gritty feel to it. Except /Elves Most Fabulous/, it's hard to believe that is from the same author, but there it is! *EDIT*: /Elves most Fabulous/ is also a good read. Also Steelbadger is active on this subreddit so they may chime in.

#+begin_quote
  During his exploration of the history of the magical Far East, Harry Potter finds cryptic references to an island Kingdom called Yamatai, supposedly ruled by the powerful Sun Queen Himiko until its sudden disappearance millennia ago. He never was able to pass up a good mystery.

There are a very few on ffn. Can't vouch for the quality.
