:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Has there ever been a fic where instead of Ginny, Percy was the one who received Tom Riddle's diary? I have this vague recollection of reading something like this. I find the idea of it quite fascinating; imagine Percy's ambition and drive + Tom's charm and cunning :o


** I feel like they would just get bogged down in never-ending, increasingly pretentious arguments about political philosophy and the state of the pureblood in modern society. Just pages and pages of paragraphs, getting more petty with each other as time goes on.

**** I remember having a plotbunny where Tom managed to get out of the diary in a non-evil way at the end of CoS, then gets to do his NEWTs. He befriends Percy and they just end up being massive nerds constantly.

** I did read one that was interesting and I'll try to find it for you. Percy was not the main character, but he was important. It was something about the Rise of the Three Lords? Harry was a grey Lord and a Ravenclaw I think and Percy after going through harsh trials after the diary becomes the light Lord.
