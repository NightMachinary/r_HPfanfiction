Does anyone know if Shaydrall is still writing? There hasn't been an update in about a year and a half.

Kinda sounds like you've answered your own question, there.

My general approach is to assume everything is abandoned. Even if it updated yesterday.

*** Should we assume that your latest fic is abandoned then? I'm still checking daily in hopes for the next chapter :(

**** It is abandoned until I update next (which I expect to be within this week), at which point it will be abandoned again until the update after :p
