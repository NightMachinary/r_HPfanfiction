:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think this fic was on FF; I read it about two years ago and it's AU in which Voldemort wins, Harry is dead and what's left of the Order is in hiding. Hermione is captured and Voldemort gives her to Snape who it turns out is still spying and a part of the underground resistance, although Hermione is not aware of it at first. I remember that it was a slow-burn, and I remember the ending ( hopefully I haven't mixed it with some other story) where I think Ginny polyjuices herself as Harry in the final battle and defeats Voldemort... Does anyone have any idea which fic is this?
