Special forces Harry (SAS or SBS preferred since he is a Brit) or nitty and gritty, army!Harry. While hiring muggles from the military is fine, it's not what I'm really looking for.

This idea has been sparking up for after playing Rainbow Six Siege a good bunch as well as reading “The Sniper” by DobbyElfLord.

I don't know why this is idea isn't as popular as others out there. It feels like more people prefer creature!Harry than military!Harry for some reason.

** I remember reading a+n unmarked+ crossover fic between HP and NCIS, where Harry was stripped of his magic +at the trial before his+ fifth year. He lost his magic, but ends up developing a mysterious power where he can control the weather.

I struggle to remember the name of the fic right now, but I believe he was +SAS+, and his file was so heavily classified (everything but his name and birthdate was blacked out) that the director of Mossad becomes kind of obsessed with finding out why. I also remember that it was largely set during the conflict in Iraq in the early 2000's.

*Edit:* Right, I actually found it: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim]])

Just had to look for Ziva. Not the best of fics, imo, but was fairly entertaining. Turns out it /was/ marked, he loses his magic at the end of fifth year not before the beginning, and he's RAF. I haven't read it in a while though, but I was actually thinking of giving it another shot anyway.
