I would like Gamer!Harry fics with Tomarry as the pairing but I'm not opposed to Gen fics either.


** Gamer!Harry is code for “abandoned within 6 months.” I've never seen one get past the second year of Hogwarts unless it started later than that.

That being said, there is one currently being updated called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death by Elsil). You can also try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley) for a different kind of “gamer” fic, without Harry as the MC.

As for Tomarry, I can't help you, slash isn't my cup of tea. You do you, though.

** My favorite is Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game). It might be abandoned sadly but it's very good in my opinion.

** The Game is an Non-magic au, but does include tomarry. I've read it tons of times and still enjoy it. Sadly the fic is incomplete. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8366987/1/The-Game][The Game]]
