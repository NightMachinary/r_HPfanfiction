I have two parts to this post, a *Request* and a *Discussion*.

So, as the title implies, my *Request* is for *fics where politics features as more than an offhand mention one time*. It doesn't have to be a purely political fic, even a tangentially political thing would be cool - it doesn't have to be all West Wing or whatever, I'm perfectly happy with it being just a minor subplot. And any character can be the one doing the politicking, and they don't have to be good at it. :)

Also, a *Discussion* - what are your *thoughts on the usual Political Party naming system of 'Dark', 'Light', and 'Neutral/Grey'?* Or the fact that there are *only three Parties* in this system?

It isn't something I'm a big fan of, personally. Yes, real world parties are called various descriptivist things like The Liberal Democrats and The Green Party, but we also have The Labour Party or the Monster Raving Loony Party and whatever UKIP is going by these days. They aren't just called 'Left', 'Right', and 'Middle', y'know? Like, the Blood Purity party might be called the Heritage Conservationist Party or the Magical Sanguinist Party or something slightly more euphemistic than the in-world term for Evil. :D

*If you have or have seen any ideas for alternate names* you particularly like, please do feel free to provide and chat about too. This isn't writing research, I'm just curious what people think.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I despise the Dark/Light/Grey naming conventions. Nobody ever thinks of themselves as a villain. (Nearly) every horrible act was done out of selfishness ("I'm just helping my friends!"), short-sightedness ("What do you mean the easily foreseeable consequence happened?"), and ignorance ("Can't predict what I don't know about!"). Nobody is saying, "Oh, because I am so very eViL I will kill the puppies!" We are all the heroes in our own story.

That said, if a fic is written well enough, I'll grimace through it.

** I love thinking about the Politics of the Wizarding World.

There's things that are pretty cheesy like the whole "light" and "dark" names but I can understand why people would fall back on those.

Personally I enjoy thinking of "dark" side in differing terms, as the "Traditionalists" or the "Conservatives" if you're feeling brave. There is always a divide between the moderates and the extremists, on any side of an agreement. "Traditionalists" and "Purists".

It's clear that Hermione for example in the post war Ministry would be a "Progressive" it in extremist terms. but what do you call the moderates? Those who aren't all keen on Pure Blood values but who think Granger might be going too far?

Politics is complex and to divide it into 3 simple factions of "light, grey, dark" is a disservice, but coming up with answers and replacements isn't an easy task.

This is my head cannon for those old families who joined up with Voldemort at the start of the first war for example.

A group of Pure-Blood Families who fear the even encroaching path of progress. If you're a Black, a Malfoy or a Flint in the early 70's you are seeing your whole way of life disappearing before your eyes. The backlash after the fall of Grindelwald has pushed forward muggleborn rights, you've seen a Muggleborn Minister of Magic, even Squib Rights marches in Diagon alley.

Who speaks up for you? Who defends your past and your future? No one. The most powerful person in Britain is an avowed muggleborn rights "light" progressive who is all but being begged to take up the Minister's job. Your desperately looking for a champion, or soon even your Lordships will be taken next. But all these old families are proud and stubborn, there was no way a Black could bow before a Malfoy, or a Rosier kneel at the foot of a Parkinson.

So when a charming, intelligent and powerful man steps forward claiming to be the heir of Slytherin, claiming to believe and defend all you hold dear, of course you leap at the chance. And while the methods make the back of your neck itch its all for a good cause, if a few muggleborns and half-blood need to die in the progress then its a price you're willing to pay.

Then Lord and Lady Bones die. Then Evan Rosier and the Heirs Prewett. Suddenly you look around and surrounding you are no longer the noble and proud Lords of magical Britain but sadists and madmen who care only for the blood they spill. When Voldermort orders the whole McKinnon line killed its too late to back out, branded like cattle to a Dark Lord who has done far more damage to the Pure Blood lines than any Squib rights march ever could. All that's left is follow his orders.

Sorry for the impromptu story, but I think about Wizarding Politics and the first war far too much.

*** No need to apologise - I love a good detailed answer, especially one with narrative, and I'm the same way about the 'mechanics of worldbuilding'. Politics, culture, society, ecology, geology, tectonics, climate, it all fascinates me. :)

Heh. Yeah, naming is hard. I criticise, but I'm definitely not any better at coming up with names. I run D&D games and I once named the ruling family of a town 'Redmond, Bertrand, and Miranda Waterslide'. And that's not even the worst name I've created. :)

I think the trick to naming political parties though is to think about what they stand for. What they actually believe in. Nobody actually believes in neutrality - even the current outbreak of "Yeah, like, I'm a 'centrist' now" in the US is mostly motivated by dislike of the two sides, rather than any particular appeal to middle-of-the-road policies. Like, they might believe in magical balance, or they might be libertarians, or be focused on world-trade economic matters than internal conflicts, or whatever else. As with most things, you follow the whats whys and hows 'til you get something interesting. :)

** For my fic, I decided on a multi axis system, there are traditionalists, centrists, liberals, progressives, but also aristocrats, meritocrats, bureaucrats, and democrats, so you are defined by your method of gaining power and you stance on issues. For example-

Lucius malfoy- aristocrat traditionalist

Dumbledore- meritocrat progressive

Amelia bones- bureaucrat/aristocrat centrist

Cornelius fudge- democrat liberal

*** That's fun. Fits the mindset of some fics too - Wizards more often 'take' power than are given it. It'd be a good 'background design' tool for political fics as well, even if one didn't use it directly in-world - it gives a good summary of the kind of policies and decisions each of those characters would make.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) and all its sequels dive pretty in depth into politics.

And if extremely powerful and provacative eleven year olds don't bother you than I would recommend Linkffn(Protection: The Sword and the Shield). It has a fully fleshed out peerage and magic system but most of the political stuff happens after the end of the first book. (The lemons can be found under the same title on ao3)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
