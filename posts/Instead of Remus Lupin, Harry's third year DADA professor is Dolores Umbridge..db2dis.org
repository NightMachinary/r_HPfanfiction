The premise; at the end of Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Dumbledore deduces that Tom Riddle's diary was in fact a Horcrux, but not his only Horcrux, and Voldemort is therefore still 'alive'.\\
Dumbledore announces that Voldemort is highly likely to be alive and planning his return, a claim only (seemingly) bolstered by Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban. But, as per canon, Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort could return, and sets about like he did in year 5, smearing Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet and keeping a watch on various people aligned with him.\\
And, of course, he issues an Educational Decree to put Dolores Umbridge in as DADA professor at Hogwarts, at the same time that Sirius Black is running around and the dementors are posted at the gates.

...Yeah, there's no way this doesn't end in disaster. No Lupin to ward away the dementor on the train, Umbridge is unlikely to teach the Patronus to Harry, the event where the dementors all 'attend' the Hufflepuff/Gryffindor quidditch match...


** In conclusion, everybody dies. The end.
