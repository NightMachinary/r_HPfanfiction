Or any story where the Wizard World is just... bigger than it is in canon. Or at least feels bigger.

Does that make sense?

Maybe there are more wizards, or less muggles, or no muggles at all. Maybe wizards are known, and they sort of coexist and influence regular society. Maybe wizards are treated as some kind of elfish equivalent, idk

*** As I understand it, High Fantasy=epic world alternative to our own, often with a dark lord ruling over the land. I'm saying /ideally/ I wanted something High Fantasy, but I'd /settle/ for Low Fantasy with a more prominent (/bigger) magical world.

**** The Wizarding World, as you word it in your original post, implies that it still exists in the context of Earth. That, inherently, is Low Fantasy, and as such, directly contradicts the title of the post.

'Alternative World' does not mean "Earth with some differences." It means you're going to a place that doesn't resemble Earth in the least. It also has to have 'internally consistent rules' that differ from that of Earth.

Harry Potter is an exploration of Wizarding Society inside of Earth as we know it and the world follows the known rules of general human life. It is, be definition, low fantasy.

What you are asking for in the text of the post is certainly possible to explore, just categorically it would be Low Fantasy and not High Fantasy. Epicness and what not is irrelevant. It has to do entirely with the style of the world created.

Remember, A Song of Ice and Fire is still considered 'Low Fantasy' by many because of how similar Planetos is to Earth, the general focus on Humans and Humanity, and the De-emphisization of typical High Fantasy tropes.

Harry Potter is probably quite unique how it mixes and juxtaposes high and low fantasy tropes. Unicorns, wizards and giants in a very low fantasy world, that is built around mundane bureaucracy and government.

****** A lot of more modern fantasy does that. It's a very post-modernist trait in my opinion. Other authors, like Neil Gaiman, Jim Butcher, and others do similar things. It's a very 90s fantasy movement. It's not really very unique. Blending fantasy into a more realist school of literature has been quite popular for going on three decades or so now.

***** No, I get it, but I'm looking for either/or. Either High Fantasy (completely AU, different world) like I said in the title OR a Low Fantasy setting (like canon) but with wizards occupying more of the world, like I specified in the description.

**** Hmmm... So you just want an AU story that doesn't take place in the "real world"? It's difficult to discern what you actually want... Or are you just looking for long stories?

** In linkffn(The Fight for Rights) (also on Quotev with more chapters), the world is a lot wider and more magical, with lots of fantasy species living in various parts of the world. The muggle world still /exists/, but is rarely seen.

EDIT: Good lord! Bad bot! That's obvious not that one! Fine, here's [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights/1][the Quotev link]].

  In this this work for a more mature and politically minded Powerpuff Fan, the girls explore intersectionality in the face of a terrifying new threat. Rated T for adult themes. TRIGGER WARNING: some mild violence and discussion of abortion.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I think this fic fits (If I am interpreting what you mean by high fantasy correctly), although it does take a while for it to really get going. It does have lots of worldbuilding and feels very epic fantasy-ish when it does though. It expands on magic in general, has lots on werewolf communities and their lives, explores fairy/magical races, vampires. Wizarding britain is separated from the muggles but it feels quite large in comparison to canon. It really builds the magical worlds of Britain, Germany, France and Europe in general. Incorporates politics and does makes the wizarding world seem bigger.
