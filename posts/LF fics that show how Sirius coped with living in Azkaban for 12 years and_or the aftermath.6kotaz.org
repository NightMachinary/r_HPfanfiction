Are there any stories out there that show Sirius's state of mind either during or post Azkaban? A lot of stories have him break out of Azkaban and then he's fine with little to no aftereffects, but I'm looking for something that gives an accurate portrayal of how messed up he is after all he's been through. I'd prefer something from Sirius's point of view and canon compliant, but I've been having trouble finding anything well written and in character so I'll take what I can get.


** Sirius is absolutely my favourite character, and 90% of the fics I read are Sirius-centric (the other 10% I read 'cos I heard they had good Sirius bits in them). This is a real problem and one of my major pet peeves. However, there are two standouts.

linkffn(A Feast in Azkaban) uses his time in prison as a frame for memories of his earlier life; some sections are POV of the dementors and some of Sirius himself. An emotionally exhausting fic, but very good.

linkao3(Padfoot's Tale by picascribit) is the first part of a three-part series by picascribit; it is explicit slash Remus/Sirius. Sirius' part covers from 1981-1994, Remus' part is part two '93-'94, and then the third part covers the latter part of 1994 and focuses quite heavily on Sirius' recovery and their attempts to resume their relationship.

Of other fics, linkffn(The Promise by ZairaAlbireo) and its sequel are notable. In The Promise, Sirius is very focused on his goals, but struggles a bit particularly towards the end of the fic. His issues are much more apparent in the sequel; however, it's incomplete and abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  1981-94: From the unbearable torments of Azkaban to a life on the run, Sirius has known little peace in twelve years. But when he comes to Hogwarts looking for Harry and Peter, he finds Remus, the man who could break his heart or save his life. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Sirius's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.

  How did Sirius Black Spend twelve years in Azkaban and come out relatively sane, when others in his situation went mad or died of despair in a matter of weeks? Complete, now in chapters, mature material, SBRL slash, but mostly gen
