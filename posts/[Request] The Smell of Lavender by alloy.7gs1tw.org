I had read this fic ages ago on TQP I think. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an intact existing copy anywhere else now that archive is dead. There's a version on ff.net that only has a couple chapters, but iirc the one on TQP had over 20 chapters. If anyone has it downloaded or knows where to find it, I'd be super grateful.

** Also, there is an "Alloy" as an author on AO3, but I don't know if it's the same one. A lot of TQP stories were posted to AO3 by the archivist person.
