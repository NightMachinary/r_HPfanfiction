#+TITLE: Any suggestion of a fanfic where the order of the Phoenix or the Dumbledore's Army read the Deathly Hallows?? I would prefer if they are reading it in the seventh book itself (like, for example, the order read the book after the chapter of the wedding) but everything that you have will help ^^
