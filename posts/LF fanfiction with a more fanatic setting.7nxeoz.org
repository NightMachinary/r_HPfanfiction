for example:

Harry believes in the same ideology as Grindlewald (Might Makes Right). Any other more fanatic approach is also welcome, aslong as he just doesn't blindly side with Voldy/Dumbles.

** I've always thought that Grindelwald was for a mix of wizard rule over muggle and meritocracy.

Besides, «might makes right» isn't really and ideology.

*** As far as I understood it - he thinks that those with power should rule those without it. Blood didnt matter. He didnt care if you were muggleborn or pureblood. As long as you had the magic to proof that you were superior to the (filthy) muggles, you were his kind of person. And in the end it comes down to - he is the strongest, thus he has the right to rule. (shrugs, maybe our ideas are going to get rekt by the upcoming movie?)

**** What I mean is that «might makes right» is basically the governing principle for any monarchy and dictatorship.

I like to think that even if Grindelwald thought that magic makes superiority, he would still believe in meritocracy.
