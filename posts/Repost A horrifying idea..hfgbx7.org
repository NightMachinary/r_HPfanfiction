I'm giving this one more shot, courtesy of [[/u/CallMeSundown84]]. Any more death threats and the like and I'm gone, and this story returns to the ether.. I'm really in no mood for it.

<EDIT>

Sorry for overreacting.

--------------

Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed through the portrait hole, Harry looking glum, Ron looking more worried than anyone had ever seen, and Hermione looking quite put out. They took a spot with a good view of the fireplace.

Fred, George, and Lee all looked up from their little huddle as trio came in. Fred and George exchanged a glance, nodded at once, then turned to Lee. “Excuse us,” said Fred, as the twins stood up. The twins walked over to the trio.

“Harry, Hermione, ickle Ronnikins,” said George.

The trio barely acknowledged him. Harry looked up briefly, then went back to staring at the fire. Hermione barely glanced at them before got back to staring at Harry, with worry and annoyance warring on her face. Ron just grunted, not even acknowledging the diminutive nickname the twins had just used.

Fred and George exchanged another glance. After a long moment, they turned back to the trio, and Fred opened his mouth. “What's got your broomsticks in a tailspin?” He asked.

“Trelaweny,” they said unison, though their tones varied, matching their expressions.

“Death predictions?” Asked George.

“The old bat,” Fred added.

They were greeted with another round of minimal acknowledgement.

“Who was it?” George asked.

“The old bat,” Fred repeated.

The trio shared their own glance. Finally, Harry looked up and said, “Me.”

“Well don't worry about her,” said Fred, ruffling his hair. “She predicted mine two years ago, but I'm still here.”

“The old /bitch/,” said George, matching Fred's earlier tone.

*** I posted this before. It actually got a lot of upvotes too, but all the comments I got on it were almost exclusively negative, the mildest being something along “you ruined my day”

**** While I don't mean to assume anything, I did happen to see the original thread and I think most of the “you ruined my day”-esqe comments were trying to say that “this was so well written and evokes feelings of sadness that genuinely upset me”. A compliment. These type of comments are pretty common responses to sad!fics. That being said, I thought your story was very well written.

****** Ok that's totally my bad for assuming, that's horrific. Did you report the last person?

While I still believe these people meant to give you a “compliment” by saying that your fic was really good at bringing up sadness, the way they went about it was horrible and you've got a right to be annoyed.
