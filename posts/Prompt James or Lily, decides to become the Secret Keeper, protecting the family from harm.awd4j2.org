I always thought it was odd that James or Lily didn't try to become their own Secret Keeper, it would have made the most sense; imo. I mean wasn't Bill his own Secret Keeper at Shell Cottage? So in theory James or Lily could become their own secret keeper. It'd be a lot more simpler.

No worrying about a possible traitor, no putting friends at risk, et cetra.

No Harem Harry No Hermione/Harry or Draco/Hermione No Weasley Bashing No Seer Luna Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash Other then that, go nuts with it. Feel free to post any stories that have this idea, or write this idea and post the first chapter of it, when you have the first chapter up.


** It's just a stupid plot device to advance the plot, just like all those TT fics where the time traveler decides to "preserve the timeline".

Honestly, the first thing I'd do if I found that my son and wife were targeted by someone like Voldemort would be to leave the country and then go to a far off place, like Australia or New Zealand. Screw everything else.

** You can explain it away with either a) the Fidelius Charm couldn't do that in 1980, or b) the Secret Keeper can't be the original owner of the Secret.

The Potters owned the Potter cottage, so James or Lily had to pass on the "Secret" to Peter. They couldn't pass it to themselves, because it was already their secret. Sirius owned Grimmauld Place, and he passed the Secret to Dumbledore. This would also explain why the Order moves out when Sirius dies; if the ownership of the house passed to Bellatrix, then the Fidelius would fail.

As for Bill, this is where the theory falters a bit. We do know that Shell Cottage belonged Bill's aunt. It's possible that she could have been still considered as an owner of the cottage (Secret) and therefore passed it on to Bill. Though this does raise the question on why Lily and James didn't become Secret Keepers of another home and just move in there.

** I can't think of any stories which have this, but I've always figured that the Fidelius doesn't allow for one to be their own Secret Keeper, and Bill had managed to improve on the Fidelius in the 16 years since Lily and James used it.

*** The fix I use for it is that the fidelius works off of trust. So, having your SO being the secret keeper wouldn't be as strong as having someone you don't quite trust as much. I essentially just think of it as putting the secret keeper as yourself is the equivalent of setting a password to "password." What it does mean is that finding the right secret keeper is paramount since it's a balancing act.
