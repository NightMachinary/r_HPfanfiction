So a lot of fics someone being suspicious of another person and they ask them a question to confirm their identity. I was wondering if there is any fic where that actually works and they found an enemy in disguise.


** That challenge question is used so wrongly in most stories. They always ask something that is usually publicly known, or something someone can figure out if they spent any kind of time studying the person they are impersonating. To top it off, they always shout out their answer.

If you're going to use a challenge question it must something really obscure or so private that only the asker and the asked would know and the response must be given at a whisper as to not be overheard.

Challenge question: "What was the last question you asked me last time we saw each other?"\\
Challenge response: "I asked you if Malfoy used an engorgement charm to make his trousers appear fuller then they really are."\\
Counter challenge response: " You'd have to ask Goyle cause I've seen him sniffing Malfoy's pants"

***** I doubt you care but my dreams always seem to feature Lucius Malfoy. And in said dreams he's aged up because if JKR can fuck with numbers so can I. Anyway (I'm aware this makes no sense) he's celebrating his 50th or 55th birthday and his kids are planning it. He has 3.

Darling: 35 (teen dad Lucius. Mother died in childbirth or it could be Narcissa's kid. It changes every dream)

Dante: 25 (always Narcissa's kid)

Draco: 15 (Narcissa's kid of course)

Anyway they're throwing a full on bash. And anyone who's anyone is invited. So leaders of vampire clans, who every runs gringotts, etc.

I'm talking veela strippers. Pools around for people that need water to live, or just like it.

Booze everywhere.

But they're giving out sex toys.

Why? Because everyone wants a piece of Lucius and Narcissa wishes they could just fuck themselves.

So the three kids design sex toys and give them out at the party.

By the way, Darling looks like Nataliya Kuznetsova to me. I don't know why but she's always a female bodybuilder.

** Not exactly on point but there is a story where someone accidentally ingested veritaserum and responds to a random question and admits that they used polyjuice to look like someone else to commit the crime that the alleged perpetrator was punished for. The story is called Expelled by Broomstick Flyer.

Linkffn(5010827)

I do recall one story had a scene where a bad guy was almost caught due to not giving the proper answers but someone else interfered before the identity could be confirmed. The story is called Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.

**** Spoiler

At the Yule Ball Tonks meets fake moody and realizes that fake moody had failed to give the proper challenge responses after she gave him the correct openings. She goes over to Harry to check the Marauder's map that they were updating. It showed Fake Moody as Crouch but they weren't sure that was correct. So they "rebooted" the map and it showed Fake moody as moody. What they didn't know was that dumbledore knew crouch was moody and when he saw that Tonks knew something was up dumbledore ran out of the ball to the ward anchor/stone to change it so it showed crouch as moody.

  bergamot [ber-guh-mot, -muht] (noun): a small citrus tree, Citrus aurantium bergamia, having fruit with a rind that yields a fragrant essential oil. While Earl Grey tea never was quite Tonks' favorite, there's somehow always a cup to be found somewhere as she tries to get to know Remus a little better. Moments from Remus and Tonks' relationship from OotP through end of HBP.
