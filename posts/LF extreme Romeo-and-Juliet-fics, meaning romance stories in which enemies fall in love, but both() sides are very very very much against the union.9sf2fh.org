Pretty much what it says in the title, if there is an understanding friend, it can be everyone but please not Harry or Hermione. Bonus points if neither are part of the main couple either, but it is okay if they are.

The key here is that I want to read something in which it is really a "You or everybody else" kind of situation.

Slash is fine, as well as massive homophobia as the reason both parties being against the union.

The only thing I really do not like are big age differences.

Thank you!


** That ends in double-suicide?

*** Okay, you'll probably hate me after this, but since it was started some time ago, I dare asking: Does the writing change? There are a lot of repeated mistakes in first chapters, I am honestly a little confused that your beta did not see them.

**** No, I don't hate you for asking that. I'm definitely flawed when it comes to grammar. I got a much better beta ( [[/u/denarii]] specifically ) after I had posted some chapters and he's much better at catching my mistakes and keeping me in line. Also, I like to believe that I've become a better writer in the years of writing it haha I'm told by long term readers I've improved
