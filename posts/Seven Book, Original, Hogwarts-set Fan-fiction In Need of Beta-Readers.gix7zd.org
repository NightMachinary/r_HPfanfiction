If, like me, you finished Harry Potter and felt a void inside, wishing you could relive the experience, then you understand the motivation behind these books. I want more Harry Potter, but I also want fresh characters and stories. Re-reading the series is always a treat - but I want something new. I decided what better way to get a new Hogwarts story than to write it myself? If also, like me, you are looking for something to fill your time during lockdown, look no further!

Bagsy Beetlehorn enrolls at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she will meet friends, enemies, and dangers untold. This is a Harry Potter-Style tale, following Bagsy and her friends as they navigate their seven years at Hogwarts. I plan on writing seven books in total, and have currently written three. The first is 70,000 words, the second 80,000 words and the third is currently 150,000 words though I aim to edit it down.

I am hoping for some passionate beta-readers to join me in this project and help me bring Bagsy and her story onto fanfiction websites for everyone to read, and to bring a fresh Hogwarts experience to those that want it most (myself included).

I would be grateful for all kinds of beta-readers - those that care mainly about grammar and spelling, those who like to edit plotlines, specific scenes, or those who prefer to read the whole thing and give general feedback. Any and all feedback is precisely what I am looking for - you can approach the beta-reading of this story in whatever way you wish.

If you wish to beta-read send me a message and I can hook you up with the first few chapters of the first story, 'Bagsy Beetlehorn and the Thorned Gauntlet'.


** Sounds like a brilliant idea.

It would be my first time doing it. But feel like would be able to help out.

** I'm really tempted to get to know your story but... I'm kinda also drafting a Hogwarts-set fanfic series and I'm rather insecure that I'll start comparing my writing and plot ideas to other people's lol
