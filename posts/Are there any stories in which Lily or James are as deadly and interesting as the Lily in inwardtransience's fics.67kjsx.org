Both "the long game" and "to reach without" have a Lily that is borderline Mary-sue'ish - so the representation is not without its issues. But, at the same time, the lady is ridiculously awesome and fun to read in both, so the mary sue'ish stuff doesn't bother me that much. What I really like is how that gaping plothole left by canon about a mother's sacrifice is filled in by making Lily a ridiculous prodigy. It's especially fun to read in the long game, where she's alive and training an interesting, to say the least, fem!Harry. And even in To reach without, with its excessive angst, she's still fun to read about because she provides a listless Harry desperately trying to cope with the Dursley's abuse a sort of inspirational figure to motivate him out of his fugue state, that's kind of baffling in its absence in canon.

So, are there any other stories with interesting and deadly Lily or James (or Sirius)? (Note, I'm looking for stories set during Harry's time period, not the marauder's, though time travel or alt. uni stuff is perfectly welcome.)

** Lily in the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs is pretty awesome. Should probably state that she is dead though.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** Haha I'll share mine,

Trelawney is cursed because divination is a serious branch of magic, but lying binds your powers and makes you magically and mentally diminished. Divination allows the discovery of truth, being able to see through enchantments and find hidden things

Voldemort is snatching up all the known seers, trying to raise the hidden and sunken city of Atlantis, where some magical artifacts and knowledge are hidden which he needs to gather more mainstream allies to govern his empire. He has already installed a shadow governor in Ireland, where magic is much more wild and the wizards there constantly war with the Fae.

The magical population is bigger then in canon, and most people lack magical power enough for formal school, only the nobility and the gifted attend Hogwarts, and having a title means real responsibility

** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) Lily is incredibly magically and chaotically powerful, which fem!harry inherited. She works at the ministry at an unspecified position (possible unspeakable) and is well known for her abilities in magical Britain. In Harry's third year she debates Lord Riddle about muggleborn rights graciously and passionately at a ministry gala, rather annoying him with her good showing. Lily does have issues with controlling her magic and wears a suppressor to make it more manageable, so she's not taking the world by storm like in The Long Game, but Harry feels closer to her than to James.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3126551]]) Lily survives, but James doesn't. After waking up, she walks into Azkaban and frees an unjustly imprisoned Sirius, and then takes steps to protect her family. Incomplete.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8379676]]) oneshot. Lily kills Voldemort with a pistol after he murders James, and deals with the adulation while mourning.

Braving Azkaban, denouncing the most powerful wizards in Magical Britain, fleeing to France, and hiding her son's identity are only the first steps.

  When Voldemort came to kill Harry, Lily met him with a SIG Sauer pistol she bought at a pawn shop. Seems Dark Lords die as easily as anyone else when you empty two clips into them. Hailed as the savior of the Wizarding world, Lily has a live baby, a dead husband, the personal enmity of most of the Dark Lord's followers, and not the slightest idea how to put her life back together. Phoenixes have it easy. Burn, die, rise from the ashes. For humans it's a bit different. Sort of.
