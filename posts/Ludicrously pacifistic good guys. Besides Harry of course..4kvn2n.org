This is just a long rant that I need to get off my chest. Basically I'm just frustrated with stories that talk about how pacifistic Dumbledore, the Order, and the Aurors are, namely how they don't just kill all the Death Eaters, especially when it's done to justify Harry going off and form his own gang. Often used for bashing as well.

First off, Dumbledore. Whenever I see stories where Harry (or whatever main character it may be) is upset that Dumbledore refuses to kill, and that he's just this insanely noble old man who's far too kind, I just remember that scene in Book 5 where he flat out states that merely killing Voldemort wouldn't satisfy him. Clearly the words of a man who abhors violence!

As for the Order...this is a volunteer militia of civilians! Heaven forbid they have moral objections to killing! Most of them weren't trained for this crap, and killing is not easy. All things considered, I'm just happy they're fighting (they're not exactly competent, but that's a whole other issue)

And as for Aurors, they are not soldiers. They're detectives and Magical Britain's SWAT. In the real world, police try to avoid killing criminals. Are they willing to do so if they have to? Yes, but that's a last resort thing that results in lots of paper work and therapy. They were not trained to fight a war, they were trained to arrest and capture criminals.

Sorry, that's just been bothering me for a while.

When I saw the title for this, I thought you were going to be looking for fics with such ludicrously pacifist good guys.

** Calling them a militia gives the wrong impression about the Order. They're not a militia. They're an intelligence gathering organization.

The only times that they fought pre-/Hallows/ was when the choice was between doing nothing and leaving schoolchildren to the mercy of the Death Eaters and Voldemort (the end of /OotP/ and the Hogwarts invasion in /HBP/.

** My problem with it is that it's the exact opposite of canon. In DH a number of Order members try to persuade Harry that he should be using more dangerous spells.

But in fanon it's always Harry telling the Order how many have died because of their pacifist nature. (Normally followed by them turning against him because of some Dark spell.)

*** I think that wizarding world is too small and wizarding warfare is too different to have an army in the Muggle sense of the word. If nothing else, while a Muggle army marches on its stomach (to paraphrase Napoleon), the wizard army logistics and resupply are almost a non-issue.

Add to that that there is no wizard equivalent of armor and artillery, so there is virtually no difference between the training of a hitwizard and that of a hypothetical wizard soldier, or, at least, not nearly the difference between the training of a Muggle peace officer and a Muggle soldier.

And, thanks to Apparition and portable flying devices, pretty much every conflict becomes guerrilla warfare, something that conventional armies aren't that good at confronting in the first place.

Pretty much the only way I can see wizards forming armies is if the guerrilla warfare has gotten so bad for both sides that they decide to settle it under "controlled conditions" in accordance with strict rules of engagement. (IIRC, some ancient civilizations did that, because both sides needed the war to be over in time for the harvest.)

*** Magical Britain only has 3000 people living in it, that comes directly from Jk, who is admittedly /terrible/ at maths. A population that small would act much like a small village during medieval times when trying to form an army, they'd conscript from the lower class.

But my belief is that most wizards and witches are rather libertarian in outlook, if not in action. When any witch or wizard could be self sufficient with the effortless use of magic, on a cultural level they stop relying on the state. So Voldemort can take over the country with 50 or so wands at his back because he never faces a matching force, instead magical Britain falls apart instantly while everyone defends their own. An army is a reflection of the state, a concept that barely exists in magical Britain... excepting Quidditch of course.

**** But as Turb stated Wizarding conflict is on a very different level than conflict as we know it.

So it can stand to reason that Aurors could be trained in combat as Wizards would engage in combat.
