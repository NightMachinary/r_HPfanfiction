According to at least fanon, Slytherin Monster was left as protection of the school. When the wards detect a powerful hostile dark artifact make itself through the wards, it releases the monster from it's slumber to hunt it down.


** Or, you know, when Quirrelmort steps in?

***** Yes... Because the Basilisk can /definitely/ make it's way up them stands.

Better yet it could've even sniped the man with it's petrifaction gaze from the ground.

**** Voldemort probably wanted to keep the Basilisk for when he really needed it (assassinate Dumbledore, take over Hogwarts) or maybe he wanted it as his pet when he took over. He was probably pretty upset to find out that his 16 year old self from the diary wasted it just to terrorize some children.
