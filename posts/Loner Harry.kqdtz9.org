I've been looking for fics that have Harry as a loner and keeping to himself, but every time I read one it always ends up the same, Harry's a loner who somehow ends up accumulating a massive amount friends and the perfect girlfriend . Then the author says that he's still a loner when he clearly isn't. Sorry about that miny rant. So what I'm looking for is a Harry who just doesn't really care about friends or socializing.People do try to make friends with him but because of his constant rebuffles they just give up and let him do what he wants


** Linkao3(24931486) has a loner Harry, although not necessarily due to his own design. It /is/ a really good story though, at least imo.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

** You know, this story I wrote doesn't quite fit what you're talking about, but it matches your characteristics if you squint.

Harry has little need for human friends in it and though people seem to think they mean something to him they end up not.
