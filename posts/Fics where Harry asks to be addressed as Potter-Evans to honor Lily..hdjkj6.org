Nice! Snape optional.


** I don't know any, but this is original.

I'd think when it's explained that his mom died for him would be the divergence point.

*** I just feel like Harry would want to honor his mum, especially after having it explained to him what she did. Perhaps McGonagall would have explained it more thoroughly than Hagrid, as much as I love the man.

**** I'm not sure if 11 year old Harry would be the most poignant version of the scene though.

3rd to 5th year seems better for it. A Harry that's in adolescence that truly appreciates the sacrifice.

****** It could work, although in my opinion, I think after the graveyard in the Goblet of Fire works better. With a flashback to the end of first year of course.

But that's just my opinion.

******* It's also the first time in his memory that his mother has actually spoken directly to him(The echo from Voldemort's wand).

Before that, all he had were visions from the Mirror of Erised, pictures from his photo album, and memories of her pleading to Voldemort for his life.
