Looking specifically for rune tattoos enhancing or helping the body. Also up for stories that revolve around runes or runes play a major role in the story. Thanks


** *With Strength of Steel Wings* has a magical tattoo

*The Arithmancer* is exploring easy expansions of the use of runes: runes written in English, runes [[/spoiler][on disposable discs as pre-loaded spells for Muggles/Squibs to use]], etc

***** Yeah, I already read that he [[/spoiler][blows the trolls head off. But my concern is, why even have the troll incident in there when Harry already wants to bond with Hermione over Ron? Why not run after her immediately?]] I hate following the stations of canon in fanfiction with a passion. I just don't get why authors can't just work from the implications they make at the start of a story to develop it accordingly.

So, my real question here is will this thing follow canon like it already does, or will it eventually be its own thing? Because if second year is canon /but with runes/, I'm out.

****** As someone who's read it already I can tell you that it deviates pretty heavily from canon. Certain canon events still happen, like the chamber fiasco and the tri-wiz tournament trouble. But they're greatly altered from how they happen in canon. It's essentially an alternate canon spinoff. Everything still happens but it happens very differently from how it did in canon. Oh yeah, and you probably should just write your own book if you hate canon so much because newsflash, most fanfic is canon spinoff.

God, can you be more condescending? Newsflash, there is a difference between leaning on canon and completely ignoring the changes your own interference in canon events have. If Harry goes as far as to shout at Ron for being a prick, declaring his loyalty to Hermione the know-it-all over Ron, then it makes zero sense for them to wait till the feast to follow her.

I despise it when authors don't follow on their own changes. It comes of as forced, like they can't think about any other option than canon to write a story.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** linkffn(Looking Beyond by shinigamigirl196) has fem!Harry carve runes into her skin as a part of blood magic. Leads to one of my favorite lines in the story: "I would like to point out that your friend is carving symbols into her flesh and you two aren't even fazed." - Audrey (Percy's muggle girlfriend), Chapter 129

It is a major canon rehash until well after the hundredth chapter, though. Just to warn you.
