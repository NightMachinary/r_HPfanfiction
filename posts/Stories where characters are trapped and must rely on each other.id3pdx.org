Maybe a spell/curse/potion backfired, maybe they're captured/kidnapped, et cetra.

Can be on any site, can be any length, anyone can be the main character, can be old or new, would rather it be completed, but am fine if it's not.

Can be a main part of the story or a minor part.

No Seer Luna, no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/threesomes and the like. Doesn't have to have a pairing or even focus on one.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP. Now complete with epilogue.

** Followup recommendation since you're fine with slash.

Harry ends up trapped in 12 Grimmauld Place, a neglected sentient and magical house that definitely prefers Draco Malfoy. They have to work together to restore the house enough that it will let them out.

The author, astolat, is more well known for her Temeraire novel series about dragons in the Napoleonic wars, so the writing here is great!

** I just rec'd this on your other post about things that need more recommendations. Here's my post again with the added note that Harry and Draco are caught in a trap with a muggle child. The summary says "love", but I think it's more mutual understanding of old rivals and seeking comfort in each other given the life-or-death situation they are in.

I wish this had more recommendations, but with the POV being a child OC and the genre emotional hurt/comfort and angst, plus it's over 10 years old... Since it's under 9K words, it's a really quick read. I've always found either interpretation of the ending devastating.

Brief non-explicit sexual content that can easily be skipped over by not reading the section beginning, "It's the third night watch.", and then starting again after the line breaks with, "Someone's shaking the house."

  Draco and Harry become snared in a trap, but they're not alone. Love guides our path for reasons we can't always understand.
