All i keep seeing is fics of Harry losing it, or suddenly becoming rebellious against Dumbledore and the Ministry.\\
Dumbledore is considered the most powerful wizard of his age, and the only reason he had not yet defeated Voldemort according to McGongall was because he refused to use the darker aspects of magic that he knew against Voldemort.

So here's my prompt. Dumbledore decides that enough is enough, and goes on the offensive against Voldemort and the Ministry. Maybe Voldemort targets the students, and Dumbledore being headmaster feels guilt at not being able to protect his students, and this pushes him over the edge. Bonus if Harry is horrified at this turn of events and sides against Dumbledore believing that the world has had enough powerful men fighting over it.

Any other character going this route would also be interesting. Just not Harry.

*** The one line from this that always gets me is the part where he's thinking on the ministry chasing him out of Hogwarts and him saying something of how years ago such an insult would have resulted in decimated cities or so.

** I've thought that Dumbledore going apeshit would be a damn good story. I always imagined him meeting Voldemort in the Ministry after Sirius is killed and instead of back-and-forth banter and then the duel he just ups and goes for the kill. I mean the man has the Death Stick so the only real reason Voldemort got away was that Dumbledore stopped fighting him.

Killing Voldemort just as the ministry workers show up so they all see Voldemort's soul talking shit before it flees and Dumbledore just floats his corpse behind him while he orders the minister and his flunkies around.

Dumbledore gets fed up and figures that if Voldemort can't be killed permanently, well he can die. Over and over until Harry is ready to finish the prophecy or Voldemort just gets so tired of being eviserated that he decides to hide out until everyone alive has died so he doesn't have to get turned inside out and constantly murdered.

*** This. We've seen how helpless Voldemort is without his body. Dumbledore can simply destroy his body over and over again, or even trap his spirit somewhere.
