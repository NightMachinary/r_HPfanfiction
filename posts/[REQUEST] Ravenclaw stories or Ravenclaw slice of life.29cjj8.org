I've read plenty of ficlets on Tumblr about Ravenclaws sneaking around Hogwarts, writing their own spells, trying to build Muggle-Wizard devices, or just breaking into the Restricted Section, and I'm looking for more of that sort of thing. The thing that's really inspiring this itch is the throwaway mention of a renegade group of Ravenclaws working during the year that Snape was in charge of Hogwarts who ended up breaking into the library and copying as many books as they could to hide them away for safekeeping, so that the knowledge could never be lost. I think they called it Operation Alexandria or something? Anyway, it was a minor story in the Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness series, and I'm looking for more stuff like it.

I'm not really looking for Harry Potter as Ravenclaw, though I wouldn't be opposed to it if Harry is depicted as a true Ravenclaw rather than someone who just happens to be sorted into the house.

Preferably a long story about a group of Ravenclaws who invent things and get up to no good, but I'm mostly just looking for genuine well-thought out depictions of the Ravenclaw House that allows for Ravenclaws who invent and explore rather than just study and read all the time.
