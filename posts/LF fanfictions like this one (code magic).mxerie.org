  When the Lestranges were sent to Azkaban, they left behind a baby - the son of Bellatrix and Rodolphus. Lelouch Lestrange is quiet and unassuming - as much as possible for a tactical genius who had conquered the world once, anyway. The board is set, and neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort have the slightest idea what they're up against.

** Thanks for making me discover this one, I really enjoyed it.

If you want another fiction with the same crossover, I enjoyed linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13444649/9/The-Demon-Who-Lived][T]]he Demon Who Lived), although sadly it died before the Hogwarts years really started.

  Reborn as Harry Potter, Lelouch now has an entire magical world to sort out that, to his surprise, actually seems worse than Britannia. Known terrorists freely walk the streets. Corruption is rampant. A fool sits as the head of government. Oh yes, and every single eleven-year-old is given a wand that can replicate the effect of every geass he's ever encountered, including his own.
