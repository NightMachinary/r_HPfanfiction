Hi! I was wondering if anyone here can help me find a fic I rea long time ago. It was completed in ff.net. I remember Harry travelled to a place where he met Merl√≠n and the founders and they taught him how to become powerful and defeat Dumbledore. Harry had a brother who everyone believed to be the one to defeat Voldemort but he wasn't. Eventually Harry and his friends travelled and stayed with the founders to trained and they started to age. Later they came back and won against Voldemort (and everyone was surprised that they all had aged). Does anyone remember this fic? It was great and I have been searching for months. Thanks!
