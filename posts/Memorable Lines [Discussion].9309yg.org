I've noticed a number of stories I'm fond of have at least one passage that sticks out to me when I think about them. Like in linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid), this bit always leaves me smiling:

#+begin_quote
  She turned up to look at him and wanted to briefly give him a kiss on the cheek. Or at least, she'd lean in for a kiss on the cheek and then "accidentally" get his mouth instead. It was the perfect chance, he wasn't paying much attention, she figured he was getting to feel the fatigue of his practice, and she could write it off as an accident because of her current state.

  /Gryffindor courage, Gryffindor courage./

  "Can I borrow your glasses?"

  /Gryffindor chicken./

** "What's the point in holding the world in your hand if there is no one worth showing it off to?"

Voldemort in PoTDK

"Only the righteous seek justice, the damned seek revenge."

Graces Malfoy in You'll be the Death of Me

"It is at this moment that I realize whatever evil I have done, whatever vices I indulged upon were worth it. Andromeda cries for her child, and I rejoice that I do not cry for mine. Whatever is necessary I was willing to do, and in my embrace my family resides. Most are not that lucky. Your convictions, your courage is admirable, but your families are gone. The Malfoy name may have been sacrificed, but the Malfoys live on."

#+begin_quote

  Harry Potter: I remember you being younger.

And from Ch. 89:

  Voldemort: Of that we are agreed. You should stay still and take your punishment like a man.

  Harry: How about I take it like a fourteen year old and sit in my room until I've learned my lesson?

*** For a more serious one, probably this one from linkffn(Forging the Sword)

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin, the Hat had almost put him in, and his similarity to Slytherin's heir Riddle himself had commented on. But he was beginning to think that this wasn't because he had "un-Gryffindor" qualities that fit only in Slytherin, but because the two houses -- normally pictured as opposites -- were in some fundamental ways quite similar.

  Ravenclaws in battle, he had no doubt, would coolly plan the sacrifice of distant strangers to achieve an important objective, though that cold logic could collapse in the face of sacrificing family instead. Hufflepuffs would sacrifice no one, though it means they sacrifice an objective in its place.

  Only Gryffindors and Slytherins were good at sacrificing those they loved.

Tom was a prodigy among prodigies. I say that not to frighten you, but to make you understand that any sort of direct assault on the Dark Lord by yourself would be madness.

** Ron at Hermione's side after Malfoy Manor when Fleur asks him to leave so she can help Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  Fleur came back into the room, a bottle in her dainty hand and a change of clothes under her arm.

  "Ron, can you move pleeze? I need to 'elp 'Ermione," she said softly.

  Ron shook his head and gripped Hermione's hand tighter as Fleur kneelt down next to him.

  "Pleeze, Ron," Fleur said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Zis eez important."

  Shaking his head again, he looked imploringly into her eyes. "I promised I wouldn't leave her. I promised."

  He knew he sounded childish but leaving Hermione's side was the last thing he wanted to do right now. When he had made that promise he had had every intention of keeping it. The evening's events had forced him to break it. When Hermione had needed him most, he hadn't been there until it was almost too late. There was no way he was going to leave now. Fleur didn't seem to understand.

  "You can wait outside-"

  "Ron," Hermione said, and he turned to look at her. Her brown eyes were glistening with tears now, "you can go."

  His heart plummeted.

  *"You- you want me to go?" he asked dejectedly.*

  *"No," Hermione smiled, "but I know that you'll come back."*

Ginny destroying the locket:

#+begin_quote
  "Open," he said in Parseltongue. It sprang open, revealing dark brown eyes -- they were not red, but they were cold and hungry for power.

  Ginny stared at it, holding the sword up. Harry repressed the urge to tell her to do it.

  "I have seen your heart, Ginevra Weasley, and it is mine."

  Do it, do it, do it, Harry chanted, but he didn't say it out loud.

  *"No, it isn't," Ginny said quietly. "And I'm Ginny Potter, you arse."*

  Then she swung with all her might, and cleaved the Horcrux and the footstool in two. Harry heard a distant scream, and kicked the broken wood and metal aside, and pulled her into his arms. The sword dropped with a clatter.

  "I am," Harry whispered for her and her alone, "so in love with you."

** Otherwise mediocre Hermione Takes over the World one-shot linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/682335]]) has this gem:

#+begin_quote
  It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed.
