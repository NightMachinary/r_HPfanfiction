Hasn't been updated in over a year. Harry is reincarnated several times and the most recent time is in the world of BNHA. I enjoyed it.

  Ibuki Ryouka behaved unlike the usual children would behave. She was quiet and expressionless, composed and mature, and she possessed knowledge that far greater than what she should have known at her age. Why, you ask? For she was the 27th reincarnation of the great hero once known as Harry Potter!
