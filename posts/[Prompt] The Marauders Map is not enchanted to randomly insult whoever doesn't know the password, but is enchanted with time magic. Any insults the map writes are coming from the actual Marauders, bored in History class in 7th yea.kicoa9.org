*** Yeah, right? Plus, there's a lot of different ways people could take this - you could do a slice of life fic, like what's going on with the Marauders when they were insulted Snape in book 3, or you could go full on time shenanigans, have either the twins or Harry writing back, changing the Marauders Era (and who knows what that would do to the modern Era?) or you could have the Marauders wiring to them change the present - like maybe they start teaching the twins/Harry how to be an animagus. I'd be down for any of it!

**** I haven't read a prompt and had such a flash of inspiration to write in a long long time! You are right, there is so much you can do with it (and I am currently doing with it!). I like the idea that they don't know it's writing from the future/another time... That it just appears and they don't know what to do with it... I makes some canonical sense in that way which resonates with me.

I love it. I adore it. I'm writing it. You are fantastic thank you!

** „There's something new!“, James said excitedly. Just a few moments ago they had gleefully insulted Snivellus who somehow had gotten his hands on the map. Now, instead of a caricature of whoever was trying to open the map, with a little speech bubble for whatever spell they were using, writing appeared. This was more than a little unusual.

„/Hi guys/“, the writing said. The four friends exchanged a look. It was in Remus handwriting. They all knew it like their own from coping his notes and because he always wrote the longest letters. James grabbed his wand like a quill. „/Moony?/“, he wrote and waited for an answer. „/Yes/“, the writing said. „/How long have you been in detention by now?/“, he followed up, proving that he really was one of them. „That's weird“, Remus muttered starring at his own handwriting. „I'm talking to myself - but literally.“ Sirius stifled his laugh as to not alarm Binns, who had conveniently fallen asleep at his desk instead of doing his job of watching them.

„Merlin“, muttered James, „The Snivellus who just had the map must have been a teacher - so are you a teacher too?“ Remus shrugged but he had a hopeful look in his eyes. „Maybe?“ „Professor Moony“, Sirius said. „We should get you a proper teacher suitcase. With your name on it and everything“ „/About an hour/“, James wrote, to answer the question. „/Are you a teacher?/“ „Yes“ Sirius grabbed the map while James and Peter congratulated an ecstatic Remus. „/Oh No! You turned out boring! Don‘t tell me you took the map from a student!/“ There was a very long pause after that. The marauders sat on the edges of their seats, hoping that Moony hadn't actually done something as atrocious as taking the map away from whatever worthy troublemaker had it at the moment.

„/Don't worry Sirius/“, the writing said. Sirius name was somehow oddly written. „/I will give it back to him when it's safe/“ The marauders exchanged a bewildered look. „Ask him what he means by that!“, Peter whispered. „I was going to!“, James said and grabbed his wand. „/What do you mean by safe?/“ A long, long pause followed. „/Ask Sirius/“ Three faces turned to a completely dumbfounded Sirius. Sirius grabbed the map. „/I have no idea what you are talking about/“ „/I bet you don't. But you will/“ „What in the world do you mean?“, Sirius asked Remus. Remus looked slightly panicked. „Oh Merlin. Please tell me I don't lose my mind in the future.“ He grabbed the map. „/Not even I get what you mean. How is that even possible?/“ „/I can't just tell you about the future, can I?/“, asked map-Remus back.

James sighed unhappily. „I wish we knew a stronger spell. One that doesn't just swallow all the interesting details“ „You can't have everything in live“, Sirius said wisely. Peter took the map. „/If you can't tell us interesting stuff, than at least tell us what year you are writing from/“ „/1994/“ James looked horrified. „/So we‘re 34? That's horrible, I hope I don't have to live to see this/“ There was such a long pause, that the marauders stopped starring at the map, in favour of discussing what they thought they would be doing at 34.

Remus was happy to know that he would be Hogwarts teacher. James was planning on being a curse breaker and also being married to Lily Evans and having a whole army of kids. Sirius didn't know what he wanted to do as long as it was fun and free and pissing his family of. Peter had no idea at all what he wanted to do, but he claimed being alive despite the war would be a pretty good achievement on its own. „/Don't say something like that/“, the map finally answered. In the future, weeks had possibly passed.

„/Sorry, forgot you turn into a kill joy in old age/“, James wrote cheerfully. „/Please tell me I'm at least not all grey and wrinkly by now/“ There was another pause. „/You haven't aged at all in the last decade/“ „/Aww I‘m blushing Moony/“ „Oh no“, murmured Remus. „I will apparently forget to not ever push your ego in the future“ James flashed him a smile that he thought was charming but only made Remus role his eyes so hard he was afraid they would get stuck. „/I have to go now/“, said the map. „/It appears I have a meeting with an old friend. Forget what I told you about Sirius knowing - Peter will be the one you should ask what I meant. And James, I promise I will make sure Harry is okay/“ The writing was almost unreadable so hastily was it scribbled. Four people exchanged bewildered glances. „/Who is Harry?/“, James wrote. He didn't get an answer. The next time the map showed them writing, it was just some random kid without the password.

** The marauder's map is a mystery to most; even though having been created by four juvenile delinquents in the making, it is an enigma, an unsolved puzzle. For though nobody could argue that the two donned Prongs and Padfoot were somewhat prodigies when it came to transfiguration, I still wonder why nobody questioned their magical breakthrough. I confess to never have been a fan of these marauders, but I am telling the truth when saying that, though the dunderheads had a generous amount of ability, they almost certainly brought their most unique feature to life by accident. I remember the day they discovered the magic faintly, though at the time I was nothing but a somewhat, if insecure, potions genius. I remember it was a sunny day, sweltering in fact, and that during our yearly lecture, the four had started to goof off.

“Oi-” Sirius Black muttered as he elbowed his companion in the side. Remus Lupin, the only academic of the four, had been the receiver of this hit, and he turned to the side, curiosity written plainly on his not-yet-furry face. You see, Remus Lupin was, and is a werewolf, and though that was something known only to his close friends, I still wonder, years later, how he kept his secret from all the others for the seven years of his education. Even now, his face scrunches up as he fibs. He is horrible at maintaining a neutral expression.

“Look, Snivvelus is writing to us!” Black said, pushing the familiar parchment in the werewolf's face. Lupin looked down, surprise obvious in his expression, for how could ‘Snivvelus' have possession of their parchment?

Though smart, I do not think they had expected to come across an old face while instructing future troublemakers through their invention. To be honest, the four, though three would be a more appropriate term, were quite short-sighted in their project, not even beginning to scrape the veracity of their achievement. This was the reason why when seeing the familiar spiky black handwriting of the child they tormented for his too-big clothes and greasy hair, they looked surprised, excited, and in the case of Peter Pettigrew, scared. (for what would their victim do to them while they were still weak, and he now powerful)

The words were simple; straight forward. “Professor Severus Snape, Potions master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!” I must admit, I have always had a flair for drama, and had I been expecting a reply, I would have gone with something much more subtle. Instead, I had given the buffoons gold to work with, nuggets of information that could be used to insult.

It is a sacrifice for science that I sit in the Pensieve, watching again and again as my past tormentors insult me, striking in the places that have healed, yet are still raw. It is for magic, that I re-watch the painful events, jotting down all that could be part of the key to the frivolous time correspondence. For I know that if I crack this, I will get the reward I have ached for through most of my prime. I will get to apologize to Lily.

** Oh... dude.... This prompt is magnificent.

The names came back in snippets. Harry... Hermione... Fred... George.... Weasley there were a lot of those. The last two could really give us good as they got they had to put their heads together to come up with a good insult to get those two on the backfoot. It made the second goblin uprising bearable given binns Monotonic drawl Was the soundtrack to their classroom.

​

The idea had seemed innocuous enough when James had proposed it. It was even feasible when sirius nicked That time turner from his mum. Some black ancestors had headed up the department of mysteries, And left a few interesting knickknacks scattered around grimmold place after their passing. Sirius had been the one To mix the grains of sand into the ink They used to draw and enchant the map. Peter had gotten a bit squeamish when he suggested adding blood to it, so They used saliva instead mixed with time turner Sand and Wickham's premium Non-smudging runic array Specialized Ink. That one they had to buy by owl mail order through A ravenclaw go between. Professor McGonagall had started getting suspicious When Remus checked out some books on drawing in perspective amateur cartography and Map making indexes. So the ravenclaw had been necessary, The girl had only extracted the promise of a date on the next hogsmeade weekend, She was pretty so to Sirius The request was no hardship.

​

When The name harry potter popped up in association with those two clever weasley They had spent most of that week exchanging insults with it had raised a few eyebrows among the group. With James crowing loudly, I knew I'd win her over e . Remus actually hadn heart To mention to James that the last name Potter was quite common in the British Muggle community. They didn't know if that Harry was any relation to him. But siris had already claimed The rights of dogfather to The possible Potter offspring on the other end Of the time traveling document. From Remus‘ assessment The kid was going to need it. His insults were creative but not very snappy. He would need Proper tutelage in the ways of sarcasm and witaschism If he was going to survive being son of a maurader. Remus was more than happy to let His friend have that particular godfather responsibility to the possible mystery kid most likely a few decades away. Remus would take responsibility for fire proofing everything, Theyd need it eventually. That conversation with the bloke named Harry, Made James ask Lily out one last time before Christmas... He was a great deal less of a part about it this time. And Evans said yes Remarkably. Remus had to slap his hand over James his mouth before his friend could possibly destroy his chances by mentioning key already had the name of the first born son picked out.

​

The birth of Harry James Potter in 1981 was both a self-fulfilling prophecy and the funniest thing any of them could remember about Wizarding history. Lily was never filled in on what was so amusing, James slept on the couch for a few days because of it but it was eventually resolved By itself.

** *I wrote it...*

Here's the thing about Magic. It doesn't care. People like to think it does, that it protects you or helps you or makes you special. It doesn't. Gravity is the only thing saving us from flying off into the endless abyss of space yet we do not think of gravity as this mystical protector. Just a force. An intangible power that we cannot control nor harness.

“But we can control magic!” I hear you cry. But can you? You cast spells and charms and think it control? Do I control magnetism because I hold a magnet? Or control electricity when I plug in my kettle? We can attempt to manipulate it, guide it, twist a small amount of it to do our bidding but that is not control.

Magic is bigger than your wands and your tricks. It is something that is, that was, that will be. It is a force that was there in the beginning and will be there in the end. Magic does not care for lines or logic or the things that man invented to define the universe it helped create. It is fundamental. Independent of earth, independent of gravity and magnetism, independent of all that came after it.

Independent of Time.

Magic didn't care that it was a map. It didn't care for the meticulous work that four boys who were too clever for their own good had put into it. Magic was just there, seeped into the parchment. A lot of it, poured and drenched onto the paper till it became heavy with the weight of it. It didn't care that the young boys were curled around the ‘map' on their dorm floor one evening, staring wide eyed at the words that had sprung onto the page.

/“Reveal your secret -- Professor Severus Snape”/

See the thing was, Magic didn't care for time. The Magic that was in this parchment had always existed. Would always exist. The ‘when' was irrelevant. How do you quantify something that always is? A person was talking to the map, so the map showed it. It did not care who to. Or when to. It just did.

People, however, do care for time. They notice when the year is 1976 or 1993 and what side of it they are on. Their lives are so short that counting the time they have is important, a futile compulsion. However, despite their counting and desperate attempts to keep such an idea linear and immovable, they fail to account for Magics' indifference for mans laws.

/“Show yourself! - Professor Severus Snape”/

“What on Earth is happening?” Peter muttered, staring at the words as they faded back into the parchment. “Why are there words, there's never been words before?”

“I've no idea...” Remus replied, touching his hands to the parchment where the scratched ink had just disappeared. “It feels like someone is trying to get into the map.”

“But the map is right here, no one is trying to get into it Moony.” James lifted the parchment up to look underneath. The words had gone.

“Maybe from somewhere else in the castle?”

“How would Snivellous even know we have this map, let alone know how to remotely get into it when he's nowhere close!?” Sirius grabbed the parchment from James and turned it over in his hands. “More to the point, why is it saying Professor Severus Snape?”

“Maybe he's trying to trick us into thinking he's a teacher, so we'd let him in?” said Peter

“Well, that's a stupid plan. He didn't even change his name. Did he think we wouldn't notice!?” Sirius snarled and he through the paper back down on the floor.

As though on cue, more words snaked across the frayed parchment and the four boys scrambled forward to read them.

/“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal! - Professor Severus Snape.”/

“Merlin he's persistent isn't he...” Sirius muttered

“Should we answer?” The three boys turned to look at Peter. “What!?” He said, “He keeps writing to us on the parchment, maybe we should write back... Scare him off?”

“Would that work?” James asked, mostly to Remus who was unofficial map expert based on nothing but his ability to read slightly more books with a marginally better memory retention of the unimportant bits than the other three.

“It wouldn't do anything bad? I don't understand how he's writing directly onto the map though? Not without having direct access to it... He must have gotten a hold of the Map at some point? Maybe put some type of listening spell on it.” Remus heard Sirius snarl at this but continued on. “It's clever though, I don't know what charms he could have used... Since he's getting through this way, then logically we should be able to get back that way? Communication charms work both ways.”

“Give it!” barked Sirius, “I'll tell him where he can stick that slimy nose of his!”

James snatched the map out of Sirius's grasp before he could lay claim to it.

“Maybe a more diplomatic approach is best if we want to actually keep this map a secret Padfoot?” James said. “If we start getting defensive, he'll know it's important and we can't risk getting this map confiscated.”

The two boys glared at each other for a second before Sirius slumped back onto the floor. “You're no fun when you're right...” he muttered.

James smirked. “I must be awful boring so.” He declared and handed the map to Remus. “You go first then, so we know what to do.”

Remus smirked at Sirius before tapping his wand to the parchment. As he spoke, his words traced themselves onto the parchment as though his own hand was writing them.

/“Mr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep is abnormally long nose out of other people's business.”/

“Compliments!?” asked Peter, snorting at the scathingly polite remark Remus had wrote into the page.

“I don't know what spell he's using to do this!” Remus replied defensively. “We're going to have to redo our security charms on the map just to make sure this doesn't happen again. I have to compliment him on that.”

“You really don't. Give it here!” James pulled the parchment towards him and set his wand on it as Remus had done.

/“Mr Prongs agrees with Mr Moony and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.”/

“Subtle, James...” sighed Remus, watching as the words sunk into the page.

“Really? That's disappointing I wasn't aiming for subtle.” James grinned

“Here, I'll give it a go!” Sirius had his wand on the parchment before Remus could stop him.

/“Mr Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a Professor.”/

“Oh for the love of-”

But Peter had tapped his wand to the map before James and Sirius had even caught a breath for laughing.

/“Mr Wormtail bids Professor Snape a good day and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”/

Peter, James and Sirius rolled back on the floor, howling with laughter.

“You're all very mature.” muttered Remus, picking up the parchment. When there was no response, he folded it back up, took out his wand and began scanning the parchment for unrecognised charms.

“Did he respond?” Sirius asked after a few minutes when the three boys had caught their breath for laughing.

“Nope.” Remus replied, his brow furrowed over the parchment. “Must have scared him off.”

Peter gave Remus a searching look. “Can't find the listening charm?”

“No...” He said quietly. “Can't see any magic on this thing that we didn't put there.”

“Maybe it was a one time spell?”, said James, “The kind that wears off after use?”

“Hmm...” Remus nodded absentmindedly. “We'll have go down to the library and look properly. It's not good that the map was so easily infiltrated, we need to have a barrier against that.”

“Fine,” said Sirius, pulling himself off the floor. “But only if we go down to the Kitchens first, I'm starved.”

“Do you just want to go to the Kitchens because they are conveniently located on the way to the dungeons where the Slytherin Common Room is?” Remus said, folding up the map and storing it in the bottom if his trunk.

“Remus!” Sirius gasped, clutching his heart with an air of drama that one would expect to see in an Edwardian novel. “I am shocked at what you are insinuating! James can you believe he would think so little of me?”

“Yes. I do. Although I would also appreciate a trip to the conveniently located kitchens for equally innocent reasons.” James said. “And there is absolutely no correlation between that and me bringing my invisibility cloak.”

“No, don't-!” Remus started, but James had already flung the cloak over a grinning Sirius and a second later, Peter was tugged arm first into nothingness.

“Eugh fine!” Remus said to the air. “We'll bypass it but we are not breaking into their common room, we can deal with him tomorrow when we've figured out what the spell was.”

Sirius's head appeared an inch away from Remus's, floating in thin air. “Knew you'd come around mate!”

There was a swoosh of fabric. And the room was empty.

*** *And a rather sad sequel... Since I've always wondered why Harry never used the map to talk to his parents.*

/“Hello?”/

James heard his wand clatter to the floor as he watched the words hover on the page for a second before once again, disappearing into the paper.

It had been two years since the last words had appeared on the Map. They had never found any spells and after updating the password and adding more security charms, the had concluded that the map was now safe for use again.

/“Hello?”/

The words sprung up again, in a scrawly handwriting James didn't recognise. It was like a mash of all their writings. As scratchy as his own but with Sirius's slant, Remus's large font, Peters joined letters, even Lilys curl on the e and o he only ever saw in her work... It looked like all their words and none of them.

/“Is anyone there?”/

James knew better than to answer disembodied voice. “Never trust anything if you don't know where it keeps it's brain.” That was the old saying his father was always repeating to him after his cousin got into a nasty accident with an irritable lawnmower. James had heard the story too many time with varying levels of colourful descriptions not to abide by it.

But still... He couldn't help being intrigued by the handwriting.

/“Hello?”/

James debated on waking Peter. It was late, too late. James shouldn't even be awake. Lately, with the castle being abuzz with ministry officials and rumours of war stirring outside the castle, he had become addicted to watching the boundaries of the map... Making sure people were safe, watching the little dots patrol in and out of the gates and searching for any sign of danger.

The words didn't feel dangerous. This didn't feel like Snivellous trying to break in again. It felt desperate... James knew he should tell Remus but he was still in the hospital wing, Sirius's small dot floating beside him on the map. He could wake Peter but what would that achieve?

He couldn't stop looking at the little curly e's...

/“I guess not...”/

James could almost feel the deflation in the statement. There was an urge in him to reply but he refrained. No good could come of answering the parchment. No good ever came of messing with Magic you didn't understand. James simply stared at the words as they faded into nothing.

/“It's Harry... I just wanted to say hi...”/

“Harry.” James murmured to himself, putting his hands on the strangely familiar scratched handwriting. “Hi Harry...”

The words faded to nothing. James kept watching the parchment but nothing else appeared. Just the rhythmic pattern of dots marching across the page.
