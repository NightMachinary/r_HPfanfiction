I'm searching for a fic which deviates from Canon in the shrieking shack event. In this fic, the entire incident was caused by Snape manipulating things in order to get the marauders expelled. I remember that in the shack in full moon Snape escapes by successfully turning into an animagus. It was abandoned I think. Does anyone know which fic I'm talking about?
