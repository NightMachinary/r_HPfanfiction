Over the years, Dumbledore had gained the ability to see if something or someone was had very powerful magic, and if it was predominantly "light" or "dark". And at that moment, he saw that Harry had a scar on his forehead, and that the scar was full of "dark" magic. And the most worrying thing was that he did not know if it was a curse, or something worse. And that worried him a lot.

However, Dumbledore did know someone who might know what it was. Nicholas Flamel. So, he brought Harry to the hospital wing in Hogwarts, and called Flamel over to have a look at what it was.

"Albus, do you know if Voldemort knew anything about Horcruxes?" Flamel asked.

"Horcruxes? You mean... Harry might have been made into a Horcrux?"

"Yes. There is only one thing that can be done."

Dumbledore was immediately shocked at the fact that Nicholas knew a way to remove the Horcrux from Harry. "What is it?"

"Avada Kedavra!" Flamel shouted, pointing his wand at Harry. When he heard the first word, Dumbledore jumped in front of Flamel, intending to make the spell miss Harry. The green light hit him on the chest, sending him tumbling to the floor.

Albus Dumbledore, said to be the greatest wizard since Merlin, was dead.

** I first saw this, and thought it was a WBWL story, because to be honest, who didn't? Anyways, then I noticed the absence of Jamie Potter, the red haired, spoiled nuisance, and to be honest I felt a bit disappointed. (I'll see myself out now...)

Continued reading, and my jaw dropped. What a twist! Mind making this into a oneshot?

It baffles me that Nicholas knew all about horcruxes. You mean, Harry could have been a nice normal boy this entire time?

*** I'm glad you like it, but unfortunately I'm trash at writing, and never have been confident enough to write a fanfic. This has started to make me think about writing fanfiction though!

**** Awww, don't bring yourself down! I'm sure you'd be awesome, you come up with great ideas, and have a very dramatic way of saying things (Albus Dumbledore.....was dead)

I think you'd be a great crime/adventure fanfic author, with the plotlines you have. It seems like a regular WBWL, that the reader doesn't even note that there's no so-called boy who lived. It seems so normal, until the mention of horcrux, then you start to reconsider your thinking. Avada Kedavra, and then, right before you have even read the last line, you know what's happening.

This sub has a writing center with proofreaders who can help you improve! It also has many anonymous resources, in case you don't like other people reading your stuff. Posting a fanfiction always is scary, but once you see people reading it, your self-esteem increases with the bookmarkings and reviews and positive comments.

But, if you don't want to, and feel like writing a fanfic will make you feel bad, then don't! I hope some awesome fanfic author is lurking around here....

**** Everyone is trash at writing when they start. It isn't a talent or a gift. It's a skill, same as boxing or carpentry or dancing. The only way anyone ever gets better is to practice.

So ignore what you think is the quality of your work, and just get to work. If you don't, you'll never know how good you could be.

Plus, that way we get good stories to read. :P

** It would be even funnier if Flamel then hits Harry with the killing curse and the horcrux is removed and Harry is perfectly fine.

** I actually remember a fic where Albus suspects something is seriously wrong with the scar and asks Flamel for help. Once they figure out it's a horcrux, Flamel immediately tries to off Harry with the killing curse, but Albus convinces him not to. Forgot the title, sadly.
