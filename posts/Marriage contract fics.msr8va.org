I have recently started reading a few marriage contract fics (mainly James spookie and Dorothea Greengrass) and I really like the idea of Harry being forced into that kind of crazy situation. I guess that there are many more of that kind but I seem to be unable to find them when searching on ffn and ao3.


** Legacy prevention act is actually pretty good for a marriage contract fic. Just Google "legacy prevention act fanfiction"

There is another one but I can't remember the name, I'll have to do some digging to find it. I'll leave the description here incase someone else knows the title of the fic: when james was younger, him, sirius and greengrass's dad were all drunk together. Sirius gets the bright idea for james and greengrass to do a betrothal contract for harry and daphnee. I think it was done in a blood quill. It was pretty good from what I remember I just can't remember the name for my life.

Edit: ahh I believe the 2nd fic I described above is "angry harry and the seven"

Edit 2: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8769990/1/Second-Chances]]

is another pretty good marriage contract (again, greengrass). While sometimes the relationship fluff is a bit over the top and almost too "cute/fluffy" to not be annoying, the book series itself is pretty good. This one has 3 stories, the link above is just for the first in the series

** I've always liked subversions of this: there was one where Harry was basically like "yeah, I'll marry Daphne as required, but since I'll just isolate her, take her wand, confine her to a hut on the edge of a cold cliff somewhere, and wait patiently until she offs herself in misery" while he "not-marries Luna, knocks out a few 'illegitimate' kids with her but then name them legitimate heirs, as they live their lives as not-husband and not-wife".

*** Some subversions I enjoyed:

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_Widower_Maker/The_Widower_Maker/][The Widower Maker]] by Draco664 (I'm told you can read fics on this site without an account)

Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina linkffn(7558470)

And three stories by phoenixgirl26, based on the premise that Ginny, as the seventh child of a pureblood family, can make a legally-binding request on her 17th birthday. Naturally, she wishes for Harry to marry her: *Seventh Child* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9868051][First Story]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9868059][Second Story]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9868065][Third Story]].

This last one is on evilauthorday, a members-only group on Dreamwidth. You need to have a Dreamwidth account and join the group to read any of the fics, which are *by definition* unfinished rough drafts (hence the group name). Harry has kicked his wife Ginny out of his house and imposed restrictions on her activities, since he has the power to determine where she can live, etc. (She thought being a pureblood to his halfblood would give her the power, but he's titled so she was wrong.)

#+begin_quote
  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.

** I would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24155128/chapters/58165858][Potter-Weasley]]. It is manipulative Dumbledore fic where Dumbledore and Molly create a marriage contract for Harry and Ginny, but they can only add Ginny's name when she turns 13, so Harry is at the beginning just bethrothed to an unnamed Weasley. He asks Bill for help and they involve Charlie and Weasley grandparents.
