Harry hummed, near inaudible, before he spoke,

"The way I've always envisioned Death is that it's like a train station. When you die, you arrive at the platform and you're compelled to rush onboard and go on to the next place.

A snort and a loopy smirk preceded his somewhat cutting statement,

"I'm one of the idiots who missed their train." His hand scratched at the back of his head as his cheeks and ears took on a mild dusting of pink. The colour draining as he noted the reaction he'd received, hands flying forth to placate as he hurriedly added, "Oh! No no no! It's fine! I can still die, it's just- it's a bit complicated I s'pose..."

An aggressive exhale exploded past slightly pouted lips, hands ruffling the birds nest of loose black tufts and curls atop his head before settling into a twitching mess in his lap,

"To keep with the analogy. Whenever I "die" I end up at the station. But the train isn't waiting for me." A half smile returned here, and although there was amusement, it was dark and it was bitter, "I have to wait on IT."

Harry's fingers danced in his lap, rolling and weaving between each other when they weren't pulling at skin or the fabric of his jeans. He continued as if he didn't notice, which his long, empty stare into the nothing before his face may be implying,

"I know it's coming, as it always will. It HAS to. But it makes me wait because I've spurned it so many times."

The half smile became a grin again, losing much of it's steely edge for a gentler, loopy amusement,

"Though, I don't have to stay on the platform if I don't want to." Harry sat a bit straighter, turning to better face his audience with a layer of excited babble erupting forth, "You know how people go to the duty free's before they get on the plane?"

He waited barely a second for a response,

"That's what I'm doing. Except MY duty free shopping is coming back to life for a little while longer. Wandering around in Earth until my train gets here."

A giggle, not the deep snort or snicker of before, delight both mischievous as it was mellow,

"I'm entertaining myself out here," A vague hand making an equally vague gesture around himself before flopping back to its fidget, "cause I know the next train will be a while."

"So I'm not ACTUALLY immortal." Relief. Present in the visible relaxation of his shoulders and the light that returned to his eyes. The minute widening of his smile following the stilling of his fidgeting hands, a peaceful aura bloomed from his very being at the conclusion of that sentence, further blossoming from the continuation, "I can still die, just as easily as everyone else."

"I just don't have to stay dead if I don't want to."


** Harry: “this is fine”, “I'm ok with the events currently unfolding”

*** Thank you, I've taken a break from fanfiction over most of 2020 and I'm not sure how much I'm going to get back into it (as I don't find it as fun as I used to and I'm writing a book of my own).

** I actually wrote a oneshot with this concept a few years ago. It's my headcanon that MoD means Harry gets to decide whether he wants to stay dead or not, though there's nothing in canon that supports this idea. I love fics in which MoD actually means something and Harry gets some advantage from it.
