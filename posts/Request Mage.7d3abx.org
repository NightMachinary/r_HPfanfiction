Looking for stories with a mage in it; rather it's Harry himself or something else.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No bashing, or very little bashing.


** linkffn(5904185) Harry becomes the first military mage in the world and founder of the divison for the british army. This fic has a harry raised by his parrents in muggle society join the british armed forces with the ultimate goal to become emperor of europe.

Edit: sorry I just remembered I already recommended this to you 2 moths ago

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I don't see what you're looking for. Isn't "mage" just the term some other fantasy series use for what we'd call a "wizard" in a HP context?

*** In some fantasy settings, mages are more powerful than wizards.

So it goes wizard < mage < archmage.

Warlocks and sorceres I'm not sure where they stand.

**** In the D&D context, Sorcerers are more natural magicians and don't have to study like Wizards to gain their spells.

****** It's been a while since I've played D&D, so I'm not familiar with savants. From what I recall, Sorcerers only had to rest to regain their spells, but Wizards had to actually devote time to study. I don't think Sorcerers needed a spell book, either. And when leveling up, Sorcerers just "gained" new spells that they suddenly just knew.

******* Never played D&D myself.

A Savant is someone naturally talented at something, and who usually, but not always, lacks on other skills.

******** Okay, I didn't know if you were referencing a savant in a D&D context. I am familiar with savants in general and I find idiot savants fascinating!
