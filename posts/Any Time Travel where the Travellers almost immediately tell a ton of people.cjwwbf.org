Like Dumbledore and 90% of the Order know from the start and there's an actual group effort to use the future info/consequences of being a known time traveller in school to the teachers.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Linkffn(Me Without My TARDIS)

It's is Harry, Hermione and Neville accidental time travel fic. Dumbledore, Dippet, Harry's and Neville's families and the Unspeakables are all told about it. They accidentally travel to 1947 and yes, they immediately deal with Riddle.

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.

**** The accidental time travel happens when Neville's misfired spell hits the cabinet full of Time Turners in the Department of Mysteries (5th book). Harry, Hermione, Neville and the two Death Eaters present in the Room at that moment are thrown back in time. That's the premise and Ron /isn't/ there so no, I don't find it annoying.

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.
