I'm looking for books that harry has to marry Apolline (for one reason or another) and he becomes Fleur and Gabrielle's papa. I would love if he fully embraces his new role of Papa for them to.


** /Gabri's mom has got it going on/

/She's all I want and I've waited for so long/

/Gabri, can't you see? You ain't the Veela for me/

/I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Gabri's mom/

** Linkffn(adopted life debt) pretty good but for some reason between the first and second chapter the writer changes her name from Appoline to Jean with no explanation. I just replace it in my head as I read but still it's a fun fic with no bashing but sadly incomplete

  A Life Debt with Gabrielle leaves Harry with new things to think about. I'm not brilliant at summaries, since this is my first fanfiction but its just a story i thought of so here we are. hopefully its not too bad

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13392594/1/Saving-People-Pays-Off-Sometimes]])

It hasn't updated in a while but the writer seems like they might pick it up again.

  When Harry saves the three witches of the Delacour family, he activates a rare Veela phenomenon. Now his life just got even more complicated and he has many things to figure out with little time to do so. Despite this, he's about to find out that saving people does pay of sometimes. Temporary hiatus. See profile for explanation.
