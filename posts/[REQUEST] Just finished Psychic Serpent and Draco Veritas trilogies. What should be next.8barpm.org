What are some of the other well-known, well-regarded, pretty-large HP stories out there? (already read HPMOR) I've got 20 minutes a day doing cardio to read, so looking to get started on something else.

I'm mainly a H/Hr and D/G fan btw.


** Arc of Sacrifices/The Saving Connor series is pretty good IMO, but be warned it is breathtakingly long. Right now I'm re reading the 4th book (out of 7) because I stopped halfway through the 6th due to time issues, and I couldn't remember some important plot details. It's a Harry's twin brother is the BWL, and wildly AU.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
