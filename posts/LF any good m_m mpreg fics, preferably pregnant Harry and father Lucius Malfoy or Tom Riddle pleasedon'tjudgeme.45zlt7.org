** To each there own. That being said your request is difficult not to judge. But whatever. I'd suggest trying [[https://archiveofourown.org]] and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org]]. Both are heavily slash dominated, I'm sure you can find what you are looking for.

** When you say slash with mpreg, I think you also want lemons/explicit material? I don't mind mpreg, but I tend to read either fluffy romance or much darker slash stories, neither of which tend to have mpreg. I also haven't read much Lucius/Harry, and wouldn't know what to recommended because of that. So these are all Tom/Harry. With that in mind I'll continue with the recommendations. The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10221383/1/Kitty-Love][Kitty Love]] series is very popular linkffn(10221383), but I've never liked it that much (I find it a bit too cliche and childish). The same for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264186/1/Surge-de-Hydra][Surge de Hydra]] linkffn(10264186), and really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3996465/Watermelonsmellinfellon][Watermelonsmellinfellon]], but if you are willing to read anything, give them a try. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/604625][Meant To Be]] linkao3(604625) is unfinished and more kidfic then mpreg.

No mpreg slash stories: I can not recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445][SCHOOLED]] linkao3(384445) enough for the plot, but it hasn't updated in a while, and it has lost its way a little. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard]] linkao3(266699) is very sweet. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] linkao3(439865) has been recommended before I'm sure, but if you haven't seen it, it is worth a read. For something more recently finished, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11330784/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sympathy-of-Souls][Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls]] linkffn(11330784) is more romance then slash as such, but still worth a read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10461074/1/The-Devil-s-Playground][The Devil's Playground]] linkffn(10461074) is excellent with a great possessive Tom. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9214710/1/The-Vitruvian-Man][The Vitruvian Man]] linkffn(9214710) is an old favorite of mine with a nice developing relationship. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) is a nicely darker story, if that's your thing. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/658024][Consort]] linkao3(658024) is also dark slash. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3544205][Artificial Affection]] linkao3(3544205) is even darker (warning: is rape).

If you have read everything here, I can dig up so of the less well known stuff if you need.

EDIT: Ug, I just realised all those links are the wrong way around, Fixed I hope. ffnbot!refresh

**** There are only a few of us slash fans (and fewer mpreg fans) around here, so it takes us a little longer to get to the recommendation threads :)

If your looking for kid fics, there is a bunch of Harry raises himself fics out there, and currently there is a thread about Harry raised by other then the Dursley's that might be worth a try. If you are after Harry raises a kid fics.... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5220289/1/Divergence][Divergence]] is lovely and comes to mind immediately linkffn(5220289) but I'd have to think for any others.

  Meanwhile, Harry and Voldemort have a lot of sex. this started out as serious non-con porn and then somehow ended up with hardcore feels and a possible existential crisis. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me.
