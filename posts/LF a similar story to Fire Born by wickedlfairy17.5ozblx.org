I personally loved this story, the only problem is it being so short. Is there anything similar out there that I may like?

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

- so maybe you could recommend one? I only searched like 30 minutes though, and these are hard to find with the ffn search or even the Scryer.

I love the tone of this, and the kinda dark tone - dark, but also hopeful, in a way.

However, what intrigues me the most is the relationship between Tom and Harry. Harry is somewhat broken after getting killed over and over, but not totally. Still wants to protect the only few friends he ever had, but has given up everyone else. Tom Riddle is a sociopath, and uses Harry, but she knows and she's okay with it.

It's just a fucked up situation, that in this story is somewhat beautiful.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
