:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic in which Sirius attempts suicide near Christmas in Grimmauld Place, but Remus and Harry come and save him just in time. Then it turns out this depression wasn't really a depression, but a curse that Malfoy Sr put on him. Idk, just sounds interesting to reread.
