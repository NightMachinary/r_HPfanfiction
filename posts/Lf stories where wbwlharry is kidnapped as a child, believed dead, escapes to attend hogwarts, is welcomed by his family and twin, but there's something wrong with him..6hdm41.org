** An idea that comes to mind is that Harry was kidnapped and taken to Africa to be a chocolate-farm slave, before being found and rescued by the African branch of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad after turning a crate of cocoa beans into a crate of spiders.

Unfortunately I can't think of anything to fill it out and turn it into a mini-fic, sorry.

*** I can't believe there aren't a half dozen recs already. It's not that huge a divergence from wbwl cliche.

As i typed, i imagined a story where he's kidnapped as a toddler and trained to be the enemy of his alleged champion brother. He returns and is welcomed but he's sorted to slytherin. His parents and siblings don't care. But there's something about him that worries them. He's moody at times, won't speak of his confinement, fights with other slytherins.

Then Draco disappears. Then other children of death eaters begin to disappear. Albus suspects harry but there's no proof.

Then lucius malfoy is killed---by flesh eating beetles attacking him---in the lobby of the ministry on the day james brings the twins to work to see what an auror does. Harry's got no alibi for it but there are no witnesses.

*** This sounds like it could be a good crack fic where he gets in and out of all kinds of trouble in the most ridiculous ways. Maybe he's become really good at escaping authorities, so he's constantly disappearing from the school. He hates chocolate with a passion and Quirrelmort is revealed after they get into an argument about vampires or something and he pours hot chocolate over his turban, burning both faces. He keeps flying off the pitch to merlin-knows-where during practice and games, so someone like maybe Fred and George have been assigned to keeping track of him, but he somehow keeps figuring out their tricks. I don't know, it sounds like it could be fun.

**** Dramatic plot twist when he encounters dementors and their normal counter, chocolate, doesn't work for him as it should? And then his boggart becomes a sticky brown dementor (eww), and his Riddikulus makes it start singing the Great Mighty Poo song (EWW!)?

***** Yes yes yes I would read this! Also random interludes where he's run off to Central Africa in the middle of the school year and we, alongside Dumbledore, have no idea how he got there.

** Harry is delivered the night of Halloween and taken to the Dursley family, James and Lily are in a coma at St. Mungos. For years Vernon and Petunia indoctrinate him against the evils of the 'magical cult' that Lily got drawn into by a manipulative old man. They tell Harry that the 'wizards' led his mother into interacting with terrorists and they saved him from that kind of life. They teach him never to trust magicians and any kind of magic he does is just delusions left over from early conditioning. When Lily recovers, she finds her son a haunted and mistrustful boy who still loves his mother, even if he's trying to save her from what he thinks is decades of conditioning.
