It's always seemed to me like such a violation to not just privacy, but something like the imperius, and it dehumanises the person it is happening to. Possession conveys that you lack control of yourself entirely, just way worse than the imperius because you can't even fight it. I've always been puzzled over Ginny's lack of trauma over being possessed for an entire year. If there are any fanfictions which concentrate on her being affected then they'd be highly welcome.


** It is surprisingly little studied aspect of the HP universe. I can offer just two stories by keeptheotherone on FFnet: linkffn(7460529;7685065). Elsewhere it is usually just mentioned, or there are weird dark!Ginny stories, which I don't care about.

Also, I still wonder about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f67nlv/exploding_snap_from_the_cursed_child/]]

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** linkffn(Identity by MarauderLover7) has a lot of Ginny and Tom POV, showing how he got inside her head and started remodeling. It's the third in a series, though.

Harry and Ginny know each other better in the series, so he also sees a bit more of the aftermath for her in the next book, Impose, but it's not a focus.

The name of the fic is "Black Ink, Red Rose", and it's the exact opposite of wholesome. Also, technically it shouldn't be linked on this sub because of rule 8, though plenty of people have done so in the past.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I agree that theres not a lot of fics that showcase this. Jenorama on Ao3 created her own little Potterverse before the books ended and in her main story California Dreamin' this is sort of addressed. (No major spoilers but it involves a Horcrux that Ginny hears and Harry wonders if its something to do with what happened to her in her first year at Hogwarts) If you dont mind Hinny, give it a read, a long story, well written, has prequels leading up to it and sequels after.
