Maybe its just because Ive seen too much shounen anime but it kinda is a bummer to me that this series never had something resembling a traditional fighting tournament.

You have the triwizard tournament but that doesnt really have them fighting each other.

You have duelling club and dumbledores army where they spar but its not really explored that much pointing out characters strengths and weaknesses and exploring them.

It could be pretty interesting to see how characters behave in this situation. Who adapts well and who doesnt ( for example Hermione is more competent but also more prone to freaking out in stressful situations she could need an arc where she learns to think more under stress). And then see their growth pay off in the end battle.

So how would you do a hogwarts battle tournament?


** The problem is that a fighting tournament usually needs a lot of convoluted plot devices to make it viable in any non-sports story. In Harry Potter, you need to think of a very good reason why people who have been fighting in an actual, lethal conflict since first year would care much about a tournament - and why there would be charater growth there, and not in actual adventures and fights. And a lot of what would make the tournament viable as a plot is already used for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

So, my idea would be: Use the TWT, and make it a Tri-School Tournament, perhaps with a great prize or something, or the "sabotage, forced to compete" canon plot device.

Alternatively, replace Quidditch with duelling as the spotlight sport. See Harry, Ron and Hermione face Draco and the other Slytherin scum every year and weather cheating, assassination attempts, and sabotage.

Voldemort won and has all Muggleborn fight in a tournament in a Roman-style "bread and games" PR stunt.

*** You could alternatively go for more the fantasy route and make the fighting more... interactive.

But for the actual tournament, I agree it's bad. I suppose the dueling club would work for plot, but even that seems forced.

** So, Incubus by SquareRootBeer actually had a dueling tournament as part of the Triwizard tournament and I thought it did a decent job of an anime-style fighting tournament, where fighters were differentiated according to their nature (Ron fights tactically, Hermione purposely drags out her fight to learn spells from her opponent, etc) but it's not very long overall and it's definitely just window dressing to move the smut along.

I'd link it, but I think it was just recently taken off FFN? And it'd violate sub rules regardless, due to underage content.

*** This reminded me of linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) by jbern where the author incorporated duels and other events into the Triwizard Tournament. There were some stereotyping going on--Durmstrang students being more prone to Dark spells, etc--but the duels were fast-paced and there were clear differing styles.

Plus the Sorting Hat is the sassiest entity known to mankind, which is always a plus.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and something I think could work is a postwar story where, in order to promote inter-house unity, the staff set up an optional, school-wide tournament where students have to register in teams of three, with the caveat that no two members of one team can be from the same house. Each match it's either a team battle, or a series of one-on-one fights.

** The thing is, magical combat in HP is pretty straight-forward unless you are at least on a McGonagall level of competency and therefore quite boring, especially if you take schoolchildren as contestants. I have read quite a few duelling tournaments and frankly, they all sucked. They either needlessly drag on despite the result being plainly visible from round 1 (Harry wins) or don't get the audience invested in the MC winning. Who cares if they win some trophy? And any reason short of "bread and games" feels incredibly forces (eg needing the prize money for something vital) and in case of a dystopian world with gladiators, the tournament would only be the cover for the main plot, namely overthrowing the dictatorship which makes them fight.
