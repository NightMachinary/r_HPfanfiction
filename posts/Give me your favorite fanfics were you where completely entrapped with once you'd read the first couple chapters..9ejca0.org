Steelbadger somehow manages to blend Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings together while still retaining the feeling of both unique stories. Shits great.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.

*** Wow. Thank you for this one. I've just finished reading it, and it is a really good read. Despite myself, I cried.

A couple of picky britpic moments (particularly given the era), but that really feels churlish to point out when the rest is so good. An excellent exploration of how Sirius and Regulus could have ended up where they did.

**** Oh wow, that's weird --- she actually is British! (At least, she says she is.) When I got your comment, I tried to remember why I was so positive of this, and finally remembered and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12704985/6/They-re-Hiding-Inside-Me][found this Author's Note.]]

Do you think it's just because of the general Americanization of the U.K. and its language over the past couple decades?

Anyway, speaking of nitpicking, I really need to focus on the rest of your comment, haha. Yes, I know, right? Such a startlingly good story. I cried too, haha, and I never cry over fanfic! She's one of my favorite writers in the HP fandom.

***** Well, we don't have mimosas in the UK: we have Buck's Fizz and it took me until basically this year to realise that it was what Americans meant when they said mimosas. ‘Mimosa' hasn't really impinged on our culture or vocabulary at all. And we certainly didn't have mimosas at Sunday brunch in England in the 1970s, even as code for someone being gay!

And the story has people thinking Peter looks chavvy, and talking about making him look more like a chav, and the only way a British person could think someone in the 1970s would use the word like that (let alone someone raised in an aristocratic bubble!) is if they were under 16, which I am fairly sure the author is not! ‘Chav' like that wasn't really a thing until the 2000s, and it's not like that knowledge is obscure in the UK: like I say, you'd have to basically be a child to not be aware of it. It's a really jarring word choice, in a fic that otherwise uses words very carefully and effectively. The author has too good a sense of words for her to make this mistake, if she is an adult who grew up in the UK.

It's entirely possible the author mostly lives in the UK (hence visiting America, and returning to the UK), which may have helped them with the sense of place that pervades the fic so beautifully, but that doesn't mean these aren't Britpicking moments!

** ...Considering I just posted about Keter-class memetic hazards created by self-replicating curses, my mind immediately went in a very different direction when I read the title. Like, imagine a book that /actually/ entrapped you when you read it? Within the book, or maybe in place, or maybe it just hijacked your mind and made you keep reading forever.

Scary...

*** Makes me think of a different kind of Tom Riddle diary that instead of sucking out your life force when you write in it, it instead sucks out your lifeforce as you read the entries.

***** I think more people would just be blah about it if the fans didn't present it as some sort of mythically amazing holy text of perfect writing and rationality, the likes of which has never graced something as low as fanfic before.

I mean, for goodness sakes, the subreddit where people discussed it as it was written was full of people proposing ‘what if there was a secret fifth house that Harry was sorted into' as if it was some brilliant original idea, while still disdaining the very fandom that had already explored and mocked Sparkleypoo for many years by this point. It was an attempt at a full-blown tract disguised as fanfic, and its relationship with both fanfic (despite being an example of it) and the Harry Potter fandom is... strained.

*** Read this when it was still ongoing. I can't pinpoint what drew me in but I couldn't stop reading it, then following the chapters as they came out one by one. Even followed their Facebook page. But if you ask me to read this again, I won't be able to anymore. Too tedious.
