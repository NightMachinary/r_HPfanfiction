I enjoyed both and found though they had similar character developments and plot threads. I do not mean either of them copied the other just very similar in a few key way's.

1. Harry understands magic differently and better than most
2. Harry has ties to said magic are tied to another realm/energy
3. Harry does feats of magic beyond others
4. Harry ends up in a secluded place
5. Harry ends up immortal.
6. vampires and creatures plays a part.
7. being a mad scientist does also.

now their are alot of ways they are seperate, and very different just found that those 7 tropes by 2 stories written similar times are interesting.


** So, do you mean that Blindness is " For the love of Magic" except tha racism, islamophobia, big dick Harry energy? Or that " For the Love of Magic" is Blindness with racism, islamophobia and big dick Harry?

Ugh.
