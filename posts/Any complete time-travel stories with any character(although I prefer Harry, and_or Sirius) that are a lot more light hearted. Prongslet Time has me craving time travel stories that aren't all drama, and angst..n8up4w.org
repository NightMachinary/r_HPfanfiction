  At the age of 20, Harry finds himself drawn to the Veil of Death. After falling through, he ends up back in time in his one year old body. Harry vows to save everyone, with the help of Sirius. With his parents and friends alive and well in this new life, Harry finally finds true happiness. Mostly crack fic and lots of cliche time travel tropes are used (but with a twist).

** [[http://clairesnook.com/fiction/if-heaven-falls-part-one/][If Heaven Falls]] starts of gnarly (fair warning, Harry dies in the graveyard pretty soon into the fic) but Dobby is the main character in this and he is a tiny and hilarious badass. I really like it because 1. it's a Cedric lives au 2. Harry actually sits and empathises with Dobby's trauma from being with the Malfoys 3. It has some of the most hilarious conversations I've ever read, because Dobby knows what he's doing and he feels he's being very clear but the humans are like â€˜did you just...what?' And it's great 4. The writer doesn't dwell once the time travel happens, it's not a long drawn out angst fest, it doesn't feel heavy at all

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45993925]]) this one is hilarious and great. It's a competent and jaded head of the DMLE Harry ending up in a tiny Harry's body and he doesn't let that stop him from breaking Sirius out and then teaming up with him for shenanigans. It's not like pranks and stuff either. It's not finished but I like the tone of it

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5137164/1/]]) is a trip. It's wacky as hell and gets very violent in places and the last chapter has a weird philosophical conversation that doesn't fit the rest of the fic...but it's certainly not angsty

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209/chapters/25775856]]) is one of my favourite ensemble fics, Lavender and Luna are the saving grace of it. Just...werewolf Lavender pining after a young and just in the cusp of defecting Severus Snape...it's great

Anyway those are all different in tone so hopefully you'll like at least one of them

  Everything went horribly, massively wrong. So Hermione went through time to fix it, although that went arguably worse. So there was nothing left but to try again, and that time ran into errors nobody expected.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
