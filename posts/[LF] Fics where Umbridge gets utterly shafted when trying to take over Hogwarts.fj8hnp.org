Just finished reading linkffn ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]]) after stumbling over it here..

Please send some other stuff my way where someone makes Umbridge pay for the bullshit she pulls in Book 5..

Either by giving her enough rope to hang herself with her actions or just straight up slapping her down..


** I'm afraid I don't know any that fit you request, but I wanted to ask what you thought of this fic and how you found it?

*** Someone requested stories with Harry teaching and it came up..

If you bear in mind when it was written it's a pretty good fic.. A lot of the tropes the challenge relies on, and the story adds on top wasn't as trope'y when the challenge was issued and the fic written..
