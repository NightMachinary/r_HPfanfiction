None of the Tropes of bsaically Evil moustache twirling Dumbledore, but a Dumbledore that will actively mow down the Death Eaters so they can't kill more people. "Oh, they're all trapped in Azkaban. Let's wait til there's a guard shift and burn it down with Fiendfyre" not a good guy, but actively working towards the Greater Good without being a bad Troper. Bonus points if he encourages Harry to do the same. "If faced with one of Voldemort's supporters, put them in the ground. Though I dislike killing, eliminating those who would kill many like that, is for the Greater Good" sort of thing. "Kill 1 to save 10. 10 to save 100, 100 to save 1000" logic


** Not to nitpick but... would Azkaban even need guard shifts? Dementors are amortal after all.

Also, a mad utilitarian Dumbledore sounds hilarious. :)))

*** Human guards are mentioned. So they'd have to have shifts or the guards would go batshit insane. But Kiritsugu like Dumbledore would actually be real Greater Good, is why i want to see it

**** When were human guards ever mentioned? The closest was Lucius mentioning that the Azkaban guards wouldn't like Hagrid yelling, but it was obviously referencing the Dementors considering how Hagrid's face went pale.

***** When Fudge visited Sirius. It might just be fanon that I'm mistaking a warden. But there would at least have to be a skeleton crew. I doubt Dementors would be willing to provide Food etc.

****** Prisoner of Azkaban doesn't mention a warden. And Dementors would have to provide food, and they'd want to have to. Otherwise within two days (or less, given how mentally fractured the prisoners already are) they'd have no food themselves, and their hunger for despair seems to dominate their minds.

******* I suppose they have house elves as well, but i was just imagining a Dementor using a Stove. I was more wondering on the How, i suppose. Even if they just have a blanket and some gruel, it seems beyond a Dementor to provide.

  Wherein Dumbledore trades a pair of socks, a package of chocolate frogs, and a warm fire for an extra day in the office and we learn that being well-rested is overrated.

** I mean, the story would be over well before Harry was born, I think. At least with Voldemort as a villian.

Hell, a pure utilitarian Dumbledore would probably train Tom Riddle personally to prevent him from turning evil, given how powerful Tom was.

*** Still make an interesting read. utilitarian Dumbledore going through the first War. How everyone, the older generation, the marauders, how they all react to Dumbledore kicking ass. They capture a Death Eater, milk him dry with Veritaserum, execute him and then use the information.
