Peeves steals Quirrel's turban in the Great Hall

Goyle going through every single wand in Ollivander's shop without a single one picking him

A canon-compliant account of how Quirrel manages to get past all the obstacles and almost grasp the Philosopher's Stone.

D&D AU where Harry is a half-elf Wild Magic Sorcerer, Voldemort is a Yuan-ti Pureblood Warlock, and Snape is an Artificer Wizard Tiefling.

The Goblet of Fire spews out the name 'Bartemius Crouch'.

The boy who lived turns out to be some random muggle kid whose MacDonald employee parents refused to serve Voldemort three times.

The Sorting Hat, the Sword of Gryffindor, the Elder Wand, the Invisibility Cloak, the Goblet of Fire, the basilisk, and Luna Lovegood are the horcruxes.

A montage of what would have happened at every stage were Harry and co. to have died to to the actions of inept adults. (Malfunctioning broom, the corridor, encountering the basilisk in Hogwarts, Chamber of Secrets, Dementor's Kiss, Moody just kidnaps him at the start of the year, Dementor's Kiss again, etc.)

The twins steal the Philosopher's stone.

Dobby assassinates every member of the Death Eaters.

AU where everyone is slightly more competent, including teachers, students, politicians, and Death Eaters.

The setting is changed to that of Persona.

Luna is a thestral animagus.

Xenophilius Lovegood POV

Voldemort is an eccentrically sinister yet not evil DADA teacher.

Snape uses the Dark Mark to lure the rest of the Death Eaters -- and Voldemort -- into a trap.

Luna gets the diary instead.

Ron finds the Death Note.

Dark Lord Flamel.

Voldemort is brought back with the Resurrection Stone, and is forced to mentor a woefully incompetent Dark Lord wannabe so that they can conquer the world.

Myrtle gets her revenge.

Voldemort manages to repair his soul as Harry Potter calls him out and he feels remorse. The entire wizarding world is outraged as he dies with a contented look upon his face.

Harry is killed early on in his adventures, and comes back as a ghost. This makes killing Voldemort a whole lot harder.

Tom Riddle is the Gamer.

Hermione is a pureblood. The Weasley children are Muggle-born, except for Percy.

Owls are used to hunt down the location of Voldemort.

We see what Voldemort's boggart turns into.

Pretty sure this one has already been used in some AU or other. I've definitely seen it at least once, though I'll be jinxed if I can remember where.

That also has been done before --- I think.

Canonically, he sees himself dead.

**** /Slaps forehead/ Why didn't I think of that.

Mind you, I /also/ have clear memories of a regular seven-year AU whose Second Year plot just ended with the reveal that it had been Luna rather than Ginny.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/][*/Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6415261/The-madness-in-me][/The madness in me/]]

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

  Voldemort avoided death as a spirit for 13 years. Strangely, he couldn't avoid a bus. One Shot.

  The twins steal the Philosopher's stone.
#+end_quote

That idea really makes me afraid of what the twins would do with something like the Philosopher's Stone

#+begin_quote
  Dobby assassinates every member of the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

We have no idea how powerful House-Elves actually are (I mean we did see Dobby attack Lucius, because he was going to attack Harry). Seeing something like that would be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  AU where everyone is slightly more competent, including teachers, students, politicians, and Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

Yes please.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Ooh! I'd like to read that.

#+begin_quote
  Luna gets the diary instead.
#+end_quote

Ooh, I wonder how she'd react to it? That'd be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Ron finds the Death Note
#+end_quote

Oh dear, that'd be terrifying yet interesting! Draco you better apologize for everything you've done!

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort manages to repair his soul as Harry Potter calls him out and he feels remorse. The entire wizarding world is outraged as he dies with a contented look upon his face.
#+end_quote

Would be interesting if you could pull it off.

#+end_quote

I like that idea!

If anyone knows of any stories that has these plots, let me know.

#+end_quote

Strangely enough, I think I've seen fics for all four of these.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]] has a time-travelling Snape begrudgingly saving Harry via time turner every time he gets killed.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12002179/1/Out-of-Bounds][Out of Bounds]] is a one-shot which features, not just the Weasley twins, but practically every student, competing to reach the end of the third-floor corridor in the shortest time.\\
And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11029663/1/Promotion][Promotion]] is apparently about everyone being a tad more competent. I haven't read it for a while so I couldn't say, but I do remember a scene where Quirrelmort foregoes the troll attack, just unleashes the basilisk into the Great Hall, and uses the diversion to murder Harry (who he put in detention beforehand) and go for the Philosopher's Stone.

...Unfortunately, I can't remember the fic I saw with Dobby (or was it Kreacher?) being used as an assassin. It was something to do with a marriage law and mass-slaughtering all the candidates? It started with Hermione helping to sort the various options for marriage and ended with the reveal that the house-elf was behind the killings.
