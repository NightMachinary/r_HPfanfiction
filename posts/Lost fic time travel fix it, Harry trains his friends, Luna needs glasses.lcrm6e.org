:END:
I can't remember which fic this is. I don't think it's Nightmares of Futures past, but it has a very similar premise where Harry goes back to his first year in his eleven year old body and starts training his friends in magic and martial arts. At one point he realizes that Luna can't see well and she winds up getting glasses.

Thanks in advance!
