Not slash is prefered


** There is a new story in the Work By Author section of darklordpotter forums called Realignment with this exact premise.

Harry Potter is somehow in the past during the Grindelwald era, during Tom's fifth or sixth year in Hogwarts, and is intent on killing him. Dumbledore takes up the role of protecting Tom. It's pretty cool.

It's possible you won't be able to access it, you need to be signed in as a user on their forum and I think there was a recent change that you have to have some minimum level of posting before you can view the Work By Author section.

**** Well, it technically says "dead" in the description, ahahahaha. My heart died and shattered in tiny little pieces the first time I read it through and found that it was abandoned though.

***** I can imagine. Being told it is completed and then finding out otherwise is worse than a WIP never finishing. EDIT: And while it does say "Dead", I dont think that is clear the story was abandoned especially when it says completed. If i hadn't jumped into the reviews before starting, I would have been crushed

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
