Preferably set in the Ministry of Magic and/or in a democratic setting. Just no more eleven-year-olds politicking or yet another heir of house of so and so, please.

Something like linkao3(and whose army? by renaissance), linkao3(The Accidental Renaissance of Zacharias Smith by renaissance), and linkao3(How to Win Votes and Alienate People) ?


** You may enjoy reading this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/13/Victoria-Potter]]

It's a newspaper article I wrote for Victoria Potter which reports on some new legislation, and suggests various different political factions for wizarding Britain (none of which are "the pure-bloods").

#+begin_quote
  It's 2005. The war against Voldemort is still being fought. Muggleborn and rendered wandless, Anthony lost contact with the magical world eight years ago. Now the war wants him back, whether he likes it or not.

  A chronicle of the events of the 2019 elections in Magical Britain, in which duels were fought, a lot of tough questions were asked, all the candidates had their sex lives thoroughly examined by the popular press (to the delight of Luna Lovegood and the dismay of the other three candidates), Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had a falling out over the Rotfang Conspiracy, Lucian Bole accidentally alienated literally everyone in Britain, Zacharias Smith and Draco Malfoy interfered in everyone's business and the magical press had a field day. In short, business as usual, in wizarding politics.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
