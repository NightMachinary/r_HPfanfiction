I don't mean not to have Ron as part of the trio or that he's a worse friend, but I get a sense that Harry and Hermione actually have a really strong friendship on their side, so I'd love to see snippets of this - maybe when Ron is in the throes of jealousy or with Lavender. Thanks!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9901010][baby birds and other adventures]] by dirgewithoutmusic is an AU where Harry was best friends with Hermione in the muggle world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30090315][light to fight your shadows]] by DoctorSyntax is Viktor/Hermione fic, but it has one of the most nuanced and beautiful portrayal of Harry and Hermione's friendship as well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12138477][A late night]] by TheQueen features a really cute missing scene from Chamber of Secrets

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7698729/1/][Take Care Of Her]] by JennyGranger features Harry and Hermione in Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6684273/1/][The Memorial]] by MarsPotter is another missing scene fic in Deathly Hallows, this time with Harry and Hermione by Dobby's grave.

  Harry did not know this and would not know this until Mrs. Granger mentioned it casually over a Christmas dinner years and years later-- but she and Mr. Granger reported the Dursleys for child abuse and neglect, over and over.The reports got lost-- minds scrubbed down, papers vanished-- but they kept calling in reports. They considered kidnapping. They couldn't imagine why the wizarding world might want to keep their chosen one somewhere so toxic, why they might want to keep this underfed child and his messy hair with those people."My mother left me a blood protection spell," said Harry, whose scar had not ached in years. He poked at his mashed potatoes under the focused attention of Mrs. Granger's stern little forehead wrinkle. "I had to live with family, blood family.""Then they should have made them treat you right," Mrs. Granger said, as though it was that simple.Mr. Granger gave Harry another helping of peas.

  When an urgent need for safety accidentally brings Hermione and Harry very far off the beaten path and forces their horcrux hunt to a screeching halt, she and Viktor must decide whether they're going to waste or embrace some unexpected holiday magic.

  Harry walked out of Shell Cottage, the weight of the world on his shoulders. He walked down to the beach, following the path that took him by Dobby's final resting place. He needed to get out and get away from everyone.
