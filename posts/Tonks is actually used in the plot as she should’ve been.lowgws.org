The situation: Harry needs to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in order to get the horcrux. He needs to do this under a Bellatrix disguise, which will not alert the goblins and either not be able to be undone, or able to be applied very quickly if it is undone.

Wow, if only Jo had established a character who: a) could change her appearance at will, and b) was literally blood-related to Bella!

Oh wait.

Funny thing is, I haven't ever seen anyone bring this up before...

EDIT: thank you for all of your contributions! A lot of people have pointed out that Tonks had just given birth. My point was that Tonks is used in the plot as she should've been, and my interpretation of that is that Teddy never existed, or at least didn't come in the middle of a literal war.

Jo tends to make every. single. woman. a mother, and I just don't like it; I feel as though Tonks had so much potential and Jo wasted it by the Teddy plot which basically renders her and Remus useless in DH. But anyways. Thank you for the discussion!!


** That could be a really interesting conversation. Harry and co pop into wherever Remus and Tonks are hiding. Remus is out. They explain the situation to Tonks, who leaves Teddy with Andromeda and starts preparing to leave. Just then Remus walks in. When he finds out what's going on, he's pissed. He wasn't allowed to accompany his friend's son, was even insulted for wanting to, and here his wife just gets an invite?

"Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. 'You!' he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. 'Your wand's here, son,' said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. 'It fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that's my wife you're shouting at.' 'Oh, I'm - I'm sorry." As she moved into the room, Mrs. Tonks resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder."

Which, would tie into him being upset if something goes wrong and Tonks gets hurt. Maybe after the war, the story is fully explained but after the incident, they're still tight lipped about it and he gets angry and basically burns some bridges.

Maybe he'd be upset if he was explicitly told he couldn't go with them on the bank heist because his motivation wouldn't be the same as before and, at that point, it would feel more like he was just being excluded because he's not useful or not trusted or /insert other paranoid feeling from growing up as an outcast/.

** This isn't a prompt, but just a general frustration at JKR's writing for establishing so many (not always, and not exhaustively) interesting female characters who she then proceeded to underutilise at every possible turn outside of as female stock characters.

Fleur Delacour, the most powerful and skilled student at Beauxbatons that year, representative of her school, working with goblins in a foreign language, presumably as a curse breaker, or some kind of financial role... becomes a little wife who can do a bit of first aid. Her Headmistress, Madame Maxime, a skilled leader and half-human rights advocate - surely perfectly-placed to become a Hermione confidant? - disappears completely from the narrative after one sidequest.

Tonks, as the prompt suggests, becomes a little wife, until she goes into battle where she is almost immediately killed off after, presumably, despite working in a job that rewards stealth, deciding to fight Voldemort's top lieutenant head-on.

Mrs Weasley, clearly a skilled duelist, choosing /not/ to physically help out the Order except for by cleaning the safehouse for 4 years. Angelina Johnson, a respected leader of her peers at school, and one of the few characters of color, disappearing off the radar until she can come back as a wife in the epilogue. And so on and so forth.

*** man, the shrieking shack podcast has given me so many thoughts about how fleur could have turned out. like maybe instead of only having the Pretty™ veela power, she can turn into a full-on flaming bird monster like the veelas at the world cup did. and she WHIPS ASS at the first task, but karkaroff is a wizard supremacist so he gives her a zero or one or whatever. and madame maxime is like oh we're playing that game? krum gets a zero too. so they're tanking each others' scores, and cedric and harry rise to the top anyway without fleur bombing the second task for no reason other than Plot Needed It.

and half blood prince. whew. flaming bird monster fleur WHIPPING ASS AGAIN when the death eaters attack the school? flaming bird monster fleur saving her fiancé from greyback, but oh no, he fucked her face up!

or not even have this character flipped version of that exchange. just have molly realize how badly she misjudged fleur when she's lying there in the hospital wing. or have bill try for the presumed umpteenth time to explain to molly that he loves /her,/ not her looks. (do we even hear from bill in canon on why he likes fleur at all?)

and this would set up a fleur and lavender connection after canon. but that's two pretty and "shallow" girls interacting positively, can't have that.

I wasn't really going from fanon or from JK's statements (because I didn't know that tbh!), just the books as we see.

And what those books show us is Molly Weasley in the kitchen for 7 books and then at the very end of book 7, Molly Weasley pretty easily defeating the boss villain's top henchman all by herself. Which suggests that she could have done that several books ago if she wasn't having too much fun making sauce come out of her wand and chasing pixies out of curtains.

Of course, it's very possible that JKR didn't intend that, but unfortunately she didn't really make that clear in the text :')

Let me rephrase that. As young as Teddy is at that point, he's a screaming potato with no personality. Tonks is a character with tons of personality that we care about. Not that we were given a choice, but i would rather Teddy gets killed and Tonks has to live through it.

...i mean, if you have too many characters, try killing them off by order of least importance, and a baby with no personality, that could become the next chief terrorist just as easily as a good person, is a good candidate.

But back to your prompt: Yes, that would have been the easiest and most logical way to go about it, but what about the way they acted in the 7th book made sense. Sure, there is the Horcrux to factor in, but why would they come in direct contact with it. They knew about the dangers of that from Ginny's experience with the diary and Dumbledore's cursed hand.

** On the subject of Tonks having a role...

I once had a plot bunny for a time travel fic. The premise of the fic was that post-epilogue, a Death Eater travels back in time to kill Harry Potter in the past. Harry in the present day, however, somehow survives the change in time. He wakes up in a Voldemort-ruled world, very confused. After some narrow escapes from the Death Eater Ministry, he manages to find the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix.

Only this isn't the Order he remembers. They're bitter and dark. They don't trust him and have no interest in his hair-brained scheme to travel back in time to prevent the 1996 murder of Harry Potter by a Death Eater who appeared from nowhere.

Most bitter of all is Remus Lupin. Harry soon finds out why: a number of years ago the Order captured and killed Narcissa Malfoy and installed Tonks in her place, pretending to be the wife of Lucius Malfoy as the Order's mole inside Death Eater ranks. Which of course means Tonks is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy, making a cuckold of Lupin, who has to act supportive of the whole situation because it's for the cause. Only it's been a few years now, and Tonks seems to be getting a bit too comfortable in her life as Mrs Malfoy...

I love Remus, I like reading about him but the pairing with Tonks honestly ruined both of their characters. Lupin simply changed into someone who abandoned his family and Tonks just became somewhat of a ‘serious' character who was just there to break the stereotype that werewolves can find love as well. Good for them to find love in a time like war but the pairing didn't just have enough chemistry to actually work.

** Tonks is such an disappointment in the story. She has these cool and incredibly useful powers that are only played for laughs, and after book 5 she never really becomes relevant again. Her character is really great as well and I wish she would've appeared more as her own character, but instead she's used for the most unnecessary, underdeveloped and overall weird romance in the entire series (and there's quite a few of those in HP).

*** It's because her character is used by Rowling simply to cause conflict in relation to Remus, then another person to die off to show how bad war is.

Rowling had a major metaphorical boner for that sort of thing. I was honestly surprised that -she- died though. Rowling... well, let's just say I'm surprised.

** Remind me, this happens after Harry already had his angry outburst to Remus, refusing his help, right? Harry is not a hardened strategist, he's a teen whose background -- we are shown again and again -- makes him horrified at the thought of his battle putting other people in danger. Someone who is alive because his parents died for him. Which we see echoed in Neville's story.

Harry's motivations being skewed by his compassion is what ultimately leads him to choosing to die, and that sacrifice is what ultimately defeats Voldemort.

So having Tonks as an 'unused chess piece' is how she should have been used, in the tragic / dramatic sense. Although it is not the absolutely smartest play that would be made by someone more battle hardened. That's what Dumbledore would have done, not what Harry would have done.

***** Too true, the battle was do-or-die, but what I said doesn't contradict Lupin not going on Order missions, as the Gringotts heist isn't a Order mission.

And the bit about him not going on missions is probably only after his confrontation with Harry about leaving Tonks and Teddy. So he propably rethought his prior commitment bacause of Harry and would change his mind again *for* Harry.

But that is highly speculative and in all honesty they wouldn't need Lupin, but Tonks. So there would is no reason for him to help in the heist except for planning maybe.

Though I would think most Order members would agree to do something in regards to Gringotts, as it is a clear objective for the war and the only reason why they didn't is because they didn't know. The battle was different, as a call for arms went out and they knew it was about to happen.

*** As someone else said she was in the battle of Hogwarts less than 24 hours later. To add to that, she's a metamorphmagus who can change anything about herself including her gender or bone structure... pretty sure child birth won't be as bad for her as other women if she can just stretch her vaginal opening and anything else she needs to do.

** I don't know if this is canon or fanon, but I read somewhere that in her normal base form Tonks looks a lot like Bellatrix, and since she doesn't want to be associated with her she changes her look to what we're familiar with. If thats canon, she could have snuck in to get the cup and her transformation wouldn't have been cancelled because its her base form.

*** Tonks looking like Bellatrix is fanon. AFAIK we get no hint as to what she looks like "normally" (if such a thing can even be applied to a metamorphmagus, we /really/ don't know much about how it works), although since Bellatrix is her aunt it's plausible that there's a family resemblance.

** Honestly one of the things that annoys me the most about the horcrux hunt is that dumbledore was like only these three teenagers can go on the hunt and no one else can know and so that's just what happens after he dies when that makes no sense. Dumbledore already was searching for horcruxes before he died, why not send out tonks, moody, Remus etc. on the hunt for example, they were way more skilled and qualified and actual adults and not child soldiers. The fact that no one in the order is trusted to do more of that work is so dumb, I hate dumbledore.

Tonks is a skilled auror with a super useful talent and a blood connection to bellatrix and yet the most we see her get to do is act as a guard and fight in a few battles and then die off screen after going to play wife and mother at like 25 years old in the middle of a war. I don't believe that people as invested in the war as tonks and Remus would be careless enough to have a kid during the war and they really ruined tonks character turning her into Remus love interested

But of course jk had to take her two most queer coded characters marry them together and then kill them off

** This is a great idea, and i have seen many interesting additions in the comments. It would have a lot more impact on Tonks' death later on, or even if she dies/gets hurt ob this mission and would be so much more tragic when Harry then needs to take on a bigger part in Teddy's life, in part because of Tonks' death maybe caused by his actions and his invite/ask for help on that mission. However I dont think Harry and co knew where Remus and Tonks where hiding, I assume they are, given the situation at that point in DH. I also think it would have taken away a little from the feeling of them growing up and doing things without the help of others that DH really does well, with them basicly breaking ties with the rest of the Order. Not to mention the difficulty of Remus not being allowed to help them because he needed to be there for his family, and that was a right decision, as he was basicly running away from his wife and son, while Tonks gets invited/asked to help them on this mission. I would hate it if Harry and Remus have another row like at the begging of DH, when Remus comes to the trio at Grimmuald Place, and that maybe being the last time they speak to each other before Remus' death at the Battle of Hogwarts.
