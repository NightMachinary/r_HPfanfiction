:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I'm looking for a fic that I read awhile back but can't seem to find now. In it, Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw (obviously ooc but I don't really care). The one detail I I remember most distinctly is that Harry is confused as to why the Wizarding World still uses quills and that pens are unavailable. So he creates his own pen using runes and with help from Flitwick. He wasn't close with the Weasleys, but he contacted Mr. Weasley for some reason and became close with the twins.


** Claw of the raven sounds similar too this but I don't think that's it but you might like it

**** Most people don't like the Harry from HPMOR, which totally I understand. But IMO, it has the best Voldemort in all of fanfiction.

***** Oh, it's not that bad. Granted, it gets petty cringe-worthy frequently, but is outright outstanding writing when compared to the average Indy!Harry power-wank.
