I've been thinking about this for a couple of days now, and as there already exist a number of objects/items/things that we consider mythological that are shown to be real in canon (eg: magic wands, flying broomsticks and carpets, bezoars, and the Philosopher's Stone to name a few) and I'm left wondering what else might be things that exist for real within the universe that Harry Potter resides in.


** WELL in my fanfic, Fight For Rights, Pandora's Box is real - except it doesn't hold vague "evil of the world," it's actually a dimensional prison for all the demons of the world, and that's the explanation for why we have myths about demons, but mysteriously have no demons in modern times. :) And of course, not every demon stuffed into the Box was a criminal, and not even the criminals deserve eternity stuffed into an empty black voidspace. It's itty bitty living space, all cramped together with nothing.

** For an /Indiana Jones/ crossover, the supernatural, ultra-dangerous fantasy version of the Ark of the Covenant would definitely be a misidentified magical artifact. I suppose the same could be true even if your specific variation on a cured Ark isn't especially /Jones/-inspired.

If we're to get away from the realm of pure ahistorical fantasy, though, it becomes a bit of a thorny issue. Religion in the Wizarding World, that is. Rowling is famously a Christian, and many agree that she probably imagines Christian beliefs to be broadly true in the Wizarding World, God and Bible and all. So if you take this view then yes, by virtue of it being abrahamic dogma that it does exist, the Ark of the Covenant as a divine artifact would exist, or at least have existed.

The third option is to take the route I do in my headcanon and decide that if they're not sheer superstition, nearly all Muggle religions are rooted in the pre-Statute days where powerful wizards would set themselves up as Gods over fearful Muggles and blast them with magical lightning if they disagreed. It's a fairly harmless proposition as it concerns Greek or Egyptian mythology, and though I'm not proud of us as a society for it, I feel like it would also be for Hinduism.

But can we take this to its logical conclusion and say that a very, very powerful wizard known only as “Yahveh Elohim”? (Considering the etymology, an Ancient Hebrew Voldemort, perhaps; 'He-Who-Exists' is in the same general area as 'You-Know-Who' and 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named'.) In such a scheme, it could well be that a magically-sealed Ark would exist, containing a binding magical contract version of the "covenant". Carry this to 33 C.E. and you get the disconcerting possibility that Jesus Christ was the Elohim line's version of the Heir of Slytherin, rediscovering all the old tricks, and embracing all the old teachings (though suitably updated), of his ancestor.

Obviously, though, such a position (harmless to me as an atheist) might well be considered rather offensive by actual religious people. Not that I imagine Wizard-Jesus would have been an evil conman, to be clear; he'd have been using his position of power to pass down moral teachings and things, obviously. But you get the idea, don't you?

** Considering the world building (towns like Ottery St Catchpole replacing towns like Ottery St Mary and Churches being prominent features in small towns) it's clear the catholic church, and therefore the Church of England, are canonical. So yes the Ark of the Covenant can be assumed to be canon unless someone is able to provide explicit evidence otherwise.
