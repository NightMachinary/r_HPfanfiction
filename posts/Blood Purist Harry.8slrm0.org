Not even necessarily a Dark!, REEE DUMBLEDORE, RON TOOK MY MONEY Harry fanfic, just a Blood Purist Harry one. Whether they make it make sense or Harry is just senselessly bigoted is of no consequence to me. I figure it'd be a nice change of pace and could lead to some good character interactions, as well as (most likely) a more powerful Harry.

Thanks in advance.


** Being raised by Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]], linkffn(2913149), he was a clear blood purist. He stayed quite loyal to Voldemort throughout this story, only turning against him when Voldemort tried to kill/torture his brother, whom he grew very attached to. Even then, he felt quite guilty turning against Voldemort, and much of the second fic in the series dealt with this issue. In the third installment, he swapped places with canon Harry, and he was still holding back when facing Voldemort.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

** linkffn(7659033) There is the They Shook Hands series, its a Slytherin Harry who befriended Malfoy. It follows the stations of canon, but the character interactions are different.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

**** He generally despises muggle, and looks down on muggleborns (he considers his mother a exception because she was powerful).

He doesent really regret being a blood purist, but reconsiders his opinion about muggeborns and thinks that while magical heritage helps a lot, it isn't everything. He also support a law to take away wizard children from muggle parents have them be adopted by wizarding famlies. He also only really dates pure-blood girls.
