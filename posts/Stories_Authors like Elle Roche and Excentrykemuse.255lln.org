I really like their stories, specifically the fleshing out of "noble" society and Harry's place in it. However, I'm having a lot of trouble finding similar stories. Help?


** I've never heard of either of those authors. Tell us more about their stories, maybe I know a few.

*** I think this perfectly fits how to describe the writing, there is also a fillet collection that would give a shorter example. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8903333/1/Will-You-Walk-Into-My-Parlor]]

** I just read the first two chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7231737/1/Chancing-Chaos][Chancing Chaos]] and I found it interesting. It's just a collection of oneshots though. Thanks OP for suggesting this. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6733750/1/The-Pillars-of-Power][The Pillars of Power]] doesn't have Harry in it, but it also deals with pureblood society.
