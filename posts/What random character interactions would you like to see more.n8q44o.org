Thanks to [[/u/KidCoheed]]'s thread, it made me interested in other friendship ideas. This could be entirely different, from characters you don't see interacted so much, (or don't even see at all) that you would like to. Does NOT have to be friendships, can just be more interactions in general.

Sirius Black and Lucius Malfoy. They're related, would love more stories where they interact with each other.

Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy. So different from each other, I could see some funny interactions, especially if you go the cracky way.

Kingsley with pretty much anyone, hanging out. Especially interesting stories between Kingsley and Moody.

Tonks around other people, could hang out with Fred and George, could hang out with Bill and Fleur, could hang out with Harry, Ron and Hermione more. She could interact with so many people. I also like the random idea of Tonks hanging out with Snape (to his annoyance)

I'd like for Abeforth to interact with more people. Could be anyone from the Order, could be Rosmerta, could be anyone, I don't care.

Heck, speaking of Rosmerta, would love to see more stories involving Rosmerta with all of the people she serves. I'm sure she has some interesting customers.

How about you?


** I just wanted Tonks to interact with Draco. Only once, didn't even need to be for a long time.

** Kinda random but Hermione with the Hufflepuffs, especially Ernie Macmillan. Hog's Head meeting fun fact, while the Ravenclaws came at Ginny's and Harry's invitation, the Hufflepuffs came at Hermione's. And one of my favorite interactions in that chapter is how when Ernie and the others were waffling about signing the parchment, it was not Harry's call to nobility that snapped them out of it, but rather Hermione's promise of protection. There was a lot of trust and familiarity in that conversation, and I'm so curious how /that/ particular relationship happened.

** I like Tonks hanging with the twins and Charlie. Also Snape, to his annoyance, but that he also secretly enjoys the quirky, rarely serious woman.

Also the twins. Just...the twins.

** Give me Luna and Dumbledore very seriously discussing utter nonsense or debating outlandish conspiracy theories and giving everyone else around them massive headaches.

** Minerva dealing with the /other/ defense teachers, similar to 'Just A Random Tuesday'. I want to see her vs a stuttering Quirrel, and a pompous lockheart, and an ex-favourite student Lupin, and...

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
