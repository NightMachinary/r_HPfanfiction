:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a fic where Harry is in Limbo after dying/being killed. He end up in a large structure where the statues are people who he knew in his past life. He walks around and talk to many people including Bellatrix who he acknowledges for her prowess, Narcissa who he commends for fuelling his fantasies, Hermione who he misses most and tells her that she's the one he loved always, Remus who he chides for being a coward and hiding behind his affliction, Sirius for being his godfather regardless for how short a while, etc.

The thing is they can only nod and acknowledge what he says and can't respond.

I think this is how the fic starts. Might be a crossover as well. Any help would be grateful.


** For the life of me I can't remember the title of this fic, I knew I read this before.
