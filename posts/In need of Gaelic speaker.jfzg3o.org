** There are only around 57k Scottish Gaelic speakers left in Scotland (around 1% of Scots) according to the govt figures, so it's actually quite hard to find them.

You'd be better trying a forum like FÃ²ram na GÃ idhlig to stand much chance of reaching fluent speakers than a US-centric Harry Potter subreddit.

** But do you really need it to be translated into Gaelic?

When I encounter phrases in languages I don't know I just skip them. No point reading them if I don't understand them. It's very irritating actually.

I think it's much better to write something in italics and mention that it's in another language. Like this:

#+begin_quote
  "/Hello, how are you?/" Harry said in French.

  "/I'm fine./" answered his French friend.
#+end_quote

** Try r/GÃ idhlig but translation is a lot of work, syntax is so different. I'd recommend you find a traditional poem or song to use instead. There's loads of resources available but the BBC has a nice little resources to start off with [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/alba/oran/]]

*** That's probably the better idea. Asking someone to translate an entire song, with rhyming verses, would be a bit much.

When I go to that link, the entire thing is in Gaelic and I cannot read any of it.

** I think the idea is a bit problematic and weird like saying the centaurs were the ones who created I don't know german or spanish or whatever. Even if it's not that popular it's still a language and it is closely related to Scottish history and heritage, so I hope you will handle this in a sensitive and respectful way.

*** Yeah, this kinda seems almost like a centaur rank funnily enough. Like what? If the centaurs created the language why would ancient picts have spoken it?

Just seems odd honestly, and kinda like it's not being treated like a language at all.

*** I hadn't thought of that, thank you for pointing it out. I wasn't going to make it a central point or even a plot moment in the story, just that the song the centaurs sing would be in Gaelic because that was the language they used amongst each other in this colony.

**** In that case, you may wish to say that it's the language that was in common use in the area when the centaurs arrived, and the song was one they learned/came up with at the time, thus the use of that language.
