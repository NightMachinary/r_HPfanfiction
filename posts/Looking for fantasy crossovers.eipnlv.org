As the title says, I'm looking for crossover fics between Harry Potter and whatever other fantasy setting you guys think is cool. Good Harry and minimal bashing are preferred but not required.

Thanks in advance for whatever you come up with!


** Here are some of my favorites

linkffn(11115934) *Shadows of Angmar*- xover w/ LOTR, probably one of the best xovers I've ever read. It's updated infrequently, but I wouldn't count it as abandoned.

linkao3(1369690) *The Triumph of these Tired Eyes*- xover w/ Thor. Completed

linkao3(10774779) *Susan, Afterwords*- xover w/ Narnia. Oneshot

  In the several millennia he had existed Loki Odinson, Norse God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things, he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before, in his thousands of years of existence had he been a loving father, but all it took was a single glance at the perfect little creature before him and he knew, he was gone.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** Thank you! I've read /Triumph/, but the other two are new to me and sound very interesting.
