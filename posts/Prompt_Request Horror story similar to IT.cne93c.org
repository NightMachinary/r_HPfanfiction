Good evening, I was watching the trailer for IT: Chapter 2, when I had a sudden desire to see Pennywise eating Death Eater children. I'd like to see either crossovers with IT, or stories with a similar monster. Like a super Boggart.

Alternatively, I'd like to see a fic where Harry somehow becomes part Boggart and the result is something like Pennywise. Bonus points if he eats Malfoy. Thanks!


** Judging from the tags, this is a very fucked up story so reader beware...

A request from the FBI sends Hermione to Derry, Maine to investigate a series of child murders that took place over the last eight months. She gets roped into a situation that calls for her unique skill set, because we all know It is no ordinary serial killer. She befriends the Loser's Club and forms an atypical relationship to the clown itself as well as Its secret alter-ego, Bill Gray.Follows the plot of the 2017 movie as well as all of its lovely canonical monthly separations.

** Check this fic out: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/]])

It's a different crossover, not IT, but it's horrifying. Spoilers: it's not the children, but the death eaters themselves that get more than they bargained for

  The Patronus charm requires a happy memory. Harry Potter doesn't have many, and the Dementors get Sirius, after all.But the story is far from over.
