#+begin_quote
  When Dark Lord Potter ends up in an alternate dimension while trying to go back in time, he didn't expect to find his twin sister, who too had time travelled. Neither did he expect he would have to find thirteen Hocruxes. Threats bigger than Voldemort are to be dealt with. Germany shall fall. Harry/Daphne. BWL Neville. Dimensional travel. Slytherin Harry. Alive Potters
