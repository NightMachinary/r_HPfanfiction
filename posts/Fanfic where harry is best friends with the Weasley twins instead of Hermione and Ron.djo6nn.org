I am looking for a well written fanfic That has a lot of Fred and George, Or a fanfic where Harry or Hermione are major pranksters . The more pranks the better. A maurader era fanfic about Sirius or Remus would also be fine.


** I really liked the Weasley twins in linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) and its sequels. It is Georgione (or whatever is the proper name of the ship), but written in rather believable way.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

** You might like linkffn(White Flags by MarauderLover7). Pranks aren't the sole focus (though they're present), but the Marauders' fun-loving dynamic is great to read.

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot.

** If you like prank-based fanfics, I'd like to suggest The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship. It's based in the next gen characters but it's really well written and the story revolves around prank wars.
