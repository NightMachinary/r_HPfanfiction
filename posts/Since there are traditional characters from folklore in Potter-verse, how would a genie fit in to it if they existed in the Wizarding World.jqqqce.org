** Tom thought he made horcruxes but actually trapped himself into an enslaved existence fulfilling wishes.

kid!ginny is just like ‘I wish to be Mrs Potter' and he's like ‘how many times do I have to tell you?! No births deaths or marriages!'

** I'd have them be a powerful magical race of sorts, like Veela but more powerful and limited to a small area, which is where the 'lamp' came from. Metaphor.

Basically, they might claim an area, and able to do powerful magic, more powerful than a wizard, but outside the area they have no or a lot less power. Something like that. So in their demesne, they might be two or three times more powerful than the average wizard. Outside, they're only a little better than a squib.

** Hmmm, well the djinn are a separate race, and not native to Britain. Perhaps, like flying carpets, they cannot be imported?

I like [[/u/karigan_g][u/karigan_g]]'s idea that creating a horcrux ties you to slavery of whomever holds the object. Voldie is going to be very busy, what with seven horcruxes out there. Nagini and Harry, being living horcruxes, have permanent possession (Nagini probably just keeps asking him to bring her prey to eat). I'd read that story.

** Sounds interesting! Imagine The Dursleys game home from vacation in the middle east, full of stories and racial slurrs on the country and its people, and how they got away with buying authentic artifacts from a local. Turns out, it's an ancient genies lamp..

Who awakens the genie, and what wishes will be granted? Exciting!

** A bit late but I have a headcanon for this: they don't just exist in lamps as legendary creatures but are rather like house-elves. They're trapped in teacups, kettles, etc. and when you tap it, they're released and you tell them to clean the house or do chores. It still has the classic 'do whatever someone wants' and can factor as the House-Elf of the Middle East.

** She would have a celebrity crush on Harry and eventually the two would start dating and later on getting married. One night when she is feeling particularly kinky, she dresses up in traditional genie clothes and she says:

"Master I will fulfill you three wishes."

"My first wish is that I want our oldest child to be named James Sirius."

"Well not exactly what I had in mind but fine... I guess there could have been worse names," she responds rolling her eyes since Harry ruined the moment. "But what if its a girl?"

"James Sirius."

"But you can't..."

"I can. You said I have three wishes. This is my first wish."

"Fine," she finally relents hoping that she'll be able to talk her husband out of naming a potential girl James Sirius when she'll have her first child. "Second wish?"

"My second wish is for our second child to be called Albus Severus."

At this point, she is no longer sure if her husband is messing with her.

"Why? Why? Do you want to torture our poor second child?"

"Come on. It's a cool name the baby will named after the two greatest Headmasters at Hogwarts."

"You didn't even like Snape."

"Yes but I still think I should honor him somehow."

"Fine," she responds. "And your third wish?" she adds while mentally pleading to Merlin or Jesus or whatever God that he doesn't ask again for another name.

"I wish to go to sleep. Catching dark wizards all day is tiring."
