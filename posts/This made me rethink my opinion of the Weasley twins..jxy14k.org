I think we all know the twins pushed Montague into the vanishing cabinet, trapping him there for awhile. Montague managed to get out by Apparatition, which almost killed him, ending up stuck in a toilet.

Usually I would tell myself that they didn't know the it was a vanishing cabinet or that it was broken. But when I was re-reading I stumbled on this.

#+begin_quote
  'He never managed to get all the words out,' said Fred, 'due to the fact that *we forced him head-first into that Vanishing Cabinet* on the first floor.'
#+end_quote

and -

#+begin_quote
  'Not until Montague *reappears, and that could take weeks. I dunno where we sent him*,' said Fred coolly.
#+end_quote

This really just soured my opinion of the twins. It's bad enough of what they did, but what gets me the most is, *"said Fred coolly"*. Not even an ounce of remorse.


** If memory serves, this took place when Umbridge was in charge and Montague was part of the Inquisitorial Squad. Under those circumstances, I have a hard time faulting Fred and George for what they did.

**** While technically, yes, the inquisitorial squad's main power move was the ability to remove house points, they were in essence placed "above the law" by Umbridge. They were basically given a free pass to bully any student who they simply didn't care for in the moment.

Sure, house points are kind of trivial and meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but it was the principle of the thing. Umbridge reveled in causing harm to students who didn't comply with her rules, all under the guise of discipline. The inquisitorial squad was an extension of her corruption that enabled her to find even more people to punish for reasons that would probably only make sense in a dictatorship.

So, while I don't agree with Fred and George actually causing serious harm to another student, I can also say it isn't completely bizarre in the context of a rebellion against inhumane rule and treatment. Also, they're a bunch of kids, and kids can be rash and unthinking, especially when they believe they're defending something.

#+end_quote

So they don't know where he is. Specifically they don't know that he's stuck in limbo, because they wouldn't have said they didn't know where he was if they knew that. It seems clear to me that they just thought he was dumped off wherever the other vanishing cabinet is, because that's what "where we sent him" clearly means. And if that other cabinet happened to have found its way to another country, it could easily have taken weeks for him to get back, despite never being in any danger.

As with pretty much all bashing, it's only malicious if you're looking for it to be malicious.

**** Your quote is from before they knew anything bad happened to him. Why should they have felt remorse? I'm pretty sure we aren't told how they feel after they found out that he was injured, so they might have been remorseful then. And even if they weren't, I've already shown that they were justified in their actions and have no real reason to be.

Yes, it definitely does. He was a nearly fully-trained wizard, and he still had his wand. (Technically, he /might/ have been a sixth year, but since he was captain of the Quidditch team that year and didn't play the next year, it's more likely he was a seventh year. And it was near the end of the year anyway, so nearly six full years of study should still be good enough.) He should be able to find his own way back home, even without apparating.

A cabinet isn't going to be lost in a jungle somewhere or anything like that. He would almost certainly end up in a house or shop or maybe some sort of storeroom. In the worst case scenario, he gets arrested for trespassing in someone's house in a foreign country. But it's hard to imagine that not eventually getting sorted out when his family and/or the British Ministry of Magic is contacted.

  “That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured?”“Who cares?” said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. “Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!”
#+end_quote

If Ron can't even stomach some remorse. Why are you assuming Fred and George did?

How exactly would he have escaped that place without apparatition. The vanishing cabinet was broken, which means he was stuck in limbo.

And the only way to get out of there was by Apparition. Which injured him pretty badily.

****** Why would Ron be feeling remorse? He wasn't involved at all. The twins might have because they might have felt some responsibility for what happened. But as I have said several times, there actions were justified, so it's perfectly fine if they never did feel remorse.

You're assuming a lot about how vanishing cabinets work. But Rowling's magic is so ill-defined that we have no way of knowing for sure if there was another way out. "The only way to get out of there was by Apparition" isn't any more or less valid than "He could have escaped by using the unlocking charm" or "He could have escaped by singing a Celine Dion song."

However, the fact that he could hear people outside the cabinet strongly suggests that they should have been able to hear him too. And that should have made it easier for someone to figure out how to save him. If nothing else, he could have gotten someone to move the cabinet out of Hogwarts so its protections against apparation wouldn't interfere.

** To be fair, Vanishing Cabinets are meant to pop out at the other end. Fred's presumably saying, "We don't know where the pair is". If they knew it was broken, that's another issue.

*** Slytherin chaser, quidditch captain, and member of the Inquisitorial Squad.

In PoA, he fouled Katie Bell by grabbing her head during a game. In OotP, he played quidditch, got made a member of the Inquisitorial Squad, and got shoved into a vanishing cabinet by Fred and George for abusing his power. Because the cabinet was broken, he was stuck in there for a day before he apparated himself out and got stuck in a toilet, leaving him injured for a few weeks. This experience led to Malfoy using the cabinet to bring Death Eaters into the school in HBP.

And that is all of his appearances in the books. There isn't even any extra information about him in the movies or Pottermore or anything, except that his first name is Graham. No one really cares about him, but lately some people have been trying to paint him as an innocent victim of Fred and George, to prove how awful they are, as seen in this thread.

** I said it in a previous post but (as much as I dislike the twins because they are cruel and their pranks are not even that funny) the fandom has grown too much and many seem to have forgotten how they were in their teenage years. Most teenagers just bully those weaker than them and wish that those who bully them die a painful death. So I can quite understand why Fred and George didn't give a shit if Montague lived or died.

** Given that he was an Inquisitorial Squad member and held an important post in Slytherin House, it seems pretty likely that Montague was either a soon-to-be Death Eater or at least a strong supporter or fellow traveler. Just as with the Marauders, it's not surprising to see pranks getting more aggressive against people that either want to murder you and your loved ones or support those who do.

And the fact is that it's only assumptions. We don't even know whether Montague became a death eater. While some characters like Draco did.

What the twins did to Montague is even /less/ of an attempted murder than Sirius telling Snape about the knot on the Willow (which was also, no matter what Snape says, not attempted murder). They didn't expect him to get stuck halfway - they expected him to pop out in whatever home or business or warehouse or whatever held the other cabinet. It was attempted inconvenience.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
