I've been searching for hours with no luck... I'm searching for fics, completed or not I don't mind, about Harry caring a lot for the younger years and helping them out, whether it be with homework or stopping older years bullies. Harry's age doesn't matter, as long as he's still a student himself.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** I'm hesitant to recommend this, because it is a Harry/Voldemort fic. But it's not a romance, exactly. The relationship is not portrayed as healthy or well-adjusted. It's a good story of a Gray-going-Dark Harry just trying to survive childhood and a hostile Hogwarts.

Anyway, one of the central plots is the "year kings and queens" of Slytherin, where each year has a semi-official leader who can dictate terms for their classmates. Malfoy is, obviously, the year king for Harry's year. Harry becomes known as "the lone king" because his study group for the younger years evolves into him becoming a leader to them. Protecting them from bullies, teaching them life skills/Slytherin skills, and just generally mentoring them.

  Harry has some weird words on his left wrist. That must be one of those strange things that Aunt Petunia hates so much. But it's okay! He likes them.Then, it all turns even weirder. Hogwarts, magic, a Headmaster and a Dark Lord await Harry - he would prefer if they all just left him alone, thank you very much.But when has it ever mattered what Harry wants?

**** Been a while since I read it. I remember a couple of scenes where Harry protects younger students from abuse, and it wouldn't surprise me if some of that was sexual, but I don't remember specifically.
