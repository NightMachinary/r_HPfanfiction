I've got a couple of projects at the moment, but can't actually focus on one of them. Which of the following sounds more interesting to you?

For bonus points, why that one over the others?

For more bonus points, poke holes in the summary.

Project 1

AU. Harry leads guerrilla war against Voldemort and defeats him at 21. Thoroughly disillusioned with Ministry, and as head of only functioning authority, Harry takes over as a benevolent dictator.

The story follows him as he tries to re-build magical Britain, fend off the International Confederation of Wizards, repair relations with the Muggle government and prevent both sides tearing the fragile peace apart. (Possibly H/Ginny, possibly H/Daphne, possibly bond-induced H/Gabrielle, possibly some combination of all three)

Project 2

Post OotP with slight Addams Family cross-over. Post-OotP, Harry meets the Addams Family, who explain to him that they are his loyal retainers, their wealth is his to command, and promptly shove a time-turner over his head and take him back in time 5 years.

Five years later, Harry is co-founder of an American company which abuses magic to make a killing in muggle business (planes that conjure fuel, golems rather than staff etc.) As he is now physically/chronologically over 17, he is technically of age, though everyone assumes Sirius emancipated him. This gives him control of the combined Potter-Black estate and wizengamot seat. Voldemort, meanwhile, is busy punishing the Greengrasses and taking their wealth by binding Daphne Greengrass to him as a slave. As he shares Harry's blood, he actually binds Daphne to Harry.

Harry sub-sequentially discovers that Daphne's pulled the same trick he has and, by some freakish co-incidence, is actually his business-partner in the American company. Using the combined Potter-Black-Greengrass assets, he sets out to fight Voldemort by employing werewolves, cornering the market on potions ingredients, and using his muggle-business assets and the Addams' magic to make everyone think he has super-powers.

While Voldemort and Scrimgeour/Harry slug it out via newspaper in a proxy-war for the Ministry's undead corpse, Dumbledore has taken the political tutoring Harry's received from Morticia Addams as a sign that Harry, angry from Sirius' death, has fallen in with a bad crowd - a sign that's confirmed when he sees Harry talking to a known Death-Eater sympathiser in the Wizengamot and supporting a bill designed to make it difficult for Muggleborns to enter the Wizarding world. The obvious solution to this problem is to /accidentally/ wed Harry to multiple light-sided girls - and Pansy Parkinson, because everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

The story follows the political/economic warfare being waged by Harry and Voldemort, the actual war being fought by Harry and Voldemort, and Harry dealing with his unwanted harem and the business-partner he was in a relationship with that is now ritually bound to him. (H/Daphne, H/Ginny)

Project 3

20 year old Harry goes back in time and is intercepted on platform 9 by a 21 year old Gabrielle. After being taken to task by her for being a moron for electing to go through Hogwarts when he could be spending the time far more productively, they agree to work together. As Gabrielle has actually planned ahead, she abuses her foreknowledge on the muggle stock-market while beginning to make plans to deal with Voldemort's horcruxes.

During the holidays when he can actually do something useful, instead of hanging around at school with children who are too young to actually replace the 19 year old friends he'd lost and a Headmaster who is distinctly suspicious of the un-child-like Harry Potter, Harry and Gabrielle take courses in, then begin moonlighting as, curse-breakers in preparation for collecting Voldemort's horcruxes. They also begin to take steps to neutralise Voldemort's support before he returns.

The story starts in media res in 6th year, when the pureblood lobby takes drastic steps to preserve their influence. Under the guise of ridding the wizarding world of the final vestiges of Voldemort's rise, they institute ye olde marriage law to re-populate the Wizarding World (Hogwarts is a mass of classrooms, but only has 50 or so people in each year?), co-incidentally marrying purebloods into key families to bring them into the fold. Harry, naturally, ends up being forced to wed Daphne Greengrass.

The story then follows Daphne as she tries to get out from under Voldemort's thumb and keep her family alive, and follows Harry and Gabrielle as they fight Voldemort, try to avoid fighting Dumbledore, deal with the teenager Harry's been married to and attempt to stop the Department of Mysteries experimenting on their made-up Veela bond.

Not actually a comedy. (H/Gabrielle)

Thanks in advance

??? How is that the "obvious solution"? if this isn't supposed to be comedy, it's just shitty Dumbledore bashing.

Anyway, I don't like fics that focus on politics and business, so those aren't for me.

*** Yes, this is very-much a comedy - or at least a send-up of Super!Harry, Harem!Harry and Dark!Lord!Harry!! tropes.

** The first idea interests me. I'd cut out the multi pairing idea and throw away the bond if you chose Gabrielle, but romance aside, sounds interesting.

The second and third ideas do not sound interesting at all to me.

The second idea is too crowded. You have too many facets. Also, servant family and ritually bound marriages are a nono, imo.

The third idea is going to be half-parody, half-serious, and bad as a whole. Ideas from those two categories do not mix.

** Your first idea is great.

Marriage law is a terrible plot device the fandom has come up with. A powerful, time-traveling Harry will never accept being forced into marry anyone. A government that sanctioned and enforced rape was the worst form of tyranny, even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't go that far. If the British wizarding world was stupid enough to enact something like that, there could be only two outcomes:

1. Harry leads a mass exodus to let those inbred bastards die out by themselves in the *Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law* style, linkffn(6049450).

2. Harry kills off those insane blood nazis in the *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution* style, linkffn(10595005).

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  After the war, the Wizengamot passes a law requiring all young wizards and witches to marry, and the Ministry will assign the partners. How do Harry and his friends react? H/G, but not overly so

*** Re: Marriage law:

Would your opinion change if I eliminated the marriage law and instead replaced it with Voldemort forging marriage contract as his means to force Daphne into Harry's confidences?

Basically, I'm looking for a way to put Harry in an awkward quasi-romantic position with someone too young for him where just telling them to go away isn't an option, and neither side are right or wrong.

**** That wouldn't make sense either. A marriage contract should only be created if parents/guardians from both families agreed to it. Unless Dumbledore or Sirius signed for Harry's side, there was no one else in a position to do so. Then again you must ask the question why Dumbledore would bother with forcing Harry to marry someone, what were the benefits for his cause and the greater good?

Since this plot of yours is a time travel, you have two 20+ years old going back and apparently very powerful ones. May I ask what form of time travel? Time-turner, memory, or alternate dimension?
