Hi so i just want to let out my thoughts on some things ive notice in the Harry Potter world whether it be the actual book series or fanfiction. So please just tell what you think or even leave things you noticed about the HP world.

That the magical people live longer and yet they aga like regular non-magical people. I always thought they should age slower to make up for the extra years. People marrying young. Maybe it me being biased because of my dislike of marriage but it make no sense that they marry young when they live a lot longer. I figured they enjoy their youth before settling down and starting a family. Muggleborns going back to the non-magical world just screams trouble because people are going to start to notice a person has been living for much longer then they should.


** Everyone's talking about life expectancy but I think the major factor is the lack of tertiary education. In the Muggle world world too, people who don't go to university get married much younger.

With regards to Aurors, there is. We know from McGonagall that Aurors only recruit a single new Auror once every few years. If they had an Auror school, it would only ever have a single student, and sometimes not even that. In which case it isn't really a school. It's just training provided as part of a job.

Are you sure about that? I know the Aurors are pretty selective, but one every few years sounds like awfully few. There's only be 30 or so Aurors at the high end.

******** I am sure. Here's the quote from OotP Chapter 29:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.

  “Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled.

  “You'd need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.”
#+end_quote

As for whether it's too few, it makes sense to me. The population of wizarding Britain is small, maybe 10,000 people, and Aurors aren't police, they're elite Dark wizard hunters. There can't be all that many Dark wizards out there. I've never imagined there being more than 20 of them, perhaps closer to 15.

Another useful quote from OotP on the matter:

#+begin_quote
  “A regurgitating toilet?”

  “Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those - pumbles, I think they're called - you know, the ones who mend pipes and things.”

  “Plumbers?”

  “Exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.”

  “Will it be Aurors who catch them?”

  “Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”
#+end_quote

Fanon has a tendency of trivialising Aurors, turning them into regular law enforcement as opposed to Ministry-sanctioned bounty hunters. But in canon they really are considered the cream of the crop. Yes, Dawlish got beaten easily by Dumbledore several times, but if you base your idea of who is a strong wizard on the set of people Dumbledore can't beat, it's going to be a very small category indeed.

********* I agree that fanon tends to trivialise aurors, but I don't think that McGonagall implies that they only take one every fw years. WHen I read that it's more of a "It's hard to get in and not many people try to" vibe.

Basically you have to pass certain standards and if you can't make it your out, even if no one actually passes that year. The fact that they haven't taken anyone the last few years only means that no one got in, not that they weren't accepting.

********** This seems to be a rather semantic point. When I said "they only recruit someone every few years" I took it to be clear that it means that they only /successfully/ recruit someone every few years (i.e. make an offer), not that they mysteriously close applications for years at a time. The quote I used to back up my position was rather clear on that front.

And in any case, the semantic point makes no difference. Either way - closed applications on high standards - the substantive fact remains the same: there's only ever likely to be 0-1, at the most 2, trainee Aurors at any one time.

** Marrying young could be a symptom of magical wars hanging over their head. First Grindelwald's war, then the two Voldemort wars. If shit hits the fan, people like security and marriage is just the right thing to make that feeling of security sprout.

I also don't buy too much into the idea that muggleborns go back into the muggle world for good. With the exception of Voldemorts agenda, muggleborns didn't have too bad a standing in wizarding society, actually. Fanfiction makes it sound a lot worse than it was. If we take Pottermore canon, there even was a muggleborn minister, Nobby Leach.

** From what I've always understood, their living longer is just a byproduct of them not being affected by Muggle diseases and the like. They only live so much longer because they aren't dying from things like measles or complications from Alzheimers.

As for marrying and having kids, well, I'm sure women still worry about their clocks. So, having kids before your forty is probably still something they strive for. Also, as important as it is to enjoy their youth, they also live so much longer than Muggles. That means their golden years are a lot longer too. So if they didn't get to something they wanted to do before they had kids, they can just do it after the kids have left because do have extra time to kill.

The solution for the Muggleborns worrying about Muggles noticing how long they've been alive seems pretty simple to me: move to a new town.

Albus, depending on which recon you go by, was about 115 years old and still strong and active enough to run a school, hold all his political positions and had no hint of being even close to retirement. Gellert was living in /horrible/ conditions for over half his life, and still made it to 115/116 before he was killed (again he didn't die of old age). Bathilda Bagshot was at least 20 years older (and probably more then that considering she was Gellert's /great/-aunt), still living independently and active before she died. Even the healthiest muggle can not claim to live to 135 and still be as fit as when they were in their 50/60s. It's a little more then good health care at work (and JKR's crap ability to count).

** Marrying young when they live longer has always bothered me as well, and I agree that it makes no sense. If you're going to live to a hundred and thirty, it seems like there wouldn't be a rush to marry and start pumping out kids as soon as possible. Like, you have some time to make sure you find the best match possible.

*** I agree and disagree.

We have kids young because women don't have forever to have kids. I can see this more with the men. Since it's a magical world /maybe/ women don't go through menopause at age fifty like Muggle women would, but we have nothing to suggest otherwise. Which means if the men decided to wait they'd have to marry women much younger than them. So maybe it's just a social thing where big age differences is looked down on OR that so many people meet their futures spouses at Hogwarts that men don't wait because the women they fell in love with /can't/ wait. Since the whole Tonks/Lupin thing him being too old for her was part of the reason, he didn't want to date her. Although the werewolf thing seemed to take more importance there.

Although, I agree that, just like with our society, people would be getting married and having children a bit later. Like when we died young (in our forties/fifties) girls married in their early teens and normally had their first child by their late teens. Now we don't marry until our earlier twenties and normally have our first child in our twenties (on average, of course).

Birth defects in children rise if you have your first child after the age of thirty with it becoming higher the older you get. But beyond health reasons (because magic can explain that away), it could just be a culture thing. The magical community is small so having children might be top priority to most of them where having a career doesn't seem all that important to many of the characters there.

*** We don't know that every couple married young. We see that James and Lily married young, and that Molly and Arthur have been together since atleast 1970 (around Bill's birth). The only other two weddings we see are Bill and Fleur, who are at least 25 and 20 respectively, and Remus and Tonks. Tonks is around 21-23 years old, and Remus is in his mid-thirties, possibly older if werewolves age faster. Most people end up in relationships that are rather long term for the first time at this age.

We also know that most couples meet in hogwarts, which is understandable. Imagine being with someone for 7 years, every day for at least an hour. It will quickly create lasting relationships, either of spite, respect, affection or even love. People who go through experiences such as what would occur in hogwarts will bond strongly. Even if we assume that Harry's six years were abnormal years at hogwarts, every year would have shocks.

It is not surprising to see people marrying and having children at young ages, not exactly in that order of course. For all we know, wizards have issues procreating without marriage. WE DONT KNOW.

** I know it's been said, but wars tend to make people marry at an early age. Back when the Iraq war was around, a friend of mine married his wife and got her pregnant before he left. The short amount of time that you're married is bliss and it'll make you happy that if you don't make it back that you at least were married to the love of your life.

This may not be facts, but Hitler did the same thing. Perhaps for another reason, but he knew he had already lost when he married.

Also, just 'cos they live for hundreds of years, doesn't mean that they can bear children beyond 50.

** Canon, while life expectancy (the average age of death) may be higher among magicals, there is actually very little evidence that magicals can live significantly longer than the oldest non-magicals. The oldest documented human IRL was 122 and there just aren't any magicals we know of who lived significantly longer than that (besides the Flemels). Bathilda Bagshot is the likeliest but she also /could/ have died in her 120s.
