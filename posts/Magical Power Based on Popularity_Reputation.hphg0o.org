I think it would be really interesting to read a fanfic where someone gains more magic as they gain popularity. For example, A-list celebrities would have Dumbledore-level magical power while regular civilians would have low magical power. How would infamous people gain their strength? Would magical affinity be determined by how they gained their strength, i.e. infamous people (like Voldemort) are better at dark magic? I also think it would be interesting to see how wizards would interact with muggles in an attempt to gain more power/ popularity.

I read a fic similar to this in the Worm crossover fandom, though I don't remember the name. I thought it was a cool idea if applied to the Harry Potter universe, as it would change interactions between wizards and their muggle counterparts. Purebloods now care about muggles, and muggleborns have an inherent advantage of knowing both avenues to increase their reputation. Now there would be way more academies for magic, as each one tries to increase their reputation.

What do you think would happen if this were the case? How would it affect the main plot of the books as well as the canon history of the HP universe?

If anyone knows any fics like this please do recommend them. I'm honestly fine with crossovers as well as fics that don't even take place in the HP fandom as long as this dynamic applies. I just want to see it in action.
