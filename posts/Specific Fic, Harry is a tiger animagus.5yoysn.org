What I remember:

1. Harry is an animagus (tiger)
2. Tonks is younger than Canon and is in Hogwarts with Harry but not in the same year
3. Harry is a Ravencrow?
4. Harry may live with Sirius (not sure)
5. Harry doesn't like the headmaster
6. There is a funny chapter about McGonagall that thinks that tonks smell like a cat but isn't sure
7. Harry is forced to show is animagus form in the great Hall


** Is it a Draco/Harry fic?

*** It shouldn't I tend to avoid slashes, but I don't remember...

If it helps I think that Harry's relationship with tonks was close but not romantic

** I think I can add a few more details, but like yourself cannot remember the title.

•Harry is friends with Daphne, Luna and Blaise.

•May be Harry/Daphne but unsure.

•They have a secret hangout hidden behind some narrow dark corridor. It's some old teacher's rooms who's animagus was a swan(there was a subplot going on there.) They painted it black and yellow(gold?) and there were two levels.

•It's incomplete

•Harry goes to Tonks for dueling lessons and offers financial assistance for her to become an Auror.

*** It's been bugging me, so I finally did a Google search. OP must've not, screw me for assuming they would. Anyway, linkffn(Midnight Gold, The Rise of the Forgotten Lord) It's...not very good.
