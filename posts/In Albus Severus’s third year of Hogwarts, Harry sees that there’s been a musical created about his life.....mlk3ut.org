With all his friends with him Harry sits down and watch as the actors all come on stage, then the first lyrics are sang;

“How does a bastard, orphan, son of a mud-blood

And a Marauder, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot

In Little Whinging by providence impoverished In squalor,

grow up to be a hero and an Auror?”

/I'ma get a scholarship to Hogwarts, I probably shouldn't brag, but dang I amaze and astonish. The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish, I gotta holler just to be heard With every word, I drop knowledge, I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal Tryna reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable, Only eleven but my mind is older. These Hogsmead village streets get colder, I shoulder Every burden, every disadvantage I have learned to manage, I don't have a wand to brandish, I walk these streets famished, The plan is to fan this spark into a flame. But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out my name. I am the H-E-R-M-I-O-N-E we are meant to be/

​

/You'll be back, soon you'll see, You'll remember you belong to me You'll be back, time will tell You'll remember that I served you well Oceans rise, ministries fall, We have seen each other through it all, And when push comes to shove I will send Dolores Umbridge to remind you of my love!/
