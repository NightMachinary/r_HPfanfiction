Fics where harry need to lose an arm or a leg. Preferably maybe needing to amputate his arm after getting bit by the basilik?

Edit: forgot to mention I'd rather have it happen early in the fic, and that it affect ways he does things. I have seen many fics where he loses an arm during the final battle, and we don't really explore his life with(out) his missing limb.

Amputation towards the beginning of the story iirc.

This on is not an amputation, but it's the best 'Hurt Harry' fanfic I've come across so far. It deals with a very realistic described traumatic brain injury.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
