Basically, I'm looking for insane Harry, but not in the way most fics do it, where he acts like a rip-off version of the Joker (or like in that one fic where by some cosmic deus ex machina he WAS the Joker), no, what I'm looking for is...Well, think sorta like how Luna acts, how people think she's "not all there"... If you need a better example, a (sadly abandoned) fic that does this idea PERFECTLY is linkffn(4669348) (hope I got the bot right). Preferably no slash and complete, though I'll settle for incomplete.


** linkffn(4966520) has Harry raised by Trelawney. Unfortunately, it was never completed.

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

  ABANDONED. Freaky connections aside, does anyone else think it strange that Harry survived a Killing Curse with little more damage than a scar? Well, what if he hadn't come through so unscathed? And what if the other damage was more mental than physical?

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

**** Honestly it's not even really that anyway. FemHarry is nothing like normal Harry. She's mostly just pissing off the horcrux in her head and even at the current point, is too young for any sort of romance. Read a couple chapters before brushing it off. There is no angsty Tom Riddle.

Harry isn't quite nuts, but he's definitely a few frys short of a happy meal and so lazy it's mindblowing. Somehow, he still manages to get what he wants (mostly to nap).
