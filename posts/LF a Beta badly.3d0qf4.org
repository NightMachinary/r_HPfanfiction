** I reccomend [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=11][DLP's Work by Author]]. You post your fic there and DLP members will give you constructive criticism on it. Note that they will focus on the negatives rather than the positives because the point of the WbA is to make the author's stories better, so if you can't handle and accept criticism you shouldn't post it there. On the other hand if you can handle criticism and are willing to edit your story in light of its flaws then it is the best place for HP Fanfiction critique on the internet. To access the WbA forum you must create a free account on DLP.

*** I will echo this comment.

Would you rather have 1 beta or a whole range of excellent writers willing to help you? By all means grab a beta, however I would also recommend you post it on WbA.
