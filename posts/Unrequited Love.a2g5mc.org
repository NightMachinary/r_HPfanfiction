Having a matching patronus is a result of UNREQUITED love and Tonks' patronus doesn't change back to the original form after she and Remus get together.

*** I think I'm just in a melancholy mood, but would still love to see AHEA grow from this rather dark starting point.

** It isn't a matching Patronus. Remus' is a wolf while Tonks' is a werewolf

*** According to the American version of HBP, her Patronus form is not specifically identified. Pottermore, on the other hand, states that it was a jackrabbit before it changed to a wolf.

**** Oops, my bad. I thought it was a werewolf all this time. But, we also don't know something critical - it's gender. It might as well have been a female wolf.

***** While it is true that in canon, matching or complimentary Patronus' signifies a pure love, my intent was to give a prompt with a different take on it.

I have read literally THOUSANDS of pieces of fan fiction and a considerable number have used the canon ideal of matched Patronus'. I have yet to see one from the opposing side, though, and I was hoping to inspire someone with a new perspective.

****** That's cool. I'm thinking if it was unrequited love, I'd take it in the direction of Remus dying after they get together. And Tonks tries to deal with it and...sigh. I make them sound like Snape and Lily again. Yes, we need someone else to give another spin on this.
