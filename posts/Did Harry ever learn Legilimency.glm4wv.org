** No, Harry doesn't learn legilimency in the books.

I do disagree with the notion that he's too morally righteous to learn it, though. He uses far more dubious spells when it suits him, he thinks nothing of seeing into Snape's mind to my recollection, and he uses the link to Voldemort's mind to his advantage.

*** I think that the key distinction is that Harry, when he does morally dubious things, generally does them on impulse or under severe duress. He is angry, so he uses the Cruciatus. He is about to be discovered by a Death Eater, so he casts the Imperius. Draco is about to cast the Cruciatus on him, so he casts the Secumstempa. But, he doesn't, say, practice using these spells ahead of time. Doing morally ambiguous things with planning and premeditation is more of a Hermione thing.

Mastering Legilimency is probably something that takes months, perhaps years of persistent effort and at least one other person to practice on/with---a person willing to have all their deepest secrets potentially exposed. I don't think Harry would go for it.

*** Not in the books. I'm speaking purely theoretically.

From an ethical standpoint it's very murky. The Snape backlash could easily be accidental and at least display the face he had potential to. Voldemort is a slightly different concept just because it's wholey within his mind. Dubious spells aside I can't remember a moment in the book where he uses a dangerous spell intentionally that wasn't life or death. One could argue even SS was used only because he didn't know it was fatal.

They're big books though. I may have missed it.

**** He didn't need to use the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow. He did it 'cause he wanted to.

While getting a peek into Snape's mind may have been a surprise, he doesn't fret over it at all. No, he didn't know Sectumsempra was fatal, but he knew it was for enemies. Harry knows what a pensieve is in OotP when he peeks into it. I don't really recall him being concerned that he'd violated Snape's privacy.

***** Oooo yes I had forgotten about that. Not that Carrie didn't deserve it. And that train of logic becomes horribly slippery. I can definitely see a harder Harry holding on to that after the war. Temper and all that.

As far as fretting over it or not I could totally see him thinking of it as an eye for an eye.

Technically a lot of spells are 'for enemies'. I think it's fair that assuming the book was owned by a standard hogwarts student that 'for enemies' would mean nothing worse than a bat bogey hex. He was pretty horrified when he realized how awful it was.

The privacy point is difficult just because 1. Teenagers. 2. There is a whole different level of wandering around a trusted adults office and basically seeing what is in their photo albums vs digging around in someone's non-isolated thoughts. It's still shitty but I feel like there is a line that got crossed somewhere in between those two.

** As far as I know, Harry didn't learn Occlumency in canon. Specifically, he was never able to close his mind to Voldemort. What he /was/ able to do was to figure out how to hurt Voldemort when Voldemort was in his mind, and he did it by doing the opposite of Occlumency: by concentrating on his genuine feelings of love and joy. We even have JKR's words to this end.

Is there evidence to the contrary that I am not aware of?

Also, do we have evidence that Bellatix is good at Occlumency? She would need to be decent at Legilimency to teach Draco---if Snape's speculation about that is correct---but from what little we see, you need Legilimency to teach Occlumency, but you don't need Occlumency.

Actually, if Bellatrix is a Legilimens, then there's some indirect canon evidence that Hermione had picked up Occlumency at some point, since Bellatrix, despite urgency, tortured her for information rather than use Legilimency. (Of course, an alternative explanation is that Bellatrix is a sadist and succumbed to temptation to torture the mudblood.)

*** I wouldn't say Harry knows occlumency, but closed his mind to/forces himself out of Voldemort's mind at the tail end of DH. And maybe when he was digging Hobby's grave.

******* Here's one. It's the shack:

#+begin_quote
  Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort's scream of fury vibrated inside his head. With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort's mind...

******** Thanks for taking the time to look it up. It looks like he is not able to keep the visions that Voldemort is leaking to him out---so he can't quite close his mind, whatever that means---but at least he can identify and interrupt. I don't think it's the same as resisting deliberate Legilimency, though.

*** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Legilimency]]

According to the wiki Bella taught Draco. Which I think at this point is established canon. She had no way to each Draco without Legilimency and I doubt one can teach a skill without knowing how to use it.

I attest Harry did learn Occlumency. Not in the traditional sense but there is more than one way to skin a cat. Instead of the traditional clear your mind he just forced the mind to focus on a different idea. It's the same way Snape was able to lay a faux memory. I think it's kind of splitting hairs as to how.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Occlumency]]

Also her quote seems limited to just when Snape taught him. Not after the fact. If this is quote you're going off of. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories

That being said I don't think we actually have any evidence of anyone other than Voldemort trying to dig into Harry's mind. So it's hard to tell if it was only effective because of EVIL or if it work for others. Correct me if I'm wrong.

**** The Wiki is based on Snape's speculation, and I was making that assumption explicit. I actually think that Snape is probably correct.

For some highly asymmetric skills, it is, in principle, possible to teach something without knowing it. For a sports analogy, if you want to teach someone to hit baseballs, your skill as a pitcher is probably more important than your skill as a batter.

Harry's "Occlumency" only works because Voldemort is allergic to love, and it wouldn't work against anyone else. For that matter, maintaining focus on one specific thing for a long time is actually quite difficult, and it's very easy to become distracted. Against Voldemort, Harry didn't need to do it for a long time, because Voldemort was more hurt by the contact than Harry. Someone who wouldn't be hurt by Harry's emotions could just keep throwing distractions at Harry until he lost focus, and then they'd be in.

Rowling's quote is about being /gifted/ in Occlumency, and the specific teaching method never comes up. Personally, I like the idea of magic being integrated with personality, and the very same traits that give Harry a powerful Patronus also cripple his Occlumency.

We know that Harry's occlumency didn't work against Snape at the end of HBP.
