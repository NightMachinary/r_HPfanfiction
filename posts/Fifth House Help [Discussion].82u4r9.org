I don't want to say much as I'm a few chapters away from actually introducing it to my fanfic and the reasons why it is added to the school and why it's allowed. But basically, I've been trying to come up with a name for a 5th Hogwarts House. All I'll say is some new courses will taught by a couple of goblins that are brought in. The 5th House's head will be a goblin as well. I just need a decent name for the new House, and for the life of me I can't come up with one. /They're all awful/.

Any help, please? :<


** Call it Merlin house and make sure to sort Harry, Hermione, Parvati, Padma, Susan, Hannah, Lisa, Su Li, Daphne and Tracey there. That way you'll avoid all the normal 5th house clichÃ©s.

**** Hat announces that Harry is important and needs his own house. Hat sorts him and a bunch of girls there. Sometimes Fred and George get moved there by the hat too. Another table appears in the hall and they need a teacher as head of house. One of the young and friendly teachers (normally a woman) like Vector or Burbage gets the job. Everyone in the house loves each other so they get tons of house points. Quirrel gets defeated somehow that relies on teamwork. Story gets abandonned.

***** Haha, yea those aren't the avenues I planned to go down. But thanks for giving me some specific things to avoid. xD The reason for the 5th House has to do with a certain political change and if Harry gets in the house (on the fence about this) there's more likely to be conflict; that's about all I feel like saying, heh.

** Niffletrum: Niffle for niffler, since they burrow into the ground and like gold like goblins. Trum for rostrum, apparently the scientific name for a duck's bill/beak.

Flobberflop: For Flobberworms. It's a depressing name, but I thought it was amusing.

That's all I can really think of. Sorry if they're both terrible names xD

*** Haha. I came up with one earlier that might be halfway decent: Sicklehound. Goblins love silver (even enchant it), they, um, dig and stuff like a dog. Aaaaand that's about all the reasoning behind the potential name. xD

I might make it so that "Sicklehound" is the surname of the goblin that's the head of the 5th house, and so they just use his name for the new house as well (another of the commenters suggested this).

Because dragons love to nuzzle themselves into hoards, and are also cool, so why not make the the house mascot.

** A Goblin surname such as Flitwick, Gringotts, Griphook, Ragnok, Gornuk, Gnarlak, Eargit, Brodrig, Bogrod, or Alguff. Or the name of the Goblin you intend to be the 5th House's head.

*** What makes you think "Flitwick" is a Goblin name? Considering it's used as a family name and Professor Flitwick only has /one/ Goblin ancestor somewhere (not necessarily in the paternal line), I never thought of it as a Goblin name. It doesn't sound like a Goblin name to me.

**** /Shrug/ lack of evidence either way. Flitwick, Griphook, Eargit, and Bogrod are all made with two existing English words. It fits a weak pattern and I haven't seen anything in the books to disprove it. So it's up for debate.

*** Actually, that might work on second thought (I didn't have a name for the Head just yet). I'm considering giving goblins surnames that wizards had ignored in favor of their epithets (real or imagined for them by wizards).

How does... /Sicklehound/ sound? Animal-y name, goblin-y too. Might settle for this if nothing else is to my liking, so thanks!

**** Sicklehound sounds cool. But none of the houses are named that directly after animals. Hufflepuff - ?? Gryffindor - derived from a magical animal Ravenclaw - named after the black talons of an eagle (her patronus) Slytherin - derived from the way a snake moves

Still it sounds cool, I think it's good.

- worms
- bats
- cavefish
- moles, voles, and rats

** [attribute][thing/suffix]

So what are the qualities of the house? Giblins so maybe persistence? maybe something with a bear or grisly?

Maybe Beardown? Or Bearowdown? because goblins like to burrow underground and also bears?

*** Hm, not sure about persistence since that seems awfully close to the hardwork of Hufflepuff. Maybe adventurous and goal-oriented (for profit and valuables, usually).

Bearowdown is kinda funny, heh. Might go with Sicklehound if not yours. Cause they hound after your money :)))))))

OK that was an awful pun

**** Goblins are known for their craftsmanship and attention to detail, as well as possessiveness, tenacity (character and physical grip), and pride. So there are overlaps with most of the houses in attributes. I'd probably focus on the crafting side, especially when introducing extra classes, think that could be really interesting.

You also need house colours that stand out among the existing colours- silver and gold would be good, or imperial purple captures their arrogance and sense of tradition.

I like the idea of a lemur as their house mascot - long fingers,good grip, used to low light levels, slightly goblin looking.

As for the name, Niffleheim (niffler plus norse mythology) or [goblin founder's name]wrought -eg Bodrodwrought. I think naming the house after themself shows the goblin pride in ownership nicely.

Sicklehound, while not sounding like a goblin name, sounds like the kind of nickname a non-goblin would give to a goblin. It would probably annoy the goblin, which might give you some more sources for tension in your story if you need it.

You can probably tell I've enjoyed thinking about this, so thanks for sharing your idea!

***** The crafting is focused on; it's one of the new courses I mentioned, "Spellsmithing". I'm not sure possessiveness is a characteristic prized by the other houses (closest to that would be ambition, which isn't really the same), but thanks for suggestions on the other prized characteristics.

Ah, good point on the color scheme.

Hah, hadn't considered that.

Ooh, another good idea on the naming. Considering that one. I quite like you input, thanks!
