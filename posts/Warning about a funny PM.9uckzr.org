I got a weird PM through ff.net this morning saying:

Subject: Warning! These beta readers are plagiarists!

I posted the ffn beta link as evidence on my profile for all to see. Do not trust these guys at all. THEY WILL COPY YOUR WORK!

I haven't clicked it because the browser showed it looking a little odd. Given the recent virus on ff.net I would probably advise no one clicking it.


** there is a post in the main fanfiction subreddit that this is actually another of those profile bomb things with critics united.

*** That makes sense. I'll continue to ignore it.

My god people have too much time on their hands.

** That /is/ weird. I mean, what does it even mean for a beta reader to be a plagiarist??

*** I guess they're trying to suggest that when you give your work to someone for them to beta it, they just upload it as their own. But the link was so dodgy looking I doubt that's the case.

*** They get access to the story prior to its posting, and then post it at their own maybe?
