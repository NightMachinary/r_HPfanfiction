I came across *Notes of Interest to the Informed Mind* by /Chuck_Johannsen/ yesterday, a fic written as though the author was an in universe scholar. I then asked the author permission to reference their fic in my own as my protagonist writes and reads a lot about various branches of magic and this is written like a professional text with referencing and all sorts.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any other fics like this? Fics that aren't really stories but texts like articles, theories etc. Or are supposed to be books that are written and read by wizards like The Tales of Beedle and the Bard.

I just thought it was really cool and want to reference and link them in my own fic.

Edit: if there's a tag on ao3 for these that would be cool to know

** This fic is a written like an in universe transcript of a radio interview with Anthony Goldstein, who had published an authorized biography of Harry Potter. The fic was written between OotP and HBP and includes references to Harry's 6 and 7th years that are now AU. So it's probably not something you'd reference in a fic, but it's great and vastly underappreciated nonetheless.

*Flourish and Blotts Hour--Transcript* by Ajarntham ----- /The Flourish and Blotts Hour welcomes Anthony Goldstein, author of the first authorized biography of Harry Potter, to its WWN show./ [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/2481/]]

​

A similar story by the same author is an in universe transcript of a radio interview with Justin Finch Fletchley. This one is canon compliant through DH and really focuses on post war reconstruction. This is probably closer to what you're looking for, although not quite as moving or funny as the first fic.

  The thirst for knowledge is a curious thing. It will bring enlightenment, but sometimes, with a little luck, it will bring so much more.

  The compilation of high-quality analysis in the realm of Natural Philosophy is somewhat lacking in my educated opinion. Ergo, I Charles Levinhand, shall arrange a comprehensive series of notes. Through these the curious public may grow familiar with the great depth insisted upon by the nature of existence.
