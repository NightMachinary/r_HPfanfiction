My favorite HP character is Hogwarts itself! So, I'm looking for fics that dive into the castle itself in interesting ways---secret rooms, etc. I love either new ideas or expanded ideas of canon (Further detail on the Chamber of Secrets or RoR, for example). I also love things that delve further into the history of the castle and the founders, just not necessarily founders-era fics.


** I love stories that talk about how Hogwarts is a marvel of magical engineering, and is technically sentient. As well as just cool magic things. Rooms that move around, or are in places they shouldn't physically fit. I've seen one where you walk down a hall way, and by the end looking out the window shows that you're somehow upside down. Just fun Non-Euclidean stuff.

*** That... that is not what Non-Euclidian means... Non-Euclidian geometry is geometry on a curved surface, like a sphere.

But yes. Hogwards being a Genus Loci with a mind of it's own would be cool.

Edit: Sorry, don't mean to be a know-it-all but the whole Non-Euclidian Geometry meaning eldritch locations thing has been bugging me for years. God damn you Lovecraft for not understanding math!

**** Sorry, should have been more specific. I didn't mean for those two sentences to be connected.

Probably should have said also, rather than just.

(I don't mind at all, thanks actually for pointing that out)

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** The non-Euclidean geometry of the castle comes up a lot in the first of The Arithmancer series, and there are definitely interesting bits of castle weirdness that pop up throughout the series. However, it's a lot to read through if you're just looking for some silly crazy Hogwarts fun-times.

** Nightmare Club by Elle Gray has a hidden tower room for the 8th years, Right Hand Red by LQT has some Room of Req and some exploration of the land around the castle. Harryromper has one about Hogwarts going feral and Harry et al have to mission back inside to see if they can heal the castle. Turn From Stone I think it's called.

**** Excellent! Here is an amazing fic series (Broken Mind by SensiblyTainted) - very heavy emotionally but so worth it! Anyway, starting somewhere in the middle of the first story in the series there are manifestations of the founders and they interact with the characters! Pretty amazing! [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/750510]]

In this one Harry goes back in time and hangs with the Founders and basically becomes one of them! It is an amazing fic as well! Crumbling Pedestal by Shivani [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20374462/chapters/48318478]]

Finally, in this one - Harry is the heir and they each have secret rooms! The Heir by Dragon eye 21 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7457052/1/The-Heir]]

There is also an unfinished story I know of as well that deals the other founders leaving animals or things hidden in the school. Let me know if you are interested. I don't go for unfinished fics but I was reading this in real time and then it was sort of abandoned. There are like years between updates - still not my usual but it's a good one!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1070691][For the Right Price series]] (one finished, one unfinished story) has Harry constantly finding secret passageways, much to his bemusement. You'll never look at Hufflepuff the same way again. Direct link is to AO3 series, also on FFN. linkffn(9894129)

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU
