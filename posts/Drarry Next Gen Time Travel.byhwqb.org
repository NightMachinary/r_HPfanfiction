Can Anyone Please Suggest A Drarry Fanfiction In Which Their Kids Accidentaly Go Back In Time When Their Parents Were Enemys


** Three gentle suggestions, my friend.

1. One enemy, two enem*ies*. Plurals are a tricky bit of the English language. Generally, if a word ends in "y" and you want to make more than one of it, drop the "y" and add "ies" to the end. Also, "accidentally" is spelled with two Ls.
2. Your capitalization is excessive and distressing. One capital letter at the beginning of the question would have been sufficient. The only time you see this format is in newspaper headlines, and even then it's disappearing.
3. Please also ask this question on the following communities: [[/r/HPSlashFic]], [[/r/drarry]]. I have found that most of the fics recommended here are genfic (no romance) or heterosexual ships.

I don't know any fics that meet your criteria off the top of my head, but the above advice may help you get more attention, which leads to answers. Best of luck!
