So my character is magical, her mum and dad aren't but her maternal grandmother is. Is she classes as muggle born or half blood?


** As she technically has "some magical blood", I'd say she is a half blood, if only because the term "quarter blood" doesn't really exist.

** So your OC has a squib parent?

Anyways, I'm pretty sure Harry Potter was half-blood, so your OC is probably half blood.

EDIT: nvm, didn't notice that you said 'not magicals' so squib are excluded, so yeah muggleborn

**** It really depends on your view, but having magical parents isn't enough to be classified as pureblood.

***** Yes, but it is enough to have you classified as half-blood, so not muggleborn.

** So the whole half blood muggleborn pureblood thing is mostly a bullshit thing the "purebloods" use to feel superior. So the answer is whatever would flatter the death eaters most.

Harry Potter is called a half blood, even though both of his parents are magical, because the death eaters declared Lily a muggle despite her obvious witchiness. Compare Snape and Tom Riddle, who have actually muggle parents.

If the maternal grandmother officially disowned the squib child, then they'd just count her as a muggleborn. If not, and she has politics they like and/or is impressive somehow, they would say she's a half blood and just avoid talking about her mother in polite company.

*** It's very obviously a comparison in a way to the ways Nazis classified Jews and ‘half-Jews' in the 1930s and 40s. IIRC, if three or four of your grandparents were Jewish then they considered you a Jew, and one or two led to you being classified a ‘half-Jew'.

**** I think you're mostly right but the death eaters don't keep records like the Nazis did, and they generally seem less organized. Until the Thicknesse administration, there was no government that sanctioned the idea of "pure bloods" and half bloods, but those were legal distinctions in nazi germany. I really think they would generally call a borderline case like this however confirmed their biases more.

And I know JKR has explicitly said she was going for Nazi Germany, but it definitely feels much more like Jim Crow south. It's a civil war, the government is mostly composed of people who aren't even particularly careful about hiding the fact that they put on masks and go murder and inflict terror, they're more interested in keeping [muggleborns|black people] subservient and second class than in exterminating them, the propaganda is much more about how they're lesser than conspiracies about how actually they run the world.

** Ultimately, it doesn't matter because blood status is, in universe, made up nonsense with /no/ (direct) practical bearing on anything (it's implied that the Gaunts were magically weakened by inbreeding to maintain their blood purity, but the cause there was the inbreeding itself, not its motivation). So, I imagine that some characters (mostly purists, like the Malfoys), would consider her muggleborn, where others would consider her halfblood, specifically /because/ these terms don't have exact, scientific definitions, which is kind of the point.

** Muggleborn... or she's really the grandmum's child and the parents are actually unrelated muggles who have been Confunded to act as her parents so the 'grandmum' doesn't have to do child care.

** half blood.

Muggleborns are people who have no known magical relations. The children of squibs are still related to magicals and thus not muggleborn.

*** Half-blood, technically. But they'd likely be looked on by the more bigoted members of society as being "just as bad" as a muggleborn.

The grandmother, a witch, married a muggle man: their daughter was born a squib. Their squib daughter then married a muggle man who had a magical child.

Harry Potter in canon was technically a half-blood, despite his parents being both magical: Lily was a muggleborn while James, a pureblood. His and Ginny's children would /technically/ be purebloods, given that all four sets of grandparents (Molly and Arthur, Lily and James) were magical, despite one being muggleborn. However, it's likely they'd still be viewed as half-bloods by more bigoted members -- just "near enough to Purebloods".

Remember to not fall into the trap a lot of writers do when it comes to prejudice by making it all a black and white/one dimensional issue.

I daresay there are some, even pureblood nutcases, that would be perfectly fine with Harry (outside of the Boy-Who-Lived thin), given that he had two magical parents: conversely, there are likely those on the extreme end of the spectrum that would consider him just as bad as a muggleborn in their eyes (e.g. Bellatrix).

To take an example of a disgusting viewpoint and to use a popular fanon character? Daphne wouldn't mind having Harry's kids one day because although Lily was a muggleborn, she was still a witch: he's magical, she's magical, so any "muggle taint" would be bred out of their hypothetical kids.

Others wouldn't see a problem with muggleborns, so long as they assimilated into magical society/norms, while others would have different views depending on the 'degree' of "half-bloodedness" -- a witch or wizard which has one magical parent is likely to be more accepted over one who's the son/daughter of a squib and a muggle, and the former is likely to be deemed "less acceptable" than a /technical/ half-blood like Harry, who has two magical parents but one is muggleborn (and even then another technical half-blood who has one parent magical and another, a squib? You can see where I'm going with this train of logic).

Basically, treat each character as having their own prejudices and not a cookie-cutter, black and white one dimensional take on it. It'll add depth.

***** In that case, she'd consider herself a muggleborn, as would others who wouldn't know about her family tree. In reality, she'd be a half-blood of some degree (kinda like how Dean didn't know he was a half-blood, thinking he was a muggleborn).

*** It's hard to say because canon never goes to any length to explain anything.

If a squib has a magical child with another squib then what? Are non magical desendants of squibs classified as squibs or do they become muggle at some point?

Squibs can interact with magic to some degree. Chief example is that Figg can see Dementors while Muggles cannot. Also I think they can sometimes do small feats of magic? Based on Filchs Kwikspell thing. Merope Gaunt was a functional Squib but she made a Love Potion. Can muggles given access to the ingredients and recipe do that?

I think it depends on politics. Stuff like counting the number of magical grandparents and parents and their blood status.

But if the person has a known magical ancestor who married a muggle, half blood is a safe answer.
