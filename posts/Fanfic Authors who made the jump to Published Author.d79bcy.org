I found Jim Bernheimer through his fanfics a bunch of years ago, and later started reading his published works (the D-List Super villain series) before realizing it was his.

Any other fanfic authors out there who have published works as well?

I ask because I'm getting to a point where I just can't read typical quality fanfic anymore. I don't really care what the story is about (although I'm pretty much done with school-era and fight-against-Voldemort era fics.)

I'm just frustrated with spending so much time looking for good stories, picking one to start, and continually being let down by the quality.


** The author Minisinoo retired from fanfic to write original fiction. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] was a well-written "Cedric Lives" AU.

My favorite former fanfic writer is Naomi Novik, who wrote the Temeraire series, a Napoleonic Wars alt history with dragons. It was originally based on a Master and Commander slash fanfic. The slashy stuff never appeared in her published works, which disappointed many in her fanfic following. Novik was also a founding member of the Ao3 team, so she was never one of those awful "Fanfic sucks and I'll sue if you write it" authors like Anne McCaffrey (Pern) or Anne Rice (Vampire Chronicles).

** E.L James (?) if I remember correctly, started 50 shades as a twilight fanfic. Don't write bad/unhealthy BDSM relationships and portray them as super hot and romantic. It's bad for the community and bad for new/curious people.

**** I would do the same thing.. minus the unhealthy, barely-BDSM relationship. You can probably tell I'm into the lifestyle myself and 50 shades has so many things wrong with the whole relationship and dynamic.

****** I suppose... but a lot of people don't have anyone in their life that will tell them that the relationship portrayed is not a safe, loving relationship. There's a lot of danger there. Personally, I wouldn't be willing to publish or portray that for any money, but to each their own.

Dire now stars in her own book series, with several interesting plot twists.

Yes, he's not (AFAIK) an HP author, but he is a fanfic-writer-turned-proper-author...

** Cassandra Clare! She used to write hp fanfiction, I didn't like it very much but I loved her published work. The Dark Artifices are her newest completed trilogy and The Infernal Devices is also a lovely trilogy by her, there are a bunch of companion-books as well and she has a few more books that are going to be out within the next few years in the Shadowhunters universe. I would skip The Mortal Instruments if I were you, You don't need to read it to understand what's going on in the other series because most everything is explained for audiences who don't want to read every single book.

** [[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][George Norman Lippert]] is a published author who also wrote 5 books (books!) of HP fanfiction, with other works set in the same universe. With Rowling's endorsement, no less. He also has a bunch of other stuff worth checking. Always had a soft spot for him, since his first two HP books were my introduction to HP fanfiction in general.
