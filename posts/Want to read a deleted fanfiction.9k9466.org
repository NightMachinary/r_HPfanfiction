Hi! So I really loved this fan fiction Lotos et Serpentium by @theaspiringcynic. It was a rare pairing fiction Padma/Tom Riddle Jr. but honestly it was superb, it wasn't completed, the author was sporadic with her/his update. Anyway, I really loved that fan fiction. I actually do have the story saved in my fanfiction.net account in my phone but I will soon change my phone, and I don't think I will be able to read it once it gets deleted from my phone. So please help me!!

** Do you know roughly when it was last updated by any chance?

*** Yup, it was last updated on 2017 July or August. A year back, then the author deleted her HP fanfics(only! She still has her other fandom stories) and she never replies on her pm, and I don't know if she's on any other social media platform or not.

**** Ok, no worries - there's a cache of over 100,000 ff.net fics available online, but it was taken in 2012 i think so not sure it would be that helpful for you! :(

***** Thank you so much for the concern. I found the fanfiction(some kind user on Reddit posted the link below) and also the author of that fanfiction reposted the story(though it's a bit different from before). Nonetheless, I'm very happy!
