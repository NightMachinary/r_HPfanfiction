Inspired by all the questions about tropes.


** I really hated harem war. And it wasn't the endless fountains of dumbledore and weasley bashing, it wasn't the sex, it wasn't the bad writing or the antifeminist premise. I went in expecting this and was willing to have a good time anyway.

It was something I called "wait, there's more!" syndrome.

No matter how awesome anything was, in the next chapter the author decides it wasn't good enough and made it more or bigger or cooler.

Oh, harry, you have a house? Oh, no, it's a mansion! Oh, it's the world's biggest mansion! It's not just library, it's the biggest library in the world! You have lands? Oh, they're bigger than the malfoys! Oh, it's actually an island! And you're actually your own country! And your net worth is 1/3rd of all Britain! Oh, you found a WWII bomber? Oh, you've got 12 of them! Oh, you've actually discovered twelve DOZEN of them and your house elves have been practicing in them illicitly?

The whole fic was like this.

** I just finished reading Lord of Caer Azkaban, and it is probably the most confusing fic I have read so far when it comes to liking and disliking it. The writing is questionable, but not terrible, but the organization of the Fic is just a disaster all around. In addition, it doesn't explain like 99% of the things that happen, just stating that they do, without going into detail, or giving you background. Each chapter is like the writer is just rushing through, trying to get as much of the story out as they can without any actual depth to it.

I knew I was in trouble the moment Harry was named Lord of Azkaban, and proceeded to not ask any questions, nor is anything explained to the reader. He just suddenly is Lord, and knows for the most part what to do.

And yet, the premise is quite intriguing, and I found myself desperately wanting to enjoy it, and at times I honestly did. There are a few laughs to be had as well. Genuine, "That was really funny" moments. But often such moments are immediately followed by... WTF author?

So, it's a typical Rorschach's Blot fic?

**** Certainly feels that way. The chapters are poorly organized in themselves, but the cherry on top are the authors notes. At the end of every chapter the Author decides to answer 5-10 reviewers questions. Not a terrible idea, but when some of your explanations are extra long, and just confusing (sometimes they dont seem to fit the fic... as if, the author edited something out but left the review response), it doesn't help. Not to mention the Author also tosses in alternate endings to events in the chapter prior like its going out of style.

** I'll probably nominate the Denarian trilogy (Renegade, Knight, Lord) for some of the worst/most confusing fight scenes I've ever seen. The series wasn't particularly good in its other constituent parts, but the fight scenes were what utterly dragged it into the ground. Emphasis on /dragged/. I'm honestly convinced that not even Shezza (the author) knew what the fuck was going on during the Department of Mysteries battle, because it felt like s/he'd just spent close to a full chapter vomiting words at me. S/he has almost no concept of how to use sentence structure to produce a dynamic fight, and after a while things just... fall away and become a confused jumble of words. People do things over and over (spell spam), and it never felt like it had much impact on the outcome due to the sheer length of the fights. Skimmed so much of that fic, just waiting for the damned things to end, because I don't know how, but Shezza made badass Harry fighting badass Voldemort /boring/.

I sometimes liken writing a fight scene to writing a sex scene. Shezza has the worst case of 'Tab A into slot B' I've seen out of either.
