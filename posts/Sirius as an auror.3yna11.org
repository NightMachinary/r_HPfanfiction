Where does this come from?


** There is no evidence Sirius was an auror. I have not seen a fic where just Sirius and not James are aurors. This is because they tend to stick together for drama.

Thematically, people like to enhance the 'good guys' vs 'bad guys' motif by making both James and Sirius highly trained police before their death/imprisonment. Having James actually be unemployed (which he technically was), makes him seem less noble. Making James (and by extension Sirius) the equivalent of magical SWAT gives him some legitimacy and training in fighting for the order, rather then being borderline child soldiers. According to Pottermore, James (and Sirius) first defy the Dark Lord when they are just 17, while in 6th year at Hogwarts.

There are certain requirements to becoming an auror that Sirius seems unlikely to meet, namely one has to have a minimum of five 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations' N.E.W.T.s in challenging subjects, with Potions highly recommended. The other thing is that Sirius was out of Hogwarts for about 3 and a half years before he was sent to prison, whether this is even long enough to become a fully qualified auror is unlikely.

** Not sure, really. It might have something to do with McGonagall's off-hand comment about Sirius being a more talented duellist than Pettigrew. Of course, there's more to being an Auror than slinging spells, and I doubt that someone with Sirius' temperament (at the time of his arrest) would have passed the character assessment.

*** Oh we don't have a clue about Sirius' temperament before his stay in Azkaban. Sure he was mean, a bully, reckless, thoughtless etc but him going after Pettigrew, his friend of 10 years that betrayed them and got James and Lily killed isn't temper. Anyone would've gone mad angry. Arthur fricking Weasley would go mad and chase Pettigrew.

**** We do, though, as Sirius tells us himself. He admits to being extremely brash, cocky, and that he thought he could outsmart Voldemort. So we have his testimony, the recklessness that resulted in his death, and even his and James' attitude in the 800-word prequel that JKR wrote a while back.

I'm not saying that he's an incompetent wizard, or even a shitty person. But he clearly lacked the composure one would expect from an elite lawman in those circumstances.

Now if he /was/ an Auror at the time, that speaks volumes. He should've known what would happen after working under Crouch Sr's stint as the DMLE Head.

***** An another interesting point about Auror Sirius is we know that aurors were permitted to use the unforgivables during the First Wizarding War (mostly I believe this is aimed at the AK rather then the other two). If Siruis did, does that make him less noble? What does that mean in terms of his whole extreme anti-dark arts and family issues? Could this have made his mental state worse, directly leading to his actions on Halloween, and the confrontation with Peter? How did this affect him in Azkaban?

****** That's a good point. The deeper you go, the more apparent it is that Sirius working in an Auror Office under Crouch's control was highly unlikely. Besides, it's unnecessary: they were full-timers for the Order of the Phoenix straight out of school.

** Let me ask this, what do you think he would do? I'm not saying Sirius would defineitly be an auror but when i think a Sirius that didn't go to Azkaban i really can't fit him into any other profession. And also being an auror is an action job so when the writer requires Sirius to be in a place for plot he/she doesn't have to come up with a 2k word explanation and just say "Sirius and a group of aurors arrived."

*** I'm pretty sure he was unemployed. There is talk of how he relied on the money he got from his uncle, and he is only 21 when imprisoned during a civil War.

***** I did not see that line. But still... Even if Sirius didn't go to Azkaban, I can still see him being unemployed as long as possible. After that? Maybe relying on his friends. After that? Is there a magical social services?

I think he would do anything (apart from outright illegal acts) to get out of working a real job.

** Why does sirus need to be a perfect citizen to be an auror? He probably could have become one on blood status alone. I don't remember anywhere it stating all aurors were elite wizards with impeccable behaviour

*** 'elite wizards with impeccable behaviour'

No but they are elite fighters, which implies training, which implies time and learning. Dropout Sirius who kids around and doesn't take things seriously is not going to be given training (ie waste teachers time) and even if he does get training, he needs to work at it... which really can you see him doing?

**** When do we see Aurors as elite fighters?

They're investigators, and they have Hit Wizards for when they know they're going to take down a target that's going to be rough and will have casualties (which can be assumed since Hit Wizards have their own permanent bed at Mungo's, in canon).

We see them (maybe?) at the World Cup and they shoot stunning spells.

The other Aurors we see we're all recruited to the Order and Dumbledore likely took some of the better fighters. Even then, Tonks got tossed around in book 5 and died in book 7 after no memorable fights. Kingsley dueled passably in book 5, then hit his stride in DH when he dueled Voldemort along with McGonagall and Slughorn - even still, we see very little (if any at all) evidence of "elite fighters".

***** We know Tonks hasn't finished training, and even if she does finish by book 7, we don't actually see much of the fighting to make a decision about how well she does. Remember, the light side is very much outnumbered, and Tonks, as one of the few actual fighters may be doing alot more off screen/page.

McGonagall says: "It's a difficult career path... they only take the best." Ron says: "But they're, like, the elite,... You've got to be really good." Tonks comments that they have lots of training, including: "Concealment and Disguise ... Stealth and Tracking" We know the Ministry uses them guard high profile targets including the British Prime Minister (Kingsley posing as his secretary). That is not the job of a regular police office, but in the UK is done by the Protection Command Specialist Operation group, a group similar to the Counter Terrorism Command. In the US, it would be the Secret Service. But this is only what we see them do, as they also hunt down and capture Dark Wizards, but are 'handed over to the authorities' after this, meaning the Auror Office is not in charge of processing, charging or imprisonment.

Perhaps the greatest evidence is the departments within the DMLE (with info from both films and books). If we base it off the structure of the Metropolitan Police Service:

Magical Law Enforcement Patrol (Uniformed police, we hear this group is responsible both for the arrest of Morfin Gaunt and also the regurgitating toilets in Bethnal Green.)

Investigation Department (Detectives)

Ministry of Magic Witch Watchers (Intelligence Command)

Department of Intoxicating Substances (Narcotics)

Administrative Registration Department (bureaucrats, the Muggle-Born Registration Commission is part of this, but normally (non-War) may be more things like the Animagus Registry)

Wizengamot Administration Services (court registries)

Improper Use of Magic Office (No direct equivalent but self explanatory, more admin then police)

Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office (No direct equivalent but self explanatory, more R and D then police)

Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects (No direct equivalent but self explanatory, more R and D then police)

Hit Wizards (SWAT? See note below.)

and the\\
The Auror Office (which would therefore be the Homicide and Serious Crime group, or apart of the Police Special Operations)

Really, it may be possible 'Hit wizard' is in fact another name for Auror, as they appear to have large overlaps in their jobs, and no one defines them as separate (the is no 'Hit Wizard' department seen in the DMLE directory). Its been suggested before that Hit Wizard are Military Police, while Aurors are still part of the police, like the difference between the Police Special Operations and Special Air Service.

So yes, the Aurors are the elite unit. Just because we see more of them then the other forces doesn't make them common, in fact it just highlights the issues the characters are dealing with.
