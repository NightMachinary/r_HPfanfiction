I once read a fic a super long time ago that -incorporated time travel- but was set in a medieval time period that featured knights, ladies of a court, etc. I'm not necessarily looking for a time travel fic, just something that takes place in an older era with a different "world" than normal fics. The one I read was a dramione, but any pairing/characters would suffice. Thank you to anyone out there who could give me a lead!


** Post Medieval, but a good period-piece:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]]

Summary: In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

You might also look up fics with the Hogwarts Founders as main characters.

**** A Long Journey Home was just updated a few days after you speculated that it was abandoned. I would recommend that you read it. It is really good and looks to be going an interesting direction.

****** I just read it myself. It is really good. I hate getting into a fic only to realise that it is abandoned. Thankfully this one isn't.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Game-of-Thrones-Crossovers/224/8324/][This list]] is all I could think of, but it's just GoT crossovers.

BTW your username is awesome. I love the story of Ceridwen.

** Are you open to other time periods? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6608051/1/Of-Muggles-and-Magic][Of Muggles and Magic]] (SSHG) is really well written. It takes place during the Regency.
