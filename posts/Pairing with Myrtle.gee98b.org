Basically what the title says, I want to see Myrtle paired with someone. Just sounds interesting. Even more so if she as a ghost is paired with a human.


** She gets a boyfriend in The Love of a Good Wizard by SweetSorcery. It's a very small part of the story, but it's the literally the only one I've ever read that gives her a happy ending.

  Have you ever loved someone, but had virtually no chance with him? All Myrtle has ever wanted was for Harry to love her as much as she loves him. Now, thanks to an unexpected friendship and a little magic, her dreams just might come true.

** There was some crack-fic, where she was paired with Draco Malfoy, but I don't remember any details.
