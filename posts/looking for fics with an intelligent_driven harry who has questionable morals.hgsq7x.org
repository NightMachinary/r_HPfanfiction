the above categories aren't mandatory but often my favourite fics have those in common.

i don't mind which house he goes into or whether he is against or with voldemort. i don't mind wbwl or any tropes, but it has to be well written.

no ginny/harry, ron/harry or draco/harry please! but any other pairing is ok (i'm partial to tomarrymort, snape/harry or any strong female lead with him).

thank you!


** An Unfound Door by Joe is a good one. Definitely some mild inspiration from the Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch there. Could also look into Knowledge is Power by Defenestrable and any of the similar ones like that Transfiguration obsessive one I forget the name of. They all follow similar patterns of "Intelligent Harry is vaguely misanthropic and gets obsessed with a single field of magic to help someone out."

** In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenonoKyuubi has a Harry extremely similar to Soul Eater's Dr. Frankenstein. This version of Harry is driven by only one thing: progress!

In his eyes, everything -even he himself- is an object of study, dissection and improvement and he ends up modifying his own body extensively in order to increase his own performance in all fields. He is a terrifying sociopath unafraid of scorn or fear from the common sheep and quite often experiments on his unsuspecting schoolmates. There is a very dark sense of humor found in this fic that I personally enjoy very much.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  AU. In a world where Sybil Trelawney is never born, the prophecy remains, but goes unheard. How different will Harry Potter's life be, growing up in a world where Voldemort won? How long until a brilliant young man is noticed by the ever more brilliant Dark Lord?

** The best written incredibly intelligent Harry I've read is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) It also just so happens to be my favorite Harry Potter fanfiction to date. It's a WBWL fic that subverts a lot of common tropes in that genre. It makes an effort to make everyone smarter, not just Harry. It's nearing the end of the third book now and is being updated at a semi-regular basis. It has a rough start but if you can push through it's quite a delight. Highly recommended, I hope you enjoy. (No pairing established yet)

Also, you've probably heard of this before but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) Incredibly well known and imo very well written.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Yep! I have heard so much about PoS and started it but didn't really see the hype (thank you for saying it gets better--- I hadn't considered the PoS discord server as the appropriate place to ask if it improves). Honestly HPMR deserves a reread at some point.

**** Oh yeah, a lot of people have trouble with the beginning. I think a few on the server just skipped the first book entirely XD. But if you're willing to get through that and give it another go I think it's worth it. The server's a great time, I never knew just how much I didn't know about canon lol

** Linkao3(Death Is But The Next Greatest Adventure). It's got smart, driven(especially intellectually), grey Harry with dubious morality. Basically, he operates on 'As long as it doesn't involve me or my friends I don't care'. The pairing is Tomarry but I haven't got that far yet(I first read it shortly before it went on hiatus a little bit ago and am re-reading it). It also has Master of Death Harry and a minor bit of Heir Harry but it doesn't have much impact on the story quite yet. Also there's Wolfstar.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)
