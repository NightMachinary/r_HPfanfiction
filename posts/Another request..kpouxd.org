Heyo guys. I'm looking for some master of death harry fics. I don't mind if they're crossovers or anything that it's not too trope heavy. I'm primarily looking for long(100k+ words) Harry focused fics. As always romantic subplots are appreciated but not necessary. Thanks in advance for your help and time Luzifer.


** Silk roads is a pretty good fic I dont know hot to link thing so all i can do is tell you the name .
