[Request] Long and complete, with no pairings, HHr, HPFD, or HPLL. Maybe even Gary Stu Harry... I need something to put me to sleep in a long flight. Thanks.

Request unclear.

Do you want no pairings, and HHr, HPFD and HPLL are just three examples of the pairings you don't want?

Or do you want no pairings /except for/ HHr, HPFD and HPLL?
