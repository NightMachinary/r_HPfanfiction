Looking for any fic that features Harry being in a relationship that no one else knows about.


** "Why do we have to hide? Don't you LOVE me?!"

"Don't you see, you'll be in danger! If they know we're together you'll be a target."

"But don't /you/ see I'm already a target? I'm a (high-achieving muggleborn/bloodtraitor daughter of a family that's always fought against the dark/daughter of a neutral family that refused him)."
