They're such interesting, forgotten side characters that have a lot of potential? A couple that just so happens to be two well-respected aurors that have their 'deaths' cause outrage by the Wizarding World? They were such badass people and they're not used very much so I was wondering if there were well-written fics that flesh them out (personality, career, whatever). I've already read TLAT.

Thanks in advance
