#+TITLE: I just finished "Imogen". The first few paragraphs hooked me, and I read the whole thing (about 500 pages) in two days. It was like being a kid again coming home after standing in line at the bookstore for the release of the latest in the series.

Here's the link. I can't really do this book justice in a few short lines.

​

I've never posted here before. I hope I'm not breaking rules by posting a link or something:

** I couldn't read the first chapter! :( It was so mean and fictional JK ROWLING is so scary just coming into a office and making a lady go upside down like that because she can! :( :(

*** Hey that's a bit of a spoiler! But it's true to form; JK hates people who write that sort f fan fiction.

**** I mean, it literally happens in the first page, so not really a spoiler. Also, if you actually want people to give the story a read, you might want to summarize it a bit. I went and gave it a look, and from the first chapter I can't really tell what sets it apart from other self insert fics, apart from a weirdly aggressive JK Rowling

*** I had to look up that Mary Sue expression. I don't think the main character would qualify as a Mary Sue, any more than Harry would if he were female.

What sets this story apart is it asks the following question: suppose Rowling were not writing fiction, but reality? What flows from that?
