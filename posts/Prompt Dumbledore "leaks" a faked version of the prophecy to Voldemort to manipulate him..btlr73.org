Perhaps "the Dark Lord will try to end him thrice, but he will construct his own demise" to have him avoid Harry


** linkffn(When a lioness fights) has that trope in the later chapters once the Parallel universe of OOC almost everyone has been established. Although it is Snape heads the operation of creating, feeding and making Voldemort believe it under the auspices of the Order and Dumbledore's command. Having said all of that, I enjoyed the fic when I read it.

  Hermione Granger, master spy, and Severus Snape, spymaster to the Order. An unlikely partnership, forged to defeat the Dark Lord on his own ground. But to do so, they must confront their own darkness within. Spying, torture, angst and love. AU after fifth

** Here is a question: How does this change anything for the better?

As far as we know if Voldemort had ignore the Potters he would have won the war, so.... And if you're talking post 81 then I just don't see it working, he will seek confirmation by any means so it's 5 year again, but with Voldemort's side probably escalating and making everything worse.

Also, even if Voldemort ignores Harry, it won't make Harry's life any better, we all can predict the Prophet response to that, as well as the public's.

*** I was actually thinking around book 5, have a faked prophecy that's more easily stolen to manipulate Voldemort to not try to kill Harry if the fake prophecy says that he'll lose anyway.

**** > easily stolen

​

it's already screaming shits gonna blow up.

​

Dumbledore already tried to manipulate fate and shit went waywire, if Dumbledore didnt bother to protect Harry using Fidelius charm, one could say both potter could possibly end up alive because Voldermort raid the potter house without anyone inside for god know what reason.

​

Also wtf makes you think he can be deceive, he maybe a fool in front of severus but hes the strongest dark lord of all time for a good reason.
