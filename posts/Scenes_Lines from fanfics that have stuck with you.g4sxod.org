(I think this is the right flair to use, I feel like there's a bunch that could've applied. Apologies in advance to mods if I guessed wrong.)

So as one is want to do during times of social distancing, I was diving through my many...many.../many/ favorites on FFN, when I remembered (and reread and got misty-eyed over) this scene from Kezzabear's "Rebuilding Life":

#+begin_quote
  "Im tired of pretending I don't want that," Harry explained. "All I want is a place for me and you and our family."

  "Why would you pretend you don't want that?" Ginny asked.

  "Because...it's..." Harry stopped, unable to express what he meant. If he admitted wanting to spend the rest of his life with Ginny, even though he knew it was undeniably true, he'd be admitting that he wanted to marry her and while he knew that -- had even said that -- the picture of his life was somehow more explicit than mere words. [...] And if he admitted wanting something for himself it meant being selfish, because Harry Potter wasn't allowed to have anything that was just for him.

  "Which part of the house let's you follow your dreams?" Ginny asked quietly [...].

  "There's a space," Harry whispered. "Under the stairs and it's just a space and no one has to live there and there's no cupboard, just space. And that space is as full of as much love as the rest of the house and all the love in the house just fills it up until there's no room for it and it spills out all the windows and all the doors."
#+end_quote

It's a scene that never fails to tug at my heartstrings and one that sometimes I catch myself thinking of randomly for no reason. Which lead me to wonder, are there scenes like that for you all? Scenes or quotes or characters that just make an impact with you and stick with you and make you want to return to them again and again?

(And why yes, this is a thinly-veiled search for new material to read, however did you guess?)


** You know, I want to put down something profound.

The truth is that the fanfic scene that has stuck with me the most over the years is a scene from one of the Harry The Hufflepuff stories.

Remus is trying to get Harry to defeat a boggart, and it turns into Trealawny in a skimpy bathing suit or something trying to have her way with him and both Harry and Remus freak out trying to get rid of it.

I almost passed out laughing the first time I read it and to this day I cannot read a scene with a boggart in it without thinking of that stupid joke.

... Damn, now I have to go back and read it again!

It's such a wonderfully bullshit story! I'm pretty sure the house elves form an army to fight off a rampaging horde of Monster Book of Monsters and Harry makes a life model decoy golem so that he doesn't have to go to class. I'm also pretty sure that Sirius adopts it.

Update: found it

"On the count of three," said Professor Lupin. "One --- two --- three --- now!"

Red sparks leaped from his wand, flinging the trunk lid open.

Professor Trelawney stepped from the trunk, dressed in a 'barely-there' robe Harry distinctly recalled from the Divine-Action memory-sphere 'lessons'.

"Come, dear boy," she rasped throatily. "Let me take you into the great beyond!"

"Riddikulus! Riddikulus! Riddikulus!" screamed Lupin, waving his wand as frantically as Harry.

Ah, memories

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/20/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]], basically an edgy Dark!Harry fic where his brother is the BWL. It's really not everyone's cup of tea, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine, mainly due to its portrayal of Dark Magic being /actually/ addictive, and Harry only 'winning' due to sheer luck and his enemies underestimating him.

This scene is at the very end, and I keep thinking back to it. It seems fitting that Harry finally reaches an obstacle he can't overcome /just/ at the cusp of victory, and taking advantage of Dumbledore's regrets in order to secure his newly revived sister's protection is just the cherry on top.

#+begin_quote
  "You... you ruined our whole family, Dumbledore." I started, making up my last plan as I talked, "I won't forgive you."

  He stood up. "I wouldn't ask for forgiveness, Harry."

  "Zachary! James! Lily! Me!" I growled as loud as I could. "We're all as good as dead, yes, even your precious Zachary is destroyed forever! He's never coming back from this, he'll always bear hatred toward me and that's no one's fault but yours!" I stared in his eyes from his feet.

  "But there is one left, one who has a second chance. Dumbledore, only you can do this! Take Natasha away, give her a life! You destroyed us, but I gave my all to protecting her, save her, Dumbledore!"

  He looked behind me, at Alyson running toward the forest with Natasha in her arms.

  "You've lost your right to meddle in this world's affair any longer, but there's one last thing you can do right. Let your last action be a good one, Dumbledore! Take her and hide her!"

  He sighed. "Yes... yes this is the very least this old man can do..." he muttered, staring at his hands. He chuckled, his voice getting slightly teary. "I thought I knew all about it, but I was a fool... I didn't get it at all."

  I stared intently at him.

  He looked in my eyes one last time and spoke aloud. "I can hardly call myself better than you, after all, Harry. We both destroyed many innocent for purposes we believed just. Neither of us has been doing the right thing, even though we were so sure of ourselves... I will take Natasha away and leave this world."

  He peered down at me. I nodded. There was nothing I could do anymore. Having Dumbledore hide her was better than I had hoped, even though I hated the thought.

  "I'm sorry, Harry." He said finally. He whistled, and in a flash, the phoenix took him away.

  I was left here for a few seconds, alone, bleeding in the grass, until the Aurors arrived, panting and sweating.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

"Severus Snape has a death wish." and "the not-innocent, but differently guilty". These lines are from Blood Magic by Gateway Girl (great fic IMO).

** It's not a specific quote, exactly, but I'm always touched by a scene in Nightmares of Futures Past. On Ginny's first ride on the Hogwarts Express, she sees Luna being bullied, and dashes to get help. And at a word from her, Harry is on his feet, followed closely by Ron, Hermione, and Neville, who rapidly put Draco and goons in their place.

It's significant because Harry's come back from a bad future to do things better this time, and it's /working/. He and his friends are much closer, to the point where instead of Ginny being shy and speechless around him, and all alone, she immediately turns to all of them when she needs help.

** One of my favourites it the line from Through Quiet Emerald Eyes [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1039565][Link]]

“Voldemort,” he snarled.

“That's right, young Potter.  It's Lord Voldemort, and I need you to bring me the stone.  If you do what I have for you willingly, I'll let you join me and live.”

“Excuse me, but you don't look like Remus Lupin- as in, you can't be fucking serious.” He gave the two-faced man some intense side-eye, and despite the situation, Ron couldn't hold back a snort, lying on the ground and pretending he was still tied up.

#+begin_quote
  After awhile, Credence finally looked at him from the other side of the table. They had decided to sit inside the suitcase, everyone but Mrs. Flamel who still had work outside and preferred to “leave the men to themselves”. It was a good arrangement that allowed them to include Graves into a sense of normalcy his wound didn't allow him to the rest of the time.

  “What you said, the other time... “ Credence fidgeted a bit on his chair. Harry wondered if he had been like that when he was younger. “Mr. Graves said I should trust you. On this, at least.”

  Credence threw a look at Graves who nodded.

  Harry leaned back into his chair. “Talk,” Harry said softly because really, he didn't have much to say. He didn't know this boy -- had barely talked to him-- but he knew the /look/ .

  “You- you asked me why I didn't think I need help.”

  Harry nodded. “I killed people.” blurted the boy.

  Harry saw everyone around the table tense, but he just stared at him for a while. When it was apparent that Credence didn't have anything more to say, Harry decided to talk. “And why killing someone should make you undeserving of help?”

  Harry ignored the way everyone was looking at him like he had sprouted a second head.

  “Because it's... it's wrong! it's a crime, a sin!”

  “ Did you enjoy killing this person?”

  “N-no, I-”

  “Did you planned to kill this person?”

  “Of course not-”

  “Did you kill this person for no reason at all?”

  “No...” Credence had lowered his eyes, flushed. Harry was happy to see that there was no trace of wild magic. It was still there, rampant under the surface, in tide with the boy' emotions. Oh, Harry knew what it was to be in this child's shoes, to be sitting on a wooden chair, head bowed in shame and heart heavy in guilt.

  “Well, I don't see the problem.” His words rang into the room. “Do you think you are the first one to commit murder? The last? From the look of things, you killed someone without wishing to do so, and you regret what happened. It doesn't repair everything, but it is enough.”

  That made the boy look up. Harry knew he had to do something, or the boy would just return into the ocean of self-hatred. Never quite looking for death, never quite avoiding it when it was presented.

  “I was eleven.”

  There was a stunned silence as every eye but Credence' moved on him. But Harry didn't look at them. All his attention was on the cowed young man in front of him. "He was a professor. Someone I trusted. He tried to kill me, and I put my hands on him. His flesh... Turned to ash. Raw magic. And for the longest time, he had that look on his face... But I was scared and angry and hurt. So I put my hands on his face and burned him until he was no more than a pile of ashes and his screams just a buzz in my head. The adults around me acted like nothing had happened. Told me it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault. The kids quickly forgot the professor. I never did. For a long, long night I wondered: was I a monster? Did I deserve to go to jail, to die? Were the muggles I lived with right, was I a dangerous freak that should be put down? But then, many things happened. I chose to decide that it didn't matter. I lived. I defended myself, I defended others, and I lived." Harry sighed and looked away, for a moment. “You know, they tell you that there is something in you that goes when you kill. You think: “that's it, I killed a man. I will never be the same again.” But you wake up the next day, and you are the same. You are still you. What happened was in you, you just didn't know it. What you need, now, is to try to live with it.”

  Harry stood up, trying very hard to ignore the stares that were burning him from everywhere. He was doing a good thing.  /He was./

  “You'll be good, kiddo. You'll be fine,” Harry said, and left.

** Another scene that struck with me was this from this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12591080/21/Harry-Potter-and-the-Critical-Game]]. I especially enjoyed McGonagall's line.

#+begin_quote
  Harry had barely managed to spoon some eggs onto his plate when a ridiculously large owl flew in carrying an even larger stack of paper held together by rope with its claws. Behind it Hedwig flew, carrying a stack of about half that size herself.

  A note was stuck to it which in strict legalese assured Harry that the entirety of his financial records were in the stacks, and that they had fulfilled their end of the treaty in its entirety.

  Harry stared at the mountain of papers.

  Harry could not carry that many papers---it was literally taller than he was!

  "What... um, what did the owls bring?" Neville asked.

  "My financial records." Harry replied distractedly. He was still staring at the mountain. Was it just him or did it seem to be growing?

  "Oh." Neville said.

  "Couldn't you have asked for a summary?" Hermione asked.

  "They're not legally bound to give out a summary, only the full records." Harry explained. He felt a headache coming on.

  "Your bird's eating all your food." Seamus said.

  Harry nodded.

  "Mr. Potter." Someone---Percy? ---said.

  "Yes."

  "What is---is this?"

  "He ordered his financial records from the goblins." Hermione explained. "Because he didn't know anything about his financial situation, and figured he needed to learn at least who was managing it for him."

  "Worked out great for you, didn't it?" Ron laughed.

  "While I will never critique self-sufficiency or maturity, I do wonder why you had your /confidential/ records delivered to the middle of the great hall rather than, say, your dorm room."

  "I didn't know I could have it sent there." Harry said. Careful observation had proved that the pile was not in fact growing, but that it was so tall to begin with that his brain didn't want to comprehend it.

  "Well." Percy said.

  Professor McGonagall arrived then and was quickly filled in. "I must say, this is a first Mr. Potter."

  "It is?" Harry asked.

  "Yes. I do believe that you can lay claim to being the only student in the history of Hogwarts to have a ten foot pile of paper involving personal records delivered to the middle of the great hall fifteen minutes before class starts."

  "Yay." Harry said. Then he blinked. "You can help, right?"

  "I daresay I can." She said, before promptly shrinking the entire thing to about a foot tall and binding it together with conjured rope. "The conjuring will disappear in about six hours, the shrinking in about a quarter of an hour later. I suggest you have the records secured before then."

  "Yes, Professor."

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

And it has my favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  Many hold the belief that the ultimate goal in life is to be in a state of complete contentment, free of struggle and suffering. However, one must take into consideration that all things are relative. Without salt, there is no sweet; without dark, there is no light; without suffering, happiness cannot exist. A life consisting only of happiness would quickly lose its beauty. It would be living life in a straight line; every day, happiness would deteriorate further into normalcy, until finally one would be caught in a state of boredom. Happiness would become like a drug -- more and more would be needed to lift the spirits until, finally, stagnation would be the only sensation remaining, there being no further levels of happiness to be achieved. The smallest hitch in a plan would feel like ultimate devastation. The ultimate goal in life, then, is to experience the fullest range of emotions possible, and to always be struggling towards some end.

#+begin_quote
  The teachers at Hogwarts were the quirkiest bunch of characters he'd seen since Milo had been hired to take out a gnome barbarian's band of performing cutthroats. One of them was wearing a purple turban. One of them was /tiny/ (Milo couldn't tell, from this distance, if he was a gnome, halfling, or dwarf). One of them was Albus Dumbledore, for gods' sakes. The last, though... now, /he/ was /really/ interesting. Black cloak. Greasy hair. Hooked nose.

  Necromancer, hands down. Milo grinned. /Ladies and gentlemen, we have our dark wizard/. Milo gave it a fifty percent chance that the professor was working for You-Know-Who, with the /other/ fifty percent saying he /was/ You-Know-Who. The only nail missing from his coffin was a goatee.

  "Hey, Hermione, who's he?" Milo gestured to the obviously evil wizard.

  "'Professor Severus Snape, born 1960, made Potions Master at Hogwarts in 1981 by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and as of 1991, is the Head of House Slytherin,'" she recited. "/Hogwarts, A History/, page 371."

  "You're a very useful person to have around, you know that?" Milo asked. Hermione beamed. "Harry, listen up. Add Snape to your list, he's bad news."

  "Are you sure?" Harry asked.

  "Absolutely. I mean, just /look/ at him.

  "I suffered a lot from the time I was fifteen months old until I moved to America a few years ago. Each and every person who inflicted that suffering on me did so for the same reason: Power.

  "For some it was monetary power, others, political power. The worst did it because they enjoyed the feeling of power they got from hurting and controlling others.

  "The reason I am telling you this story is because Ian was killed for the same reason. Power. It could be the money, the influence he had over young people like you, or it could be that some stupid idiot felt threatened by him and they wanted to take back a non-existent imagined power.

  Her green eyes are fixed on him, alive, full of something powerful, something he can only barely comprehend. “Severus, you have to live after I'm gone. I want you to live.”

  And then she vanishes, and he is alone once more, in the dingy kitchen of his childhood home. It has taken some time, this accounting of her life. It is the middle of the night, and there is rain against the window where there was none before. He doesn't know how long he sits there, turning the vial over in his hands. He has lost all track of time these weeks, and has no sense of it until the faint light of dawn begins to brush its fingers down the shut curtains.

  Severus rises, moves to the window, and lifts the heavy fabric to watch.

  The sun may be pulling itself over the horizon, but here, in Cokeworth, there is a soft spring rain still falling. Droplets cling to the window, collecting in streams, in rivulets, in rivers cascading to the earth.

  Lily always loved strange weather.

  It is the first thought he has had of her that he has not tried to swallow up with magic or shut away from himself. Lily would sprint through it when the sun slanted through raindrops, when it thundered when it was snowing, when the sky went odd colors at dawn and dusk. She had loved all of it.

  And the skinny, strange boy from across the river. Yes, and him.

  Severus moves to the front door and opens it, extending one hand out into the rain. The sun is faraway and pale, but it still feels warm on his face. He realizes he hasn't left the house since he returned to it, hasn't felt the rain on his skin in--he doesn't know how long.

  Rain with dawn sunshine running through it has no magical properties, is included in no potion, is no kind of antidote to any of the poisons he has known, and yet--

  And yet, he steps out into it anyway, into the water and light.

Calling a professor on anti-Slytherin bias:

#+begin_quote
  “You and the others and your bloody prejudice. You think there's not a bit of goodness to be found in a Slytherin, that we're not capable of such a thing. Then you discover that I literally have the power to sink this island beneath the ocean for all time, and suddenly you've decided I must be a worthy person, after all.”

  “I---”

  “Do the Slytherin students in your class ever speak to you? Do you ever have to field a question from a Slytherin? Or is it only the third-years, who quickly learn not to bother---that even if you grant them an answer, there is a coldness to your eyes that the other Houses never see? Children /are not stupid/. I know you've done such a thing because many Slytherins who've dwelled in my Common Room over the years told me so. How long does it take you to convince them not to come back for next term, I wonder?”

  Nizar leans forward and pins the woman with an icy stare. “Do you understand how that places the students of this school in danger, Septima Vector?”

  “Just because my subject is strict---” Septima tries, but Nizar cuts her off.

  “I do not like hypocrites, Septima Vector. You need to understand that while I am a war mage, I am the titled Protector of this school /first/. If you do not gain a swift understanding of how your prejudice harms students by keeping them from getting the education they are entitled to within these halls, I can assure you, it isn't Salazar Slytherin you need to fear.” Nizar flicks his finger at his classroom door, which opens on silent hinges. “Now, get out. Come back when you've more brains in your head than to be impressed that I didn't let your family line die out a thousand years ago.”

#+begin_quote
  They held hands and watched magic rise and twine and gather and release. They saw yellow tying together emerald green and violet-blue in a fragile thread, a knot over their heart. So delicate, and yet so strong.

  /Two are stronger than one. For when one would fail, two would prosper./

  Flitwick's final words, as he held their hands in his own.

  Then yellow swirled and was gone, collapsing upon itself out of existence.

  Then they, too, fell upon themselves, in a fever of magic and emotion.

  And between them, slender and strong as a spider's web, their souls grasped one another tightly and didn't let go.

#+begin_quote
  Harry spun around, walked a few paces away from her, and then turned to face her. “It's funny,” he said, “but I was talking to Malfoy yesterday, and I actually realized something. I realized I owe you an apology.”

  She stared at him. He was so pale that his eyes seemed the only colour in his white face. He said, “I'm sorry. I'm sorry I never told you I loved you. I'm sorry I waited until it looked like I might lose you before I did anything. I'm sorry I lied to you when you asked me if I loved you. I just never thought of it like that. You've always been like a part of me, like how I can do magic. I never sit around thinking about how I love being able to do magic, what it means to me. It's just a part of my life. But if I lost it -- if I couldn't do magic anymore---” He broke off. “I'm not like Malfoy. I don't make fancy speeches. But I know what I feel.”

  Hermione just stared at him. She couldn't say a word. Couldn't even think a word.

  “I want you to be happy,” he said slowly. “And if I don't make you happy, then you should be with the person who does.”

  He looked at her. Harry. Who she had always loved, not because he was brave, although he was, or clever, although he was that too, or a good dancer (which he wasn't) -- but because he was kind, with the sort of kindness so rare among most people, and teenage boys in particular -- kindness that not only gives, but gives up.
