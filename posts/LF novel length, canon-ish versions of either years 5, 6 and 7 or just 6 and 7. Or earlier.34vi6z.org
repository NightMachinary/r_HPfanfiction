I posted something similar about a month ago but... I'm finished all of those now! I need more! I'm hoping to find novel-length versions of later books, starting where the fourth or fifth book left off and continuing the story as the author saw it. Nothing wild or AU, but something that could've really been the later books. Usually stuff that was written before HbP or DH came out. Mature ratings are fine. Generally speaking I prefer G/H and R/Hr but if the story is realistic I'm not picky. Examples of stuff I've read already: HP and the Refiner's Fire series, HP and the Psychic Serpent trilogy, etc. Any new recommendations would be appreciated :)


** Ah, the classics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1673267/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Emotion][Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2140869/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Curse-of-the-Damned][Harry Potter and the Curse of the Damned]]. 6th and 7th years.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] by the same author deserves a mention, although it is seventh year only. The first fanfic I read. Ah, the memories.

Say, were all the classic canon continuations Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione? And yet they say the canon ships came out of nowhere.

**** The Seventh Horcrux is probably my #1 fanfic ever. Frankly, I think it's far superior to Deathly Hallows.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters][Notebooks and Letters]] It was written shortly after DH came out, it follows the plots pretty closely but with some realistic changes, that still keep the the heart of the story. It is H/Hr BUT Ron, Ginny, and family stay likeable. Not a Dumbledore bashing one either
