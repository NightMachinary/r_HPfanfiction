Next Year will be super interesting.

*** I could pretend I have something new to say so I will. He actually uses all the random obscure things he has rather than going "your a metamorphmagus and can change your physical body" followed by "my foot aches" and you are now "lord gryffindor slytherin ravenclaw le fay emrys dracula etc" then going "damn I'm broke". This combined with a good writing style and an intriguing if overused plot makes it fucking awesome despite the cliches. Besides I just want to see the comment counter go up.

*** I read it because of that. Once you step back and stop taking it so seriously it's the funniest shit ever. Seriously, the fuckin cabins of the train are divided up into light dark and grey and eeeeevil Potter traitor guy is giving a pep talk to the light first years about how important it is to convert the grey and it gets funnier every time I think about it because holy shit none of it makes sense for 11 year olds but it just compounds upon itself again and again.

*** It's a story about a protagonist who is wrongfully imprisoned, becomes a badass on multiple fronts despite their isolation, escapes, and creates a noble persona as a tool to gain power and take revenge on the people that wronged them.

It's /The Count of Monte Cristo/ for Harry Potter fanfiction.

*** I've always wondered if it's more commonly men or women that write harems. It feels like there's been a shift in the gender makeup of fanfic communities in especially the last 5 years.

*** Yeah I agree. I think a lot of people are enjoying the absurdity of it, sort of like a subtler (and better) /My Immortal/.

I know it's not really my thing, so I ignore it.
