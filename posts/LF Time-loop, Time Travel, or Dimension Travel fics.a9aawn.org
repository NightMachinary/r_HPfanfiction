Preferably novel-length or longer. Ideally, its protagonist is one of the major supporting characters (e.g. twins, Luna, Neville), but I won't turn up my nose to some Golden Trio stuff. Stuff like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]], or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] are examples of ones I like.

Please no f/f main pairings. It's not my cup of tea, but I'm open to f/f side pairings and the sort.

  As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.

** Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass is, IMO, the best time travel story around. The ending is slightly bittersweet but gives the story a lot of depth because the time traveller (Tonks) achieves her goal, but fails to save everyone because foreknowledge isn't everything.

It has a really outstanding friendship between Harry, Hermione and Tonks and is pretty good at depicting what a competent time traveller can achieve and which issues they run into.

**** I mean, the author is basically setting up a triad and it feels entirely natural. Even Hermione conceding defeat without a fight is entirely in character for her (like she chose Harry over love in canon). It even pulls off a seer Luna without being annoying. God, I really love that story (and wish that the sequel will eventually come along).

******* What's worse is that canon HP is fine with being brainwashed and controlled, as we see from the scene with Rufus Scrimgeour. His belief in Dumbledore borders on the fanatic in that scene. It's not until they start hitting roadblocks on the Horcrux hunt that he starts to realise that Dumbledore isn't exactly what he thought he was. But even then, he still follows exactly what the man lays out for him, even after his death.
