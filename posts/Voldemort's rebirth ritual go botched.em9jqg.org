  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** In linkffn(11913447), Lockhart (Harry from the future) sabotages the ingredients, replacing the bones with enlarged squirrel bones covered in enough dust from the bones of Tom Riddle that it qualifies as a valid ingredient.

In linkffn(9548162), Harry knocks out Pettigrew in the graveyard, and rather than just leave Voldemort's spirit wandering around for the next Death Eater to find and resurrect, performs the ritual in his own way and obliviates Voldemort after the resurrection

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  One-sho. Everybody likes to write epic stories about how they've made Harry Potter different, but invariably all of them, amusing they get that far, hit upon the same stumbling block that tests our willing suspension of disbelief when they get Harry in to the exact same position of being carted off to a creepy graveyard to resurrect Voldemort. Lets change things a little, shall we?

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
