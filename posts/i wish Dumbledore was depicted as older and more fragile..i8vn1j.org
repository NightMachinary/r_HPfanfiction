The significant age people can reach does not help the story. There are only two major relevant items where the considerable age wizards and witches can get to come into play. dumbledore and Grindelwald being old enough to have their fight set in WW2 and Madame Marchbanks still being alive. except one of those is somewhat arbitrarily created. Albus is 59 in 1940 based on his birth in 1881. Madame Marchbanks is positively ancient based entirely on needing to be around for dumbledore's youth. drop two decades off their ages, the fight between them happens when their around 45 and dumbledore dies at the ripe old age of 95. Madame Marchbanks would be nearing 120 or so but she is admittedly remarked upon as being extraordinarily old.

I feel like so many of the problems I have with dumbledore is this ever-present feeling that he is entirely more capable of action then he ever actually performs. being entirely capable and practically mobile and strong makes his inaction seem closer to negligence then calculation. it also pulls authenticity away from his attempts to place responsibility for defeating Voldemort onto Harry's shoulders.

the first through fourth books essentially require adherence to two major beliefs.

1. that Dumbledore is incapable and grossly negligent of Harry, Hogwarts, the safety of his students, as well as using the titles and accolades he supposedly carried to enact any kind of good governance.

or

1. that Dumbledore is more capable than we realize and must therefore be acting intelligently despite the irrationality of his actions. that his inaction is part of a larger plot (some would further imagine that everything must be part of this plot)

if Dumbledore was depicted as his age, I feel like his characterization would be more comfortable. Sir Richard Harris while only 72 gave off a much more believable and sincere age through makeup and prosthetics then the later actor Michael Gambon.

if there was this very real understanding that Dumbledore was much too old for the responsibility on his shoulders it would be much more forgivable. That a 90-year-old man nearing the end of his life with a thousand worries could not muster enough disgust with the world to contemplate the idea the Dursleys would be anything but kind. traveling to the ministry for a session of the Wizengamot would be task enough that quickly returning was something of an ordeal. his choices of teachers made by someone relatively unfamiliar with academics of the day as so many of his peers have already died. maybe his political positions could be something like the house of lords where one is appointed for life, and with his age political figures are simply waiting for his inevitable death so they need not hear his votes anymore. the idea of him sliding down that bathroom chute and fighting the basilisk more absurd.

the fight between him and Voldemort in the ministry being one that in the quiet of his office brought him to collapse in his chair would make fear of the outcome more apparent, and the sincere realization that just because Voldemort is supposedly afraid of him does not mean that safety will last much longer. it would also be all the more impressive for him to still go toe to toe with Voldemort even if only for a brief altercation. and finally, I feel like his having killed himself through the ring would come off as less a failure of the most inopportune sentimentality and more a dying man having wished for a glimpse of who awaited him.

in terms of characterization of plot very little would change but if more emphasis was placed on his age, I think his choices could be better stomached. it would also place greater weight towards Voldemort's own lust for immortality. a story which is made weaker by the idea that Tom could very realistically lived into his early hundreds but instead dies at 71 having spent decades of his life either in pursuit of immortality or a decade as a shade.

side note: might also clean up some of the weirder bits like how everyone seems to marry in their early twenties and have kids, or how the Flamels immortality rather than making them incredibly ancient scions of an earlier age means they maybe only 6 or so generations back.


** I like your interpretation and it does make more sense of the canon events if Dumbledore is overburdened with responsibilities: is he constantly fighting a rearguard action in Wizengamot against the blood purists, dealing with petty administrative tasks, begging Hogwarts alumni for donations, negotiating international treaties, ... ?

"The Accidental Animagus" linkao3(14078862) has him fighting a Dark Lord in Rwanda who is a magical counterpart to the real life genocide, like Grindelwald/WW2. Which explains his absence during key events.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Voldemort living into his early 100s? I believe wizards can live much longer. It's one of the explanations for stagnation in the wizarding world if the average person can live to their 150s. The headmaster previous to Dumbledore, Armando dippet, lived to the age 354. And McGonagall is older than Dumbledore by a few years I believe.

*** Dippet being 354 makes this even more stupid.

Doesn't the whole Methuselah ages make it even worse then? That Tom died practically a teenager? That Dumbledore is the prime of his life?

It also makes the world even more confusing since the world isn't wall to wall thousands of ancient creaking bodies since the clear majority of wizards and witches seem to die in normal lifespans. And marchbanks isn't even that noteworthy then. And flamel could very well have been a contemporary of Dumbledore's grandfather.

*** I think, the age of Armando Dippet should be silently forgotten and not considered for any more universe development. It is some kind of JKR's joke, which would break whole universe if taken too seriously (similarly to the existence of vampires and the Kreacher's age). In my head, wizards tend to live slightly over hundred years of age, and Dumbledore's 150+ is seriously long life according to the wizarding standards.

*** Bull.

That figure, Armando Dippet's age, comes from an image from a limited edition box set about the making of the movies and the props used in them.

So basically, somebody making a prop for the movie put in random dates. That prop with the dates included may not have even been in the movie.

That's not canon. The only things which are canon about Dippet is that he was headmaster during Tom Riddle's tenure at Hogwarts and left at some point between Lupin being bitten and Lupin turning eleven.
