Literally any time there is a marauder story, when they are adults, I see the phrase "brother in all but blood" used at a minimum twice. How often to you see it? Sometimes it's used for good measure, but sometimes I can just tell that the person has seen it in other stories and /really/ wanted to use it, and shoehorns it into the oddest of sentences.


** I dont really read Marauder stories. But I remember reading a fanfiction where harry and Dobby are friends and it mentions that at least twice... xD

** I came across it several times by now.

I like it as long as it doesn't go into blood-bond, heir-contracts or some other bullshit.

** I remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4449406/1/A-Brother-Divided][A Brother Divided by Indie-Mod]] back in 2011 and I think it was used to explain the relationship between Harry and Neville at least once. Maybe more than that.
