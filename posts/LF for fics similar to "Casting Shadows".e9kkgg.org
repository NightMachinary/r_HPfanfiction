i really enjoyed the premise of this story where harry continues to fight against the dark and i especially enjoyed the fact that andromeda and teddy play a bigger role in his life as well as the fact that his relationship with Ginny break off without bashing (that may actually be my favourite part of the story because its so rare) and that harry's power is shown without the cliche of he flex his aura and everybody bows down to him out of fear

no slash no genderbending harry no harmony and no hinny
