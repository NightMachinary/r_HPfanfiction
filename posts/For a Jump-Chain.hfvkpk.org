I write at the moment a Jump-Chain story. Or at least I try, my muse jumps from tangent to tangent üòÖ I try to minimise that with quick notes about it. On of the tangents was for Hermione as companion in a RWBY jump: what do you think would be her Semblance?


** Jumpchains for those wondering, are a series of Choose your own adventure type stories that have the main protagonist "jump" from one setting to another after a certain amount of time, kinda like a continuous Isekai . As for the question, it would probably be better to ask over at [[/r/JumpChain][r/JumpChain]] for subjects such as these, as you'll likely get more answers.

Personally speaking, I would expect something that favors range and usability over raw power. Given she has access to HP magic her semblance should supplement it rather than overtake it. A sensory semblance that gives her instinctual awareness of her surroundings would be my go to as it would be useful even outside of fights, and honestly it fits her character as well. A knowledge gathering semblance for a person who makes it a hobby to gather knowledge.

*** I plan too, I just thought I ask here first because HP. üòâ

I thought in similar lines but I'm not sure about the details... Her role would be the main-reseacher of the team but should I try to find a combat applicable one or a utility one for just outside combat. Maybe as a kinda spymaster? Things like that. I have difficulties to narrow it down. üòÖ So I thought I just ask the community. üòÅ

*** They're not choose your own adventure stories, they're similar to a /writing prompt/ called CYOA that has very little relation to choose your own adventure stories beyond the name.
