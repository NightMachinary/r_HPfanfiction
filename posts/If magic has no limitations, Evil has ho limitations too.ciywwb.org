Consider the following scenario:

Fidelius Charm erases memory of somethig protected by a secret from every person on the planet. In order to do it it manipulates their brains.

Voldemort being the Evil Genius modified Fidelius in the way it doesn't erase the memory, but causes strong seizures that lead to epilepsy and then to either disability or death.

Then he casted it on the Statue of Liberty.


** I don't think that Fidelius erases information, it just prevents people from finding it out. People who already know it will still know it but they can't tell anyone else.

**** They'd still know it exists, but they wouldn't be able to find out that it's used by the Order. Probably a double layer Fidelius: First layer hides it's existence, second layer that it's used by the Order.

***** DEs knew the truth about Sirius. Assumption that no one will check his home is ridiculous.

It was stated that the Grimmauld Place is the safest place for Harry after Dursleys and Hogwarts. If Bellatrix could visit it whenever she wished, it wouldn't be true.

**** I'm confused. Are you forgetting they were outside the property in DH or am I misunderstanding you? And how was the Black residence famous?

The Fidelius hides the property from view. It doesn't erase the knowledge of it. In DH, I think they discussed having to land on the step. Harry almost slipped and a Death Eater saw his foot or something like that.

Flitwick in POA:

#+begin_quote
  "The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"

***** If you know about a property and its location, even if you can't see it you can still use something like Fiendfyre to destroy it. Therefore Fidelius is a hardly good way of protecting a house.

Still it manipulates a person's brain and therefore can be changed in order to cause death.

****** The house becomes intangible. There was no space between 11 and 13 until Harry saw the parchment in OOTP. There are also a plethora of protective spells used in conjunction with the Fidelius. And it doesn't manipulate the brain at all. How did you come to that conclusion?

******* Fiendfyre is Dark Magic for a reason.

If you don't see something that exists right before your eyes and a person near you sees it, something prevents your brain to process the signals from your eyes. Nothing stops that "something" from killing you.

And it burned down the Room of Hidden things. Not the RoR or the rest of castle after the room disappeared.

Or maybe it's magic. Soul magic as described in POA.

** In terms similar to computers, the information is there, it's just not acessable, in my opinion. So in OOTP, Harry can physically see the No. 12 Grimmauld, he's simply prevented from using that information, and therefore his brain doesn't recognize the sight. It's similar to bad sectors on a hard drive; the information is there, and being let in on the secret allows your brain to 'recognize' the data.

**** I know what you're saying, and that is a very evil plan, but I'm just saying I don't think that's how the Fidelius works. However, I have my opinion and you have yours, and neither of us is more right than the other.
