"(Insert famous person here) was really a witch/wizard."

I know it isn't something that the people who do it take seriously, but it's always bugged me, in fiction in general but most noticeably with HP fanfics. (Example: in Percy Jackson the Beatles are stated to have been demigods.) Like, a character will reel off a list of artists or just anyone who's done anything important, and then say "oh, you thought a /muggle/ did that?" And then scoff and laugh it off.

And I know that it's just a joke, not to be taken seriously, but it's always really bugged me, like the author's suggesting ordinary people can't be brilliant. "You thought Queen were normal people? Mozart? William Shakespeare? Nah son, wizards."

Like, they're writing a story set in a world of magical people (that happens to lack good non-magical people completely, but that's not really related), so of course they aren't thinking about muggles, but even so...

It made me wonder, has anyone ever come across a fic where the muggle world isn't denigrated? As in, people discover or recognise the good parts of the muggle world? I'd be interested in reading something like that.

Anyway, just something I wanted to get off my chest that I've been thinking about recently. Anyone agree at all?


** Yeah that really bugs me too. I'd like it if it were subverted occasionally, like if Thomas Edison was an asshole wizard who went around stealing muggle inventors' patents like an industrial Lockhart.

** I feel similarly. It's not limited to fanfiction either; there are alien infiltration or magical world works out there that insist nearly anyone worthwhile was 'actually' --

it bugs me, because it steals human achievement from us. I don't mind a few, particularly if the historical figure seems altogether ill-fitting for their own time, like Nikolai Tesla, or whose background actually fits better with their reputation, like Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel.

There was a nifty side-story in one fic where the main characters needed to consult with Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. and ended up working with his estranged girlfriend Marion Ravenwood; both were gratifyingly muggle but smart enough to be trusted by some Veela to assist in some archaeological recovery.

**** It steals human achievement from us in the context of the fanfic we're reading. It's wizardwank, and every reader is a muggle. Obviously it makes no difference in the real world, and the particulars of who discovered what are irrelevant to me, because I haven't contributed to any worthwhile discovery myself, but it's insulting in the context of a fanfic whose message seems to be "muggles are backwards, soulless peasants who couldn't discover anything for themselves without the help of a wizard".

** I tend to only write people to be wizards or witches that were called that anyway. Jean d'Arc - Witch. Rasputin - Wizard.

Or I include people that became legendary to have been in contact with wizards or witches, or became magical. Charlemagne and Barbarossa - both now Lich.

I'm on the same boat when it comes to just straight up making everybody whos important a magical being. Its a way to make magicals better than they (already) are, by handing them over every achievement the muggles thought they made. I'm cool with a few achievements, especially if they truly seem out of this world. Or if wizards have supported some achievements by inspiration or guidance. I wrote a fic once where wizards and muggles held a rigorous discourse and interchange in the House of Wisdom in Bagdad. Or one wizard that charmed the pistol of Gavrilo Princip so it would absolutely shoot true and kill Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

In the world of Harry Potter, I feel like it would make little sense if there are no cases of wizards and witches influencing, but theres definitely a "Mary Sue" character to it as well that rubs me the wrong way.

** If anything, the inverse aught to be just as prevelant. Instead of famous people secretly being magical, the existence of the magical world could have erased these names from the history books via the butterfly effect.

Maybe John Lennon was never born, because Alfred Lennon was a muggle born who assimilated into the wizarding world, and Julia Stanley married some other guy, and even if they both had kids, and even if they both had sons, and even if those sons got buckets of musical talent from half the DNA that would have otherwise made John Lennon, it's unlikely that either man would just so happen to be in a position to meet the rest of the Beatles, so the line up we all know and love would be a little different.

Maybe Isaac Newton was a muggle born after all, but he devoted his prodigeuos talents to unraveling the mysteries of real magic, instead of science, and his works were only ever published in the wizarding world, and knowledge of such things were forbidden for muggles, so Hermione Granger might have written essays for her science classes in grade school about some other scientists who discovered the things Isaac Newton would have otherwise discovered, then learned about some guy by the name of Isaac Newton in History of Magic.

Maybe Winston Churchill was eaten by a werewolf as a child, and it was some other guy who gave the "We shall fight on the beaches" speech.

**** A similar aspect that I've thought about is what people who interacted with witches/wizards before magic became hidden especially because it wouldn't take away a 'human victory'.

William Shakespeare doesn't have to magical, but if he was so great that witches/wizards wanted to protect his works then it would explain why he's so famous when other skilled playwrights never made into history.

** I would love this. I would love this a lot. It's always bothered me whenever I read stuff like that in fics. It's like, if all the great muggles of history were wizards, then it starts to seem like Grindlewald was right all along. It makes it look like muggles are basically sheep that trundle along until some wizard feels like coming down to start a revolution or invent some new science, and the the entire philosophy of the 'light' side, that muggles and wizards are fundamentally equally (ignoring the whole magic thing), look a bit delusional.

I think some writers are so scared of being accused of 'muggle-wank' that they veer too hard in the opposite direction, or so excited by the new magical world they've created for their fic that they go to far in comparing it to the muggle world.

*** That's a sound analysis. I might almost suggest that (a certain amount) of the authors who use the trope in their fics want so badly to be a part of the universe that they're ashamed /not to be/, if you know what I mean. Like, some of the dismissal or disdain for muggles you read in these stories is so visceral that it can't be /completely/ out of nowhere. (But to clarify, I'm not trying to suggest that people who use the trope are self-loathing.)
