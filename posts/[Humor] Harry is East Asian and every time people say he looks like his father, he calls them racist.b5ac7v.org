Bonus points if he lectures them on how to spit differences in asian facial characteristics or some shit.


** "No, I do not have an accent. My name is Hauwi Putuur. It is derived from my ancestor whose name was Harry Potter but that isn't my name. Yes I will explain this every time. No, I will not stop explaining this. And no I don't, I look nothing like my father. Even Cho Chang gets called Harry Potter occasionally you racist bastards."

*** I went to uni with a couple of Korean guys who everyone said looked exactly a like (they also both had the same very common Korean surname). They would always tell people they were racist for saying they looked alike and claim they looked nothing alike...which was fine...except they were identical twins who just liked to mess with people. Maybe you should have Asian Weasleys as well because Fred and George would so do this.

** Asians as a whole don't look all alike (you can probably differentiate between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean genotypes to some degree), however, it seems to me that within those groups, there is much less diversity than within comparable white nations (say France, England, Germany). Largely only one hair color, one skin tone, one eye color, and more uniform facial features make it more difficult to distinguish between them. Also, there's the high degree of collectivism and historic low development which has usually meant uniform hair and dress styles, making it even more difficult...

Eh, not sure where I was going with this, take it as it is I guess, lol

*** Asia is a very large continent. While I agree that some people do get Chinese, Koreans and Japanese confused, there's still people from numerous other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Russia (yes, part of it is in Asia) who look different.

**** Yep, that's exactly my point. Also, "Asian" refers to areas outside even the continent, but rather in the "Asia" region - Phillipines, Japan, etc.
