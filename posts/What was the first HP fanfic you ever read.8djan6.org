Mine was the Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori, a post Hogwarts trilogy that was abandoned partway through the third book.


** "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" was unfortunately the first HP fanfic I've read. It was so bad that I gave up half way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), a canon compliant Year 6 fic from Ginny's POV, is the first HP fanfic I finished reading.

*** Ginny Weasley and the HBP is the first ever fanfic I've read. I was reluctant to read fanfics at first because I thought I won't be able to swallow non-canon material. But since this fic is supposed to be canon-compliant from a different perspective I tried it out. I went from there to Post-Hogwarts stuff and so on.

I feel like for this reason this fic is an excellent entry into HPfanfic. It's not the best. It reads like a YA novel targetted towards teenage girls. But it's good enough that you'd be compelled to search for something better.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
