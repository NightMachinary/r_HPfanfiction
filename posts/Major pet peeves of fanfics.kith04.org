Im a new author and im still planning/ writing a chapter or two every now and then but i dont want to finish it then realise people hate is for a silly preventable thing. (For context its a marauders fic that wont have have any of the golden trio aged characters in it) what are things that make people stop reading immediately/ just sets a sour note to the fic in general Thanks!:)


** Slytherin persecution complex

When authors seem to forget how old a character is. Yes, even the most self-sufficient first year should never be left alone over night, much less live alone. No, sixth years are not children who can be easily picked up and need constant supervision. Yes, a fourth year does need an adult guardian

** When people dont format well. On fics you cant have massive blocks of text they need to be broken up into chunks

** The big ones for me are poor spelling/grammar (I'm fine with the odd typo but when things are unreadable or there are obvious, consistent mistakes then I have to stop reading) and poor characterisation.

The poor characterisation thing is kind of tricky, because I have pretty firm headcanons for some minor characters and tend to be quite fussy about what I read anyway!

I also mostly prefer reading gen over romance fics, and avoid golden trio/Hogwarts-era fics, but I think I'm in the minority there.

Oh! Also canon rewrites where nothing really changes, or fics that quote whole sections of canon. And /nicknames/.

And punctuation.

Those are my biggest turn offs from any fanfic.

** Just a personal pet peeve are fics that aren't in third person. I struggle with first person and cannot do second person no matter how compelling the story is.

There is just something about third person fanfics that hit the spot (lucky most of them are in that POV)

** Sloppy writing - left out letters or punctuation, missing or double words, lack of capital letters.

Anything that makes it look like it was written by a 2nd grader who didn't bother to reread what they wrote.

** For me, overusing epithets like "the black-haired man" or "the younger werewolf" instead of just their names, pronouns, or context, especially when it's a character already known to the POV character. Some are ridiculous and over the top, like "the messy-haired, hazel-eyed stag animagus."

** 1. Capitalisation and grammar. If the text is not worthy of your re-reading it, why it should be worth for me to read it at all?

2. Too long story. Every story should be only [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][as long as the plot can carry it]], and almost all fanfiction stories are [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/micro-review-of-grow-young-with-me-by-taliesin19.html][a way too long]]. NEVER repeat in full what's in the books, we all have read them, and if we don't we should go to the original text. Easiest is just to skip all those years in the canon which are not bringing anything for your story (or summarize it in few paragraphs). It is perfectly OK to have a prologue, which establishes differences between your Harry (for example) and the canonical one, and then continue in his fifth year, where your real story truly begins.

3. Don't sweat the rest, be honest with yourself. Many things which I don't like, are something others particularly look for.

*** Snape gets whitewashed in the most surprising places. Harry's off on an island because fuck everyone who's betrayed him.

But guess who's chilling on the island with him and his new friends/family?

** When a character in universe is somehow aware of events or people they shouldn't be. I swear every fic with Dumbledore bashing somehow has a character comment on "The Greater Good" while having no reason for knowing Dumbledore's backstory.

*** It wouldn't bother me so much if they Just Stuck to things he actually did in Canon... and was manipulating with good intentions...

Most of the time it just comes off as less of a Chessmaster and more of a Mustache-twirling cartoon villain

** In terms of content (plot, world-building, characterisation), you may as well just do what you want to do. Anything listed as a pet peeve here, even if it's very upvoted, is a favourite of some other section of readers. And vice versa. But pay attention to stuff like spelling, grammar, word choice, formatting, etc

** Americanisms!

I can't stress enough how badly they contribute to anybody seeming out of character. If you are not British, find somebody who is who can Brit-pick it for you.

I'm happy to offer my services as a Brit-picker. :)

** All of the above but also time references/ slang. I know the marauders is peak David Bowie Era but like directly referencing it in the fic is awkward. Same with slang. It dates your fic, just stick with as little slang as possible unless it had a reason to be there.

** Agree with the formatting. First person narration-prefer my HP fanfic in third person-however, if it's easier for you to write that way go for it. Too much exposition/narration or too much dialogue...should be a nice blend of both.

** Formating is important. Make sure it's not a wall of text. Also, I won't read a fic if chapters are shorter than 2k words.

I won't read a fic in the first or second person, and I won't even click on a fic with an OC as MC or some weird-named OC paired with one of the Marauders.
