The title is a little weird but the point still stands, why hasn't there been more stories like this? The British Occupation, where England basically took over Eygpt in 1882 - 1922. During that time British people literally stole All the Eygpt artifacts they could get their hands on. And put them all in fancy museums to show off to the world back in England.

The basic premise could be very simple, young Harry is forced on a school field trip to a British Museum where they have an extensive Eygpt section. There Harry, either through his own magic or Parseltounge, active a hidden lock that gives a tool or book that teaches Eygptian based magic.

I know of one story that is kinda like this, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2353966/1/Ascension-Of-The-Scorpion-Sorcerer][Ascension of The Scorpion Sorcerer]]. A long read with a 300k word count, but it's incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2007. The training montage alone is mind-boggling.

If there are any other fanfics with this plot please let me know, I'm on a 'Harry learns foreign Magic' craze right now and I'm running low.


** No reason to limit ourselves to Egypt. Britain really, really got around in our Empire days and I don't think there are many countries we haven't looted with impunity. But yeah, I ask the same question - there are so few cursebreaker or world-wide stories in general and it's such a sad deficit.

My only explanation is that most stories are Hogwarts romances or alt-storylines for the books, so bringing in other countries and ancient history isn't high on most people's list to write. No idea how valid that explanation is, mind, but it's all I've got.

**** I've seen some different perspectives on this, but I'm not enough of an expert to say any particular one has more weighting than the others.

Some say that the size of depictions in ancient artwork was indicative of social status, which is why Kings and Pharaohs and Gods were so tall while everyone else was smaller - so perhaps the artist regarded man and centaur as social equals under the Gods?

I've also heard that it's just a relic of the artistic style and format used - it's a lot easier to plan out a wall of artwork (painted or carved) if everything is sized similarly and there is a certain visual appeal in that kind of structure.

Some people say that depictions vary - some centaurs are tall and some centaurs are short - due to the differing myths and beliefs about their origin and whether there are multiple types of centaurs or not.

For all I know though, it's something completely different. As I said, I'm no expert. :)

** A pre-Hogwarts Harry unintentionally completes a ritual: as such, the ancient Egyptian pantheon regularly appear to him and (seemingly) only him to just... hang out. After all, it's been millennia since they walked the Earth, they're no longer "bound" to their roles expected of them by mortals, and this little mortal caught their interest (Apep/Apophis, the lazy git, likes to just sleep in Petunia's prized flower beds).

Thing is, despite their archaic values on things (thief? Chop his hand off, et cetera) and the way they look (like animal heads), they're actually pretty chill and get along well with him -- compared to how they were portrayed in mythology, they grew as "people" (not many fics do this: they have the gods/goddesses as static/bound by their natures/as they were during ancient times and, if that's a flaw of being a deity in-universe that's great, but seeing, say, Artemis looking for a decent husband or Aphrodite becoming more conservative, or one of the ancient warrior gods of another religion becoming more despondent and lazy? Character growth/change).

The Dursleys become more uneasy when they feel something (or rather, /someones/) unseen watching them.

When he arrived in the Great Hall for his Sorting, Dumbledore almost chokes on his own spit when he sees Harry listening to an animatedly speaking Anubis, or when the other Egyptian gods/goddesses start wandering Hogwarts out of curiosity.

** Given how Victorian 1990s Magical Britain was, and also that the actual Victorian age was very much in the "Britain (or maybe just England) is superior" mode, my guess would be that Hogwarts teaches primarily traditional British magic. Leaving all those silly Egyptian things to curse-breakers and foreigners and the like.

I've seen fics where it gets pointed out that if Dumbledore had spoken to a professional curse-breaker (like Bill Weasley), the Horcrux issue would have been a non-starter, specifically because the ancient Egyptian use of them was well-known. But I'd love to read one where Harry triggers something like that on his own.

**** But they took what was most useful or interesting to them and generally relegated the rest to a lesser status. I don't know enough about Egyptian, Asian, Indian, or African magical traditions to even make a guess at what might be considered useful or ornamental. I truly doubt much Australian or American lore made its way back to Britain, although Europeans who went to those places learned some and combined it with what they already knew.

Of course British magic is an amalgam, but it's one primarily from western Europe: Celtic, Norse, Germanic, Roman, a dash of Greek, and probably some French after 1066. Which to be fair probably describes much of the magic of western Europe overall. Any Egyptian or Middle Eastern lore that made its way in before the artifact grabs was filtered through Greek writers, as in real life.

** While I really like the idea, I have a feeling it could very quickly backslide into having more in common with the ethnic magician trope (and related less kindly named tropes) than desirable.

Unless there is a dedicated fanfic writer out there who actually knows their shit about Egyptian, Indonesian, or-wherever-else-the-United-Kingdom-was-overstaying-their-welcome's culture, and is willing to write about said culture with love and respect you land in the territory of fetishizing said culture from what is probably a white perspective. Sadly, that tends to be problematic these days.

That said, I have always been a sucker for fics where Harry is plucked out of his natural UK & Hogwarts habitat, and does something completely different.

Imagine how diverse the Harry Potter fandom would be if every fanfic writer tried to write a story about Harry Potter ending up in their home country and consuming local culture and meeting creatures from local folklore?
