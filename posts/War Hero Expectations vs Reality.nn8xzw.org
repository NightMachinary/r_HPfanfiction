Are there any fics about post-war Britain where it comes up that the Golden Trio are not that skilled or practiced at defense? During the war they mostly camped out. Hunting/destroying the horcruxes was all-important, but stabbing something with a sword or a fang does not translate to dueling. They were caught by snatchers, who don't seem to be the brightest wizards of their age, and Harry only defeats Voldemort because of the elder wand's allegiance and his trusty deus expelliarmus machina.

If there was a larger resistance, both inside and outside of Hogwarts, one would assume that their defense skills would have greatly improved due to the battles and skirmishes being fought, while the Golden trio's skills would have atrophied. I can imagine Ron, Harry, and Neville entering auror training together and everyone being shocked when Neville beats them in practice duels or something similar.

Anyone know of anything like this? Or have any arguments about why this wouldn't be true?

Note: I am aware that all 3 are very skilled at defense, and that this is Harry's best subject. But standardized test scores (OWLs) are not the same as application and experience.

To be fair, the Snatchers had them cornered in the tent--there wasn't a way out, since Disapparating would leave almost anything behind.

That said, I am interested to see what might come of this.

** I'm writing one. IMHO Harry et al are quite good and experienced in duelling (which they are) but need to learn other stuff like teamwork.

** I agree. I would like to see a post DH Harry and trio's journey to truly becoming powerful wizards like Dumbledore.
