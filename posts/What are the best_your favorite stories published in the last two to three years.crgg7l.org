  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

** !linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles)

This one is a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic with a fem!Harry who is well-developed as her own character, a Voldemort who has his own complexities without being apologistic over his atrocities.

!linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane)

This one is written by a friend of mine, and gave me a huge love of female Voldemort stories. Stories such as...

!linkffn(Power is Control)

A very interesting and messed up Harry/fem!Voldemort fic. (Can you tell that I have a favourite pairing?)

!linkffn(Serpentine by by darkfire1220)

Okay, a non-Voldemort centric one. Harry winds up hatching a basilisk at the advice of the snakes that sometimes visit him in his cupboard, and views said basilisk as his closest friend as he goes to school. Has a Tonks in Fred and George's year.

!linkffn(The Other Champion)

Cassius Warrington is selected as the Hogwarts champion, not Cedric Diggory. The two develop and odd friendship, and Harry gradually develops a romantic interest in Daphne Greengrass after a few chance encounters. This is probably one of the best Haphne fics out there, as it avoids a lot of the tropes that most of the fics with said pairing tend to use.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

*** That fic loses points from me due to the rampant lack of punctuation and the accusations of plagiarism.

Another author, NocturneMemory, wrote a similar themed fic of Fem!Harry shipped with Voldemort who discovers they have shared souls, pointed out that the author of Runic Warding had copied elements of characterization and imagery, and straight up plagiarized a couple of lines from their fic, with zero credit.

The similarities are eerie.

From NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  He wonders how she can place such importance on other people when she has his fucking soul in her chest. How much more of a home can one carve out in another person? How much more of himself---

  How infuriating it is to know the succession of her thoughts, the succession of affection she holds for other people when he---

  How much more of a home could that be?
#+end_quote

.

From Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  /Now you need to accept us, all we are and are not, and accept that once you made a home in me. Open up your eyes and ears and your nose Harry, your heart and your mind and everything you are, so that I may in turn make a home in you as well./ He told her all this with solemn inevitability, holding the waiting dark in his red right hand.

***** I recall that NocturneMemory posted in the comments section of Runic Warding back in Feb/March 2018, laying out the "too close to coincidental" similarities between the their fics, and asking the author to remove specific lines and give credit. After checking through 80 pages of comments it appears that they've been deleted, and Wayback Machine only has a logged copy in March 2019.

Here's some copied themes between the two works.

*Theme: Harry feels safest in the dark.*

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  In the cupboard, in the welcoming dark, in the snick of a lock, Harrie presses a wet face into a musty pillow... Harrie learns early that darkness is often safest. That there's nothing to fear as long as that lock stays firmly in place.
#+end_quote

.

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  "I've always felt safest in the dark Headmaster, for as long as I can remember. Because when it was dark I was safe from the Dursleys."

  It was a sad but true fact that the only times in her childhood Harry could actually remember feeling truly safe was when she had been locked in that fucking cupboard.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Voldemort uses the soul link to "phantom touch" Harry when she's sleeping.*

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  He scrapes a farewell pass of his teeth over the ticking of Harrie's pulse, wishes it were more than phantom canines against the rising tremor of it.

  Harrie wakes, a phantom brush of a movement, sliding over her hip.
#+end_quote

.

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  After the third time waking up sweaty and frustrated from the feel of phantom hands and teeth somehow the distinction didn't make her feel any better.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Innocent young fem!Harry compared to the empty monster Voldemort.* Voldemort is repeatedly described with metaphors and imagery using the terms /darkness, voids, vacuum,/ and /emptiness./

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  And of course, his little girl, that tiny little spot of uneven light and uneven hair; the first time he ever felt anything shift inside his chest, inside any chest at all; whether half full, half empty... Twelve years old and ruining pieces of a man who had been alive for decades, dove into darkness with no thought to his soul or humanity. A boy and a man and eventually a monster; soulless, empty.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  The person who despite everything that had happened still couldn't really think of herself as anything other than Harry, who might once have sort of been a baby girl called Harriet Potter and an empty boy called Tom Riddle and a fully grown monster called Lord Voldemort.

******* Thanks for the archive combing, Nocturne's takedown on the use of metaphor was super satisfying to read. No wonder Runic Warding is such a clunky mishmash of different motifs, lol.

I had searched by keyterms from the original comment, which laid out the comparisons of the two works. Basically what [[/u/saintlysweet90][u/saintlysweet90]] wrote in their post further up. I only found the deleted post, so I assumed that the Runic author had taken them it all down, since Ao3 allows fic authors to moderate user comments to their discretion - unlike FFN which only allows deleting of guest comments.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

It's probably for a less-than-great reason, but I really like the idea of a pretty male Harry with an appearance that draws more on his mother than it does his father, and the fic does a /lot/ to explain and work with the setting towards that. The interactions with the Dursleys - and how Harry maneuvers around them - is a big example of that.

There's a few things about the fic that bother me something fierce - the bigotry of the main character and the explanations that can sometimes feel a lot like justifications - and others that make me really interested in it - such as how gay the main character is, which is probably shallow but look I'm a simple person, as well as the world building, something that's surprisingly good. In addition to that is one of the rare few fics that I feel gets the emotions surrounding abuse, as well as the emotions one might feel when trying to escape an abusive household, only to then be put back into one immediately after. It loses a lot of points for some things, though, and that largely comes to my own discomfort with in-universe explanations for why hating a species of people is justified, even if it's made clear that it's like, an actual *thing*, as well as how a lot of things are framed to make the use of slurs - not IRL ones, but nevertheless - acceptable. There's a lot of things I'm not at all interested in with this fic, but there's also just as much - if not more - that makes me really, *really* enjoy it and all-in-all the fact that I wrote this much for this fic alone should probably say something about why I'm recommending it.

  A death curse wouldn't stop this thing. But I have to try. I just have to... keep it together. Pull my magic up under my skin, and ready to release it as soon as the final blow came...Of course, that plan gets shot to hell when it asks, in a hoarse voice with an English lilt to it, “Why are you naked?”

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes; Annals of Arithmancy) got the trilogy completed relatively recently.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is also not too old and a favorite of mine.

Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider; Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis) also got completed recently.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
