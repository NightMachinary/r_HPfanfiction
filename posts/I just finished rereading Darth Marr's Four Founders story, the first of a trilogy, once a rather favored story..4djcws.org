The second in the trilogy, a Star Trek crossover, has always been one of my favorite stories but I remembered never really loving the first, just liking enough to read the sequels. The third, a Star Wars crossover, was rather good until it got to the end.

But the first story, uggh, it has not held up. It has every cliche I've come to hate. Magical Cores, Warding as its own field, Harry using AK with compassion: Rather shocked I finished rereading it.

His two other HP/Star Wars crossovers (Katarn and the Revenge of the Wizard) are quite enjoyed stories still.

Anyone else found an old favorite just hasn't held up when rereading?


** I've mentioned it before, but I don't think /The Lie I've Lived/ by jbern has held up very well.

It's a neat premise, and there are several things I like a lot about it, but when I reread it I end up getting bored sometime around the Yule Ball.

Maybe it's because GoF AU has been done to death, and everyone needs to write their own take on the three tasks instead of just changing it completely, but I think the story gets sort of boring after the first half.

**** The one where [[/spoiler][Remus slept with Lily while James was away? Then Remus dies randomly at the very end because the author obviously didn't feel like dealing with the situation he created?]]

Yeah as a huge Remus fan I wasn't too keen on it either. Really the entire ending is just one wet fart in my opinion.

***** Yeah. I think my main issue with that story is that I got the interpretation that Harry was dead and James was in control, not Harry seeing his father's memories.

****** We as readers are told that he became a combination of Harry and James. I'm not sure how far exactly you got (or where exactly it's even mentioned) but there are some conversations with Sirius where he asks things like, "So should I just call you James?" and 'Harry' doesn't really have an answer.

It's a super neat premise, and the first dozen or so chapters are really engrossing, but I think it failed to leave the atmosphere so to speak.

******* I finished it. But it left me with such sour taste I didn't reread it. if I enjoy a story, I reread it. That way I actually really absorb it. One read isn't enough for me to retain the most salient points.

******** Honestly, I disliked it at first too, but I think its unique enough to give a shot. Sure gof au is done a lot. But this fic is very unique. It deals with things I've never even heard of outside of the story. For example, a lot of the early part is hj (harry/james) dealing with his identity now that he has all of the memories of James, which I haven't ever seen. And then, it doesn't follow stations of the canon tasks. So its fairly unique amongst gof au. I get the bad memory thing. But Its worth a read.

***** I've never understood why Remus is popular. Yes it's implied that he has moral fiber for dealing with his lycanthropy but other than that he is basically a blah, filler character.

****** PoA makes a big impression. Remus is also the first helpful adult that Harry meets who isn't a parent of one of his friends, kind but a bit hapless (Hagrid) or distant to him (Dumbledore, McGonagall).

***** There was pretty clearly closure on the Remus front no? HJ accepts that he isn't really James and so forgives Remus. Or at least says it was in the past. It;s just ya know Remus dies. God forbid though that the author made a character complex and different than most of the fandom where the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad.

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'Tarkan is like this for me. Its one of the classics of the fandom, and I loved it the first (few) times I read it, but in the numerous years between its updates a lot of its tropes have been done better or in a more interesting fashion.
