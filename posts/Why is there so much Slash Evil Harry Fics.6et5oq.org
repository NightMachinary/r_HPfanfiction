Slash Evil Harry fics seems to be popular for reasons undisclosed. Like all I want is a pour milk before the cereal AU Evil Harry fic with no Voldemort but I get Harry//Voldemort/ pairings and if that isn't ridiculous Tom Riddle took ballet classes

And somewhere out there, that is probably a fanfic. This is almost as bad as rule 34

Almost


** I'd say at least part of the problem is the Death Eaters are a total sausage party. (And most authors that go with evil harry's make him believe what voldy's spewing. )

Your choices seems to be Bella whose insane and usually kills Sirus, and the death nibblers; Pansy whose a bitch and nearly every author has made out to be ugly/ pug faced, and Greengrass who we know pretty much nothing about in canon.

So yeah, the choice is almost always a guy, and this is Harry fucking Potter, dating a lackey seems a step down. It helps that they can rely on the prophesy- yep, equals in love, you defeated the dark lord by loving the evil out of him or whatever.

Also, there's a Harry Potter fanfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimensional hopping for beginners]], in the middle of the second chapter the dimensional troubleshooting Harry arrives at Hogwarts School Of Ballet with Tommy Riddle playing the lead villain in their play. But don't worry, our Harry saves the day.

*** I'd actually prefer no romance at all when reading a Evil Harry fic tbh. Unless manipulation is involved with a "I don't really love you you're just a useful tool" now I want to read a fic where Harry just emotionally and psychologically wrecks people damn

I'm just going to ignore that exist

**** It's only a half chapter of the entire fic, but since you say you're not going to read it, I'll spoil it a bit, it ends with Harry killing them all out of horror with a nuke, so rest easy.

****** Dimension hopping is amazing and a really fun time - it's a comedy fiction overall. Not a dark Harry but a fairly jaded and ruthless one who's basically a funny asshole

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, acclaimed dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** The worst part is the age difference... Riddle's like 50 or more years older, so at Harry's 15 he would be around 65~70... I find it even more disgusting that those Hermione/Remus or /Snape. Although the real stuff of nightmares is seeing Hermione/Dumbledore is some random bashing crap.

** I don't read slash but if you look at the pairings alone most of them are Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Lucius. If your partner is a bigoted terrorist I can see only so many directions where the plot can go. That's probably the main reason I don't read slash. While I'm not into guys I can appreciate a good plot. That requires a believable pairing, something that Harry/Death Eater is not. Because the Death Eaters and Voldemort are responsible for his misery in the first place. No matter how you turn it, Dumbledore's side didn't kill the Potters.

Then again, who else would you pair Harry with? There are few appealing male characters. Based on canon the following females can be shipped with Harry to make a somewhat believable pairing without too many mental acrobatics: Hermione, Luna, Alicia, Angelina, Katie, Fleur and Tonks. On the male side we have Neville.

The other reason is the fact that the "light side" failed Harry on more occasions that I can count. Dumbledore admits that he is ok with Harry being tortured by his relatives (ten dark years), the Hogwarts teachers let him get bullied, isolated and tortured again, the Weasleys knew about the abuse and did not help him, the Order was useless and his guard deserted him and there are many things Harry is not told. Therefore it's not difficult to come up with a plot where Harry is fed up with their shit and gets things done his own way. The problem however is that in a lot of stories his solutions are equally stupid.

** I think it's a result of the number of Harry/Voldemort fics. If you want to pair Harry up with the murderer of his parents, then having Harry be evil is pretty much required.

*** /But it was Dumbledore who set the Potters up. Tom Riddle was one of his victims as well. Dumbledore needed another opponent to become even more famous./

You don't know how often I've read this silly argument.

** Pairing Harry with the murderer of his parents sort of requires him to be OOC, no matter how out of his mind Voldemort was at the time. The slash pairing also helps forward the plot. While I love Harry/Bellatrix stories, their relationship usually isn't as easy to further a plot as a Harry/Voldemort relationship.
