I'm looking to sample some of the less well known things.

I'm not 100% what my own would be, but there's a decent chance it's linkffn(Testimony of the Avarice). joe's stuff never fails to pull me in.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]] - Fred and George end up in the Marauders' era. I really loved it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118000/1/Wither]] - Short and dark, but quite good.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really]] is a great crack fic featuring Grindelwald's 'redemption'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]] is a refreshing fic that involves Umbridge as the lead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] is IMHO by far the best Year 7 Hogwarts fic. It deserves far more Favorites.

** Running down my AO3 favorites list and checking the kudos counts for less than 1k:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13788267/chapters/31695750][Bad Oracle]] - very enjoyable fic where Delphini goes back in time to kill her dad...it takes a couple tries.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]] - Harry becomes a necromancer and a Dark Lord after coming back damaged from the whole dying thing in DH.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15589665/chapters/36194733][Into the Arena: The Cursed Child]] - like LullabyKnell's other fic, "into the arena with your head held high", except Delphini exists and got adopted by Harry so she comes back in time with Teddy and Harry - quite different from the original story, sadly much shorter.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15558741/chapters/36119607][Choices]] - Defector/Death Eater Harry who is NOT gay for Voldemort, or Draco.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/589726/chapters/1060711][The Prince and the Professor]] - A new professor in the Marauders era helps Severus Snape through a very bad year. Snape's POV. No slash. Sadly incomplete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12203742][Scenes from a War: The Marriage of Alice and Frank]] aaaand [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10302530][Scenes from a War: It Looks Like You Might Be One of Us]] - I'm actually rather upset these have so few kudoses. Dark!Lily, but still with the Order; in the first she gets possessed by the Dark Powers to save Frank Longbottom from a nasty curse, in the second she gets caught when Aurors raid the back-alley book fair she's visiting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12629358/chapters/28776324][The Ancient and Most Noble House of Weasley]] - snapshots from an alternate history where the Weasley family became traditionally Slytherin.

  Darkness is about to rise, but they aren't ready to fight. A plan was set into place; to stop it from ever rising in the first place. Harry & Teddy must time travel to 1993. They must find the boy who would grow up to become the new Dark Lord, without getting tangled in the whole Sirius Black issue. Would they be able to keep their identities secret from everyone?

** A few I enjoy

Final Protocol by Lord silvere,has a very unique story has a Susan bones/harry potter relationship, not near finished (probably be a long time until it is) but definetly worth a read if that doesn't bother you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12775205/1/]]

The Long Road Home by Penelope Muir, it's almost 600k words in, basically Neville is the boy who lived, but James is the alternate version of Neville's parents Lilly isn't and is trying to cure him but is slow burning snilly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/]]

I will second the Alexandra quick series, very au because it's an entire new story set at livermony but it is written fantastically

Now the last recommend is hard to find, it got way more than 1k favorites when it was up, but the author actually adapted it to an actual book that they sell (I'd recommend that one as well, it's just not hp fanfic) so they removed it from fanfic... It's a Hermione and Draco pairing in an world where basically LV wins the battle of Hogwarts... Can get pretty dark, sexual content as well (with adults), violence, talk about rape..... But it's a great story and definetly worth a read if you haven't read it yet and it's "Cruel and beautiful world" by lena phoria ... Ived found it from a Russian site but, you can search Google and find an PDF of it if the site is too hard to navigate(included this one because it's a very reclusive fic, if you didn't read it years ago, lot of newer fanfic readers don't even know it exist which is a shame) [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=83685&chapter=0]]
