#+TITLE: I read a post a few days ago that said Rowling didn’t want Harry to be a magical tony stark. Are there any fics like this? Not a crossover and preferably not super tech based just Harry being the Tony Stark of magic.

** Heh, I was just thinking about making a post requesting this.

The closest I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight) - Though honestly it's not that great of a fit. Harry is some kind of super runes prodigy, able to come up with what are essentially talismans that can produce spells. Also it's a harem fic. Probably one of the better ones, for whatever that's worth.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] has Harry starting a magical space program and leading the charge on his generation inventing/discovering a bunch of magical theory.

** Wouldn't that be just any fic where he winds up being Lord Black-Slytherin-Potter-Peverell-Griffindor-Ravenclaw and ends up with an obscene amount of money and is also an indy!harry story?

*** One of the central defining aspects of Tony Stark is that he is a super genius inventor, so I think they're looking for a Harry that is a genius magical inventor. No need for the ridiculous names. Tony Stark is just a Stark, and other than his father it's not a notable lineage. Yes, he would probably end up with obscene amounts of money from selling his products.

**** Plus, Tony Stark is also an actually interesting and likeable character (at least when he's written well). That's not something I can say about the vast majority of the Lord Black-Slytherin-Potter-Peverell-Griffindor-Ravenclaw Harrys out there. :)
