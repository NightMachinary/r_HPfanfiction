He spends all of his free time in the library, reading anything he can get his hands on. Nothing else interests him besides reading, books, and talking about reading and/or books. After graduation, he opens a bookstore with Hermione Granger, his platonic life partner, with Madam Pince as a silent partner.


** Not a gryffindor then? Probably a Ravenclaw. I love to read, but to the exclusion of everything else sounds a bit boring.

*** But there's so much interesting things that could be related to books, like printing, editing, proofing, getting published, how books are organized, how paper is made, etc.

I mean, he even enjoys discussing what he's reading, which means it could be a very educational story that uses Harry Potter as a framework to explain the world of Harry Potter in ways that the original author never thought to.

**** harry makes a newspaper thats trustworthy, the daily prophet rises up to the challenge, they compete to get the latest story, Rita Skeeter is fuming, her career and public trust are stained by false accusations, lies and hyperbole. The wizarding world is suddenly more up to date with world news, developing magics and other things. How does the Wizarding World react to the advances in muggle tech? Fear over the destructive capability? Curiosity at their inventions that magic can do the same?

i want something like this
