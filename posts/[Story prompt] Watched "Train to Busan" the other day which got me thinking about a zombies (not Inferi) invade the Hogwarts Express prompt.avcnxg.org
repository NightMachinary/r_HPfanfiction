** "Remember to keep the windows closed," Hermione shouted as the Express ploughed through another group of Zombies, the unbreakable charms on the engine, coaches and rails kept the train running and its passengers safe. There were undead crawling all over the train, severed limbs and blood splashed against the glass and their howls were sure to haunt them forever.

"Did you see what happened to the Lunch Lady?" Neville asked for the tenth time.

"We all saw that," Harry pointed out while holding Ginny's hair back. The crazy witch had tried to get on top of the train but was literally torn apart before she had cleared the door. It took the combined efforts of the DA to clear out the undead and shut it again. "What I am more worried about is why we are suddenly overrun by Zombies. I mean, you'd think that a Zombie apocalypse would have made the news by now."
