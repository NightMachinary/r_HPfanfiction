Wondering if there was some good fics where Harry or someone is an agent for the SIS, CIA, or other intelligence agencies. The villain doesn't have to be Voldemort.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8465414/1/Agent-Potter][Agent Potter]], linkffn(8465414), is pretty good.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has no magic, and Hogwarts was a spy school to begin with.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.

** If you don't mind slash, there's a James Bond (Skyfall) crossover, linkao3(it might be magic by professorfrankly). Harry is Q. More precisely, Harry has become Q after the events of the books.

If you don't read slash, you might still enjoy the sequel, linkao3(alec's training daze by professorfrankly), wherein Alec Trevelyan begins learning to use his previously unknown magic under the direction of George and Ron Weasley. It's really just an interlude, but amusing.
