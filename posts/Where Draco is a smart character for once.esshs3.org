I'm a huge Draco fan and I've read billions of fics of him and I see them portray him like he's smart but the things he does is still so damn stupid. Others portray him as a saint, which he's not, and that makes him unlikeable even though the author tries to make him seem nice when he's not. I want a fic where he's still a git, but a smart git. Like a enhanced version of the cannon him with maybe less daddy issues (though that's also welcome)

Any ship/bashing/length of fic Idc No pwp or mega angst fest but if it's rlly recced I guess it's ok.


** I think you might like Sarcasm and Slytherin... Draco is certainly smart here, he is just a bit naive and need time to mature.

** Of the top of my head, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. It's the best presentation of Draco I've seen.

*** Is that the one who tells a person he barely knows but is trying to befriend that he is thinking of raping someone and knows how to get away with it---and get away with it in a way that would leave everyone knowing that he did actually do it? Genius! :P

***** I know the Doylist reason the author put it there. However, from the Watsonian perspective, it makes him come off as far less socially competent than he is supposed to be.

****** He's socially incompetent when dealing with muggle-raised people, which is to be expected considering he never met one before. He's perfectly competent when dealing with people from his own culture.

******* I am not sure about that, either. Unless I am severely misjudging HPMOR's society, a typical wizard-raised person would be just as disgusted by Draco's boast, even if they might already be aware that Draco could get away with it.

**** Yeah, it's got a few of those moments.

But as a person who once went through childhood, it can also be read as a little shit trying to be "edgy"

#+begin_quote
  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
