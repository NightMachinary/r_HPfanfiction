** (In your best Asmongold voice) What up, y'all. It's ya boi. It's Harry Potter. I don't even know where to start on this one. For the record, I did NOT, repeat, DID NOT, put my name in the goblet. The staff here.... it's like they don't even care any more. They aren't listening to the students. They knew something like this could happen and someone ran an exploit on the Goblet anyway. The staff at Hogwarts cares so much about image that they forgot to tighten security. Check and double check the wards. Maybe, I dunno, look for sloppy spellwork. This is so frustrating. In its current state, this Tournament is UNPLAYABLE.

** “Guys, I've made some freaky discoveries. You know how Snape killed Dumbledore last year? He did it on /Dumbledore's orders/! Isn't that crazy? On top of that, he was best friends with my mum and loved her! He was protecting me all these years! Now, here's the sad part. This will be my very last video. Ever. After I sign off, I'm going to have to give myself up to Voldemort and die to protect the Wizarding World. Thank you Hermione, my brilliant editor, and Ron, my source for ideas. You two have been my greatest friends. Draco, otherwise known as PurebloodSupreme, please come up with better username. And yes, I know it was you. Professor McGonagall, thank you for being such a supportive teacher and being there for me every step of the way. Hagrid, you're awesome! Without you, I wouldn't even be here! Ginny, I love you with all my heart, and I hope you can still be happy in the future. The guy who ends up with you will be a truly lucky guy. Lastly, to Professor Snape, I hope you and Mum manage to become friends again. She'll forgive you. You protected me, after all. She can't possibly deny that! Guys, it was fun vlogging and sharing all these cool memories with you, and I hope you've enjoyed my content up to this point. I'm signing off, now. Wish me luck on the next great adventure!”

- after defeating Voldemort *

“Okay guys, I lied. I'm not dead. Apparently my mum's sacrificial charm saved me. But I meant what I said earlier. I'm immensely grateful to all the people I mentioned in my goodbye message. You know who /is/ dead? Voldemort! All the people who laid down their lives to fight him will now be avenged thanks to his destruction. If you liked this vlog, do the big three! I'll see you in the next one! Bye!”

** Maybe Dudley edited the videos and got super invested in the history?

Would also be fun to see Harry outright and straight-faced breaking the Statute of Secrecy with not only the ministry not doing anything because they don't know enough about technology to understand what he is doing but also the muggles he is exposing the magical world to (completed with complex explanations about culture and history) not only laughing it off, but also actively teasing and finding explanations to convince those who do believe in it. In the end he will actually have helped to straighten the secret by making the muggles find alternative explanations to any magic that does slip through.

** There was a story which was just a bunch of oneshots, in which one of the chapters had this same premise.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

"As we don't think actual protons work for capturing ghosts, we'll use magic instead!"

"And then we'll try it out on Professor Binns!"
