Sometimes I just get into the mood of reading parental!Harry. Preferably with younger Teddy, Al, James, or Lily, but I'll take ones with other 2nd gen kids. One shots or long stories are fine, canon pairings/genders is preferred. Thanks!

**** I think you should be all right. All of those stories take place after California Dreamin', but it shouldn't be too awful confusing without reading that one first. In that continuity, Harry is a teacher at a wizarding school in Berkeley and Ginny is studying at UCSF med school. If you know and accept that, you should be fine. You might want to read linkao3(8759671) before The Selkie's Gift though for a bit more background on that story. It's a one shot.
