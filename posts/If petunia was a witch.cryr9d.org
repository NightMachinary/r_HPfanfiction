Would she still hate lily then? I dont see her joining Dumbledore or voldemort. she probably would have ended up working in the ministry. And i dont see her liking james or snape either... would lily have listened to her and stayed away from them??

These were my shower thoughts.


** I've been wondering about this myself.

Her personality would not be poisoned by toxic envy, as it is in canon. But I think she wouldn't be a nice person by any means. She's extremely snobbish, and as a magical this would translate into her wholeheartedly endorsing the Magicals-are-superior-to-Muggles ideology. I'd go out on a limb and suggest she'd be sorted into Gryffindor. At her core, I think there is a strength of character that'd make the Hat put her there. But being Gryffindor, of course, does not automatically make you a nice person.

In this universe, she would look down on Vernon simply because he's a Muggle so there'd be no Dudley. The most likely thing is that she'd find some half or pureblood wizard to marry and live a fairly quit life, during which she'd do her best to pretend she's not muggleborn and make occasional remarks about Muggles that even the average magical would think a bit tasteless.

**** Sort of; there are similarities. But Umbridge is a dangerous manipulative sociopath with a strong streak of sadism.

Magical Petunia I'd imagine as small-minded and unpleasant, but harmless. In extreme circumstances, she might even have a (reluctant) willingness to do the right thing for others, even if it would take an awful lot to bring it out.

** It's worth noting that Petunia is probably a couple years older than Lily, so the idea of her primary dynamic at Hogwarts involving anyone in Lily's year is somewhat far-fetched. She'd be aware of them of course, but she would have her own friends, her own foes.

For some reason, I have a vision of her ending up with a McLaggen type. Maybe Cormac's dad or something.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

  When the letter arrives, Lily is almost as excited as Petunia. She writes Albus Dumbledore to ask if she can go too, and if she cries a little when the answer comes back no she doesn't tell anyone. Lily waves from the train platform, writes diligently, and listens with excitement whenever her big sister deigns to share stories of magic. --Anonymous asked for "what if Petunia was a witch and Lily a Muggle?"

** Petunia's whole beef with Lily is her jealousy of Lily's magic, so no, she would not hate her. Lily adored her older sister until Petunia cut her out of her life, so if Petunia said to stay away from James she absolutely would (Lily didn't like him anyway until 7th year). Snape is a different story. He met Lily when they were nine, so her staying away from him depends on how much older Petunia is. If she's only one to two years older he's still their introduction to magic and Petunia could end up liking him as well. If not, I'd say that it's a 50-50 chance that lonely Lily still hangs out with him while Petunia is at school, as it didn't seem like any of them had other friends in Cokeworth.

** She'd probably still dislike Snape, since she disliked him from the outset, even before she was aware that he was a wizard. The dislike would be tempered however, since he'd be her only source of information about the Wizarding World. However, once she's part of Hogwarts, there's little reason in her mind to keep him around.

We know far too little about her childhood personality beyond the jealousy so I'm not really sure how she'd behave beyond this, or in Hogwarts, but it wouldn't surprise me if she'd indirectly cause Lily and Severus' friendship to break down even earlier with her prejudice against "his kind" and Lily listening more to Petunia -- her sister, who she now has a functioning relationship with -- than her other Gryffindor housemates (who has an obvious bias).

** I read an interesting fic the other day. It's not Petunia-centric (it focuses on Lily/James), but Petunia is a witch in the background (slight spoiler for the fic, but just recommending it here tells you that much anyway). It has a few ideas about how and why Petunia the witch still dislikes/hates magic, Hogwarts, and the wizarding world that I think make sense.

** Its hard to say for sure. Essentially Petunia just felt inferior to her sister and wanted to be included. I think if that feeling were to happen again even for different reasons and if it were intense enough then it would cause the same issues between the sisters but its entirely possible that Harry might have been treated a bit better since you wouldnt have the issue of her finding magic repulsive later in life.

** Well until her 7th year she did stay away from James and by then Petunia wouldn't be in school anymore, so I think she would end up with him, but to be honest, I don't see so much reason why she would tell Lily to stay away. James is popular and Petunia is someone that would like someone because they are popular, he is talented and rich, has a good standing and considering that Petunia married Vernon, she doesn't have a problem with bullies as long as they don't bully her. and to top it all James was outspoken against dark magic and the whole pureblood ideology.

I think if anything she would be jealous that someone like James was interested in Lily.

​

Snape is a coin toss, I personally think Lily would drift away from Snape sooner on her own if she had an older magical sister that could explain things even better than Snape and if she wouldn't be so isolated in the muggle world. In the books, it was clear that Lily forgave Snape quite a lot of things that should have been warnings and what she really wasn' ok with

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
