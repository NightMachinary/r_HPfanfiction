I am in a dire need of ss/hg fics. Pleasee help me. I think I've read all of the classics and most famous ones, but now I can't find good complete fics(I don't really follow fanfics unless the fic is reaaaaally good and worth it, like 'bound to him' and 'the contract')

Any recommendation will be welcomed and appreciated.

*I prefer darker themes, torture, war ... (I am over 18, so sex and that kinda stuff is allowed and preferred) *war time fics are favourites of mine specially if it's during Hermione's sixth year. *every other fanfic that does not fit into my preferences but you think it's worth a shot, recommend away ;)

Thank you all <3


** Linkao3(5837464) I'm not a massive ss/hg fan, but I recall enjoying this fic quite a lot, may not be your cup of tea though... there was another I quite liked which was post war, Hermione helpings Snape recover, started off in 12 grimmauld and then moved to spinners end, snap had no voice and Ron was a douchebag, can't remember the name but I could probably find it if you're interested :)

#+begin_quote
  When Snape is exposed as a spy for the Order, Hermione finds herself caught in the crossfire of the Dark Lord's quest for vengeance. She returns home with his followers' actions seared into her skin and his promises tattooed on her soul, determined to keep her ordeal a secret from those she loves. They've been through enough already. She always knew she would have to sacrifice parts of herself before this war was out, but how much can she give up before there's nothing of her left?
