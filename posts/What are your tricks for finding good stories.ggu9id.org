I skip almost everything over 100k words, almost all unfinished fics, and fics that took more than a year to publish from start to finish usually get a pass. I feel like I have a decently high success rate when it comes to finding fics I enjoy.

What are your methods for rooting out the less than stellar fics?

****** A lot of relationships in fics don't use relationship tags - they just list them in the character field.

In any event, as I don't read non-Harry-centric fics, no great loss in excluding those characters from the character field.

** Fics containing rare pairs or no pairings are usually well-written and not too preachy. And of course no bashing.

** A lot of the times it's the summary for me. I like looking for unique ideas or takes on tropes. So its often the summary that makes or breaks the story. But another way I find some good fics is check out fics that authors that I like like to read themselves (using [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] myself not sure is AO3 has a favorite page that shows on profiles). I often find unique ideas are done well cause the author thinks it our well.

Sometimes if I really like the author I check out if they run a community that they use to keep track of stories. I found a story, Kicking Gotham - linkffn(13521865), that I would never have found by myself by doing this.

** Personally I search on Reddit, I put a thing I want after the [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] at the top, it will then show all posts with the words i put in there, then I can just look at all the request/what's that fic/self promo posts for fics that I might like, if I find a good fic I check the authors fics and see if there are any good ones.

I should probably find a better way but this is working rather well currently

** I have the highest success rate when I just plug the general idea I want into Reddit search and have this sub do the work of filtering for me.

Failing that, on AO3, exclude all of the following:

- Manipulative Albus Dumbledore, Character Bashing, and Morally Grey Harry Potter tags
- M/M category
- Rape/Non-Con and Underage warnings
- the Cursed Child fandom
- Harry/Voldemort (all 3 variant tags), Harry/Snape, Hermione/Snape relationships
- Draco Malfoy as a character altogether

Then sort by Kudos, put some keywords of whatever I'm in the mood for in the search bar, and still despair at the amount of crap that gets recommended.

** I have a saved search for the Harry Potter fandom on AO3. I excluded all the things I'll never ever enjoy (a/b/o, mpreg, bashing, certain pairings) and use that as a base for all searches. I sort by kudos, and maybe add other search peramaters if I'm in the mood for a specific thing (8th year, for example). There is so much stuff out there that I'll never be able to read it all but at least this way I can maximize my chances of finding the good stuff.

I started off on ffnet but now I find it a bit disorganized and overwhelming. Now I only read stories there if recommended through here or tumblr.

** I find a fic I like using pairings or just the summary and then check that persons favs and follows. I will also go back to fics I've saved in the past and do the same thing depending on what I'm “craving” for a story.
