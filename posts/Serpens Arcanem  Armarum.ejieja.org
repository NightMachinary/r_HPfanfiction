Does anyone have a copy of Evander's Serpens Arcanem and Serpens Armarum fics? The author has taken it down from like every single site, including all the backups like fiction hunt. I really enjoyed reading them though, and would love to have a copy to peruse. Kind of sad that they took them all down. Like, yeah they were your fics and yeah you don't have to continue them, but that doesn't mean people can't enjoy what was actually posted. Nothing on the internet disappears completely - surely someone has a pdf version of them? I did but my old laptop got fried and I lost it.


** Hopefully this should work :)

*** The basilisk venom and phoenix tears had unintentional side effects, causing Harry to transform into some kind of living snake. Finding out why is part of the fic. He ends up living in a boarding house for people who don't fit into typically Light society - e.g. disgraced Dark wizards / creatures. There is slash, but it's super light and with a character who genderbends (a sidhe). Ends up NOT going to Hogwarts. Actually worth reading if you haven't.

**** Thank you. It was an interesting, if short, read. It's too bad that the author didn't finish it...
