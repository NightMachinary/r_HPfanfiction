:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Seem to remember a fic from a many few years ago, something about Rowena Ravenclaw trying to create a device into which she could shoot a spell and have it hold the spell in some form of suspended animation from which she could then be able to study it, anyway she shoots an AK at the thing all hell breaks loose and the resulting vortex created by the hovering AK sucks in the surrounding rocks which result in the whole thing becoming the Veil, was this a fever dream or a genuine fic?


** That was Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Root of Evil) I believe. It's a very unique story - nothing is rehashed, and it has very original worldbuilding.

** I wrote this fic forever ago. Kinda wish I actually finished it, but I think it got too tainted by dumb shit, and was a bit too ambitious for my writing ability at the time.

*** There's still some pretty solid ideas in there, it's been a while since I've seen a new founders Era fic so if you ever thought about giving it another go I'm sure you'd have a fair amount of interest
