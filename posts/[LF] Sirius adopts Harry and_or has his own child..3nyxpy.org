** Definitely check out linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7). It's complete with one completed sequel and a third in the works that updates weekly! Seriously I am in love with this story. Currently rereading it. The characterizations of everyone are so well done and it's very well written.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

It has been edited primarily for grammar; having been written around the time OOTP came out, it does not incorporate canon from Half\-Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows\. Earlier versions of the fic are available in ebook formats from Chandri \(containing all the files of the Stealing Harryverse\) and from Deinera \(containing only Stealing Harry\)\.
