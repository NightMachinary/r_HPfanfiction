If a metamorphagus was an animagus would their abilities cross over? Would a metamorphagus even need to be an animagus to become an animal or can they transform so completely that in physicality they are an animal? If it was possible, how much of the metamorphmagus ability would cross over? Would the animagus animal have the ability to change drastically (wings, horns, abilities that didn't come with the package of that animal) or would it be a more limited ability (markings, colours)?

Does anyone have any ideas on it?


** I feel metamorphmagi might not be able to turn fully into an animal (or be an animagi) wether that be by law because they could just change there disine or animal and they would never be able to keep it registered. Or does the metamorphosis stop the animagus transformation from working.

I think the thing about animagi is that they become the animal wholly while keeping their human mind. While a metamorphagus might be able to have the appearance of any animal they would still be human in ability. So, yes, they would still need to become an animagus to become an animal in essence.

As they keep their minds, I would think so, yes. However, what I said above would apply to this scenario. They would still be that animal in essence while being the other in appearance.

Edit: metamorphagi is simply an innate ability to transfigure oneself. They are limited to what every other human can do with human transfiguration. They just do it without a wand.

** I think the animagus would have the same abilities in animal form, like they could be any color of pigeon. Being able to sprout lots of different animal features: wings, horns, flippers, stingers, etc, just seems overpowered.

** Metamorphmagi are limited to appearance changes only, like hair colour, eye colour, or skin colour. However some that are more talented could change their nose into a duck beak (eg tonks) however they wouldn't be able to change into an animal

*** Does Tonks do the duck beak thing in the books, or is that a film-only event?

I seem to recall that when I read the books I always had the impression that metamorphmagi couldn't change anything into non-human features. So while they could change skin, eye, hair colour and shape, they were limited to human shapes.

But there are fanfics that have Tonks turning her arms into wings and all sorts, and I feel like if they can literally take on any shape of any species, that makes metamorphmagi obscenely OP.

**** It was a pig snout in the books.

#+begin_quote
  Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snape's, shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favorite noses.

  “Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks.”

  Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.

***** Hmm, but a pig-like nose which makes a person resemble Dudley is still a human feature, as opposed to an actual snout.

I think the effort that JKR went to say that each of these examples resembles an existing character was to demonstrate that Tonks's ability is limited to human features.

But that may just be my preferred interpretation, because as I say, otherwise it makes metamorphmagi extremely overpowered.

*** Anyone can be animagi though. So Tonks could possibly change the fur colour of her form.

** I was under the impression that Tonks's ability required effort to maintain. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but if that's the case then she's not 'turning into' anything, she's just changing her shape by concentration. If she gets distracted by anything, she reverts. I don't think it's transfiguration at all, more like pulling a funny face and trying to keep it there. I haven't read the books in a long time, so I'm not sure what's said about it.

*** Unless you believe she was born with bubble gum pink hair, they don't revert.
