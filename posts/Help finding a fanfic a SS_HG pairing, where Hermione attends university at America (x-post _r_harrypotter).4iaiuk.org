Someone posted it here: [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/89470/3804]] I'm not so big into fan fiction but I'd love to help them.


** You should encourage them to post their request over at the [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/][SS/HG Fanfic Recs]] page on LiveJournal. If anyone would know the answer to their question, it would be someone there.
