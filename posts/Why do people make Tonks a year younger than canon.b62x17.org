Is it so Tonks can still be at Hogwarts during Harry's first year so they can interact? Or do you think people see that Tonks graduated in 1991 and Harry started in 1991, and just assume they were there at the same time rather than realizing that the end of one academic year and start of the next take place in the same calendar year?

I would imagine so. If it's a story where both Harry and Tonks are main characters, it gives the author another opportunity to build their dynamic. I actually prefer it this way, because I like the idea of Tonks being like a big sister to Harry.

** Maybe it's to make her relationship with Lupin that much more uncomfortable.

(I'm probably gonna get downvoted for that and I don't care.)

**** It won't change much at all in terms of age difference. But it definitely would make Remus uneasy, given that this would mean he was involved with a girl who attended school at the same time as Harry.I don't know how the readers would feel about this, some of them maybe wouldn't like it.

***** 6 years, 7 tears. Not a huge difference in a Honks pairing. 14/15(?) years not a huge difference for a Lupin/Tonks pairing.

** Is there any actual canon evidence or evidence from Pottermore/interview with JKR that actually gives us Tonks' age? People assume she knows Charlie or was in his year at Hogwarts but do we actually know?

*** It's said that she knew Charlie at Hogwarts, so she was there at the same time, implicitly in the same year but plausibly a year below or above, and was a recently qualified Auror the summer before Harry's fifth year, and Christmas of Harry's first year Charlie Weasley was already away working in Romania. We don't know if he stayed on for his NEWT years or buggered off after getting his OWLs as we don't know what UK qualifications a Romanian dragon farm/reserve would want to see. We do know that N. Tonks has her NEWTs as we're told in canon that they're a requirement for becoming an Auror.

We don't know how long Aurors are expected to train before being qualified, whether or not there's a required probationary time with the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and/or the Hit Wizards before you /start/ training, or if you can start in the top echelon of magical law enforcement without serving any time at all.

In short: there's a couple of things that imply Tonks wasn't at Hogwarts by Harry's first year, but plenty that permits that she might have been.

*** Tonks tells Harry in OOTP that she qualified a year ago, then McGonagall tells him that auror training takes three years, so fans determine her age based on this.

**** If you click the [1] Next to her estimated birth year. It should definitely be given a different colour.

You get this:

#+begin_quote
  Tonks says in 1995 [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix][/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/]], Chapter 3 (/The Advance Guard/) "I only qualified a year ago" and Auror training takes three years after graduating [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix][/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/]], Chapter 29 (/Careers Advice/) - "...Auror training takes a further three years...") placing Tonks' graduation in 1991 (if she immediately started Auror training), and her birth in late 1972 or 1973.
#+end_quote

â€‹

Furthermore it means she was born while the Marauders were at Hogwarts. Which could make the relationship really awkward if you think the Tonks' were close with the Potters and Sirius.

** After the books were complete but before Pottermore it wasn't clear exactly when she attended, so writers guessed. Those stories inflenced subsequent stories and now a lot of people think it's canon.
