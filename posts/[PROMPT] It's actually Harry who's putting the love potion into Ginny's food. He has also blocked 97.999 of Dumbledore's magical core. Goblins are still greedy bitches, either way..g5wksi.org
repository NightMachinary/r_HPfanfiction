This prompt came to me, as most amazing ideas do, at like 3am after my sister woke me up and I couldn't fall asleep.

Anway!

Harry is slightly senile, kind of stupid and has very little confidence in himself. This causes him to start putting love potion in Ginny Weasleys food 6th year onwards, love potion which he obviously purchased from goblins. He also uses his Lordships and Dordships whatever to put magical blocks on Dumbles, who Harry is certain is trying to usurp his plans to defeat Voldemort, in leau of Dumbledore becoming God, I don't know, the saviour of the wizarding world.

Thing is, Dumbledore's strong enough to yeet the power blocks of, Fred and George have vast experience with love potions (bonus points if even Voldemort is disgusted by it because of how he was conceived) and the Goblins do not give any shits, nor is there any Friend of The Goblins bs.

Basically, I just think it would make a highly entertaining crack fic
