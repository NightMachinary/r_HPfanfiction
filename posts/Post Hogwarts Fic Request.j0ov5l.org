I'm looking for good post-hogwarts fics that follow the books but doesn't have to follow the epilogue. I don't specifically care if it is Harry/Ginny. Preferably complete and novel length.

(I've already read The First Day and The Aurors)


** 1)Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash complete and novel length fic. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]

2) no voyage by aheartcalledhome well written Harry/Ginny fic dealing with the aftermath of the war themes of ptsd. Not novel length but complete and worth reading in my opinion. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23968243/chapters/57648346]]

3) Grow Young with Me » He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead. words: 242k+ I usually despise oc's with a raging passion but the characterization is so well written that I promise you its worth reading. Not complete but it's semi-regularly updated [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]]

4) Harry Potter, Wizarding Barrister Harry finds himself doing an unusual thing after the war: defending the innocent before the Wizengamot. Here's what happens during his final case. This is a long one shot but In my opinion it's still worth reading it in terms of a good postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3548160/1/Harry-Potter-Wizarding-Barrister]]

5) New Leaf to Turn » by slavetothepen Dudley Dursley lived a very normal life. But when an all too familiar letter makes an appearance on his son's 11th birthday, Dudley must seek the guidance of a cousin he hasn't seen in 19 years. Who else but Harry Potter [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5980337/1/New-Leaf-to-Turn]] complete and fits all the requirements except the length
