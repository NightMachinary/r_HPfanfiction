I'm looking for a Fic. So Harry somehow travels back to merlins time and he is adopted by Merlin. He gets powers from magical creatures, and plays a major role in shaping the wizarding world. He plays a part in the original wizengamot, and is also Salazar Slytherin. He is a warrior healer? He is gifted a sword from the goblins because he fought with them in a war. The sword later becomes Gryffindors sword. And they all have really weird names. He is trained by Morgan Lefay.

*** Should I read it? I tried it before and it seemed... weird-ish I guess?

**** As someone else said, it's a bit weird but definitely original and worth checking out. Just a heads up, the author is not an English native and it shows. Some mistake and turn of phrases that can be slightly odd, I've seen much worse and even someone as pick as me was not put off by this, however.

I say it's worth checking out

***** Well, the mistakes can be forgiven if they weren't born knowing English, I just can't excuse laziness in the native speakers. I'll take your word for it, the fic does seem interesting.

***** I read the first few chapters and a few chapters toward the end, at the time I wasn't interested in something so long so I just kind of walked away from it. It was actually pretty interesting and I would definitely recommend it - at least from what I saw.
