I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4291790/1/Polyjuice-Memory-Charms-and-More][Polyjuice, Memory Charms and More]] and was looking for more like it. It can be kinky or dark or just fun. Whatever.


** Polyjuice potion is used in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/38461?view_adult=true][Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy's Wife]].

If you're cool with slash, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10642029/1/Cursed][Cursed]] might be similar to what you're looking for.

  When Draco Malfoy takes an unexpected day off, his Auror partner decides to personally check he is not in any kind of trouble. Because that is what partners do, right? Mature sexual content. Complete.

  Harry Potter discovers the Spell book of Desires in his fourth year at Hogwarts, which contains a vast amount of sexual spells and potions. Various pairings throughout the story. Rated M for a reason.

** I lied [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600022799][girls & boys]] and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600096188][being wanted]] are both fairly interesting. That whole site has a lot of smut. Edit: lot of it is really fucking weird too.
