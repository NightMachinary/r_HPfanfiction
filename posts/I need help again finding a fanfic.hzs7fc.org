:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm horrible at keeping track of what's what and which one is which and I keep forgetting the names of the things but not the plot. Does anyone else have this problem where you can recall the most obscure of details but for the sake of your life can't recall what the name is?

basic outline - Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys to an orphanage where he is given the name Hadrian Jovie Peters (or something similar), when he goes to school he becomes an obvious prodigy. He is bullied for this except for a few people like Eric. He goes to university and gets a degree and becomes a professor. A lot of the kids like him and the headmaster is a friend of snape's so he tells him all about Harry and they become friends. He has no idea he's actually Harry Potter but when they meet again at hogwarts they still are friends.

this was on either [[https://fanfanfic.net][fanfanfic.net]] or [[https://ao3.org][ao3.org]] . I think

#+begin_quote
  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
