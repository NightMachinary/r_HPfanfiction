Any points that interest me (all don't have to be included, at least just one):

- Time Travel
- Harry/Voldemort (or Tom)
- Dumbledore Bashing
- Slytherin!Golden Trio
- Friends with Slytherins
- Lords and Ladies (Potter-Black included, I don't care if it's super fucking cliche)
- Master of Death!Harry Potter

One of the only fics that I've liked that includes them being Dark and that I remember is linkffn(Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas).

Thanks for any replies and recommendations!

(P.S. I'd prefer them to be completed, but if they're not, I'd like them to at least have a lot of words and abandoned or a lot of words and in progress.)


** Not the trio, but a good read nevertheless.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

***** Right? I would have loved to see McGonagal's reaction to Teddy getting into Hufflepuff or something when they thought that he'd definitely go Slytherin. That would be amusing. I totally want to see Portrait Dumbledore and Portrait Snape react to Harry, as well. Like Teddy gets in trouble or someone bullies Teddy like an idiot and Harry comes to talk to McGonagall about that. That would be brilliant.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
