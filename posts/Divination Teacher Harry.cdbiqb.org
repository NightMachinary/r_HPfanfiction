** Was it a Tomarry fic? Because I remember reading one with Harry as the divination professor and Tom was teaching DADA I think. Harry would constantly give Tom ridiculous prophecies, and Tom could never tell if they were real or fake. He was convinced Harry was bullshitting him??? There was something about a llama prophecy, a near death experience and the Weasley twins too. Sound familiar at all? I can go try and dig it up.

Edit: All good, I found it. Linkffn(11973276) Even if it's not the right fic, you should take a look. I remember it being pretty good.
