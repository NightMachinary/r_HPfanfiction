So I remember reading it some years ago, in it Harry managed to learn some wandless magic pre-Hogwarts, thought nothing really out of reality, I think he only could change a pencil in metal and move objects, it was something like this at least. Then on the troll incident he was looking in the third floor, Snape saw him, runned after him and he accidentally found the troll and went like “Kill it! Kill it with fire!” And somehow used his wand to roast the troll alive, he didn't see Hermione and the only reason he didn't obliviate her when he heard she had seen him is because she had already told Dumbledore. He didn't go to the Dursley's at the end of the year, instead he gave himself a world tour, learned to become an animagus, occlumency, and made a ritual in which he killed a dragon. I remember that the last scene I read was in second year, he saw Ginny possessed with red eyes and tough she had mage-sight.


** Some of these scenes sound like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley)\\
although it is not Harry who does these things.

** This sounds familiar. It has some commonalities with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes by Peeves' best friend), but I don't believe that's the story you're asking for.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)
