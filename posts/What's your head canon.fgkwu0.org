Post owls can apparate after they reach a certain terminal velocity/height/distance from wizardkind. Each "apparition factor" is different for each owl, which is why their personalities vary so widely.

Certain items cannot be apparated, flued, portkeyed, or transported by other magical means. Perhaps the items can be flued, but not apparated; portkeyed, but not flued; etc. This is why heavy hitters in canon never walk around with an iron man suit or their gadgets-for-every occasion.

Remus Lupin was never bitten. He's a born werewolf and the reason Fenrir hates him so much is because of old bloodline drama. Hence their clich√© names. The first werewolves were Romulus and Remus, children of the wolfmother of Rome. Fenrir is also a born werewolf, but from some other independent line. This is also why Lupin never comes to get Harry. He's too busy abstaining the throne of werewolf-dom to take care of a child, and he knows that any adopted child of his would become too much of a target.

Ronald Weasley eats so much because as a child he swore a pact with the ghoul in the Weasley's attic. He eats enough for two people because part of his nutritional gain is somehow transferred to the ghoul.

Both light and dark magic are addictive. Overuse of dark magic makes you Voldemort. Overuse of light magic turns you into a self-righteous Greater-Gooder. Dumbledore became self-aware during his fight with Grindlewald, and one of the reasons why he never takes on Harry as an apprentice is that he doesn't want to turn Harry into a Greater Good Thanos-like figure. This is also why he never seeks out Voldemort or attempts to truly defeat him. For Dumbledore, who constantly fights at the precipice of his addiction to light magic, the magic required to defeat Voldemort outright would send him over the edge.

** I have a list of illvermorney/current wizarding america headcanons, since not much is revealed about them

-America and Canada have a smaller Wizarding Population, which is why they can fit the large countries population in one school

-Illvermorney is a large early colonial mansion on the outskirts of boston, charmed to look ruins of a house with it's roof ripped off and vines growing out the windows to muggles.

-instead of lots of paintings, there are a mix of sentient statues and photographs. There are some paintings from the early 1800s-1850s. There is a bust of every headmaster of Illvermorny in a room called the hall of heads.

-Houses are not a thing in real schools in america and canada like they are in england. In Illvermorny, "houses" are more like cabin names/mascots in summer camps. They are seperated out so there is more rooms per grade, and each dorm area has a mascot. They are not seperated in the dining halls or have different house colors.

-Illvermorny colors and uniform are coanonically royal blue and cranberry. I think that like hogwarts uniforms are similer to british secondary school uniforms, thier uniforms are similer to american prep/catholic school uniforms.

-Unlike england, instead of allies of shops to do their shopping in, we have malls. Instead of diagon ally, they have several magical malls across the country.

-Instead of a minister, they have a president

-Some spells are the same as the ones they use in england, and some are in languages of several native american/inuit languages

-many of the animals from native american/inuit folklore are real and native to these countries, same as english folklore animals are real

thats all I got for now, but I might think of more later.

** 1. The Killing Curse will bounce off gold of sufficient purity. We see such a ricochet in the Battle of the Atrium, and it fits with IRL alchemical beliefs (gold was considered the perfected form of metal, while a perfected human would be immortal, thus the two abilities of a Philosopher's Stone).
2. Occlumency has a hidden downside: It doesn't just defend your mind against intrusion, but against /anything/ that could affect it; this includes such threats as "advice", "new information", and "second thoughts". Thus, the more one uses Occlumency, the less they're able to adapt to change or take advice from others.
3. Hogwarts Castle is at least semi-sentient. It is also far less well-defended than people think, due to its wards and other magical defenses being forgotten, neglected, ill-maintained, meddled and/or tampered with, or outright deactivated/disabled over the past thousand years.
4. Luna Lovegood has some degree of perception beyond human norms, even if she's not technically a Seer. Ron Weasley may also have a bit of the Sight (when you consider how often his comments end up foreshadowing things).
5. Albus Dumbledore's conclusion that Harry Potter would have to die came no later than November 2nd, 1981. His actions and inactions regarding Harry make no sense in preparing a warrior or champion, but make a truly disturbing amount of sense in grooming a martyr.
6. Draco was gay/bi and attracted to Harry and Ron, but due to his upbringing couldn't recognize/accept his feelings, thus his constant hounding and needling of both Harry and Ron. Ron himself may also have been bi and in denial, his blowup at Hermione over the Yule Ball due to jealousy of both her and Krum.

** "remus lupin was never bitten" uhhh, half blood prince page 16 remus says he was bitten by fenrir. full bit "Who's Greyback?"

"You haven't heard of him?" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. "Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results. "

Lupin paused and then said, "It was Greyback who bit me."

*** I'm actually completely aware of what canon says. But we only have Lupin's word on it. He could be lying, because it makes for an easier story than "I'm the rightful ruler of werewolves, but I don't want the throne."

Him being a hereditary werewolf explains (a) his name, (b) why he never took in Harry, (c) why he's the only werewolf we know of to have ever attended Hogwarts, and (d) why Dumbledore was willing to take so many risks on him.

Characters don't always tell the truth about themselves. Sometimes they're deluded, sometimes they're actively hiding something, and sometimes the author just doesn't want to introduce disparate elements to the plot. Dumbledore, Snape, Lockhart, Crouch-Moody, and Slughorn are good examples of such characters in the series.

Also, maybe Fenrir did bite him, but bit him in the sense "it was Fenrir who gave me this scar," rather than "it was Fenrir who turned me into a werewolf."

***** ...that really doesn't address any of the points that I raised?

Have you never read a story where characters weren't always telling the truth?
