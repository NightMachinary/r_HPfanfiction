** Thank you for so many additions to my reading list! Here's a few possibilities for yours:

*Through the Wormhole - Star Trek DS9*. A three part series that easiest to find [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1456411][here on ao3]] but the most recent updates are only found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13446963/1/Through-the-Wormhole-Year-3][FFN]]. Harry goes through the veil of death and ends up in the wormhole when Sisko met the prophets during the premiere. Starts out pretty true to the series, then diverges because it has to. This author also wrote a lot of stories in the Lone Traveler series, linked elsewhere in this thread (they qualify, and are great guilty pleasure fix-it reads).

*Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain - The Dresden Files*. I have mixed feelings about this one, but its certainly an interesting read.

*Illusions of Grandeur - Supernatural*. I loved this story, and am pretty disappointed that the sequel has been abandoned. MoD!Harry is old and from a previous version of the universe.

*Browncoat, Green Eyes - Firefly* universe. This one is probably not what you want, but the portal vs fusion line here is a bit blurry and the story is excellent. It's /is/ technically fusion, but its also the 26th century, Harry is the last/only wizard and it reads like a portal fic until you're more than halfway through. If you aren't familiar with Firefly, the earth is a uninhabitable flaming rock and humanity now lives elsewhere, its a space western, and you should watch it.

*They Call Us Dark - LoTR*. This fic... this story fits what you're looking for but it /does/ have some issues... I liked the concept and would read the hell out of a beta'd rewrite but.... problems, it has them. For instance, the author is very likely a non-native English speaker and uses some confusing terminology such as referring to Harry as "the raven" and forgetting to tell us that s/he's talking about his hair lol. Also: keep in mind that some elements are made up from whole cloth, and /this does not have anything resembling a LoTR canon finale/.

*The Power he Knows Not - LoTR*. Unlike the previous one, this is a great story. It follows stations of LoTR canon a bit more closely (with a twist), and is a completed story written by the same person who is working on the Shadow of Agmar and Elves Most Fabulous (which I'm linking without talking about - they also fit. Elves is crack, Angmar is serious and excellent but incomplete)

*The Archmage of Arda - LoTR*. It's complete and I liked it and I don't remember anything beyond that, sorry.

**** Oh, thought of one more.

*Gods Among Us - Battlestar Galactica* (the reboot, I think?) - I went into this having a vague idea of what this show was about, and I feel like it did a decent job of explaining what was going on. If you're heading in fandom blind you'll probably be okay. (The description also says stargate, and I never watched that either.)

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called ‘The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  The one grateful thought that he threw to the sky was that he was not surrounded by trees. Truly, Harry was used to waking up in enchanted and lonesome forests and while he could surely survive in one again, the wide-open, grassy plain was a sight for sore eyes.The untamed magic and general feel of a land unknown to him were far outweighing any relief he could find, however.Because of course Harry Potter, the boy who had never stuck between the lines of “physics” and “magic,” would again defy the rules and end up very, very far from Hogwarts -- the place where he should have been at the moment. Appearing in a world with nothing but the clothes on his back and the wand in his holster for protection was very unfortunate indeed, and it was only the mind-numbing shock Harry was in at the current moment that saved the grass in a small radius from him from an explosive destruction.“What,” he said, “is this.”OR.The one where Harry finds himself in Middle-Earth and goes with Bilbo on his quest, making attachments and saving a few lives along the way. But don't be fooled: Fawkes is the real hero of this story. This is basically an "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH FAWKES" story. I'm a big fan of his.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** linkffn(Post Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe) is set in the MCU universe but except for a few "cameos" (one early on and one just recently popped up) from his old (and totally dead) world, the magical world does not exist. It's still a WIP so it's possible a fusion could happen but as of right now there's not even a real hint of it happening. He is told that he could "eventually" bring back his world but that's it.

** This isn't complete without the Lone Traveller Anthology. It's about a Harry who does the age-old trope of the time travel ritual, but fucks it up so completely that he becomes dissasociated from any one universe and starts travelling to different points of time where he can make a difference - in the beginning, it's just JK's world, but it branches out quickly into a bunch of different fandoms.

Linkffn(Harry Potter: The Lone Traveller by The Professional)

Linkffn(Stories of the Lone Traveller by dunuelos)

Linkffn(Further Adventures of the Lone Traveller by dunuelos)

Linkffn(Harry Potter, Lone Traveler, God and Wizard by dunuelos)

There's a few more larger arcs by dunuelos in their own threads, but those are announced in the main stories. Dunuelos goes a bit strange with real-world religious symolism by the end of the second story (a bit over the top, but not preachy or anything), but it's a lot of fun to read.

  It's finally happened: The Lone Traveler became a God. With the Divine name Marek Ilumian, Patron God of Free Will, Minor God of Knowledge and Travel, sometimes he goes over the top. But he's all about giving people a choice - or at least the opportunity to Choose. And having fun, of course. And Pie. Lots of Pie. Completed but I've added more.
