For those of you who wrote an OC, if they happened to find themselves in front of the Mirror, what would they see? Is it something possible to achieve? Would they waste themselves in front of it, or be able to realize that it's not real?


** At the beginning: a life of adventure and heroism.

At the end: her mum.

** From Iron Lady:

Becky McAllister would see herself with a wand, going to Hogwarts with her adoptive brother.

Tom McAllister would see his brother alive again.

Alice McAllister would see herself with more children, her barreness cured.

Harry would see his adoptive parents and his birth parents reconciled, the two worlds he is a part of united peacefully.

** Charas from Darkness Ascendant:

Considering she's based on Sophie Ellis-Bextor, she'll see reality: herself on stage before tens of thousands of people.

Wallace would see his children without them being inverted(colors).

Licorice would see her being presented an award for her cookbook being a best seller and translated into every language ever.

From A Trek to the Stars:

T'ryl would see magic actually being quantifiable.

The twins would see their dad spending more time with them.

*** I like this so much! Small, different things that shows realism and hard work in your OCs.

Wallace is kind of not like the other...
