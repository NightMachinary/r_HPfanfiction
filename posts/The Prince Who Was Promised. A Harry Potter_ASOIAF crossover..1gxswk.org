** This story is awesome so far. Are there any other worthwhile HP & ASOIAF crossovers?

  He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

  Harry Potter is reincarnated as Harry Baratheon in Westeros (from A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones). He has his memories, and essentially his personality, but he isn't the same; different life, different experiences, and what have you. He can use magic, but he has no wand (not yet), and I'm of the opinion that most spells can't be done wandlessly, save for a basic few.

It's a work in progress, but shows great potential.

** I am still reading ASOIAF right now, so I don't want to start this quite yet (I'm finishing up book 4, so only one book to go); however, it looks really interesting. Definitely gonna have to check this out.
