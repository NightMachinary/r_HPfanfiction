#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** I believe it is WIP and the author is taking their time. I think the last chapter was at a pivotal point in the plot and and the story itself is probably reaching it's denouement. The author updated another of his stories back in February so they are probably still alive.

** That's one of my favorite HP fanfics.

The story is very satisfying since I have a very dim view of the British wizarding world. Too many of those guys were stuck in the middle ages and needed a THOROUGH shake up.

*** It's also satisfying because of the way it deals with the Marriage Law trope. Don't get me wrong, there are good fics that do it in a way that makes the characters believable and likable, but in most I just feel like the character should just leave the country, choose to go to Azkaban as a statement, or start a revolution against the Ministry for their audacity in telling people to marry and have children. Also, all but one(!) of the marriage law fics I've read have completely ignored the concept of homosexual wizards/witches.

**** Ah, this isn't the one I meant! If you check out the author's profile, you should see Empire listed somewhere - that's what I meant. I'll have to dig for the Tom Riddle ones, but if you do a search in the subreddit for the "best of lord voldemort" list, there's a few on there.
