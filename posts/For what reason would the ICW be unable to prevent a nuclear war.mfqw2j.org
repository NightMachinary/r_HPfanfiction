I'm working on a post-nuclear fic, and I was wondering this.


** If it's a muggle only war, then I think it could be down to overconfidence. Maybe the ICW doesn't believe the muggle tech is strong enough to warrant breaking the Statute. By the time they finally realise how strong it is, it's too late.

Conversely, blood purists on the ICW could be actively helping the muggles, because they want to have the muggles all kill each other off.

Finally, it could just be that the majority of the ICW isn't in a country that can make a difference here. For example, if the ICW is led by Japanese and Indian wizards, they may not be able to help stop a nuclear war between USA and Russia.

** Easiest: Wizards don't really understand muggles.

Sure, they may have heard of nuclear weapons, the internet, world-level environmental threats, or the term "8 Billion", but wizards as a whole have never really internalized how close to the precipice they have come.

You have a couple who have tried to wake the wizarding world up to these uncomfortable truths, but they never really woke up the public. Not exactly surprising given the narrow-minded view of the government's and incompetence of the wizarding press.

**** So first two thoughts:

1) Magic can hold off the apocalypse: Wizards stayed above ground, but only in magic heavy areas like Hogwarts and Diagon Ally. This leads to a predictable split: Some wizards want to still interact with Muggle society and bring in Muggleborns, while others take a 'on their heads be it', and want to wash their hands of the fools.

This has some interesting byplay, as you can have the changing circumstances be an excuse for shuffling up the sides. Maybe some on the 'light' are fed up with Muggle destruction and want to leave them to the tunnels to rot, while some in the 'dark' realize how astronomically stupid it was to ignore them (and maybe want that world ending power for themselves.

In the background you can give Wizards a resource crisis: There is only so much protected land, and it is dwindling as magic users die/abandon land and the apocalypse overtakes them. Being much easier to maintain land than reclaim it back. No longer can wizards go into some field, cast some muggle repelling and space expansion charms and basically have all the room they need. Also can't just walk into a supermarket and steal from the muggles. And then you have the 'dark side' which may not adjust well to not having any targets around.

â€‹

2) Magic can't hold off the apocalypse: Wizards retreat to Gringotts and the Ministry Basement and maybe Hogwarts. Wizards end up in isolated pools, maybe they can communicate but not connect. Thus driving them to connect with the muggle underground as a way to connect the wizard underground enclaves.

**** That can be easy. Magical defenses work... For a while. Depending on the needs of the story, a bubble head charm cast by a competent but not spectactular wizard would protect against the fallout for 20 minutes without collapsing. A wizarding standard "clean air" property charm (aka ward) would last a week at most.

Gives the wizards plenty of time to get below ground and plenty of incentive to do so -- recasting the clean air charm constantly is annoying. Better to move underground and use more potent, though smaller area, charms on the entrances so they'll last years.

** ICW is not a magical UN variant that we think it is. It is basically a club where specific people are invited and the reason for the invite is not given out.

** In my opinion, some "Internal Interferences" could be a good justification. For some reasons, a group of wizards from the ICW are working in the shadows in order to let the war happen : maybe they wanted to "weaken" the country that was first bombed, thinking, incorrectly, that they could prevent it from responding with one of their own bomb, or maybe they just wanted to created this post apocalypse world for whatever justification they could have (Muggle extermination, monopoly on ressources . . .).

Anyways, this group first worked from the inside in order to diminish the risk of a Nuclear War, before actively delaying any action from the ICW to stop the war, even trying to fight and/or kill the wizards sent into the country to stop the war, until it's too late.

** Because they don't have jurisdiction over muggle weapons?

Maybe because they don't think it'll be a serious threat, because it's just a bunch of neoptistic purebloods and Dumbledore's the only progressive one there because he defeated Grindlewald and was obligated to be let in?

Also, if you post the link I'd love to read it!
