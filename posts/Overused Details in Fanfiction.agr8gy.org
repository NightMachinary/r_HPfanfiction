[This thread is just for fun, I just want to know what other people think.] There are some tiny character details from canon that fanfiction authors use so much that when I come across them, I want to immediately give up on the story. For example:

Albus Dumbledore - eyes twinkling, lemon drops

Luna Lovegood - nargles, crumple-horned snorkacks

Fred & George Weasley - dungbombs dungbombs dungbombs fireworks! pranks!!!!

Ron Weasley - always! shoving! food! in! mouth!

Tonks - wotcher, don't call me Nymphadora, hair turns red as she gets angry (basically, that one scene in the one movie that she showed up in)

And all the magical candy. All anyone seems to eat in HP fanfiction is Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans and Chocolate Frogs. Oh, and firewhiskey! That was supposed to be an alcohol similar to cinnamon whiskey (Fireball) but who ever drinks that all the time?? In fanfiction, it's like "accio firewhiskey" every time someone wants to get blasted. I wish people had enough creativity to come up with their own magical alcohols and candys. Lol which overused details irk you?


** Remus Lupin, chocolate slut, scarf enthusiast.

FTFY.

Take a look a Clich√© Bingo posts. Both the post squares and the comments are absolutely spot on.

*** Goddamn, do I detest twinspeak.

Ninety percent of the time it reads in the most awful, horribly confusing way, not to mention it only happened once in the entire canon series.

If it wasn't so horrifically overused I'm sure it would be entertaining, but that horse was beaten to death years ago.

** As far as Luna goes, I agree that it's annoying when /"oh-look-a-nargle!"/ is her only character trait, but it also feels inauthentic to read a Luna fic where she /doesn't/ namedrop a magical creature of some sort. It's a tricky balance: I want her to seem like Luna when I read her, but not like a parody of Luna.

**** Well, seeing as HPfanfiction subreddit has tens of thousands of subscribers after 12 years since the last book came out, I'd say it was one of the best series in history. And that's not to mention the commercial success.

Morally dubious characters sound realistic to me. Logical inconsistencies with characters? Duh. I know of no one who doesn't check those two boxes at some point in their life.

Now, there were plot holes and the books aren't perfect but seeing as it turned millions of kids into avid readers, I feel compelled to defend it.

Plus, it is easy to break apart something, immensely harder to build.
