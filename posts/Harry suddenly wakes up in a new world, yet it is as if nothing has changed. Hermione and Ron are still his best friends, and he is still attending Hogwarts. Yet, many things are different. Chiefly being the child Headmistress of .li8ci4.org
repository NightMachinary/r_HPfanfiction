** What is the age difference between Ariana and Delphini? I feel like a large portion of the fic would be justifying why the headmistress is in a relationship with a student.

*** Ariana is still Dumbledore's little sister and is around a decade younger than Dumbledore's age in canon. She is also Wizarding Britain's strongest, just as Dumbledore was. Her body is simply perennially a child's, it is suspected that she is immortal.

**** First off let me say I like the idea and am in no way attacking your prompt. I'm just asking some clarifying questions. How old is Harry in this situation? If Delphini is a perfect she's either 15 or 16 in a relationship with a 100 year old Headmistress. Together, they have a child who is, at minimum, 11.

***** Uh, I don't think I implied that Ariana and Delphini were having a relationship?

It's just that Ariana Dumbledore and Delphini Riddle are two people Harry is absolutely sure were not there in his previous world. Their names are clear indicators that he is a different world.

You can pull Harry from any year, but I think 7th year Harry would be more convenient since he would know about Ariana Dumbledore and how she was Albus' sister. Harry only has his memories and does not possess his AU world counterpart's. He is trying his best to hide the fact that he is from a different world, seeking info about what things have changed and exactly who the 'Harry' of the new world was.

Ariana and Delphini are the most visible changes in Hogwarts. There can be other major changes and Harry finds out about them later. Like his mom sends him a Howler for some reason and then he realizes 'holy shit, my parents are alive here'.

****** I understand now. In the prompt, you said the chief difference "being the child headmistress". I read it as "being the child /OF/ headmistress". My mistake.
