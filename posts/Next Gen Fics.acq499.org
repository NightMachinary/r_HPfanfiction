I hope you like it! It's Scorpius/Rose, recently finished, and I got some pretty positive feedback. Please let me know if you end up enjoying it!

  In their sixth year, a ball that echoes the only good thing to happen in the Triwizard Tournament is held. Scorpius is desperate to finally ask her out, but Rose knows that she couldn't care less about that Malfoy. The Phoenix Ball pushes Scorpius to finally give her an invitation - but of course, it's never quite that easy.

** Linkffn(Ignite by Slide)

I've read something else by this author, so I expect this one is good as well. It's the first part of what appears to be a very long series centered on Scorpius and Rose.

Edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is another good one. It's Teddy's first year.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
