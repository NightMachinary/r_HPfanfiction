Fics like the drive in being alive or grow young with me or Novocaine

Where it starts of like canon but diverges pretty fast No bashing no romance involving death eaters no slash unless canon No harmony

Harry/Daphne\\
This is a pretty unique Haphne story. Apparently, Daphne was pretty... chunky during Hogwarts. One Lamb-hating ritual later, and there you go.

ANYWHO~ Harry works at WWW after the war for money, ends up making an alternate identity Kettle (POTter calling the Kettle BLACK) since he's head of those families.

Bunch of politics, money (both gaining and losing) going on. All the while Harry and Daphne are doing that dance.

  Post Deathly Hallows. EWE [HP/DG] HAPHNE. "Just for once, can something nice happen in Harry Potters life" Also contains depictions of PTSD, alcoholism, lemony scenes, humor. Harry Potter tries to survive the peace after the war. Starts just after the end of the war. Hermione won't stop crying, Harry has nightmares, George won't get out of bed. And Harry needs to talk to Ginny.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

***** Platonic obsession. I guess I get what they're saying. You have to do a lot to make Draco/Harry make a tiny bit of sense, but you can keep Harry in character and still pair him with Roger Davies, Wood, or Ron.m
