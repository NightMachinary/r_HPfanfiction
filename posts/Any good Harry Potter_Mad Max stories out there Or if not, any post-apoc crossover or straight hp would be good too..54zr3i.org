I checked ffn but found only a couple that didn't pique any interest.

Preferably no hp characters as love interests (if there is/are) unless it's hermione, fleur, or Tonks---crossover or original love interest is preferred; no slash; and no egregiously clichey shit.

Gotta remain on earth so no amazing fics like revenge of the wizard by darth marrs.

It's incomplete, woefully short, and not so much a Mad Max crossover as it is heavily inspired by Max (and a significant amount of David Bowie, but that's neither here nor there), but I've written the first two chapters of something that might be what you're asking for. As far as I've planned there are no pairings, since most of the fic centres around the parent-child relationship between Harry and Rose.

**** Currently, the biggest reference is to Diamond Dogs and Bowie's Halloween Jack persona, but there's been reference to the Thin White Duke, Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, and a significant amount of the fic takes place in Berlin, where Bowie had one of his most creative periods and put out the "Berlin Trilogy" (Heroes, Lodger, and Low). So, yeah, there's a pretty heavy influence, if I'm to be honest.
