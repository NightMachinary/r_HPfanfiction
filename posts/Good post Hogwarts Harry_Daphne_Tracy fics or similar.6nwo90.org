Ive been on a bit of a Harry/Daphne bender lately, and recently read a post Hogwarts fic where Harry ends up finding love with Daphne after a fallout with Ginny, and it takes a bit for them to recognize their feelings. Interestingly I would have seen the story go in a different direction with Harry paired with Tracy instead or Tracy in addition to Daphne with how Tracy was characterized. And so, that thought is now wiggling away in my brain and I need to satisfy it.

--------------

So, I am looking for any good post Hogwarts Harry/Daphne/Tracy fics focusing on the relationship but hopefully with solid plot as well beyond the romance. So a Romance/Drama or Romance/Adventure or something. Either Tracy or Daphne (or both) can be the initial focus of Harry but it needs to include all 3 at some point. Also as far as recommendations go...

I don't mind if its rated T but I prefer M. I don't mind if there is smut or not. I don't mind if Astoria (or an OC) is thrown into the mix provided they are deeply connected to Tracy/Daphne..... but that's not what I'm looking for. I don't mind if its during Hogwarts but again, I am looking for post Hogwarts preferably. Finally.....

I also realize this may be asking a lot and perhaps there are no good plot stories with such a relationship... just smut. But had to ask... Thanks ahead of time.

This is the only one I can think off that includes all 3 that doesn't also include 20 others, although it's not exactly a complex read ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  After the fall of Voldemort, some people could deal with what they had to do in the War, others could not. Harry had pretty much left Wizarding Britain, thought not magic. Having a quiet drink in a pub, someone from his past re-enters his life HP/TD/DG

*** I am honestly somewhat perplexed this thread is this dead. I knew it was asking a lot but are there literally ZERO fan fics of the sort (not accounting for smutfics)? I figured it would be a stretch to find a good one, but with how Tracy is usually written as Daphne's best friend in fan fiction, I figured there would be something, even if it wasn't what I was looking for outside the pairing.

Color me surprised.

And yea ive been reading a ton of Harry/Daphne lately... this one included.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
