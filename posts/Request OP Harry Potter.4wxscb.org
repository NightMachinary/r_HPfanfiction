Hey all, I am looking for OP Harry Potter stories. Its mainly so I have something to occupy my time during my trip on Thursday, so they dont have to be great, they dont have to be perfect, but I do want them to be enjoyable. I would really really like them to be over 100k and complete.

Thanks.


** Linkffn(Wastelands of Time) may be the best OP Harry fic ever written.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

*** Second this! It's a really good read. Joe6991's work is generally pretty good. I enjoyed reading this one and his other series, the Sword of the Hero trilogy.
