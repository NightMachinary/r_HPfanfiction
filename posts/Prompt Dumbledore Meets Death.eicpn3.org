After his death, Good!Dumbledore meets with the personification of Death, is lambasted for not manipulating Harry enough and told that the entire world is doomed to ruin on the current path. He is sent back in time to the beginning of 1980 to redo it. This repeats until we get Fanon Manipulative!Dumbledore where all of his canon actions are done with the worst possible intentions, and Dumbledore hates himself every step of the way. Yes he put compulsions on the Dursley's to mistreat Harry and did it with tears in his eyes. Set Hermione up to die with a troll, gave Harry a love potion keyed to Ginny, and set Sirius up to die so that Harry would lose another parent figure, all of that horribleness that comes from Dumbledore bashing. But death literally made home so it. He can even have a few run throughs where he gives Harry a really great life to soothe his conscience. He sees this Harry when the little eleven year old asks him what is in the Mirror or Erised.


** Ooh, I like this! I definitely feel a take on a Manipulative!Dumbledore can be done well if he's given a motivation like this to do it, and/or he's written as actually competent.

** Damn, I like this. By the end of it all, ole Dumbles even lost his taste for lemon drops.

*** The moment he sucks a lemon drop and hates it is the moment you know he has lost his soul.
