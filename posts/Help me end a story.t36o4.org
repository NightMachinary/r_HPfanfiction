I started writing a story with a friend of mine in school. Never finished the last chapter and i always thought it should be finished one day.

But kinda lost track of where i wanted to go with the story.. Anyone got any ideas for the last chapter? Would love some feedback and inspiration to finish it :)

Enjoy

** The question is, how do you want it to end?
