I was reading The Well Groomed Mind, and chapter 18 just has Neville casually pull a knife out of his pocket, like it's a normal thing, and nobody comments

I want more Neville with a knife

I doubt Neville, or any other canon student, could do much if Dumbledore or any other competent teacher was present, but I'm sure students could be badly hurt or killed before the attacker was subdued.

*** Well yes, you just have to be better at it than the others. Of course, that's difficult with Dumbledore, but he is away from school frequently enough.

Alternatively, arrange it that enough people will defend you for it to devolve into a free-for-all massacre. Maybe slip some kind of insanity potion into everyone's drink, or imperio a few people to start a deathly fight which you can then exploit.
