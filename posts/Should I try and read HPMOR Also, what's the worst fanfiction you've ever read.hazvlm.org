***** I had to give up on like the fifth chapter, where Harry leads Hermione to the girl's dormitory and kisses her hand but doesn't lead her in because he didn't want to cause a scene. I also happen to be a girl, and all the "oh well women are only good for housekeeping and stuff" was getting really annoying. Ginny would be rolling in her coffin. Yes, she isn't dead, but she would be, after reading the first few paragraphs.

** For HPMOR, the spelling and editing are competent. The plot is decently thought out, with a few unique twists on lore. Unfortunately, the author hasn't done much research on canon lore to the point where so many characters act out of character. The overall story plot is decent, but the characters, especially their emotions, are not done well. You can tell that it's a propaganda piece to get you to think about the philosophy of ‘methods of rationality'. The philosophy comes first, and the philosophy gets plot armor. Although considering how much plot armor canon Harry's power of love had, that's not so bad.

Overall, HPMOR was enjoyable on my first readthrough. The second time around, I had a decent first half before I found the philosophizing to be unbearable.

The worst harry potter fanfiction I've read is forgettable, bad, smut. If you can get through My Immortal and Higwarts School of Prayer and Miracles, try out Harry Potter Becomes a Communist.

  /Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

  PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

  HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics./ And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

  HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

  DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

  PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

  DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

  DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

Looking back, this shows one of the major weaknesses of the fic; the idea that everyone but the main protagonists are imbecilic dunderheads. The author sees a potential plot hole or inconsistency and rather than going "there must be a reasonable explanation for this", he goes "cleary they're all morons, my protagonist is smarter than that".

***** I don't think we're reading this passage in the same way at all. What I got from it is that for all his precociousness, Harry is still an impulsive, immature child who applies unreasonable standards to the rest of the world. Which is borne out through the rest of the story; Harry wins a lot of respect for his intelligence, even contributes something to magical research by bringing a scientific perspective, but nearly drives Hermione away through his insensitivity and bull-headedness, and comes perilously close to either putting Voldemort in position to take over the world, or destroying the planet outright by accident. Because he's smart but foolish; he's still a mere child. Biting a primary school teacher because she wasn't prepared to teach at a high school level is one symptom of that.

******* Do you remember the first mock battle? He and Draco dismissed Hermione's chances and focused on taking each other down. But unlike them, Hermione had appointed lesser commanders and delegated responsibility to them, and together they conceived and executed a plan to play dead until Harry and Draco's armies had weakened each other, then overrun them.

Or his first real foray into magical research, where he set out to overturn foundational assumptions about spellcasting, and it turned out that the authors of their textbooks actually knew more about the subject than a precocious eleven-year-old's guesses, and his assumption that wizards had just never properly tested their theories turned out to be ill-founded. He did /eventually/, with a lot more work, manage something truly innovative, although it wasn't quite as revolutionary as his first ambitions.

Even in such a small thing as his desire to be rid of the Golden Snitch, which he viewed as a game-wrecker and just a way for the Seeker to show off; when groups of people started to seriously discuss the subject, they came up with good ideas that didn't necessarily include abolishing it altogether like he wanted.

And after all their clashes and disagreements about morality vs pragmatism and properly weighting evidence and so on, it turned out that Dumbledore was actually acting on the advice of many prophecies, allowing him to steer events in a way that Harry couldn't have anticipated, and it was just as well, because left to his own devices, Harry in his delusions of rationality would have accidentally handed the world to Voldemort on a platter, if he didn't turn it into a large strangelet first.

It has flaws of course, and it's not the perfect story many people state it to be. I love it for what it is, and that's the important thing.

There's a podcast of HPMOR, if that's better for you. It's awsome quality with great voice actings. And there's a currently ongoing discussion podcast called We Want Methods of Rationality, that follows along with it chapter by chapter.

Both can be found on [[https://hpmorpodcast.com][hpmorpodcast.com]] and on many streaming services like Spotify.

** I do recommend that you try to read it - and like TauLupis, I'd suggest starting with DaystarEld's expanded introduction - but that doesn't guarantee that you'll like it. It's just that it gets mentioned often enough that it's worth making up your own mind. If you dislike it by chapter 10, you probably won't enjoy the rest, and then you can see people recommending it and shrug your shoulders.

(Personally, I enjoy it, and objectively it has a lot to recommend it: it's long, complex, complete, with very few typos, only mild coarse language, plenty of humour, and every character has both strengths and flaws. But a lot of people find Harry simply unlikeable, and the author tracts tend to turn off those who aren't interested in the philosophy it's peddling.)

Worst I've ever read...meh, hard to say, because I don't tend to read far into stories that I dislike, and they don't end up bookmarked. From the current top ten on fanfiction.net, I did find "To Shape and Change" quite mediocre - but not worse than the average, I just wouldn't have put it in the top ten. Harry Crow gets a lot of flak, but it's in the "didn't read far enough to really judge it for myself" category; maybe at some point I'll read it all just so I can judge it and be a judgier person.
