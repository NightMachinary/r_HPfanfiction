** I would recommend anything by saras_girl if you're okay with Harry/Draco. I'm a particular fan of linkao3(Turn by saras girl). I also really love linkao3(Azoth by zeitgeistic).

I don't know your thoughts on femslash- I can recommend a few if you're interested but it's unfortunately WAY less popular than m/m. :/

AO3 has more slash than ffn so could also be a good place just to browse around!

Edit: i don't know why the underscores aren't showing up properly. It's saras underscore girl for reference.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  "Mother's fulfilled her promise at last," Tom Riddle said, grinning widely as he struggled to get onto his feet. The blood pouring down over his broken nose and dripping over his teeth made his smile significantly more sinister than it would have otherwise been. "Does it hurt?" "What, falling five-hundred feet from the sky?" Harry started, with a voice as sweet as burnt sugar. His broom was smoking in a pile next to him. "Why don't you try it and then come back and tell me?" he said, flat-toned, and then - "Gosh, why aren't you dead, I landed on you from five-hundred feet!"

** I love slash and read a ton of it. I don't read much fem slash, so I can't give many recs for that, but here's [[http://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bcategory_ids%5D%5B%5D=23&bookmark_search%5Bfreeform_ids%5D%5B%5D=624795&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&user_id=katelawyer86][a link to a list of my all time favorite slash fics]].

If you haven't read any slash before and just want to dip a toe in, I'd recommend a wolfstar fic. [[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/3156196.html][It Was Only a Kiss]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] are great places to start! FWIW, It was only a kiss is the more graphic of the two.

My biggest piece of advice though is to read only slash fics that are recommended until you've exhausted them or at least tried a dozen or so because a lot of slash that you'll find when just browsing sucks, and I'd hate for you to get the unfair impression that all slash is bad just from those fics.

Also, take recs for slash from people whose opinions on het and gen fics you agree with. The fandom is large and I see lots of people reccing Drarry fics on this sub for example that I couldn't even finish because they were so bad. So even though something is recommended, it still might be shit.

Happy reading!

** in my opinion, linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) is the best slash fic I've read in the HP fandom, it's Harry/Sirius but there's no age difference because of time travel shenanigans. It's an AU seventh year fic and it's really well written, with a good plot and really nicely written characters, and also complete which is always a plus!

** I haven't found many amazing slash fics in the Harry Potter fandom. That said, I do like Tira Nog's [[http://tiranog.southroad.com/harry_potter/A_Nick_In_Time.htm][A Nick in Time]] and the sequel [[http://tiranog.southroad.com/harry_potter/Growing_Pains.htm][Growing Pains]]. I think the first story is better than the sequel though, and the first story really doesn't involve any slash. The premise is basically that the Golden Trio are all adults and are teaching at Hogwarts. Severus and Harry end up getting turned into kids without a memory of their former adult selves, due to some of Dumbledore's magic beyond the grave. Hermione and Ron raise them while trying to find a way to turn them back into adults. The sequel takes place after they become adults again.
