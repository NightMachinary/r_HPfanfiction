So I remember Harry went dark and ended up getting sealed away for a very long time until finally being unsealed on a spaceship. He takes over a bunch of pirates, I believe. Also fairly sure it wasn't on any conventional fanfiction sights, like ffn, ao3, ect. It might have even been a deleted copy that someone saved, I have no idea.

Kind of vague, but I'm hoping you all can help me.


** Your referring to RahXephon's The Star Empire which was taken down a while back. I have yet to find another copy of it.

** I love this fic. It's honestly reasonably well written and I like the progression and the gaining of strength. It's an interesting universe, unique to say the least. If you ever find a story similar to it please send it my way. It's a shame it was abandoned, as I wanted to see where he was heading with it.

** Although you've already found the fic you're looking for, your description is quite a good match for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][Browncoat, Green Eyes]], linkffn(2857962). (It is a Firefly crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Firefly to enjoy it.)
