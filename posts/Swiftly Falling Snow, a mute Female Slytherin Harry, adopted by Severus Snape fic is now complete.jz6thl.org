When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

81,064 words in 15 chapters. Beta read. The first book is complete and posted. The second book is complete and I will start posting on Saturday (I update every Saturday). Book three is 2/3rds of the way done.

** Just finished this, I thought it was great! I admit I have some reservations around Snape adoption fics, as I don't look kindly towards canon Snape around children. However, I enjoyed your interpretation of him in your story, he seemed in character yet better than his canon self. Pleasantly surprised that this fic finished only days ago, that's something I don't see every day! I'm looking forward to the next one, I've found myself invested in Rachel's story.

*** Thank you so much! I would definitely have reservations around canon Snape adopting children as he's quite harsh. I'm glad he still seemed in character to you. And yes, I just finished posting this on Saturday, so I'm excited to see the reception it receives. I'm very pleased that you're looking forward to the next one! Thanks again!

** Does it explain why her name is Rachel Snow and not something Potter?

*** It doesn't in the story because in the story James' name is Snow as well. Two things contributed to the new name. The first is that Rachel was originally an OC, but I discovered she was holding the same narrative purpose as Harry in the story so I did some merging. The second reason is that Snow is the last name of a teacher who saved my life while I was in school. She passed on, but I like to keep small pieces of her with me. I like to think that she would be engaged with what I write and would appreciate the tribute.

I hope this helps!

** I enjoyed this! It was very well written. Would love to see a bit more of the abrasive/sneering side of Snape (not to Rachel but to others). I felt you dealt with difficult topics sensitively and didn't unrealistically 'cure' Rachel but showed a gradual process of change. Will defo be checking back for updates to part 2 :)

*** Thank you very much. I definitely toned down Snape's responses in this because I wanted him to be slightly abrasive (enough so that he scared Neville a bit) but not so much so that he's Neville's boggart. Thanks for letting me know what you thought!
