So, not the time traveler(s) but other people's around them. Say Harry/Ron/Hermione end up in the past, and the outside looking into why the heck they're acting so different.

Or with Malfoy, or Snape or whoever it is gets transported back.

If pairings Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc, doesn't have to focus on pairings.


** and I Looked Back on a Broken World: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24339502/chapters/58688299]] It has a mix of the time travelers' perspectives and the Marauders' perspectives

These ones, too, if you don't mind one shots: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1396888]]

  Terrible things happen when wizards meddle with time, Miss Granger. Particularly to those caught in their way.

** Let's try this again: linkao3(26232913) Harry's prospective on a Hermione who came back. The plot doesn't explicitly states so, but it's quite evident.

Not exactly what you are looking for, I know, but it does show someone from the outside trying to piece together the mystery of the time-traveler.

Quite an unusual pairing, I'll admit, a Hermione/James Potter fic. It starts with his perspective of things and shows flashbacks of how he fell in love with her.

  Who wouldn't be stunned speechless when your practically flawless girlfriend of several years randomly says ' oh love, I come from twenty years in future; by the way, would you like a slice of lemon in your tea? ' - Even for wizards, time travel is farfetched, right? Wrong. JamesHermione.

** I'm enjoying this silly tale of catty teenagers:

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13250357/1/]])

It's updated regularly, unlike my fic, which isn't abandoned, but I'm working on slowly recently:

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
