** The problem with Obscurial Harry is that to be one, he /has/ to be /terrified/ of his magic. Given his life circumstances, that means he'd have to be aware of it and the Dursleys aware that he's aware, and then do everything in their power to beat the magic out of him and /make him hate his own magic./ That last bit is the most critical, and is the reason why canon!Harry /didn't/ become one.

The very idea of going to Hogwarts would probably really mess with Obscurial!Harry's head. It'd be an interesting story, but it wouldn't be anything like what you want if it played out logically.

Also, most obscurial kids die very young. The implication is that their obscurial (a magical parasite) consumes their life/magic, with only the absolute strongest wizards surviving much longer. I'd imagine Harry, in this situation, if he survived, would have piss-poor control and an inability to do anything except release and direct his inner demon.

*** That's very true. But in the realm of fanfiction, and more recent "FB2" trailer we see him again trying to control the obscural. Those plot points of course would be during his years at hogwarts not on his first one.

Have you read "Eternal Love" by FluppyGoo
