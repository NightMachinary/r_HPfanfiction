** Multi could also apply to relationships that /aren't/ harems, like Harry and Ginny date for a bit, but it doesn't work out, and Harry gives Cho Chang another shot, but again it just doesn't work out between them(they disagreed on Marietta), so he ends up dating Greengrass(which ends because Ron was a git).

*** So if the pairing is like [Harry, Fluer, Susan, Daphne] does that mean he dates each of them and ends up with the last one (generally)?

**** Probably not. That's probably Harry Harem.

Something where he dates them in succession would have [Harry, Fleur], [Harry, Susan], [Harry, Daphne]. The tagging [Harry, Fleur, Susan Daphne] implies they're all in a relationship together.

Although I suppose that could also be down to FFN's /very/ limited tagging system.

**** Sequential on screen dating especially with more than one ex is really, really rare in fiction. If there is a lesson you want to teach a character or something else you want to show the audience one failing relationship and break up is typically enough. Words are a limited resource in a story and you have to decide where to spend them.

Given that, I would never bet that [Harry, Fluer, Susan, Daphne] means a series of three relationships. That's never mind convention, where everyone in the square brackets are in the same relationship.

** They're used interchangeably, but personally, I would lean towards harem being a larger group than "multi"
