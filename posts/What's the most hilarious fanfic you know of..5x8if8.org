Somewhat self explanatory. What makes you giggle?


** Other than Seventh Horcrux I find: Harry the Hufflepuff, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=482496&i=1][Slytherin Career Day]], Six Years, Six Applicants, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/830080][Registration]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6894757][THERMOS!]], The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake, Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]] and 'The Horror! The Horror!' all to be quite funny. Also 'Harry Potter and the Natural 20' is very funny but not purely focused on humour.

** I think linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday...) is the strongest humour fic in the fandom.

And not just because it is hilarious. The humour is well-crafted and consistent throughout, which I think a lot of humour fics fail to do. The jokes are almost Rowling-esque -- they feel whimsical, not bawdy or malicious.

linkffn(4810036)

Also pretty good linkffn(The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort)

I'll be surprised if you haven't read it, but just in case. linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)

linkffn(When In Doubt, Obliviate)

I haven't read those last two in quite a while, but I'm pretty sure they hold up still.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter the Dragon]]: At age 8 Harry turns into a dragon. Followed by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12069854/1/Sort-the-Dragon][Sort the Dragon]] (written by a different author)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game][Harry Potter and the Game]] is one of those Gamer fics. Before you go oh god why do people keep reccing that shit I'd like to say that this is a /good/ fic. It's not a crack fic but doesn't take itself very seriously most of the time either. It's got easily the funniest Lockhart scenes I've ever read and canon events are wonderfully derailed by the end of second year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, Is that a Baby?]] is amazing. Harry is raised by a group of extremely powerful violent terrorists/mercenaries. Some knowlege of Naruto is helpful but not all that necessary given that the fic mostly stays on the wizarding side of things.

Not a Harry Potter fic but if you know a bit about Naruto I recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies.]] It's absolutely fantastic. My second or third favorite fic ever.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is great dark humor. You definitely want to read the "Bailout" chapter.

I think the second half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is quite hilarious. Such drastic change in tone compared to the first half definitely upset many readers, but many more, including me, seem to enjoy it. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483), continues in the same tone, but is unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] wrote many hilarious one-shots, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], linkffn(3793741), is probably his best.

** Somehow still not mentioned: linkffn(Make a Wish; The Hunt for Harry Potter) - the classic hyper-lucky Harry.\\
Also somehow not mentioned, and probably even hilariouser: linkffn(Double Time Trouble by Skysaber).

Not going to bother finding it again, and not linkable by the bot: A Series of Crazy Random Happenstances (HP/Smallville fusion).

There are a few other classics I find very funny, but can't think of any specifically.

  Harry Potter has the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's deserving of some enjoyment, isn't he? Well, he thinks so, and he intends to act on it. The strange gifts he has, and isn't going to question, should help in that regard.This is a story in which Harry has sex with just about everyone. Any necessary warnings will be at the top of each chapter, and a little summary will be there as well if you're reading this for the meagre plot included (There's no discernible reason you would be, it's first and foremost smut) and don't want to read that particular chapter.The background story will basically follow the books, and won't bother restating everything that happens. There might be included a very basic recap just as a reminder in the notes, though.Can't promise especially quick updates, it'll depend on how often the mood strikes me.
