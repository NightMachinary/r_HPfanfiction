I read Beyond This Place of Wrath and Tears by Talriga. It was a very good fanfic. I love the ideas of Severus Snape time travel from the future, met his past self and 'merged' with him. His appearance changed, his magic was more powerful and chaotic (?), also Hogwarts talked to him and helped him.

Sadly, it was last updated in 2007 and the author hasn't made any updates since then.

So, is there any fic like that? 1. Snape time travel to the past 2. Merged with his past self (causing his magic to be more powerful) 3. No slash
