*HEAR ME OUT*! Ok, Umbridge was one of, if not the, most irritating character in the whole series, I hated her more than Voldemort. There are certain villains that we love to hate (ex.: Thanos) and then there are characters like Umbridge that are simply unlovable in all levels. So you must understand how painful it is to admit that she may not have been completely wrong.

Even ignoring all the life-hazards in Hogwarts by assuming that it actually /was/ a sequence of unpredictable happenstances that the faculty had to react to and giving /all/ professors the benefit of the doubt by assuming that they were actually able to teach their subjects (Snape still had a NEWT class even with his high standards , Binns is described only as being boring the incompetence thing is fandom, Trewlaney plus some students actually do correct predictions relatively often and we barely hear anything at all about muggle studies to be able to ascertain one way or another) the fact remains that it is above all a school, not -as many stories make it sound- a sovereign nation with teachers and the headmaster able to make decisions about the students life's even out of school (Dumbledore never did anything more about Harry's summer accommodations than advising him and setting up a informal protection detail) and thus should be held up to the standards set by the ruling government.

Now, the year before a student had died in mysterious circumstances during an international tournament mostly organized by said school. During the same time-period one government official was found dead in dubious conditions while a retired auror was found to have been held captive and being impersonated for a whole year by a presumed dead war criminal. The previous year a known fugitive had been sighted multiple times in the same school (some of this sightings were pretty violent in fact) and after being caught was set free using unexplained means by an unknown party right behind the minister's nose. And in the year /before/ that multiple students were attacked during the school year, some losing most of the year because of it. Last but not least in the year /before/ that a professor died in mysterious circumstances. This combined forms a pattern of escalation that would raise red-flags in any serious government, frankly sending a trusted government official to make a subtle investigation over the school would be one of the mildest reasonable responses, by all means there should be a much more intrusive investigation over Hogwarts after all this instances.


** i never understand fanfics that try to normalise magic. the school should have been more wacky.

You can still have randomness happen due to magic and Voldemort's evil plots, if anything those should become more central story points.

*** I actually do agree with all your points, while I do greatly enjoy stories that includes other countries the whole Britain=Hell while /literally-anywhere-else/=heaven trope grew old pretty fast. My point was that the Ministry, as the government that rules over the nation and subsequently Hogwarts, actually have the right and reasons to interfere over it.

Yeah, the ministry wasn't any bastion of competence, the amount of corruption was upped to something cartoonish, but it is still the government chosen by the people to protect the people and Hogwarts had in mere 4 years seen at least three accounts of successful murder, a year-long serie of attacks of racist motivations in the student-body, a member of the staff and notorious celebrity was sent permanently to the hospital with all his memories erased, a escaped convicted not only invaded the school multiple times having on one occasion gotten to the dormitory of some of the students and held a knife over one of them, the same escaped convicted was then rescued by a non-disclosed third party and escaped again, a guest from a school on other country and a student of Hogwarts were both put under the cruciatos curse while a guest from another was put under the imperius, /another/ escaped convicted -this one believed dead- showed up there, a student was kidnapped during an international event... and this are only the ones that there is no way of the government not knowing and even then only considered superficially, besides it there is the best of man eater spiders in the forest, the fact that the being doing the attacking was a giant and super-poisonous snake with death-ray stare, an underage student being possessed by a forbidden item, the troll attack, the attack on the unicorns, all of Quirrel's murder attempts, Lockhart tries at obliviating, Lupin's accidental murder attempt, Barty Crouch Jr's deliberate attempt at murder... this is grounds enough for /any/ government to take action inside it's borders.

** Hogwarts was a private boarding school not a public government school so they get a pass on somethings. The ministry forcing a teacher on the school was a gross over use of power given it required an executive order rather than a new law voted on by the people or in this case the wizengamot. At least that's how it appeared to me. Having an impartial liaison between the school and the ministry should have been a thing though. Though again finding someone trustworthy in the climate of that year in particular would have been an issue as it would have likely ended up as lucius malfoy or some other death eater.

** I disagree with your opinion, mainly because, despite the strange situation Hogwarts is in (being the only magic school in Britain, probably financialy supported by the government . . .), Hogwarts in a private school.

The only duty Hogwarts has concerning the Ministry is to maje sure it provide an adequate education to young witches and wizards, education which is assessed thanks to the OWLs and NEWTs (with ministry officials as examiner).

Now, I'll admit that the events of GoF should drag the attention of the Ministry, but even there, the only duty of the school should be to cooperate with the investigation. Which Hogwarts totally did by apprehending the man guilty for 2 of the things that happened (murder of Crouch Sr and abduction/ impersonating of Moody), a man who could also have revealed the culprit for the murder of Cedric. It is not the fault of Hogwarts if the investigation was botched, probably because the fucking Minister himself executed Crouch Jr before he could reveal anything, just because he refused to hear the truth.

So yeah, Hogwarts did everything they had to do, and the only reason why the situation /could/ have justified the intervention of the Ministry was because the Ministry fucked thing up in the first place.

​

PS: I also want to point that Hogwarts had a pretty good reason to not want any Ministry intervation, since the last Ministry interventions were far from helpful. The Minister sent an innocent man to Azkaban (the worst place in the magical world apparently), without any proof just because "/he needed to be seen doing something/". And the dementors sent to "protect the school" (for the same reasons) against Sirius Black ended up being more dangerous than the man himself.

*** Eh, guess it is mostly a divergence of opinions, though I would like to point out that it was actually never stated in the books (admittedly, it could be in some article in Pottermore) that Hogwarts is the /only/ school of magic in Britain, furthermore we also have no idea of how tuition is paid to say for certain if it is or not private (though I personally think it would be public if it /is/ actually the only one at UK and otherwise private).

About if ministerial intervention is or not warranted or legal is mostly a question of if Hogwarts is or not beholden to the government, the ministry -if it is the sovereign government that rules over Hogwarts- would probably have the right to launch an investigation over the school, though as it would probably intervene on it's normal activities doing it by the normal means would be unadvisable (even more so if it actually is the only school), so sending a single official of trust is, while not exactly smart -even more so considering just who is said official- an understandable choice.

**** Hogwarts is a pretty strange school. From one side, it has several characteristics that are clearly inspired from the British Private schools (the House system, the Governors . . .), but from the other, every magical child of Britain is invited to go there, and the only expense seem to be the school furniture, all of these characteristics are more like a public school. Though the "no tuition fees" part also brings the question of how does the school pay its functionment cost, mainly the teacher wages.

Concerning the existence, or not, of another British school. While it's never clearly stated that "Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain", it is implied. In DH, when Harry read in the /Prophet/ that Hogwarts became mandatory under Voldemort rule, he asked if there were children not going there. Ron told him that some were homeschooled (and even them seemed to be a minority), if another school exister, he would probably have mentioned it at that time.

Also, I'm not even sure if the presence of Umbridge was even legal or not. At first, the Ministry was only able to impose her presence as the "Defense Against the Dark Art" teacher, after Hogwarts was unable to find one on their own. Then, Fudge somehow passed a law than made her "High Inquisitor", and which gave her some power over the school. But I don't know if the position of "High Inquisitor" was created thanks to the Ministry influence over the school, or if Fudge used his influence on the school governor, who then accepted to create the position. Hell, at that point in the story, Fudge had already clearly abused his power several time so it could just be another example of that. But it's not my point.

When I said that the Ministry should not have any authority over the school, I meant this particular Ministry. Because while the situation may have warranted the presence of a representant of the Ministry, the situation was only that bad because of the incompetence of the Ministry, and the representant sent was not even there for the good reasons (she just wanted to look for Dumbledore flaws, harass Harry and have her power trip).\\
A competent Ministry would have been 100% right to send someone. But the situation would never have been that bad (they would have caught Crouch Jr, interviewed him and declared Voldemort return rather than thinking that Dumbledore is out to get a job he refused several times). Also, a competent Ministry could probably just have asked Dumbledore if they could send someone to look around and ask some questions, and he would have agreed.

***** In this we agree, my point was that in that situation the ruling government (government being used in general terms rather than referring to the one that rules any specific nation) would have the right to send someone to find out WTF is happening.

** Assuming Hogwarts is a private boarding school, private schools are wacky and have tons of free reign. They also can intersect (? is that the right word?) with public schools and still keep said free reign(ish). They don't even have to teach you stuff sometimes. Based off siblings&friends experience, I've never been to a private school.

** At my school, we had racists that had entire classes drop out that still teach. One teacher definitely subtly sexually harasses some students and had literotica bookmarked on his computer (along with a suspicious lack of other websites). A substitute teacher talked for months about how nonracist he was because he married “an oriental” and threatened to beat me up with a baseball bat because I aced an exam.

I basically went to school where Snape, Binns, and Trelawney (one teacher let everyone copy Wikipedia for As) taught. This is one of the best schools in my state. I'd have picked and loved the exciting magical danger of Hogwarts any day over my high school.

It's a story about magic, the school should be quirky!
