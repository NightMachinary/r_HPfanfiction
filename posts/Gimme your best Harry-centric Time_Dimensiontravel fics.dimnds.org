** linkffn(Too Far from Home by story2tell) is my favourite, no pairings, but A LOT of angst

linkao3(The Second String) is really good, slash pairing

linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth) is a oneshot masterpiece

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245967/LoveHP][LoveHP]] linkffn(2705927) Very good but also very dark, not for the faint hearted and absolutely more than earns its "M" rating.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/606422/serpant-sorcerer][serpant-sorcerer]] linkffn(1962685) Also very good and not as dark as Imprisoned Realm. It is complete and a great stand alone, there is an incomplete sequel as well.

EDIT: I also once read a story where Harry was transported to a world where his parents were alive. It was a Drarry fic, other-Harry had been a real jerk, and James was married to Regulus not Lily who had left and wasn't very involved. For the life of me I can't remember the name but I think it was AO3.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** One of my favorite time travel ff is a parody linkao3 (oh God not again!)

Another I like is Ron centric linkao3(sense of the soul) That one isn't complete.

Another fun time travel one is linkao3(wind shear) This one is a bit dif in that Harry doesn't travel back to his own past.

My absolute favorite dimension travel fic in linkffn(a black comedy by nonjon) It's hilarious and I love it so much. Another parody. He has another parody I like called linkffn(dimension hopping for beginners)

One that has both- also dark/grey!Harry is linkao3(stand against the moon) and it has a sequel. That author has some others that you might want to look at as well.

And then there is the one that I can't remember the name but is really good. Harry gets pulled into another world to defeat Voldemort but I think the order is kind of corrupt and Snape helps him? I'll try to find it.

Remind me! 1 week

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
