** Purely from the title that sounds like linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School), though I don't know for sure because I haven't read it.

*** I remember this fic, it was quite good iirc. Not a fight to survive type though, but a Hogwarts school of dueling.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

There is a fair amount of that in this story, maybe not so much its sequel though.

Now, this story is old, and quite AU. So AU in fact, it wouldn't be too far a stretch to proclaim it not really HP at all. Considering he changes his name and you barely see the original cast at all.

I personally find these stories a lot of fun to read every now and then, perhaps due to nostalgia. The writing isn't always going to be great and some parts do drag on for a bit too long.

I am not trying to dissuade you from reading them, just wanted to give you a fair warning that they may have not aged super gracefully. Also, hopefully to avoid people jumping up my ass every time I mention older stories.

Again, they are fun, but hardly masterpieces. Sadly unfinished as well.

*** Came here to suggest that exact fic,

I agree with you about not aging very well but it is super great to go back and read again.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
