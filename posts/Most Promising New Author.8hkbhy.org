What story are you currently reading that is the first published by a new author? What about it has you hooked?


** linkao3(From Ruin by GraeFoxx)

Features "Back in time" BAMF Harry, but with a twists:

- canon is heavily altered, his knowledge of the future isn't very useful;
- enemies and "friends" are powerful too;
- the chapters has good balance between character interactions (including politics) and action;
- active Flamels.
- "Back in time" Draco Malfoy as willing partner (not a friend, logically explained).

**** I don't see anything bad in that GraeFoxx uses "I'm still here" as foundation for his work. *All* fanfic authors use HP books in the same way. And while kathryn518 gave her approval I don't think any fanfic author made such request to Rowling :-)

May be "I'm still here" is a good work, but unfortunately it's abandoned: for about 3.5 years there're just 13 chapters and the last update was in January 2017.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

*** Thanks for your reply. I'm currently working on my first fic and I really want to see what other new authors are bringing to the table.
