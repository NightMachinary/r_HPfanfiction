Hey yall,

I've been working on a Harry/Daphne fanfiction for a while now and I'm getting ready to post it, which is very exciting. I've been having trouble deciding between potential summaries, so I thought I'd outsource to get more feedback. Let me know if which one of these (if any) you think is the best/most interesting. I've put them in order of which I like best to least. The story is written in first person and is 100% Daphne-centric.

Thanks so much!

  I'm going to move quickly now, I hope you're ready. My name is Daphne Greengrass. I'm one of only two people who saw Voldemort die, and I'm the only person who will recount those events truthfully. Tread lightly, this is no mere story. It's about a boy who blazed with fire and an empty girl trapped in ice. It's filled with broken glass, jagged edges, and men who fancied themselves as gods. If you're ready to hear it, I'll spin you a tale. I'll change your world. I'll show you something.

  This is the way the world ends. It starts with death, as a green flash illuminates the sky. It starts with betrayal, a child stolen in the stillness of night. It starts with secrets, scared whispers which bode of mistakes long forgotten. The light is fading. Victory isn't assured. Everything comes down to one choice, one decision. Hold fast, don't look back. The last great war has begun. A nonBWL!Harry story. HP/DG.

  Daphne Greengrass survived a living hell---once. Plagued with nightmares from her past, she finds solace in Harry Potter who is hiding a terrible secret of his own. As the war closes in around her, Daphne will stop at nothing to uncover the truth... even if it means working with Harry's brother, the BWL'd. HP/DG.

** Definitely three. There is a place for prose but that place is not in a summary, a summary should let the audience know in some detail what the book will be about. The first two don't do that, and the third barely makes the cut. To be fair, I thought the first two sounded good and epic, they just aren't suited to be summaries.

*** Yep. The first and second read more like intros to summaries, like what you'd find at the top of the back cover or inside of a dust jacket. (So something like 1&3 or 2&3, in those orders, might work.)

*** It alternates between third-person limited and first-person limited. I know that sounds bonkers but let me explain:

The story starts twenty years after canon would have ended, on the 20th anniversary of Voldemort's defeat. Connor Potter (the BWL'd) gives an interviewing in the Quibbler explaining, for the first time, how Voldemort died. During the celebration the following day in Diagon Alley, Connor is attacked by someone who claims he's a liar. That afternoon, Barnabus Cuffe receives a message from Daphne, who everyone thought had died in the final battle, saying that she would give the prophet the "real story" of how Voldemort died, but that she would only tell it to one person: Connor's son, Charles.

In this way, the vast majority of the story (90%) consists of Daphne telling her story of Charles which is in 1st person because she's the one telling it, while there is a "B-plot" of everyone in present-day (a) struggling to deal with the fallout of Daphne's revelations, (b) attempting to figure out why she's only revealing herself now, and (c) trying to determine what her actual endgame is.

The cool thing about this device is that both stories become narrative frames for each other. as more of the story is told by daphne, /we/ (the audience) understand more about the relationships happening in the present as /they/ (the characters in 2018) are able to better surmise what daphne's motivations are because they're learning about what happened to her in the past.

**** Now THIS description made me want to read it. Could you post a link?

Maybe write something that shows it's an interview fic? Excuse my writing abilities (usually they're bad, but now I'm sick and can't English):

"Charles, the son of Connor the-boy-who-lived Potter, sat in front of (however you want to refer to Daphne), she sipped her tea and started talking: (some badass sentence you used earlier, I think one from the first option would fit best)."

I think that your best feature is the fact that it's an interview and a wbwl discovery at such a late date, I usually skip most wbwl description (and fics, unless recommended) so hinting that the wbwl actually won and kept the title for more than 20 years? HELL YES.

But seriously, can you post a link?

Edit: or tell me in how long should I ask the bot to remind me...

**** First of all my vote: I would not read story with summary no.1, I would consider to read story no.2 and I would for sure read no.3.

But even better is the summary what you wrote above: Story starts 20 years after Voldy death; Conor is BWL and shares for the first tome how he won, next day he is attacked; suddenly DG (who is supposed to be dead) contacts the Prophet and promise real story about what happened. + the info about 2 plot lines and how they connect together.

Now I want to really really read it :) post a link, will you?

**** Question. How do you handle exposition? I'm writing something in 1st person exclusively, and while fun, it's a bit hard to do exposition without extremely long dialogues. I've tried to work it into the descriptions and such, but I'm afraid that it's too vague or sparse for good worldbuilding, but I can't do more or it'll become too exposition-heavy.

so, how do?

***** I don't claim to be a particularly amazing writer---but here's my two cents on your questions.

Regarding exposition. If you're talking about fanfiction, I think the audience (your readers) need a lot less information than you /think/ they do. Fanfiction is weird because there's so much meta-information out there. When we see a Slytherin!Harry fanfic, we assume that it will include things like politics/dark!harry/dumbledore!bashing/perhaps-WBWL/perhaps-abuse, and we subsequently make the decision to read it based on our assumption of what the story will contain. While this is an absurd way to consume art, it's nevertheless what /most/ people, myself included, use as a filtering mechanism.

As a writer, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking we need to spend a lot of time in the front end of the story proving to the reader that this story is different from the other 800k stories already published on the site. That's slightly preposterous also because it assumes (1) a lack of faith in the premise of your story, and (2) that the meta-judgements your readers are making aren't actually taking place. This all boils down to the fact that your reader will (probably) already know most of the exposition of the story based solely on the premise that /they've read fanfiction before/. Exposit what your character needs to know, not what you think the reader needs to know. Chances are high that your exposition will be overly long if you spend time explaining things your MC---and people living in the world---would already know.

1st Person POV. I really like this viewpoint for stories that are focused on how a character grows into the world (as opposed to stories where a world makes the character grow into them - almost all travelogue tales). My story, for example, is all about how Daphne grows from being complicit in the Dark's agenda (racism, hatred, oppression, etc) to being courageous enough to take a stand against it and the subsequent fallout(s) which occur from those actions. Everything that happens is relative to /her/ understanding of it. These give you a lot of tools you can play with, such as having an unreliable narrator, or having a narrator who believes things which aren't true--thus infecting her objective view of what the narrative actually is.

That's my two cents. I hope this helps!

****** Thank you for the advice. Although I don't write fanfiction (Mine is an original story) it's still useful. I've reread the critical draft for the next chapter (which was concerning me) with it in mind and it's not as bad as I assumed.

Thank you for the reality check.
