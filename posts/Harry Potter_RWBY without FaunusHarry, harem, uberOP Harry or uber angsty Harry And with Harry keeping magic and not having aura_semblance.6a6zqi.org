Basically I want to know if there are any good HP/RWBY without the way overdone tropes.

Bashing and dark!characters and slash are okay. Please no harems, genderbending, romance/Amir-centric plot, mpreg or pottercest. Thanks!


** linkffn(12292532) Return of Magic is a decent crossover, though I would say he qualifies as at least a little overpowered in it (Mind you, my scale of power has been warped by reading so many trash fics)

General premise is Harry Potter ends up in Remnant, meets Winter on a secret mission, and they team up. It's set during Volume 4, so if you want to avoid spoilers from before that, I would give it a skip

*** This is my fic! First time any of my work has ever been recommended on this sub by someone before! :D

Oh and like the person said, it's Harry/Winter (but I wouldn't call it romance centric), no harems, no genderbending, etc...

He does keep his magic and I'll admit is a bit OP. He also does eventually get aura but it won't have that big affect on the story and there are no plans for a semblance at this time.

I'm actually just working on finishing up the next chapter now so I should be updating soon I hope.

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?
