I'm looking for fics where Lord Potter (or any other kind of House he has headship of) is a legitimate political position that he has to take very seriously.

Mostly looking for writers exploring magical politics AND for Harry (whether wholeheartedly or reluctantly) having to take his "position" very seriously.


** Damn, I'd love a Downton Abbey-ish story, where he's a distant cousin of a heir-less Lord and needs to learn about managing estates, having political responsibilities and taking care of the community... but I've never seen anything like it :(

****** I was feeling down so your enthusiasm cheered me up, so it being contagious is a very positive thing, I would say.

*** Does downtown Abbey have a lot of political maneuvering and such? Would you recommend it?

**** Well, now that I think about it, Downton is much more character-focused than political... political and social maneuvering do happen, but sometimes only in the background or to show how they affect a certain character. Part of it is, I think, because it's historical but not meant to teach history, just show how that moment in history was for that social class. It must be more awesome to watch while already knowing in-depth about the social and political reforms happening in that time period.

That being said, I do recommend it. It's a great series, with great characters.

It's Drarry and more from draco POV, but it had an interesting take on the duty of being from an ancient house and how that developed. Kind of unexpected theory for magic as well.
