This is probably something that has been requested before, but what is your favorite story that, if it ever has been recommended here, is recommended rarely. I'm especially looking for stories that you think are underrated, or passed over for an unfair reason.

** !linkao3(A Station South of Canon)

This is an absolutely hilarious melting pot AU. Harry is an actual Horcrux and is therefore borderline indestructible, Hermione is deaf and developed legilimency abilities, Draco is barely capable of using magic and tends to use non-magical weapons to compensate, and Ron is childhood friends with Luna, and has all the strangeness that would bring.

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.

** This might be abandoned at this point but I love the idea: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12950436/1/Say-My-Name]]

I hope maybe people will find it and bring it back to life. The basic premise is that Hermione lives with Teddy (whom she's adopted as teenager) in the Muggle world and she's a Doctor working in research. She apparently obliviated herself in order to protect Teddy in the Muggle world.
