It's seems like 90% of Fanfaction writer's make Hermione parents names Dan and Emma. Why? I know that in canon, J.K doesn't give them names. So why are Emma and Dan use the modt


** It started in a handful of popular fics, predominantly Harry/Hermione and is - as I recall - a reference to Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson.

As fandom is wont to do, other people started using it, osmosis happened until a decent proportion of fics were using them and more recently at least there's been pushback and people using other names.

*** And a lot of people I guess use them (me included) just because they don't care about names and Dan and Emma are as good as anything else.

*** Sadly, when I named the Grangers in my fic, I found the Dan/Emma names that were used in a lot of fics, and decided to use them, but hadn't made the connection to the actors until a reader pointed it out. I would have gone with other names if I had made the connection... because it is just a little creepy.

** I started using Dan and Emma when I started writing HP fics actually thinking that those were the canon names for the Grangers... A bad case of Fanon supplanting Canon, I guess.

Once I figured out that the mere Muggles didn't rate a name from JKR, I started giving the Grangers different names in every story.

I've got a crack fic in the planning stage where they get a different name every time they speak, just to see what kind of reaction I get.

*** It's possible that Helen is favored because Hermione is the name of Helen of Troy's daughter. Not sure about Richard.

**** Nope, just looked it up Hermione's father was played first by Tom Knight in CoS then replaced by Ian Kelly in DH. While Hermione's mother was played by Heather Blasdale in CoS and replaced by Michelle Fairley in DH.

Would have been my first guess to though.

** *Emma* Watson and *Daniel* Redcliffe. That's why the names are so common. What I don't really understand is why this subreddit loathes it so much. I haven't seen any fic that implies they are actually the irl actors, it's just a nice little easter egg. I always see them shown as dentists, occasionally also being well versed in law or having a military background if the plot demands it. Never once saw them shown as actors.
