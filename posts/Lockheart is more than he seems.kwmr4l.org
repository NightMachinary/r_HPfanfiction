I'm looking for fics where Lockheart is more than an idiot. He doesn't have to be particularly clever or a particularly powerful wizard (though I'll take those fics too), just anything where he isn't portrayed as completely one dimensional and has some good qualities.

In both "Oh god not again" and "When in doubt Obliviate" he isn't a powerful wizard at all but he's aware of this and still smart enough to use what he has. In "oh god not again" he goes along with Harry's schemes and in "When in doubt Obliviate" he is a loving parental figure to Harry despite still only knowing one spell.

In Amalgum-Lockheart's folly, a Harry do over fic in which Harry is sent back and merges with Lockheart creating someone with Harry's memories and brains and Lockheart's ego and hunger for fame, he is written in an interesting way (could do without some of the Ron bashing though).

I'll take crack or seriously written fics (though I appreciate the request lends itself to crack fics more). Don't care about pairings or lack of pairings but please if it has pairings don't ship Lockheart with a kid.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply.

** I'd suggest The Prince of Slytherin.

Link on AO3 (if I use the bot it gives the summary of part 3 for some reason) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027]]\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/]])

But uh, a few things to note about this fic:\\
* I hate the prologue. If it's turning you off the fic, skip it and see if you like the next chapter more - I certainly did.\\
* This fic is meant to be a subversion of WBWL tropes, so it has to use those tropes to some extent.\\
* Yes, James and Jim suck at first. They get better.\\
* I personally think the story really picks up in book two. I liked the first part enough to get through it, but the later parts are some of my favorite bits of any fic I've read.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
