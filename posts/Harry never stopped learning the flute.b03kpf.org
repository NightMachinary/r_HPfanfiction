*** I'm terrible at writing (and I have no idea how to write bad English), but:

"Mister Hagrid! We have discussed it countless of times! YOU need to stay in bed, while these- these MONSTERS need to stay out of the hospital!" shouted the healer, his light green robes full of dirt.

"Din't ya be angry, healer Greengrass. H'is just playing, 'e means no harm. Jus' a baby, really" Said the ancient (half) giant, coughing,while the muddy krup hid behind him.

Harry smiled. With the white beard, bald head and wrinkles within wrinkles the man in bed looked the polar opposite of the man that took Harry from the Dursleys. However, in everything that mattered, Hagrid was still the same.

"Hello! 'Arry, I din't see ya there!" Hagrid beamed at him, stifling another coughing fit.

"Make sure that he rests, Mr Potter" said the healer and with a flick of his wand made the dirt and mud disappear. "And you," he huffed towards Hagrid, "take your potions, I'll be back in an hour with the next dose. "

"Tha' healer gal of Luna appreciates them animals much more", whispered Hagrid to Harry before starting to cough. Harry quickly passed him his potions, and Hagrid drank them in one big gulp with a grimace. "How've ya been?" he asked, and they soon entered their daily routine. Harry told him that Al was about to become a grandfather, and of the trouble that James' children get to in school. Hagrid was reminiscing about the old days and telling of similar pranks committed by other infamous pranksters. By the time healer Greengrass returned, they were both with tears of laughter in their eyes.

"Ya need to tell James tha' 'e deserves evrything his kids put 'im through, he 'as even more terrible tha' his uncles!" laughed Hagrid, and then started coughing again, which left him breathless.

"I think it's about time you leave Mr. Potter" said healer Greengrass, rushing with the potions in hand.

"I'd like to stay for a few more minutes, if at all possible", begged Harry, "I wanted to play him the new piece I was working on".

"Very well". The healer said, pursing his lips.

"Thank you", said Harry, "I am writing this one for you, Hagrid. It's called 'Fluffly's lullaby', I know you miss him still".

Out of his pocket, Harry took his old, trusted wooden flute and put it to his lips. A clear sound arouse around him, much different than the hoots he managed in his first year. A melody, like none other rang in the room. Telling of peace, and calm. Singing of friendship and love. Lamenting the passage of time. Hagrid was listening, tears in his eyes. Before long, he started breathing more easily than he had had in a while, and when he closed his eyes - a small smile was on his lips.
