I have been Drarry hardcore fan for a long time, but recently I started getting into Snarry quite a bit... So I was wondering if some of Snarry fans had interesting stories to recommend? Thanks!


** If you want 8th year specifically, there's\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8762425/1/Unexpected-Effects]]\\
where Harry has problems from his basilisk bite back on 2nd year and goes to Snape for help. They take a long time to get there, but in my opinion, are quite true to themselves especially in the way how they don't communicate too well.

** I'd recommend looking at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]]. I usually find quite a few good reads from other people's answers to the monthly "what have you been reading" posts
