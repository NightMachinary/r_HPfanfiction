:END:
I just remembered this fic but I can't find it and I can't recall the name. Apart from the things in the title, he also removes the previous Grunnings CEO. I also think the Prime Minister's daughter develops a crush on him after he saves her from terrorists. It was all pre-hogwarts. Oh I also guess he seduces his primary teacher but I'm Not so sure about that.

**** Sounds like a half decent fanfiction. Unfortunately, it is written by someone with the hormones of a thirteen year old, and the intelligence of a seven year old.

** It's that oddly written fanfic that was quite good for a while but was later on filled with scenes that keep implying that Fleur wants to fuck Harry. Waste of fucking time. I hate that fanfic.

*** Please do. I didn't remember Fleur being in the story at all. I was looking for the plot which as you said, was pretty good. The pre-hogwarts period I remember didn't focus much on Fleur I guess.

  Wait only 300 words? That blows, okay here the deal, me in Harry Potters body, no idea how, but I do plan on kicking butt in his place and tacking phone numbers. So let's see what one of us would do in the place of Harry Potter, ONWARDs! Foul language and sexual themes. Reviews welcome.

** Okay, I just realised that this might not be the fic you were looking for, but Harry does save Fleur in this one and infiltrates Gringotts or some shit, idk. I seem to have misunderstood your post, but this is the fic I dug up:

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time

It's shit I tell you.
