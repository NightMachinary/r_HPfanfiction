A new tunnel is being built for the London Underground. Normally, the wizarding world would not be concerned about this, but the tunnel is due to pass through the vaults of Gringotts. Influencing things so the tunnel goes elsewhere isn't possible, as the drills will hit the vaults in three days.


** It really shouldnt be that big of a deal, just mind magic pepole to belive that thr griund or area is unsuited for tunneling.

We see them casually manipulate world politics in book 6, construction workers are no problem for them

*** Technically they'd have to mind magic people to have always believed that, since very little construction goes on without some serious surveying and planning work beforehand. If it was unsuitable, they'd've found it before the drills ever got on site, most likely.

**** Archaeological finds happen mid-construction all the time. Convince them that some ancient ruins have been found where they're digging and all construction has to stop so that the 'experts' (wizards) can take over.

***** There is a growing movement to have more archaeological surveying involved in the planning process for construction and such, but that's definitely a more recent thing than the timeline for the HP books so you do have a point.

I still disagree with you, I'm afraid - the survey and planning parts of construction can take a LOOOOONG time and as HiddenAltAccount says elsewhere on this post, that period for tunnel-building can up to a decade in advance, just to get all the surveying and checking and rechecking done properly.

I wonder if the Muggle aversion wards/protections work at that level as well - so people find reasons not to dig down there at all, rather than just finding reasons to leave once they've already drilled nearer to the wards/protections.

** The routes for new tunnels are known literally a decade or more in advance.

When routes are being planned, several candidate routes are considered, published, test drilling is done, and so on, up to another decade in advance. Someone in magic-land really took their eye off the ball if they didn't notice for *20 years*.

*** There's probably some dull Ministry job that just consists of reading muggle construction plans and checking they won't dig anywhere the shouldn't, and when those plans are found the Muggleworthy Excuse Committee comes up with a reason they can't go ahead, stuff like "There's old mine shafts around there that make it unstable"

**** That they decided to enchant a flying car and motorbike and copy trains and radios, that their estates haven't been spotted by cartographers, pilots, and surveillance satellites, suggests otherwise. But in any case, even if the wizards don't care, you woulda thunk that the goblins would have noticed all the tunnelling going on for over a hundred years.

*** My headcanon is that Unplottable places exist in little pocket realities outside our own. They can only be accessed by crossing the two dimensional boundary in exactly the right direction, and by having the right key (which could just be being magical). This means that if the vaults are unplottable the TBM would just not notice them, and to someone inside the vault the TBM and the people on it would appear to jump from one side to the other, a Planck length at a time.

** This is something that has always seemed weird about Gringotts and the Ministry of Magic, which is also underground. Did Rowling have no idea the shear amount of stuff that is underneath London: the Underground, sewers, water mains, electricity cables, gas pipes and foundations, which I think are often deeper than they would be elsewhere because London is built on clay, which is soft.

Although I have heard a story about something like this happening in real life. Apparently someone was digging tunnels under London near or under the Ministry of Defence building. They ran into a deep basement or something that wasn't marked on any maps so they called up the MoD to ask and were just told 'no comment'.

** We already know from Cannon that MoM is in communication with Muggle prime minister, so they would just tell him the problem and Muggle minister would cancel the construction in 5 mins. But interesting idea tho, it would be pretty funny if no one in magical world know about the tunnel and one day bunch of Muggle constructers just come face to scaly face with a dragon.
