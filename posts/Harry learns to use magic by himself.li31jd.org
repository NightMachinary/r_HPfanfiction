Heyyoo!!

Does anyone know any fics where Harry learns to use magic by watching tv shows/reading comics? Like linkao3(Harry Potter and the Avatar's Return)

Or he learns about the magical world earlier (before he goes to Hogwarts) and learns how to navigate the world and learns some magic like in linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree)

Slash is okay, but NO Harry/Multi, Harry/Harem, SSHG and Harry/Ginny

Also please rec only complete fics. Thank you!

Edit: Or any fics where Harry learns more about magic like linkffn(The Potter Family Grimoire)


** (Slash is okay, but NO Harry/Multi, Harry/Harem, SSHG and Harry/Ginny)

Now we're besties :)

** The concept of that Avatar Returns fic is awesome, I just wish it were a several hundred thousand word long fic instead of a short one shot.

  After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar. - Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that Avatar: The Last Airbender is a historical documentary.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

**** Yep. It's certainly a bit weird, but it fits the criteria. (1)Harry learns magic before going to Hogwarts based on, among other things, Doctor Strange comics. (2) Harry isn't in any romantic relationships, and neither is Hermione, so that means there's no H/multi, H/harem, H/GiW, or SS/HG. (3) The author has stopped posting chapters in it and posted a sequel, meaning this fic is complete.

**** I've only played a couple sessions and never really got into it, and I could read the fic just fine. I'd expect you to have more difficulties with the author's slightly weird writing style than with the occasional D&D references.
