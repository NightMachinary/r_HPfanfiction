Anybody know any good non-slash Harry Potter and X-men crossovers? Tried to look for them my self but after 20 minutes of swimming through all the slash fics, I gave up.

Preferably ones where Harry joins the X-men rather than X-men joining Hogwarts.


** linkffn(Mutant Storm by bobmin) is like this I think, but it was one of the few good crossovers with xmen that I read

** Child of the storm. It's a megacrossover of many universes with logan, prof x, and jean grey having significant roles but tertiary while the avengers are more significant and primary and secondary characters.

** Would you be interested in one where Harry creates his own team of Mutants (and otherwised powered and unpowered) people? Some of which are from the X-Men and he still works and interacts with them? It is a Harry/Multi fic.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
