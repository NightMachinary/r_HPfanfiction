Fics where Harry ran away from Dursleys before the Hogwarts' letter and wasn't caught by Dumbledore or anyone. Maybe lived on the streets or stayed invisible like in linkao3(For the Price of a Soul by SilverCookieDust), maybe managed to disguise himself as an adult like in linkffn(The Hidden Hero by EveBB). The point is he lived alone, used to rely on himself and nobody has managed to find him until he comes to Hogwarts.

linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) also counts.


** linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them), of course. And linkffn(Escapologist Harry). Both are excellent and /highly/ recommended.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
