** It's good to be back. She still has it - easily the best series in the fandom by far.

My post from the Discord to spur some discussion:

#+begin_quote
  Just finished as well. Great chapter. Riddle's interest in Rigel is notable, but we've known that for years. Archie and Hermione was expected, but I didn't expect it to happen this early. Caelum was great, and I think he's trying not fall for her while he already is, if that makes any sense. Really looking forward to the Tournament now, as Riddle's line about bringing her to attention means he probably rigged the Tournament so that he would be in it. No more hiding for Rigel.

**** *Chapter 1:*

Archie goes off to South America for a healing internship.

Meanwhile, Harry entertains guests at a party hosted by Sirius, annoying Regulus by claiming that she is important to Rigel, and that everything Regulus admired in Rigel is due to her. Regulus and Sirius get into a heated argument first involving Sirius' duty to remarry to have more children, segueing into a conversation involving Regulus' impotency and their siblings which did not survive. Harry tells Draco a story involving her and Archie trying to catch lightning and succeeding.

She meets up with Leo, who reveals a freedueling tournament that is to be held. She also reveals to Krait her protection potion and its antidote. She gives the Dominion Jewel some magic to mould her mindscape and protect it.

*Chapter 2:*

James encourages Harry with her business. At Krait's she talks an elderly customer out of buying a potion. She gets Krait to give away her Protection potions to werewolves if they come to buy. Leo teaches her to Apparate. Count Aurel, the leader of the Strigoi Shrouds coven (that might not be the right word), the coven that stays at the Lamia, the hotel that Harry used last book when brewing, meets with Leo to discuss the tournament and is a bit disappointed when he finds out vampires will have difficulties entering. The Count notices that she smells familiar, but leaves it at that. Harry finds out about the tithes that are paid to Leo. Leo gets slightly suspicious as to why Harry used the Lamia.

She reads some letters from Hermione, Archie, and Snape. She has a discussion with the Jewel about her plan for her education, which it calls convoluted. They discuss defenses for her mind.

She meets with Snape, and she learns that he is perhaps the first person other than her to learn Shaped Imbuing. He interrogates her on the potions she sells to Burke indirectly through Krait's. Snape reveals that Shaped Imbuing is likely to not become popular due to its difficult requirement of wandless magic and more. Harry wishes for it to become more well-known, so she begins to plot to make it very prominent by demonstrating that it can do more than regular brewing. She accidently suggests to Snape for her to do the Imbuing, which makes him suspicious, since last time she did not have enough magic. He also tells her that her magic levels have not dropped at all, which is highly suspicious. He figures out her aura is artificial and she is concealing her magic, and becomes frustrated because it will hinder her acceptance into the ranks of potioneers in England.

She exchanges letters with Caelum Lestrange, and later meets with him at a fancy French restaurant. She speaks in perfect French (such Caelum doesn't understand), and gets the waiter to take out half the wine in the bottle and replace it with water since she doesn't want Caelum drunk. Caelum reveals that he is now apprenticed. She realises that he is vanishing most of the wine instead of drinking it. He forces her to teach him Shaped Imbuing.

Later, Leo teaches her how to freeduel. She finds out that Regulus is the one who is setting up the wards for the tournament.

***** *Chapter 3:*

Harry decides to visit Mrs. Flint (Merriam), and along the way meets the flower-selling girl again, who reveals her name as Margaret, or preferably, Margo. She talks about her ill friend Cora, who is a juggler, and Henry, who is a thief. All are part of the Court of Rogues.

She finds Merriam packing her things, and learns that Merriam is moving out and is employed full-time at Maywell Clinic. An Adam Quincy arrives to help Merriam move her things, and Harry figures out that he was the person she thought was the cauldron merchant from when he helped her stop Jack from stealing her purse. He's also a Squib, and in love with Merriam. She is given muffins by Merriam to deliver to Healer Hurst.

Leo finds her along the way, and goes with her to the clinic. They arrive at the clinic to find it in a tense situation as Healer Hurst is arguing with another healer from St. Mungo's, who refuses to pester a sponsor for the money to buy a potion to heal Cora. They find out that Cora has had Seifer's Syndrome for months. It's a disease in which the magical core is not contained and spills into the physical body, wreaking havoc slowly. Obviously, Harry then volunteers to brew it, even though she lacks the license.

They search for the recipe in the Guild's archives, but find it restricted, so Leo fools the archivist into handing it over to him, pretending to be acting in the stead of his father. They find that the recipe requires a basilisk scale, which Harry decides to sacrifice her ring for. Leo comes over to her house to help her brew. Harry decides to teach the alley kids Potions.

Hermione sends her a letter asking to meet, and Harry meets her the next day, earlier than expected. Harry wants to deliver the potion, but Hermione is sort of in her way, so she is forced to allow Hermione to accompany her. She explains to Hermione the circumstances behind the potion, then also the almost worship of magic, especially by the purebloods. They cure Cora, who is very happy.

Harry goes to the tournament. Leo interrogates her about Hermione. She wins her first match, and learns from Marek that Leo is using a triangular blade with his wand inside so he can guarantee victory to remain King. She wins her second fight against a female goblin, but it is a hard fight.

She runs into Remus after she leaves, and he figures out that she is freedueling, and in a tournament. He goes to watch her the next day, and subtly threatens Leo. She fights a werewolf, attacking with a movable shield charm, and barely loses the fight after nearly being taken out by sleeping gas.

Leo prepares for his final match, and drinks at the bar, when Marek comes back after tracking someone to an area known as the Cesspool. They think Leo is pretending to be drunk, but he is actually drugged, so Harry grabs a cure for him. Harry is approached by a hooded man who tries to offer her a job from his employer.

*Chapter 4:*

Harry finds out that Archie is stuck under a quarantine. She also receives a letter from Snape that gives her more ideas, along with a letter that tells her she has passed in all her classes for the correspondence school.

She has her birthday party. She is given the communication mirrors, and has to use them to contact Archie in front of the whole party, nearly blowing her cover.

Caelum comes over to learn Shaped Imbuing from Harry, who goes over an old but useful book about wandless magic with him. He tries to talk her into getting permanent transfiguration to make her look more attractive.

Her family goes to the Quidditch World Cup. She and Ginny go and talk with Cedric, who looks at Ginny like a little sister. At the Cup, they sit with the Malfoys and the Minister. The Malfoys reveal that they are funding another wing at St. Mungo's, for mental maladies, and Harry goads them into funding more expensive potions (like cures for Seifer's Syndrome as her example), and Sirius decides to match it. The Bulgarian Minister humiliates Crouch (who doesn't seem to be a polyglot here), when he talks to Lily in perfect French. When the Veelas use their Allure, Draco is heavily affected due to his empathy, which Harry accidently reveals knowledge of. She helps him. The match goes like canon. The Dark Mark rises above the stadium, and their box falls apart, and Sirius is injured, though healed by Harry. James protects Fudge. They escape the stadium, with the Weasleys, Malfoys and the Ministers, and no one is hurt.

****** *Book 1:*

Harry and Archie switch places, she calls herself Rigel and starts to become friends with Draco and Pansy. She is blackmailed by Marcus Flint, who figures out that she is not actually Archie, though he does not know who she really is. She is forced to do schoolwork for him. She joins the Quidditch team. She has problems with her magic, and attracts the interest of Snape. People start getting sick and falling asleep without waking up. Eventually Draco gets sick that way, she goes and saves him, invents some new mind magic technique, and comes to an accord with her magic. Apprentices to Snape. (Not exactly in order)

*Book 2:*

Meets Leo during the summer, does amazing things with her potions, meets Caelum Lestrange at the same workshop or something, attracts the eye of many masters. Also meets Snape as Harry, gets permission to learn and collaborate with him. Back at school, she continues to be blackmailed. Helps Flint pass his exams and cheat with his schoolwork when the professors investigate. Kinda follows canon, and is accused of being the Heir. Things go kinda the same, kills Basilisk and helps teachers. I think sometime in this book she finds out Draco is an empath.

*Book 3:*

More summer stuff. I don't remember it though. Archie is a metamorphmagus. Goes to school, gets the time-turner. Finds out about the Dominion Jewel going missing. I think she finds out about the Marauder's Map this book, otherwise, she's always had it. Goes to Hogsmeade, has fun. Learns that her polyjuice potion is failing and she's feeling pain due to growing differently from Archie's form. Is forced to spend a month creating a potion that will blend both her and Archie's forms. At the same time, Marcus Flint begs her for a favour, asking to hide his mother away from his father. She does so, giving his mother her apartment in the alleys, takes an aging potion and goes and lives at the Lamia Hotel. She finds out Peter Pettigrew is after the Dominion Jewel for Riddle. He attacks her as she uses her time-turner, and uses it multiple times. The Jewel is greatly affecting him. He hides her in an underground room, then forces her to use the time-turner multiple times. This causes 7 copies of her to exist, which starts to kill her as her cores all resonate. She also eats her potions ingredients kit to survive, but it poisons her. The Jewel kills Peter, tries to take control of her, but fails and is instead used to change her core so that it doesn't kill her. Snape finds her afterwards when Draco tells him about seeing her multiple times on the Map.

** Just jazzed that this is out. I want someone - anyone! - to figure out Harry's secret so bad that I can barely keep myself together.

Snape is hot on the trail.

Leo knows more of Harry's secrets than anyone.

Draco got a whiff of Harry's emotions over the summer. Will he notice?

Riddle is the King of Secrets, and he's got his eye on her now.

Anyone want to take bets? My money is on Leo. Harry in this OU never gives up a secret unless she has to, and if she HAS to, Leo is the most likely to have something she needs that she doesn't have herself.

***** Shit's gonna get real?

Though I'm of the mind that Harry's name comes out of the goblet rather than Rigel's name. I think that Voldemort is more interested in Harry and Riddle is more interested in Rigel. And I have a hard time picturing Riddle putting a name in the cup (due to the agreement between Rigel/Riddle). We'd also have the added layer of Harry's name coming out of the cup under a different (non-participating) school. So you could have Archie travel to Hogwarts to compete. Thus having Harry pretending to be Rigel pretending to be Harry and vice versa.

******* Voldemort doesn't have to know Harry is at Hogwarts. All Voldemort needs to know is that it's possible to enter a fourth school (AIM) and Harry's name into the goblet. Remember it's a magically binding contract. So Voldemort would know that Harry would have to be at Hogwarts (a place Voldemort would consider his turf.)

** I just finished reading it! If we remain true to the vaguest outlines of canon, we should be seeing the Goblet of Fire next. I'm so hyped to see how Harry will have to figure her way out of that predicament. And if the animagus forms for her and Archie are different (as they almost undoubtedly will be), she'll be in trouble due to that 5th year too. I'm predicting a mid 6th reveal, with 7th year being her on the run/fighting a war.

**** Well, I'm basing it on the assumption that Voldemort is actually in charge of the Death Eaters. We do know that he has Horcruxes, so I don't think it too far a stretch that she'll have to remove them eventually. The main series of Alanna the Lioness also ends with the book in which they deal with the Dominion Jewel, then a resurrection of a powerful sorceror, then finally a huge battle. Obviously murkybluematter won't follow it to the letter, but I feel like there's a good chance we'll see these events vaguely followed.
