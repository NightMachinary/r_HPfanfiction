I have been reading fanfiction for awhile now and I very read said few where they talk about a challenge. Like I recently read a series of dribbles that were part of the 100 little things challenge


** Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my mobile.

Here's a link to the challenges forum on FFN:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/forum/Harry-Potter-Fanfiction-Challenges/44309/]]

Then there is Livejournal. Off the top of my head, here are a few (these are active communities):

http://hp_bunintheoven.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_creatures.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_getlucky.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_goldenage.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_hetgen.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_humpdrabbles.livejournal.com/profile http://hp_mhealthfest.livejournal.com/profile http://hprare_cliche.livejournal.com/profile [[http://hprarepairs.livejournal.com/profile]] [[http://mixandmatch100.livejournal.com/profile]] http://rarepair_shorts.livejournal.com/profile [[http://slytherin100.livejournal.com/profile]] http://hp_darkarts.livejournal.com/profile [[http://100quills.livejournal.com/profile]]

And many, many more.

[[/r/fanfiction]] does (fandom-blind) prompts, check out the sub for the pintsized prompts.

You can find prompts on Tumblr as well. If you enter 'writing prompts' in the search bar, you'll get numerous hits.

Good luck and happy writing.

** If you want, you can check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12277303/1/Copy-Paste-Write][my collection of rambles]] over on Fanfiction.net.

Most of it is random drabbles with little future, but a few of the bigger ones have enough information and plot-hook-iness to serve as prompts. I recommend chapters 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12.

** If you go to [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]], there are daily prompts that have been put out since October. If you want HP specific, I have used [[http://hpfanfictionprompts.tumblr.com/][Harry Potter Fanfic Prompts]] as a tool in the past but they haven't updated in a while.
