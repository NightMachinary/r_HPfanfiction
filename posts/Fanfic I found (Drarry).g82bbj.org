Hey so I came across this fic that I thought was really good. It's pretty short but cute. It uses the 8th year trope thing. But I thought it was good writing and it's pretty pg-13, so I thought I could share it and help out the new author. So here's the link [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23591491]]

  Draco has been rather out of it since returning to Hogwarts to finish. This doesn't keep him and Harry from getting detention. True Feelings come out and they have to figure out what to do with them.
