So, I am now starting Book 4 of linkffn(3766574). 67 chapters out of 147. And I will try to avoid spoilers while discussing this fic but take this as a warning, I plan to ask about future events so... SPOILER ALERT... I guess.

When I first got into fan fiction about 2 years ago I generally avoided non-completed fics. Back then I had, literally, a million fics to choose from so it didn't really take out that many of my options. Once I really got into the fan fiction culture(world? lifestyle? Don't know what to call it), I learned what I preferred in fics. Pairings, themes, authors I avoided... the usual drill when someone dives head first into the world of Harry Potter Fan Fiction. Now I struggle to find fics that pull me in enough to finish them. I can't remember the last story I completed. I've been trying to rid myself of the habit of abandoning fics once something happens that I strongly disagree with. But sometiems I just can't make myself finish them.

When I started Prince of the Dark Kingdom I didn't realize it wasn't complete. I saw it had over a million words so I just assumed it was finished (stupid mistake on my part). At my current point in the story I am losing interest. Honestly I'm not entirely too sure why. Maybe I just burned out by reading it to much. (I have a terrible habit where once I find something I like, I surround my self with it for a good chunk of time then drop it for a while. Books, music, movies. I obsess easily). But I don't want another Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin!! I demolished that fic and now am forever waiting for updates that never come. I hate it.

I think for me, PotDK, while interesting, just wasn't that exciting. There is no overarching antagonist. Yes each book has it's story arc, but there isn't any connecting theme book to book besides maybe paganism. There's no big bad guy! Voldemort isn't the villain in this story. He's not a good person but he's not Harry's opposition. (That I know of so far. It could change I guess). And, really, Dumbledore isn't a factor yet either. The AU aspect of the world was interesting at first but the longer the book went on the less and less different the two universes seemed. There are still some significant differences, pagan magic and the government, but they don't really factor into 75% of the story.

So my question is... Even though The Prince of the Dark Kingdom isn't complete and hasn't been updated in over 2 years, is it worth finishing. I've invested a good chunk of time into this fic but I'm not sure it's worth reading to the end if it's not going to ever be finished.


** If you are getting to a point where you don't like any fics anymore it might be time to take a break from fan fiction and read something else completely different, I recommend A Confederacy of Dunces, Catch-22 or Naked.

** Iirc the AU starts to become a major presence around the end of year four, with the story wildly diverging at that point to spend a lot of time away from Hogwarts, even later on. What I'd say to you is to power through book 4, then at the end decide if the rest is fun enough to continue.

*** It seemed like book 4 would bring in some of the cannon characters we haven't seen yet and deal more with Dumbledore. But I've never really liked Triwizard fics so I think that was another thing that put me off

** I don't think it's worth it. It's a million words with no real payoff, and it's unlikely to ever have one. Even when it was updating semi-regularly, waiting a month or more in between updates was too much, and you'd end up forgetting a lot of recent chapters anyways. I couldn't recommend a story like that to someone unless they really just like reading a million words just because its a million words.

Then there's the actual content. Most people will just turn a blind eye on everything because muh worldbuilding! but truthfully I don't think it's as good as people think. It's fine. Fine enough to read a million words of it that doesn't go anywhere? Not really. There's too many immersion ruining ideas (such as the parselflute), and some of the characterizations are just a bit too weird (constantly referring to a 12 year old as a blond bombshell).

Perhaps the worst part is that large swaths of this story is just plain boring. The decision I made years ago is that no, it's not worth finishing.

** My problem with this one was after a while it seems that drama was inserted just for the sake of drama, not for storytelling purposes. Plot threads were dragged on, Harry always had to be involved in /some/ sort of idiocy, even when there was no logical reason for it. It just got very melodramatic and overdone, really. It has some really interesting story points and could have been a lot better than it is, but I suspect that this is one of those stories where the author didn't have any kind of game plan for the plot and things ended up going in every direction all at once as a result.

I know canon Harry is headstrong and impulsive. Thing is, he learns from his mistakes and uses that knowledge to his advantage in the future. Prince of the Dark Kingdom Harry keeps making the same dumb-ass mistakes over and over as if he expects different results every time.

** The point of reading it is for your own enjoyment, and you're not enjoying it anymore, so stop.

There is some more action and conflict later on, however, and Dumbledore's faction becomes more of a factor, if I recall. It's been a couple years since I last read it.

** I barely got through Prince of the Dark Kingdom, and I've read The Son of Lord Voldemort and all of Athey's stories at least a dozen times.

Reading POTDK was one hell of a read. I dropped all of my other online pursuits to read it, and it still took me nearly three weeks to read it, and I skipped the summer school before Hogwarts part, which is easily at least 50-100k words.The world-building was beyond awesome, though The Son of Lord Voldemort and some of Athey's stories definitely exceed it. The character development is definitely unparalleled as well. Problem was, it's one and a quarter million words, with long gaps between good action scenes. The story progresses as sluggishly as I do on Monday mornings. The suspense was not artfully done either, as the length and the turtle progression that the story has just overwhelmed me.

Overall? Excellent read. Better than the average fic? Yes. One of the best? Probably not. Nevertheless have to give the author credit for writing so much. There's very few HP fanfics that exceed 800k or so words.

** Sometimes I wonder how they manage to write that much. I stopped reading PotDK after Larisses' debacle. Honestly, while I can recognize a great dedication, he wrote 150.000 more words than the HP series together! I think he could have written it in half, at least, cutting a bit of useless adventures and angst.
