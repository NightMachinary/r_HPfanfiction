Looking for answers that are alternative to quidditch, a new magical game, or original Triwizard ideas- I'm just curious what you've all seen.

**** Basically Magical Crufts, stuff that would be illegal in the real world, like having them fly through flaming hoops and do courses that would be dangerous, but are safe because of charms

** A game called Jack. The players place up objects as rewards, then jump off brooms at a high distance. Closest to the ground wins the object. I can't remember the story it came from only that it was a Harry/ Tonks multichapter story.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** So I'm pretty sure "racing brooms" are canon but without any mention of actual organized races? Not a game, per se, but a competition of some kind?

Like, how much does car culture translate to racing brooms? What is the NASCAR of wizard flight? Who hosts the /Top Gear/ equivalent?

Anyone got any fics with this stuff?

**** I don't remember the exact details but it was called Ricochet and the players would use the handles of their brooms while they were on them to hit the ball over a net, kind of like tennis and Quidditch had a child. It sounded pretty interesting, honestly.

**** I think it was similar to volleyball? Brooms may or may not have been involved. Might not have been White Squirrel, I just remember it was something I read just after I started reading fic.

I also just remembered Lippert's James Potter series has a weird variant of Quidditch (it's not Quodpot, I don't think) where players stand on their brooms. Wasn't as much a fan of that.
