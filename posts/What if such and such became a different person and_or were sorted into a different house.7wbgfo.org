Inspired by this theory: [[https://youtu.be/XUT6a1acRW8][What If Draco Malfoy Was Sorted Into Gryffindor?]]!

I'm wondering if anyone has ideas, opinions, or fic recs about more sympathetic characterizations of Slytherins, or maybe even a major/minor Slytherin being sorted into another house etc. Just out of curiosity! Feel free to even mention someone from the other houses being differently sorted or hanging around a new group. This always seems like a cool topic of discussion and sharing, as many agree that Slytherins are described in black-and-white terms and houses like Hufflepuff need more love. Cheers!

Summary: The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.

By completely changing up the first year sorting in PS, the author manages to make pure gold.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
