Greetings denizens of the deep.

I come to you with vague information in hope that one of you can aid me in my nostalgia fest. I once read a fanfic where Harry was sorted into slytherin, and had an older female student act as his sort of tutor and friend, before they eventually became romantically involved. Harry also ends up serving voldemort I believe because mad eye moody killed the girl. In the end of the story voldemort brings her back to life but it's like a pale shadow of what she was and he's forced to kill her again. Anyone have anything that sounds like this? It had some political stuff too but I don't remember it well. Not a lot to go on, I'm sorry. The girl was an OC though, fairly certain.
