For me I would say it was in fifth five book after Dumbledore and Voldemorts duel but before we heard the prophecy. That was when at least for me Harry's story peaked, the Prophecy was the beginning the series decline even if I didn't quite relies it at the time. Not that there isn't some good stuff in the sixth and seventh book but none of it is really enough to outway the bad.

If I were going off when Harry peaked magically instead of when His story peaked for me I would go with the end of Third year when he drives off all the dementors.At least to me that was Harry's best magical feat and he never surpasses it.


** Book 4, the night when Voldemort returned. The contrast between the cheerful crowd during the third task, the eeriness of the maze, the sense of dread in the cemetery, the fear of imminent death during the duel with Voldemort, the sense of hope during the Priori Incantatem scene, the chaos upon Harry's return to Hogwarts, Harry's panic and exhaustion as he realizes what just happened, the fear of what's coming... gosh that night must have been a real emotional rollercoster. It was then when I got the feeling Harry lost his innocence and the tone of books really shifted.

I didn't like book 5 all that much. It's really long and a lot of chapters are just people holding a really long conversation.

** Goblet of Fire and "Flesh, blood and bone" chapter - I will never forget the first time I read it. I was 14, and read the book at my aunt's, hiding from my parents who tried to force me to put the book away and talk with the family, but I just couldn't. I had goosebumps all over, and the only thing I could think of was "Holy shit".\\
In general, Goblet of Fire was THE book for me. Maybe, it's because it was the last book (I read it some time before OotP came out, so I had to wait before I could get my hands on it), or maybe it was because Voldemort finally returned from the dead, but I just couldn't put it down.\\
To this day, GoF is the book I re-read the most - my old copy is falling apart. I'm not sure, but I think I read it, like, 50 times.

** This is hard for me. I read the books when I was really young, so it's a bit skewed.

Using hindsight, probably the night when Riddle returned. The fifth book is probably my least favourite (which is funny, because I love the movies). I actually really enjoy the sixth book, minus the awful attempt at romance. It has its weak points, but I love TMR's story. It would definitely be the horcrux reveal if not for the fact book 5 brought the series a bit down from its peak for me.

** In never really enjoyed the books after 5. Honestly I don't remember them very well as I struggled to read them. They just didn't interest me as much.

I listened to and read the first 4 books so many times, I still read them. I don't even think I read book 7 more than once.

** Battle of the Ministry, so book 5 in general.

Book 6 is a history lesson that should've taken a few weeks, not the entire school year. And book 7 has the Ministry and the Order fold a month after Dumbledore dies. Asspull, after asspull to prevent Harry from dying from his wand deciding all on it's own to zap Voldemort, Wormtail's arm choking him out. Deus ex machina at it's worst.
