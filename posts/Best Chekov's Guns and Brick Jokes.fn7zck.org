When I say Chekov's Guns, I mean in the later-ish sense of 'an insignificant thing that later turns out to be important' rather than the original 'everything you mention should be important to the story' sense. Check out the TV Tropes link if you want a description of the Chekov's Guns trope and examples of all the different variations. I'll take any of 'em if you've got 'em. I just wanna see some fics where things that are important and vital later on are mentioned off-hand really early on - eg. Harry gets a potion wrong in his opening scene potions lesson, then blows up Voldemort with it in the finale. That kind of thing.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** There's HPMoR and carbon nanotubes, acetylene blowtorch, and the time turner

*** Ah yes, I hear HPMoR is full of the things. I could never get too far into it, due to the sheer punch-in-the-faceability of its Harry Potter. Dude was more obnoxious than I remember some of my more... socially-errant secondary school classmates being - those who'd piss off the teacher just because and never did anything they didn't immediately want to.

**** considering that he's really a clone of Tom Riddle but raised differently it's not surprising

***** Indeed - also, an interesting note, apparently the little messages that pop up in the corner to alert me to Reddit messages don't read spoiler tags, I could see the whole thing there.
