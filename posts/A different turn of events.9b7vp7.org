Why didnt Tom summon the book from harry before he was about to stab it????I mean..he literally had his wand and all....there's even a fic dedicated to this thing happening....


** The only magic Tom performs during the chamber scene is to write his name in the air. While not explicitly canon, a simple interpretation is that he wasn't able to cast all kinds of magic before he fully regained his body. If he could cast whatever he wanted the entire sequence would be flawed because a simple body bind when Harry initially drops his wand ends the conflict.

Secondly, there's canonical precedent for horcruxes being immune to summoning charms

*** Not quite. He uses a second spell of some sort that drives away Fawkes following the healing moment, then Fawkes flies back and tosses Harry the diary.

And while they /might/ be immune, it makes more sense that Harry just caught him off guard.

** Surprise? That's the only thing that makes sense, and like it or not its really the only way Harry can ever really one up Voldemort in the stories: by doing the unexpeceted quickly and without hesitation.

** Why did Voldemort never try curses other than the killing curse against Harry? Why didn't the Ministry intervene more in second year when they showed they could in 5th? Where did Harry go for 24hrs after Hagrid pulled him from the rubble of his house but before he got to the Dursley's? Why didn't Hogwarts protections protect Ginny from the diary? Why are we not given more slytherins who aren't evil for the sake of being evil?

Its a story. Sometimes things happen for narrative reasons rather than because they're the optimal series of events. Stories would be really short if people didn't make mistakes but making mistakes is human so its actually in character for people to make mistakes. Get over it and enjoy, some things don't need to be questioned.

A lot of the time, things only happen for narrative reasons in Harry Potter. Why didn't Dumbledore give the information directly to the trio during 6th year, instead of hiding them in the items left for them? Because JKR wanted a dramatic reveal in DH, no matter how stupid it made Dumbledore.

You don't need, and probably shouldn't, question that when enjoying the series. But you should question it when writing fanfiction - and preferably change canon.

**** Well said. Even in-universe, there's a really stupid thing Dumbledore did which was to not make public who and what Riddle was: a half-blood who attended Hogwarts (although oddly Ron in PS seems to know this). I'm pretty certain Dumbledore never told the public because Bellatrix freaks out at the mere insinuation by Harry that Voldemort wasn't a pure-blood. People like Lucius wouldn't have cared (apparently Lucius was even hoping Harry would become the next Voldemort) but a bunch of DEs and would-be DEs would have hesitated to follow Riddle.

** What [[/u/Pudpop]] said sound reasonable. An alternate supposition, though: since stabbing it kills Diarymort, it seems that even if Diarymort could manifest outside of the Diary with a physical form, he still /was/, on some level, the Diary, just projecting a fraction of itself outwards. So perhaps it' would not even be possible for him to Summon the Diary, whether or not he was at full power and whether or not other people could use the Summoning Spell on the Diary, because the Diary is /himself/ and it's a logical absurdity to use /Accio/ on yourself.

**** You don't seem to be understanding what I'm saying. I'm saying that magically the Diary might count as a part of Diarymort himself, and so it wouldn't work any more than if Hermione tried /Accio Hermione Granger's left thumb/, no matter how precise he gets.

***** I got what you were saying, that Diarymort couldn't summon the diary since he himself is part of it. But I don't think that's right. The Hermione thumb wouldn't work because, well, the thumb is already right there so the charm, at best, might move her hand a bit if it does anything. If her thumb had been severed I'm pretty sure it would work. So if Diary Riddle says /Accio Tom Riddle's Diary/ it should work. He's a projection after all, not a diary, and it's not like moving the diary directly affects him (Fawkes brought it to Harry after all).

Except in /Lego Harry Potter/ Book 2. Seriously, [[https://youtu.be/yoE8uAKYgPE?t=1192][just watch]]. I know it doesn't match with the books but goddamnit, it so funny, sometimes I wish it were canon.

Anyway, what I was assuming was that it was some law of magic that you couldn't use /Accio/ on yourself, which seems like a plausible extrapolation of the fact that you can't use /Wingardium Leviosa/ on yourself.

******* LOL @ the lego thing.

Well, according to the Wiki anyway it's actually just that Accio, Levitation and other such charms cannot be directly applied to the human body for an unknown reason. That's why it was shocking that Voldemort managed to create a true flight spell.

The folklore version of horcruxes had something very much like this. If you shook the egg that contained the needle that contained the soul of Koschei the Deathless, Koschei got thrown about.

Be kind of funny to sneak around after a Dark Lord and, just as he hits peak monologue, start blasting out the Cha-Cha Slide and make him dance to it.
