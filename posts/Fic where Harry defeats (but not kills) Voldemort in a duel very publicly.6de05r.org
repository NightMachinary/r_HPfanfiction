** In linkffn(RuneMaster), Harry ends up broadcasting the story's version of the graveyard duel to the entire audience of the Triwizard Tournament, cutting Fudge's attempt at covering up Voldemort's return off.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
