My best friend wrote some HP fanfic. He's out for the count right now (medical reasons), so I won't be able to see him for a few weeks. I have some of his work I'd like to share here - it's something I know he wouldn't mind. However, I want to do more than just share his work; I want to continue writing it, as it seems incomplete. I plan on gathering some feedback before getting to work.

It's my first time on this subreddit... can I just paste all of it into a text post? Do I have to post it on a fanfic site first, then share the link here? I couldn't find the rules of this subreddit anywhere; a basket of sorry's in advance for all the questions.


** It would probably be best to post it on a site like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/]] and then post the link here. Those are two of the biggest fanfic sites.

**** after you post on a fanfic site, you can link it here (in this subreddit I mean) so that people will know about it and read it.
