I have read alot of fanfiction, I like some of the more independent/powerful Harry fics. I am looking for a good length series, they always seem to end too quickly for me


** It's a bit dated, but joe6991's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Hero Trilogy]] might be read: powerful Harry, over a million words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.
#+end_quote

Also recommended is the Wastelands/Heartlands of Time series by the same author. Sequel is WIP.

jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and sequel is another lengthy, complete series with a powerful Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures.
#+end_quote

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] and sequel are pretty lengthy. Sequel is WIP.

#+begin_quote
  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
#+end_quote

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] is WIP, but updates weekly.

#+begin_quote
  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

*** Jberns The Lie I've Lived also features a very powerful Harry, albeit one who relies on his intelligence rather than pure magical power.

*** I disliked the hero series. Although it was one of the first i read and was pretty out there. It might be better now that i am more accustomed to fanfic.

**** I think I enjoyed the first couple of books back when I was new to the fandom, but I tried reading them again some months ago and couldn't get through them. Still, there are some good parts scattered throughout. I think the second book sort of lost its way after Harry left the parallel Hogwarts universe and it never really found its way back.

** The [[http://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#Dangerverse_Main][Danger]] series is great. Four completed, one in progress, and lots of one-shots.

** There is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] Series on ff.net... I'm not a great fan but it's worth a look I suppose. Other than that, nothing really comes to mind. I'll look through my favs and alerts tomorrow, when I'm awake.

*** I dislike the Saving Connor series personally, but generally, the Slytherin Harry / mentored by Snape concepts usually have him as more independent (or at the very least, more ruthless). Those are quite common (though not my cup of tea).

*** So I found another you might like: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487494/1/The-Chronicles-of-Harry-Holmes][The Chronicles of Harry Holmes]]. It has two completed stories and even though the third hasn't been updated since 2011, I still think it's one of the best stories I've ever read.

What if the Dursleys gave Harry the Sherlock Holmes books when he was a child to make sure he knew that there was no such thing as magic? What if he did everything to become just like Holmes?

** I'm not too familiar with very many series, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series is supposedly good but Harry isn't the main character.

*** To explain it a little more, Alexandra Quick is an American witch and definitely not a Harry-clone in terms of personality.

*** I second this. It is a series, and the main character is powerful and independent. Though since it's in America the surroundings are different, it is what I assume people would look for in powerful!Harry fics/series, without actually having Harry in them.

** try the Denarian series (Dresden Files cross-over). And if you aren't familiar with Jim Butcher's Dresden Files books, strongly advise you to take a break from fanfiction and read through them.

*** This story was pretty good. The premise is that harry finds a denarian coin walking home one day. Partially a crossover with the dresden files.
