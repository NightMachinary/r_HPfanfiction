Like the fact that a Galleon is solid gold, so abusing the exchange rate to make money off of it, or doing something like that, rather than being Lord Everything. Just being Harry Potter rather than a Lord, but making money by fiddling the exchange rate and selling the gold.


** The Tinkerer. It should be a good read. He ends up developing a software for Microsoft and ends up loaded.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

**** tbh here it wasn't /really/ stolen, it was just Dumbledore accepting the Hogwarts application for Harry... and while Dumbledore here is quite clearly !Manipulative maybe !Evil it's in the background. Harry hasn't even talked to Dumbledore in the whole fic.

**** Nope. When I saw that it seemed interesting I checked the last chapter, and I think it's still in first year. I noped out of that quick. I enjoy long stories, but when your at close to 200k in a pre established universe, and still on first year, I can't read them.

****** I could be wrong. I did only read a few paragraphs at the end of a chapter. I'd ask someone who read it instead of taking my word on it. Do give "In The Mind Of A Scientist" a read through though in my opinion. It's complete, and has two crossover sequels.

Its a Star Wars xover but it features Harry making silly amounts of money and in ways more original than the solid gold stuff. Honestly the gold stuff annoys me because I'm sure that someone has thought of it before, it would be stupid if it worked.

*** I don't know. I feel that if it is solid gold, and not just gold plated, the goblins have probably set up a system, or charms to make sure such an outcome doesn't happen.

He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

** I don't think it would be that hard to make money when you have magic. You can reparo broken furniture and appliances and so forth and sell it as new, you could probably conjure a lottery ticket, you can summon lost money and change with accio, you could probably use magic for insider trading with muggles no one the wiser, you could probably rob a bank with no one the wiser, and so on.
