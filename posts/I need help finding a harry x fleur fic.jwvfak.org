:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fanfic I'm looking for is a harry x fleur

Fleur owes a life debt to harry

Harry has a sister(might be adopted)

Harry is an animagus(I think it is a Phoenix)

Harry proposed to fleur

Harry and fleur had an argument because of fleur calling him BWL then harry flies away with his animagus form and then comes back around midnight

Also the fanfic is not harry potter and the problem with life debts


** I'm actually curious myself now. But maybe try looking in [[/r/harryandfleur][r/harryandfleur]]
