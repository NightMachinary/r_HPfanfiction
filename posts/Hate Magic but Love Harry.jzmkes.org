The last remnants of her once beloved sister, her only nephew and an orphaned baby with no concept of what he'd just lost or how close he'd come to death: of course Petunia Dursley adored baby Harry.

Vernon had always wanted children and although Harry wasn't exactly what he had in mind (in many ways) another baby to dote on and adore was just another blessing.

But one thing had not changed, the Dursley's were a 'normal' family, valuing that above all things. As much as they loved Harry (just as much as Dudley) they did not love magic.

Accidental magic came with harsh reprimands and was heavily discouraged. Though Harry was told much earlier what it was that he was doing, their quieter 'son' proving responsible enough to keep that information to himself from age seven, it was made clear that (in no uncertain terms) it would not be done in their house.

Their little Harry had very quickly learned the loophole. As long as he wasn't doing it at home (and no one found out) he was free to do his magic... elsewhere. Incidents like teleporting onto rooftops, talking to animals and making things float were things the Durlsey's pretended they didn't know about. Only recognising them when they needed to be explained away, which came with more reprimands about the need for secrecy and not to be so arrogant or foolish.

When he was a little older, Petunia sat her Harry down to tell him of his parents and that (very soon) he would be invited to the school they attended. He was also told that: Yes, his aunt and uncle would always love and support him regardless of his decisions, but they did NOT want him to go to Hogwarts. Something he recognised and decided to go to anyway.

They sent Muggle work for him to during the year, having him sit tests and indulge in 'normal activities' during the holidays, but they eventually had to step in and truly face the magical world when their beloved nephew ended up injured or traumatised again and again.

I know fics similar to this exist (if not this specific) and I'd love some where this is either the main or subplot.


** To be honest with you, this might cause Harry to supress his magic in order to be good to his aunt and turn into an obscurus.

*** I don't think so. I'm pretty sure obsuruses are because of abuse due to magic, this sound more like reprimanding not full abuse . I he only reason Harry didn't become one in canon was because he didn't know WHY he was being abused.

**** Obscuruses are because the child willingly tries to supress their magic until they break it. Abuse is a cause not the reason. In canon Harry would have been an obscurus if he knew he was punished because of magic. But he didnt knew of magic and thought they were being horrible to him just because he was himself.

*** Only if you don't choose to ignore the spin-off movies, they came out /after/ the original book series, after all.
