Could anyone recommend Remus Tonks (or Remus oc) fanfiction similar in style to Shades and Shifts by Fernwithy or Kaleidoscope series by Shimotsuki?


** The best one I know is called Shifts, written by Fernwithy, available only on Ao3, i.e. Archive of our own.

Shifts follows cannon very closely. Tonks meets Remus as a child when her cousin Sirius is still Hogwarts age and brings all the Mauraders to visit his Aunt Andromeda's house.

Shifts is rated T and goes through their wedding I think. The sequel goes through the end of book 7, and has a lot of well thought out interesting werewolf characters during Remus's mission spying on the werewolves.

There is also a series of sequels about Teddy Lupin's years at Hogwarts. I highly recommend all of them.

Let me know if you like them!

*** I've read shades by fernwithy and am now reading shifts. But I haven't been able to find a sequel that follows them through dh. Have you got a link to that sequel? Because I thought such a thing doesn't exist. I read three parts of Teddy Lupin series, cried while reading most of the chapters. The author just somehow manages to write such sentences like 'no love he got, no caring for, had fallen on his ears like his father's voice'. I suppose it's inadvisable for me to read such things because I end up wanting to write to Rowling a very unpleasant letter. I absolutely loved shades by the same author.
