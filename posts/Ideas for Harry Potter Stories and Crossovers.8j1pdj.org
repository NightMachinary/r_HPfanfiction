** A rather cracky Mass Effect crossover where fem!Shep, Liara and Tali get sucked out of the Mass Effect 2 universe and end up crash-landing their shuttle in Privet Drive Number 4's backyard on November 2nd, 1981 (due to the wards, no one notices). While checking the area, Jane finds Harry in front of a door, suffering from hypothermia, and take him to the shuttle, which Tali is busy repairing. They patch Harry up and are surprised when a medical scanner shows that the baby has been exposed to Element Zero.

Since this is clearly not just the past but an alternate universe, they decide to keep Harry for the foreseable future, especially considering how they found him. Tali fixes the shuttle and the trio decides to head to the Mars, to dig up the Prothean Archive there. While Tali tries to build an FTL drive for the shuttle and Liara does her science thing, Jane is stuck with raising Harry (and no one in the group knows much about motherhood or raising humans). Liara eventually gives him some biotic lessons, although Harry keeps coming up with his own techniques (since magic is not just biotics).

Fast forward a couple years and they find an owl sitting on their shuttle, ignoring the lack of oxygen to deliver the Hogwarts letter, which is even adressed with "Shuttle 03, Prothean Archives, Mars" or something similar. So after using the shuttle sensors to find Diagon Alley (element Zero concentration in London), Shepard takes Harry shopping and they get some books to get a basic understanding of the magical world. At Hogwarts, Harry tells everyone that he has been raised by two aliens on Mars but most students just think it is either a joke or an additional layer of security, while a few believe it since "it's Harry Potter".

Not sure where the main plot here would go, but Voldemort, Snape and Malfoy are sure in for a bad time.

** I've got an HP/Avengers (MCU) crossover in the works, but it's not ready yet, maybe in a month or two. Thought it might be cool to see a Harry who's somewhat lost after the second war and has some exploration of foreign magic and the obligations some other wizards have, as he searched for meaning since his life was basically "Beat Voldemort or Bust". Beforehand his conception of a post-Voldemort life came across as "Um, Auror I guess" which is just enough leeway for me. Hermione is pretty useful for this, keeps him grounded and focused.

Having to rewrite some of the mechanics of magic so the magic systems don't contradict was a bit of a pain, but it's been pretty fun as well. Also Wizards vs Aliens is just silly enough that I chuckle at the thought.

*** Does this play with the same ideas as Wand and Shield?

**** I haven't a clue! I haven't read that before. What's it like? (And if I may, is Harry paired with anyone?)

***** Harry is depressed, because he got dumped in a different universe from his, but covers it by being a world traveller. Because he vacations in non-vacation spots (war zones) with no paper trail or support, SHIELD freaks out. They freak out more because he becomes Besties with Tony Stark. They track him, he plays counterspy, he joins the Avengers and the plot goes haywire. It ends just as things get Asgardian.

He is paired with Natasha, but really wants Ginny.

****** Nah, it's in the same universe as his own, and his depression isn't about anything romance related (he didn't get back with Ginny after HBP and he's in a relationship that works for him). His situation is more about trying to find out what he wants to do with his life now that it's not prophesied what will happen now; feels a bit aimless. Although that bit about SHIELD freaking out because he's practically a ghost is really neat, I might just use it. xD

******* The first nine or so chapters will give you really interesting idea of how to do SHIELD interacting with Harry. And Harry poking SHIELD--he thinks lightly--but enough to make everyone freak out.

******** Now I'm really interested. I'll definitely check out the first dozen or so chapters, at the very least. Thanks!

** I want a Harry Potter/The Client List fix where the husband who left at the beginning is a wizard.

The client list is such a trash show that there isn't really a fan base.
