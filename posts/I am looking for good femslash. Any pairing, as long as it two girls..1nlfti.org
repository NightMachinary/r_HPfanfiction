** Here's my favorite Hermione/Luna fic

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things]]

It's M-rated, but heavily plot driven. I can't remember if there's any sexual scenes, but it's certainly not a smutfic.

** /ANY/ pairing? Just for that I wanted to find and give you an Umbridge/Fem! Giant Squid fic.

/I did in fact find an Umbridge/Basilisk slash, but the Basilisk was male in that one./

** Try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] by SlyGoddess. It's like 90% femHarry/Ginny. I remain a staunch supporter of this fic despite its ungodly slow updates and severe bouts of melodrama. The product as a whole is both gripping and satisfyingly mushy, not to mention well-written.

** I'd suggest the collected works of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1039923/fembuck][fembuck]] though her stuff is generally short and gets racy in almost every story.

Here's a C2 for you as well: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/All_Things_Femmeslash/60640][All things femmeslash]]

...and in case you've never heard of it- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]. It's Holly/Hermione, later Holly/Tonks. It's a bit twisted.

It's all HG/GW. I thought I had more as HG/GW is one of my favorite pairings, but unfortunately femslash isn't nearly as common as slash.

*** Thanks!

Do you have any non-femslash, just plain HG/GW romance recs? I really dig this pairing.

****** Ah, well In The Long Run is rated T. I think the others all have some explicit scenes, but they're not the focus. I stop reading pretty quickly if stories are too smut heavy, I'm far more interested in plot.

I found this in my bookmarks though, I forgot to include it before: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound_With_Silver_Threads][Bound With Silver Threads]]. It's LLP/OFC and rated T. [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][This]] is a HG/LL fic, but it's been a couple years since I read it, don't really remember much about it.

And [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][here's]] a femslash C2.
