I'm looking for anything where any main character gets rich and successful by their own effort and not because they inherited 6.022*10^{23} Galleons. Can be anyone, Harry or Hermione preferred. Can also be a time traveler who uses some future information for clever investing or a fan SI who gets very disappointed by the results of the Gringotts inheritance test.


** 6.022*10^{23} Galleons, you say? Why, that's a mountain /and/ a Mole hill.

** It's very rare indeed. Even in 'revolutionary' fics such as "The Sums of Their Parts", Harry still relies heavily on inheritance to fight his wars.

[[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] fics generally features a very rich Sirius Black who bankrolls good guys' political ambitions and war efforts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), is perhaps the only fic I know that has Harry (and Sirius) building up their wealthy by themselves, albeit with illegal means. Basically, both end up in a new dimension. Potter wealth is off limit because the Potters are still alive, and Black wealth has all been squandered. Thus, they play esteemed Wizengamot members during the day, and rob their fellow rich Wizengamot members at night.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

*** A Black comedy was my first thought. my second thought was linkffn('The Havok side of the force') which oddly enough is /very/ similar in style as nonjon's. Is a comedy and if you like all of Nonjon's work, the other fic its for you. It is a crossover with SW though.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** The Arithmancer by White Squirrel does this. Though you may need to get to the sequel for exactly what you want. Great story though and both parts are complete. I also think someone is doing an audio book version on youtube
