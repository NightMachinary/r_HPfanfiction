  What if Harry Potter had a much more mischievous side, one that was locked away thanks to everyone's favorite manipulative old geezer.It starts at the end of Harry's fourth year, as the shock and stess from the events in the graveyard forces him to enter into a magically induced coma. For twelve hours, he's asleep, the trauma of seeing Cedric die and seeing the ghosts of his parents, not to mention the return of Voldemort, breaks down a thirteen year old magical barrier in Harry's mind, awakening a part of Harry long since thought lost.Suddenly, its chaos. the Boy-Who-Lived vanishes with a magical motorcycle and an ancient snake, the death eaters are being harassed in the worst way (You know, fire and destruction), the Ministry is being its usual cowardly self, and Dumbledore is trying to find how it all went wrong.And then, at the start of 5th year, a very different Harry Potter shows up, with an Agenda in hus mind designed to flip the Wizarding World on its head, and the determination to do it.They never saw him coming.
