A Hogwarts where a dorm room had 4-8 different students all sorted to different houses and made to live together to live with different minded people.

Common rooms and library having levels divided by age and year. Prefects from 4 houses rotating keeping eye on young student in their common room while having their own privacy in alloted common room.

Students learning to adjust with different type of people from early on. Great hall being the same with house table and student schedule being same with house division but interaction on personal level being possible for everyone.

I mainly thought about after reading many 8th year fics. Thoughts ?


** It would make a great background setting detail for post war stories.

If the change happens in the middle of a characters schooling then it has more potential as a central story element; the inciting event for a redemption, corruption or coming of age story.

Interesting idea either way.
