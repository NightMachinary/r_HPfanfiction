What if Harry read that first Hogwarts letter, but instead of an admissions letter it was a letter giving him a mission, should he choose to accept it. He acted as a student for 6 years, before his boss Agent 0012, Albus Dumbledore was KIA. Dumbledore has Agent 00SEVERUS kill him in order to keep his cover as an agent of Voldemort. Harry, Agent 00687, was able to give one last report to Agent 0012 after taking an AK to the head. Here's how you read it. You read Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, assume that Harry at some point read that first letter, before allowing Vernon to act as its self destruction function. Then, whenever either Harry, Snape or Dumbledore talk to each other, remember that they are speaking in a code. You can try to figure it out, but I don't recommend it, they are such good spies that even the reader can't tell.

So, read the book with the knowledge that Harry knows about the prophecy, that Harry and Dumbledore and Snape are speaking in a code (the amount of points given or taken do mean something).

This is the story of a young wizard spy becoming an adult.

*** Which is also the prequel to a massively multi-crossover series; this is the version of Hermione in the world of Alex Mack, but the original is still around too.

** Oh damn, I thought this was going to be about a crossover with Harriet the Spy. I'd read that.
