Anybody know of any good fics that feature Oliver prominently? I tend to like longer fics but any recs are appreciated. I have no preference pairings or if the fic is slash or gen. I'm not a fan of character bashing but if the fic is well written I can ignore it. Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] by AMarguerite is not necessarily a Oliver Wood centric fic, but he is one of the main prominent character of this fic. The story is from Percy's perspective in which Percy and Oliver actually teamed up. I absolutely love the espionage type of tone of the fic.
