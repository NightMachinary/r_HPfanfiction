:END:
I remember reading a fanfiction where Voldemort won the first war and harry was abandoned by his parents while they and his brother fled England. Harry ends up going to a wizarding military accademy and Remus becomes his mentor. Harry ends up as a necromancer and with a Harry/Voldemort pairing.
