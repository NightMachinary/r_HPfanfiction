Tired of dark harry giving it back to his parents. But I love the wbwl storyline way too much to give up.

Would love to read a long fic without James and Lily bashing or they are on the path of redemption.

TIA! Happy Christmas!


** “Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin” is somewhat close to what you're asking for. It subverts a lot of WBWL tropes and is generally a really good fic in my opinion.

A few notes:\\
* James and Jim (Harry's brother) start out shitty, but they genuinely improve. And yes, Harry does do a revenge thing, but it wasn't over-the-top.\\
* The prologue is very misleading; it's written to look as if it's fitting into the regular tropes of the genre. If you don't like it, skip it and come back to it later. I didn't like the prologue, but this is still one of my favorite fics of all time.\\
* This fic's tone is a lot darker than canon, so if you have a problem with that this probably isn't the fic for you.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Because it definitely hasn't - the author posts chunks of the new chapters on the discord server for editing advice and the most recent one came out on the 21st.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10639968/1/][Neglentia]] is a fantastic one-shot with two sequels. Voldemort is dead, people are sane, it isn't some absurd Dumbledore plot. Harry suffered from a fairly serious case of neglect, and the plot is about major events where he comes to terms with his childhood.

** Subversion and Boy Who Lived could count; in both, he's experimenting with what's technically Dark Magic, but he has a good relationship with his parents or brother and there's no element of bashing them, and a strong element of brotherhood in both of them.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Voldemort attacked Godric Hollow, James Potter died defending his twin girls while Lily was away. Charlotte Potter was proclaimed the Girl-Who-Lived who destroyed Voldemort, while her twin Harriet was left a squib and sent to be adopted by her aunt Petunia Evans.Ten years later, Hogwarts letters are on the way, and Petunia's greatest fear is that her daughter might turn out to be a witch after all.
