A vaguely horse-like face, a long, craning neck, a bony figure, and bright red hair... James Potter felt love at first sight.


** When James met her after finishing school he knew her good looks ran in the family. Petunia was simply an older more refined form of the beauty his fiancee had.

He cheated on Lily that night and felt horrible about it for days. Until they visited again and once again he found himself falling into bed with her sexy sister Petunia.

For years they kept the affair secret, from both Lily and Vernon.

Until they both came up pregnant at the same time. Petunia had gleefully kept the secret of her affair from Lily all these years.

Lily may have magic but she had Lily's husband in her bed often. It was nothing for James to charm Vernon into not noticing anything was happening. He did it several times a week in fact, along with doing her several times a week.

James arranged for both of his boys, Harry and Charles, to have play dates often. Vernon maybe would have had some suspicions once but James had charmed those away already.

So it was on a cold November morning where she held what she considered to be her half son in her arms. One of two remaining ties of her secret love and vowed to herself.

She would raise the half-brothers together as the brothers they secretly were. Perhaps they would both have magic seeing as their father was such a powerful wizard, in more ways than one she smirked to herself as tear rolled down her face.

*** I think there was a fic awhile back similar to this. Petunia took polyjuice to look like Lily and had sex with James on the couch. Later she became pregnant and never told anyone about it. Somehow Lily found out later, I don't remember much.

This write up though I would love to read a full fic about.
