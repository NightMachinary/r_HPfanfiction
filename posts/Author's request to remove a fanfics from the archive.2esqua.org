Good news everybody... Scratch that, it's not good news.

Hello, i'm the person who is running fanfiction archive [[http://fictionhunt.com/][fictionhunt.com]] - completely automatic system that was created in order to preserve stories that were originally posted to FFN, but were removed by its administration for various reasons. To do that it picks all of the available stories and simply stores them "just in case". It has a very visible link to the original author and a link to the original story. So, no ill intentions here whatsoever. Innocent database that doesn't hide who's the author and doesn't make any money off of any works.

Now, I've received several emails from authors requesting removal of their works, saying that somehow I had to contact every author personally and ask for their permission. Which is not only unreasonable (there're thousands of authors), but simply technically impossible since authors don't have emails or any other form of communication available to the simple robot.

What's your opinion? Should i stand by the original idea and preserve stories no matter what or should i comply with author's wishes?

*UPDATE:* Since posting, I've made number of changes to FH and one noticeable is that story primary link is pointing to the original location on FFN. So please, visit FH before you write your comment.

*UPDATE2:* Website is down for now. We are moving to the other location.

*UPDATE3:* So, website is running again. I've discussed a number of features with couple of users, so that'll be following. Stay tuned. Current email is unavailable, so don't write there. I won't receive anything.


** I think there's a disconnect here--I don't think people going to your site understand what your site's intentions are. It's not clear anywhere that you made it to archive deleted stories, which I think you need to say somewhere. Authors who find their stories on your site may be understandably upset that your site is taking away traffic from their story on FF.net (and thus reviews and follows, etc). Your link to the FF.net story /isn't/ clear; I completely missed that little greyed (FF) and would have no idea it was a link, let alone a link to the FF.net story unless you mentioned it. If the link to the FF.net story were the main link and your archive were greyed and clearly labeled as "fictionhunt archive" it would clear up a lot of confusion.

But even so, I think plenty of authors are uncomfortable with their stories being hosted on sites that they did not personally post on. Mirrors and archives are usually only trouble no matter the intentions, diverting traffic from the original source and inconveniencing authors who no longer want their stories online (sure there's always an archive somewhere, but at least no one so easily accessible). You should handle individual requests of authors the very least--you shouldn't host their content if they don't want you to. It'd be disrespectful and only discourage people from posting creative works online.

*** Perhaps I could suggest that if the site is truly intended as a "backup" version, in case things are lost, that you might switch the links around. This way the primary link, when they click on the story title, would take them straight to the ff.net website, where we have hosted our stories, and can communicate with our readers. Then you can put your backup link, your secondary copy that is supposed to be there just in case ff.net take stories down, as just that, a secondary link to the work, just where the FFN link is at the moment.

Because while these actions you are taking are great, and are appreciated, I do not think we have dealt with the core issue here, which is that you haven't made any attempts to ask for permission. Until that is addressed, the petition will remain. (my suggestion would be that you actually remove the archive links for the stories until you have permission from the authors, which I am aware is a time consuming job that would have to be done almost one at a time, but you have your archive, and that isn't going anywhere. Therefore you have the time now to ask permission properly, before you host stories online without the permission of their authors.)

I do not believe that I am being unreasonable, and nor do the other authors.

********** This cuts both ways. Calm your misplaced righteous fury. If people have to contact you to re-host your work, then /you/ have to contact the rightful owners of each and every intellectual property every time you write anything using something they own!

Add to a story? Contact the owner, get permission. Otherwise, you can't publish it.

Write something new? Contact the owner. They say no? Too bad, you can't publish.

What's that, it's too much work, the author is dead, but the work is still owned by their estate, or the copyright is in limbo, and you can't figure out who owns it? Too bad.

That's essentially your tone here. I for one, do not appreciate it.

Also, what're you going to do, go to a lawyer and get them to shut down the Wayback Machine while we're at it? I'm pretty sure you'd be laughed out of a legal office for asserting you own anything based as deeply as fanfiction in someone else's intellectual property. But hey, mob justice is okay right?

Really? Hmm... the Wayback Machne also honors fanfic author's requests to remove their works and do so. They also honor DMCA takedowns on work that was stolen, also from fanfic authors.. Get over yourself. If it's so bad, why are you hear and obviously reading it.

************ I love how you failed to address any of my other points. Thank you, you fail at reading comprehension. Please start sending letters of inquiry to every author and publishing house that owns any world you've written fanfiction in, post-haste.

Get over myself? If what's so bad? I feel like you're just being angry because you feel personally attacked by this person, whose intent was to make sure that content that was removed by sites who find it objectionable is still accessible somewhere. Obviously, if you're an active author, you'll repost it. But what about those authors who have long-since left whatever fandom they wrote in? Should their work simply vanish forever? Because of your wounded pride, it might.

Now, assuming you're an author whose work has been collected by the robot that assembles that site, and you take umbrage with this fact, you can then e-mail the administrator and have your work removed. Not a huge deal.

But what you're arguing is "Do it my way because I said so." That is not okay.

As for why I am here and reading this thread, it's because I enjoy fanfiction, and I welcome a place where I might be able to someday find an old favorite that's long since gone missing otherwise. I feel I should show my support. If that means arguing with someone like yourself, then so be it.

Addendum: /Everyone/ based in the US honors a DMCA takedown notice. The penalties for not complying are stiff for hosting companies. If, for example you had a Youtube channel, I could file a DMCA takedown notice on your wholly owned and self-created content, and Youtube would automatically take it down. The process for countering a fraudulent takedown notice exposes you individually to the person filing the takedown, since your personal information is required to proceed and file a counter-notification. At no point is the takedown filer required to identify themselves. Abusing a poorly weighted and most-probably broken system is not the way to ensure your wishes are followed.

** I'm torn on this kind of thing. I've read fics that were intentionally taken down by authors before, and I've spread links around to people so they can do the same. Ultimately, I've always felt that one of the largest dangers to the fandom is having stories disappear off the net due to any number of reasons. Ranging from people hosting their fics on blogs that got deleted (the several LiveJournal purges ~5+ years ago), people hosting the fics on personal sites they just stopped paying for as they got older, archive sites going down because there's so little traffic compared to the past, that the person running the site just feels it's not worth it any more. I could go on and on.

I personally took like a 5 year break from fanfiction between 2007 and 2012 (I had been reading since 2000 prior to that), and was really taken aback when I found that Livejournal had pretty much died, and all the old rec lists had stopped being updated. It was a real kick in the pants to find reams and reams of lists with just dead links, and since many of the fics were high quality but not necessarily extremely popular, many of them actually did not have backups online.

It's with that reasoning that I can say that I see nothing wrong with archiving fics without asking the authors first (though I think if possible, a good faith effort to at least find an email wouldn't go amiss). That said, if specifically asked to remove the fics from an author who can verify it's actually their work, you're obligated to take it down. They could legally force you to do so if they wished (though most fanfiction authors don't have the time, money, or inclination to create a legal dispute over it).

TL;DR: No to individually asking every author if you can archive their stories. It's virtually impossible to do so. There are fics that are 15+ years old at this point! Yes to removing stories from the archive if asked, you're virtually obligated to do so.

Also, on a personal note, you're really damn cool for running this archive. I've never used it before, but now I definitely know where to go when I want to find removed fics.

**** I agree entirely with [[/u/Servalpur]]. It's practically impossible to contact everyone and entirely unfeasible. Some people delete a story for personal reasons though, and may not wish for it to be 'out there' anymore, in any form. If those people contact you and ask for stuff to be taken down, then you should do it. It's their work, after all.

Could you not post information on the site just to say that it's an automated system and if an author asks you to take their work down, you will do so?

Other than that, I think your scoop system is actually a pretty good idea. I had been hoping to find the ever-elusive, deleted excentrykemuse fics on there, but regretfully they aren't there... Real shame, that. I've been after copies for ages.

I can entirely see [[/u/marshmallowpuff]]'s point here. It /is/ possible to set up an automated PM system that would reach anyone [who has PM turned on] and at least notify them that their work has been scooped, if not ask for permission. That would allow them the opportunity to email you to have their work taken down--no matter their reason for wanting their work removed, you /should do so without complaint/.

It should probably also be noted that what you are doing isn't actually /allowed/, good idea or not. Be thankful that authors have only complained to you and not to FFNET (who really ought to know that somebody's /crawling/ their archives).

No, quite the opposite. The fanfiction author owns the copyright. So does the author of the original work. It's illegal for either to distribute the work without the consent of the other, and it's illegal for a third party to distribute that work without the consent of both. This is just a section of copyright law that's pretty much ignored most of the time because (a) fanfiction authors can't generally afford lawyers to protect their fan fiction and (b) fan fiction is generally a good thing for the original work's popularity.

***** I don't want to keep cluttering up this thread by essentially reposting the same comment, but I would really like some source on your claim that "The fanfiction author owns the copyright."

Because every thing I've learned about copyright indicated the opposite, and the only mention I've found of a case that examined this question directly claims that the judge dismissed it "with prejudice" - as in, it's so far out that it's not even worth the court's time to examine the details of such claims.

Again, I am always up for being corrected, so if you have actual cases or even opinions of legal professionals to support your claim, I would very much like to read them.

PS. keep in mind that DMCA takedown notices aren't relevant here - I know some fanfic authors filed them, and sites complied - but more often than not this is case of people either not knowing their rights, or website owners lacking means/will to defend themselves.

****** Conceded. [[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf][This fact sheet from USCO]] says that only lawful derivative works are covered by copyright, and for them to be lawful they must be authorized by the rightsholder for the original work. Its definitions of "derivative work" don't apply to most fan fiction -- it talks about incorporating copyrighted material from the previous work -- but a skilled lawyer could probably make it stick.

Assuming Rowling's past endorsement of fan fiction is to be construed as legal authorization, most HP fan fiction is lawful. One can register a derivative work with the copyright office. It appears that there is a separate author listing for the derivative work, which implies a different rightsholder. But that endorsement was not enough to hold up in court.

I'm confused as to why a fantasy world and its characters would count with copyright law rather than, say, trademarks.

Literature always falls under copyright. Trademarks are mostly domain of marketing material.

The 2 aren't mutually exclusive. HP as in a wizard boy in glasses and black hair is pretty known to represent the franchise of Harry Potter - so if I were to promote my new shop by drawing a sign with Harry Potter, signed it Harry Potter's Coffee Shop - Rowling would have cause to challenge me for misusing trademark of the name Harry Potter and probably the general imagery too, despite it being my original drawing.

If I actually went and copied part of a book cover's image for the sign - copyright violation of that image I copied without permission.

In the case of the archive though there is no question that none of the fanfic authors have any trademarked material - since they don't market or trade on any of the content they create in the fanfic.

** As a reader: thank you for your work. Don't see anything wrong with you making backups, authorized or unauthorized of fanfiction.

Especially since you took the step of making first link head to original source so as not to siphon off traffic.

edit. In light of current wave of anger directed at you, perhaps you could circumvent it a bit by not hosting a browsable link of the backup directly for the fics that authors refused to be hosted at your site.

Instead allow users to input a "friendly request" through a small automatic form for an archived fic from your "personal backup" which is than automatically shared to the email address that your new "friend" provided in the request form.

People share stories from their personal backup collections by request all the time like this.

  Instead allow users to input a "friendly request" through a small automatic form for an archived fic from your "personal backup" which is than automatically shared to the email address that your new "friend" provided in the request form. People share stories from their personal backup collections by request all the time like this.

After that it builds a graph with those vertical lines. Each one is one mention (there's also a transparency involved, but that is besides the point).

Email seems to me like the most obvious way to ask for takedown notice without unnecessary complications. Not only that allows author to keep record that he/she sent request, but also in case i'll need to ask something that is more convenient for everyone.

**** more recent, but does it change the original as it relates to this discussion?

this second post mostly examines copyright of fan fiction as in context of fan-fiction author's liability if they attempt to make money of it - summing it up as "plot can stand on its own, with no reference to the worlds, characters, or situations created by the original copyright holder." I have yet to read any fanfiction that would pass that test.

As far as copyrights of fanfiction authors themselves, this quote:

"But if your fan fiction story creates a new work that is based on the original, but transforms it into something new, that story could then be protected in its own right at least so long as it is a non-commercial work."

But the explanation that follows it restricts "new" rather severely. Pretty sure the way she explained it, that any story heavily featuring one of the major HP characters wouldn't qualify.

When I publish something online, I think of it like sending a story to a magazine. You're signing over the rights to it. They have control of it now. Well when you put something on the internet, even though you still retain control of where it is, I think there's an implication that it's publicly available now.

Mostly, I think I don't sympathize with people who take down stories enough. I understand them wanting them to not be "published" as in posted to a site anymore. I get that. Legal reasons, don't want them up there, don't want to be associated with them anymore, etc. But I don't sympathize with people who create marvelous things for public consumption and then deny the public that. I frankly don't care that they have a "right" to the creation. If it was on someone's computer, and never posted then that's different. That's still their private thing. But when you stick it on the internet, it isn't your private thing anymore. It's the public's.

Authors put time and effort in to their work, they place it where they want it and they do not expect it to be taken from them. It is exactly the same as building something, or painting something, it is not right for that piece of art, once it's been removed, to then go on display somewhere else simply because other people want to see it again.

When I put something on the internet, whether it is fanfiction (I have two stories of my own) or something on facebook, original fiction, whatever, I put it on the internet with the understanding that no matter what I do to try to delete it it will be available until the end of time. I thought this was a basic assumption. I guess some people think that you can make things publicly available, like sticking a painting out in the middle of the street, or handing out free copies of a book at a supermarket, and expect to get all the copies back at some point.

In my mind, when you make something publicly available, you do so with the understanding that it will be so forever. If someone put their photograph on a website and later tried to take it down, or handed out copies in the street and later tried to get them back I would have no compunctions keeping a copy for private use or downloading a copy of the photograph to keep for myself.

I cannot believe you are so naive to think that just because YOU believe in a certain thing. As it has already said, when an author posts on the internet it belongs to them. End of story. Good bye. The End. It really is not a hard concept to grasp. The fact that you have continually failed to see that leads me to believe you are not with the rest of us in the real world where Copyright is a well received concept.

Plus, handing something out is a completely different point all together. Publishing something is something you have done, it is yours to own, yours to do as you please with. When you GIVE something out you are doing just that, giving it away. The word give means (in case you missed the concept of giving now) to freely transfer the possession of (something) to (someone). Which means you remove all legal right to it.

To publish means to prepare and issue (a book, journal, or piece of music) for public sale. Which means, unless asked or bought, something that an author has published is not available for anyone simply because they 'want' it. Also, in case you are unaware, the word issue means the action of supplying or distributing an item for use, sale, or official purposes. To which has not happened here.

I don't think it's disrespectful or rude. If I ever removed my work and people were still passing around private copies I would see that as a valid consequence of making something publicly available. If you don't want people to be able to access something, if you want to be able to retract it at some point in the future, don't put it on the internet. I thought this was basic knowledge.

************* You're a special breed of fool, aren't you?

Not your right to have it. Period. Copyright attaches even to fanfics. Period. The authors own them. Period. They decide what's done with them. Period. Even on the internet. Period. Everything is on the internet, including published books. Authors get to remove those, too. As do publishers. Just because 'you' don't mind doesn't meant that carries over. Just because 'you' don't agree, doesn't mean you're right. It just means you're the kind of person that allows this crap to propagate and encourages these people.

It comes down to one simple fact; the person that wrote it owns it and gets to decide what to do with. Your opinion on the matter means nothing. Whether you personally agree means nothing. And they are preserved. The author has them. If they want it shared, so be it. If they want it kept in their desk drawer and for no one else to lay eyes on it, like so many of mine, so be it as well. You have no say so in the matter and your opinions on it count for nothing.

Quit being one of the 'entitled' ones that feel because 'they' want to read it, 'they' should be allowed. You aren't. If you missed the boat, not the author's issue. It's yours. Deal with it and find something else.

This isn't about preserving anything. When you publish, be it a book or magazine, you still own it and have say-so in what's done. It also means for every use they have to pay you, via the internet or not. Doesn't matter. It boils down to not your right to have it. Ask the author. They say no or don't answer, you're SOL in getting it.

Consider this, all of you.

** I agree with what most of the other author's say. I found my stories on your website and that infuriates me. Not only was I never asked for permission; but I would have never granted it. All of my stories are on ff.net, and only ff.net, for a reason. And that reason is largely so I maintain a modicum of control over them.

Technically; too, what you're doing is against the ToS of ff.net. The same ToS that I'm pretty much convinced I'm the only one that actually bothered to read when I agreed to publish there.

But Excerpts!

A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Website, including but not limited to User Submissions (defined below), without FanFiction.Net's prior written authorization.

C. You agree not to access User Submissions (defined below) or FanFiction.Net Content through any technology or means other than the Website itself.

E. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the FanFiction.Net servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.

D. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any commercial purposes.

Also in there as part of the user action is that I do still 'own' my stories. I have granted fanfiction.net the right to use them. That does not mean I have granted a third party the right to copy them. I have not given you any such permission. I can, in theory, take you to court over it. I'm also curious as to what ff.net would do if we pointed out you have a robot essentially mining their information.

It's the same way in the real world. A Hollywood studio can't use a song in a movie without getting the rights. You cannot use my works or do anything with my works without my permission.

You say that asking for permission is unreasonable? It most certainly isn't. Asking for permission is the basic tenant of this type of endeavor. And no; a robot not being able to do it is not a valid reason. If you want the archive; you better get the permission. Don't spout any nonsense about it beinig 'unrealistic' because it's far, far from it.

TL;DR: If an author tells you to remove their stories from your archive. You remove their stories from your archive. And you do so immediately.

They exist so when someone does somethign like this, fan fiction has the legal high ground to do something about if if they wanted to. You're essentially data-mining off of their hosting. I suspect that would concern them.

I'm not going to jump through hoops to get you to rectify something you should have never done in the first place. Given your blatant disregard of other basic thing here, I'm not sure I want you to have any access to my personal information. You could very easily make an account on ff.net. You may even already have one. And you could send me a PM asking for permission to use my works. I would respond to that likely within twenty-four hours. The entire process would take less than ten minutes of effort on your part. Probably closer to two if you have an account already.

And had you done this; you could have probably sold me on the idea. Had it seemed like a passion project for you, I may have gone along with it with some conditions applied. But you didn't make the effort. And you went ahead without consent.

I'm TheEndless7 on ff.net. I've done a sort of AMA on here; I respond to every message I receive on ff.net. I am one of the most accessible fanfiction authors I know. Your laziness in getting basic permission to use others work is not my fault. Remove all of my stories from your archive.

** Super late to the party but eh :P

I write stories on fanfiction, and i'm slowly moving towards Ao3 as well, which is why my opinion on this might be inconceivable for many fanfiction writers

I love the idea of this website. So many good stories get deleted because either someone complained that it was too graphic for a certain site, or that they didn't appreciate the content. not to mention sometimes writers take down their stories and never post them, for reasons their own.

for me as a reader, this can be depressing. i've spent countless time asking authors who have taken down stories that people enjoyed to either re-post them, or if they don't plan to do anything more with their story, to at least let it be spread around for the readers to still enjoy, even if the author themselves doesn't care for it. i love stories, hell i've read hundreds of them, and the thought of them disappearing is terrible.

i've gone on fictionhunt in the past to read stories that have been taken down from other sites, and for that i truly applaud this archive. the fact that i can re-read a story that i thought was lost to me always brightens my day

now as a writer...

i still think the same.

i write my stories for the enjoyment of others and myself, i don't see the problem with my stories being shared around and enjoyed. If fictionhunt is acknowledging that this is an archive, and he's not plagiarizing, than i really don't see what the problem is. it's impossible to ask personally for each author's permission and in my own honest opinion, the stories are being enjoyed and better yet saved.

heck, should something ever happen to the stories i write i would like knowing there was an archive keeping the words i wrote safe.

I write these stories for free, for the enjoyment of myself and others, and really, in the end of the day knowing someone has read my work just makes me happy, call me simple i guess

i know my opinion isn't popular, but that's how i feel, especially since it seems he is trying to fix the site

He thinks this is a "valuable service" and we discussed your site more. The only main problem I have with it now is I don't like the highlighting. I get what you are saying, but I would rather it not be highlight able. Do I just send an email saying to disable the highlighting?

** I'm just going to use an /in fandom/ example. I have all of Rankina's work. Every last bit, in a private file. Her work is no longer online. She removed it, as is her right as the author.

However, what I am doing is vastly different from what you are doing. She left permission for us to share /privately/ her work after she pulled it down.

She. Left. Permission. So I violate no rules by having a private copy that more or less has a share alike agreement on it. I also have a copy of "Forman's Familia". However, I do /not/ have permission to share that work. So it remains a private file.

Your argument, that you are only keeping an archive in case something happens... doesn't hold water. The writer, while not holding rights to the characters in this situation, still does own the unique way the story is presented (more or less the plot for simplicities sake). The author also controls where it is printed/published/hosted.

If I want my LJ to host my work with password protections, that is my choice. Or hosted only to a specific facebook group... again limited only to the group, that is my choice. If I were to pull down all my work? Still my choice.

You need permission from each author. And funnily enough? I leave a public email available on Ao3, which is the ONLY place I post my stuff. My co-written works? Also appear on ff.net. I'm one of the writers angry with you. Reason? My co-writer and I did not grant you permission to host our stuff.

We defend what rights we do have to a derivative work for a reason. We still have that right. If we don't defend it? We lose it (yes this is the trademark argument, but still valid).

** So you created a bot that automatically "preserves" fanfiction without the fanfiction owners' permission or prior knowledge, and you're upset that some authors want you to take them down? I just don't think you're connecting with why we're upset, to be honest.

And, as Bicky pointed out, through ALL of this conversation, never once have I (or any of the FFNet authors in our facebook group) been asked permission for you to host our stories.

Disregarding the fact that it's "too hard" to ask permission individually (I mean, come on, if you want to host our fanfiction you NEED TO ASK PERMISSION, regardless of how you do it), we've all emailed you. So you have our emails. You've talked to us. You've tried to convince us that this is a good thing.

But still you haven't asked permission?

I just don't understand.

Another thing--you're "preserving" the stories. However, the only one who has the right to "preserve" our writing is us. And we have. As Bicky told me, she has "back ups of her backups of her backups". Yeah, they're not online. So what? There's plenty of other fanfiction if, god forbid, something happened to our work. Nobody needs to read our work should we decide to delete it or if it's deleted and we choose not to repost it.

If you really can't ask permission, then you really don't need to be hosting our work. Just saying.

Here's an interesting thing about libraries - by law every publisher in most of the countries has to provide certain number of copies to the state library. That is done so that information is always available freely and is not lost (no matter how bad that information is). Sure, this is not a very similar case, but nevertheless you should see the analogy here - FH is completely non profit. It doesn't make any money, it doesn't hide who is the author or where the original story is. Instead of leaving it be, some of the authors jumped on this bandwagon with pitchforks.

With your analogy of a library? You have it backwards. In this respect the publisher is the "host". The Library is the Internet.

Real World example Harper-Collins does not have right to touch Orbit books. Two different publishers with two different author lists. If Harper-Collins were to try? Orbit would sue them in a heartbeat... because they have no right or legal grounds to touch /their/ writer's work.

So, in this respect, we have chosen our publisher(s). That publisher is not you. The books /are/ available at the library, but do not carry your mark on the spine.

**** Ahh, see, realists would realize just how crazy this whole idea was in the first place and realize how upset it would make people.

No. You did NOT ask permission. I'm sorry, but "explaining the situation" is not asking permission. Never have you said, "Sunset on Heartache, I would like to host your stories on my website. Is that alright with you?" You've simply state that they are there, and said that I could have them removed if I emailed you links. Which I did in my first email. But apparently I need to email you AGAIN, I need to make you comfortable, because this is apparently about you and not all of the authors who are upset you're hosting their works without their permission.

The interesting thing about libraries is that they're full of books that have been published, are original, and whose authors are making money off of them. Those authors have people who will stick up for them should someone "steal" (yes, I am going to say that) their works.

We do not.

We don't make any money off of this.

This is a fun hobby for us.

And people like you make it not so fun anymore. People like you are WHY stories are disappearing off the internet. Has one author who realized what you're doing come up to you and said, "Thank you for hosting my works without my permission"?

It doesn't MATTER if it doesn't hide the author. You're still doing this without anybody knowing about it. While we were contacting authors last night, do you know what one said to me? "This makes me so nervous."

Ughhh. I guess there's one thing to be said about you, and it's that you don't fold under pressure.

Could you explain logic here? I mean, how would a copy of someone works, linking to the original and the author, result in an author loosing his will to write.

That seems like a huge stretch and an argument for the sake of the argument.

****** My works are being posted elsewhere without my permission. I thank you for removing my works, but the point still stands. For example: when an artist has his/her work posted places without his/her permission, they stop posting their work. When a writer finds his/her works posted elsewhere without their permission, why wouldn't the same thing happen?

Harry Potter is about community. It's about being kind to one another because we all love the same thing. But here is a community of authors--friends of mine, fans of mine, people I am fans of--who are being disrespected like this and it's just not okay. I applaud you for trying to make things right now, but a bit of foresight could have prevented this entire situation.

If I take my works down from a site and you (the general you) have a private copy of my works, so be it. But you do not get to distribute it to other people. It is for your eyes only the moment it goes offline. If I say "Feel free to share my works however you see fit, as long as you give me credit", you are then allowed to share my works.

I like the idea of your archive, Kane, don't get me wrong. You did a great job on it. The character footprint is a gorgeous idea. I just don't UNDERSTAND, still. You never asked permission to use our works. Not once was there a "Can I keep your story archived on my site?"...in the email you sent me, you said, and I quote:

"Hi Kimmy. Just so you know the situation not only from your friends' description - FH is an automatic archive that saves all the works from ff.net in order to preserve them in cases when ff.net removes stories for various reasons.

P.S.: I assume the you are aware that all of the stories cite original authors and contain links to the original stories, right?"

You didn't attempt to apologize, ask permission, or anything. You just wanted to tell me that your archive was automatic and my friends were blowing things out of proportion. That is the problem here.

I'm sure half of these authors would be fine if you just asked permission. A little, "Hey, xxx, I'm sorry about that thing I did where I posted your story without letting you know. Can I keep it up there though?" would go a long way.

Thank you, however, for removing my works.
