What's your favourite HP/any crossover? I'm going to take the easy option and go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], a really great Harry Potter/Dungeons and Dragons crossover that's partway through the third book, although it's not updated in a few months.

Milo, a Level 3 Wizard (system is D&D 3.5e) is accidentally summoned into the world of Harry Potter and joins Hogwarts. Features hilarious levels of genre-savvy.

There are some minor changes to the world of Harry Potter - Quirrellmort is actually dangerous, some of the magic items work differently, and the characters seem a little AU, although most of that's explained by the presence of a Wizard.

What makes this truly great is the interaction between Milo, who's an OC but whose journey from plot device to real character is one of the main threads of the story, and the rest of the cast, as well as his innovative uses of magic. Canon is also warped enough that you can't immediately tell what's going on, but it's close enough that the author doesn't create massive gaps they need to fill with wildly AU musings.

** *HP x ASOIAF:* /Black Prince/. Really great writing. Appropriately grim, lots of consequences. Harry doesn't have a wand yet, so there's not much magic happening yet. No wise mentor or fairy godmother to help him along linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious )

 

*HP x LOTR:* /The Shadow of Angmar/. Master of Death Harry, where it is more of a curse than a help. Pretty grim world that he's thrown into. Harry deals with bad, bad stuff and you can't help but feel for him. Author does a great job with the LOTR languages and history. It is refreshing to read a LOTR crossover that is not set during a period covered by the movies because it introduces characters and plot lines that aren't normally touched. Still updating linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

 

*HP x Marvel:* /A New Man/. Middle aged Harry yanked to alternate earth. He's a bit cold-hearted in his attempts to return home (there's a case of pragmatic neck snapping). More recent fic, still updating linkffn(A New Man by Steelbadger)

 

*HP x Sherlock (BBC Series):* /The Case of the Missing Wizard/. Definitely worth a read. It connects the two fandoms in a new way. I've read 10+ of these crossovers and this fic feels unique. Hosted on fanficauthors.net. You'll need to create an account for that site to read ch. 2 due to that chapter's M rating. Recent story, still updating

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I could probably go with Shezza's Denarian series, but to be completely honest, I find it a bit shit, even for all the praise. The action and kick-ass is fun, but Harry is very unlikeable, his Fallen isn't very interesting and the plot is just all over the place. Writing is passable, but its nothing fantastic.

Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod isn't a direct crossover, really, but it's still really fun. Not the best thing I've ever read, but it is nice. It does the eldritch crossover okay, Harry is generally likeable and Padma is an okay sidekick. Good writing, the plot is concise. Could definitely recommend this to someone.

The Gunslinger and the Mage is really fun. Really really fun. The writing is good, the characters are okay and pretty accurate, and its really nice to read a Dark Tower fanfic.

The Prince That Was Promised / The Black Prince is also pretty good. Writing is top-notch, characters are fine and as far as we've seen yet the plot is good. Some unnecessary events and things in the story, and the crossover part is still a bit underplayed, but it has amazing potential, and this could definitely be a favourite.

Natural 20, as you mention, is fantastic too. It may very well be my favourite crossover for the reasons you've listed.

Either way, it's really hard to say what's my favourite. I think, ultimately, it would be Natural 20, as I had the most fun reading that, or Black Prince, for the quality and potential. I really can't say.

****** I haven't read the rewrite in its entirety yet, so I wouldn't know if the little bits of magic from the original were written off. I just skipped to its last chapter to see if it goes beyond the first draft. It didn't.

The first draft was just beggining to introduce the HP Magic, I think. My memory is fuzzy, but I do remember wandless magic and the like, and then one of last chapters introduced a witch doctor who knew about the lithning scar. Then the rewrite came, and it never went beyond what we already know. It is frustrating to think that if only the author continued on with the original, we might know more. But I'm still thankful that its still being continued. :D

******* Do you know why the author decided to rewrite? I haven't heard anything about their motivations for starting again.

 

It sounds like the author hasn't cut out anything he had previously, but just hasn't gotten the rewrite to a point where completely new HP magic happens. I know that in /Black Prince/ there is some wandless magic (more like accidental magic though) and there's some slight foreshadowing when Harry gets an anonymous letter that indicates someone knows the significance of his scar. I think the story will pick up pretty soon.

** On FF.net:

- linkffn(Harveste by kyaru-chan) and sequels are a fun Addams Family crossovers that do a good job with morbid humor. (There is also /Perfect Slytherins/ by Jeconais, IIRC, but I found it to be preachy and bashy, overloaded with bad fanon.)

- linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romantiscue) has Hermione be reincarnated as Sakura (from /Naruto/).

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/]]) is a short and hilarious /SCP/ crossover one-shot.

- linkffn(House, DADA by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) is a funny one-shot crossover with /House, MD/.

- linkffn(The Professor's Journey by AlphaEph19), a /Naruto/ crossover where both Sarutobi and Orochimaru find themselves in the Potterverse.

- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina): Harry is raised by James Bond. Comedy ensues.

Off FF.net,

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is an interesting James Bond fusion, where "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants", as well as Harry and Hermione, attend "Harworts", a school for spies where skill and technology (and occasional superscience) replace magic, run by "Appledore", even while "Death Strikers" terrorist group is making a comeback.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][Yer a Witch, Taylor]] is a technically-not-a-crossover, with /Worm/, where Taylor triggers with powers that mimic that of a /Harry Potter/ witch. Highly amusing.
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/riding-acromantulas-and-understanding-magical-biology-harry-potter-worm.10627/][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]], also a /Worm/ crossover, where Taylor and Amy (a.k.a.

*** The Naruto fics are well written, with developed characters and a solid world building. With A study in magic i feel the same as Prince of the dark kingdom: it deserves to be re-read at least once. It's a really good fic, Sherlock doesn't solve all of Harry's problems overnight and again, contains well developed characters, rich world building and an engaging plot that even when it's half a million words long, lefts you wishing for more. Sadly, it's sequel is a bit slow on the updates.

** All of the fics listed here so far are indeed very good, though I agree with [[/u/SniperGW]] that The Denarian series is somewhat overrated. I would probably have to second Browncoat as my favorite piece of HP crossover, but as a runner-up I'll put forward linkffn(Illusions of Grandeur by Kanathia). This is more of a Supernatural story than a HP story, but it is very well done indeed.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
