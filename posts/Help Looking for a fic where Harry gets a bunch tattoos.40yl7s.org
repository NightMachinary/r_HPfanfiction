I can't recommend it, though. There are some graphic noncon scenes that provide the impetus for Weasley bashing. Not a fan of either of those two things.

** I'm sure you're looking for a specific fic, but I have no idea which one you're looking for so here are some others where he gets tattoos.

I don't remember exactly, but I believe he gets a tattoo or seven in Power of the Mind. I'm going to check the epub file after the bot posts it. linkffn(7441197). The rewrite was never finished afaik. Edit: It looks like it wasn't this one.

There's also [[http://triofqf.livejournal.com/31615.html][Triquetra by Calliope]]. It's on tumblr so no bot link.

Two other characters get tattoos in the Where in the World is Harry Potter Trilogy by nonjon with very amusing results. linkffn(2354771).

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  THIS HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AND IS BEING POSTED NOW. CHECK OUT MY PROFILE TO READ THE, HOPEFULLY, IMPROVED VERSION. What if instead of running to the Leaky Cauldron after blowing up Marge, Harry had elected to stay in Muggle London for the summer. How does one change make a difference? Features an Independent and Powerful Harry.
