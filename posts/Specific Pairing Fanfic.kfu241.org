** Linkffn(Witches of Westfield) is the only harem fic I've read and didn't immediately drop when I realized that it was a multi-ship fic. It does feature Harry/Daphne/Tracey, but also has Harry/Luna, Harry/Hermione, and Harry/Andromeda. The last two are only at the very end, though. It's a pretty good read, too, and does the multi-Lordship thing well.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?
