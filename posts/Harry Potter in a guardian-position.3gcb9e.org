Stories where Harry Potter has a different guardian are a dime a dozen. Stories where he matured enough to become a guardian himself not so much.

Do you know any good completed stories where Harry raises a child/is a teacher/helps a younger self from a different dimension/becomes godfather/etc.?

  Whenever Harry does something drastic, he always ends up in a strange situation. Time-travel-fic.

** These are the nicest and best I've seen so far (though admittedly I haven't read much in this area). They're really great, the first short story, which starts out a little awkwardly, is just sort of an introduction to the second longer one. They are epilogue-compliant, but don't match some of the things JKR continues to share on Pottermore.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.
