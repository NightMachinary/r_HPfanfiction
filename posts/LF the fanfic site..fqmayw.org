** Twisting the Hellmouth has also non-crossover HP stories, but I am not aware of any that isn't found on another site as well.

Spacebattles.com and Sufficientvelovity.com as well as their NSFW sister site Questionable Questing have HP stories in their fanfiction sections.

** For fanfic searching, there is [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]], but it only searches ffnet. Still it's a heck of a lot better then the basic search tool.

If you're into Harry/Ginny, there is [[http://siye.co.uk/]].

You may be able to find some stuff on [[https://www.wattpad.com/stories/harrypotter]], but be advised, that's pretty much scratching the bottom of the barrel. Might be there's gold nuggets down there but I've never risked it.
