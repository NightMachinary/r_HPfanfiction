  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** 1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]]

Harry Potter is rightfully paranoid after all those attempts on his life. So he decides to do something. And I mean, REALLY DO SOMETHING.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]]

How far can you take a fart joke? Can you make it last 16 chapters without...diluting its essence? This guy can. Absolute crackfic that somehow manages to make ONE point of humor extend throughout its entirely without it feeling....stale.

3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/][A Curse of Truth]]

This is a self-insert fic. And it blew my mind. It made me change my opinion of self-insert fics, violently. Not ALL of them are cringefests. This one is...beautifully done.

4. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]]

Amazing story which deals with Voldemort in a rather unique manner. But that's not the highlight of the story. The characters are so well done with such amazing banter and humor that you'll be laughing your head off without this being a crackfic. The author, [[/u/petrificussomewhatus]], is an effing genius with the pen. I recommend reading all of their works, you will NOT be disappointed. Hands down my favorite fanfiction author.

5. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]]

Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. I could tell you how funny this story is...or I could just show you. Here you go.

--------------

Harry and Ron made it to the Great Hall in one piece. When they got there, however, Hermione Granger was waiting. She wanted answers.

"What is the matter with you two?" she asked. "Last week you were perfectly normal, now you're acting all strange. And speaking Spanish? What is this?" she demanded.

"Spanish?" Harry asked. "I still don't know what you're talking about." He shoved some sausage and egg in his mouth and continued to look at her with concern.

"Harry, you've never been good with attention before, and now all the sudden you're Mr. Spotlight!" she snapped. "And you, Ron, have not made one comment about Harry's name coming out of the Goblet. I would have expected you to be angry!"

"Angry?" Ron asked. He also looked at her in concern. "Are you alright, Hermione? You're acting awful funny."

"Me?" she snarled. "You two are being downright crazy!"

Harry and Ron looked at each other, and then back to Hermione. They slowly lowered their silverware to their plates and pushed back from the table slightly. "Listen, Hermione, if you need to see someone about this, we won't think any less of you. There's no shame in seeing a psychologist," Harry said soothingly.

"A psychologist?" Hermione screeched. A few heads turned in their direction in confusion. "I should see a psychologist? I'm perfectly fine! You two are nutters!"

"Listen, Hermione, I've read about this," Ron said, in all seriousness. "Have you had any big gaps in memory lately? Woken up and not knowing where you are?"

"What are you implying, Ronald Weasley? Because I'm fed up with your nonsense."

"I think you're being possessed!" Ron yelled, drawing most people's attention. "By the Devil."

Hermione's face became eerily calm. "You think I am being possessed by the Devil," she repeated. "And what makes you think this?"

"You're hearing things in strange languages. You look like you haven't slept in weeks. You've got a twitch in your right eye. And you study magic, which we all know is of the Devil."

Hermione's face then burned with rage. "We're at a SCHOOL of MAGIC, idiot!" Hermione then let out a frustrated, strangled growl. It was a loud, frightening sound, like that of an angry boar being eaten by an angrier bear that's been sodomized by a dying duck.

"SATAN!" Harry and Ron screamed as they dove over the Hufflepuff table, and under the Ravenclaw table.

"I want my mommy!" Ron yelled.

"I want your sister!"

There was several seconds of silence from under the table.

Then Ron said, "Not cool, man..."

*** I just finished reading A Curse of Truth because it was a self insert and I've never read one outside the notorious My Immortal and knew of their bad rap.

This was an experience I am glad I had. I very nearly cried at the ending it hit me in the feels and was on the edge of...my bed for the last 3 or so chapters.

For anyone interested: I'd say skip the sequel. It's abandoned and kinda ruins the ending of ACoT imo

Anyways thank you so much for these suggestions. I'm planning on completing all of these!!!

Edit: in case it wasn't clear from my post the reason I knew of ACoT was because of you so thank you again!

**** You know how, for some people, reading fanfictions where Sirius spends a happy life with Harry helps to heal the pain from Sirius dying in canon? I felt like I needed fanfictions of A Curse of Truth to fill the gaping void in my soul that the ending caused. That story is one that I'm really glad that I read...once. I don't think I'll be able to read it fully again. Too damn painful. And you can't even blame the author for killing unnecessarily, it makes perfect sense considering the overwhelming odds William was facing.

If anything, the sequel made the pain even more intense. It just emphasized all over how he was gone from that world and would never return.

** Harry Potter's Second Chance.

It's on AO3 and has elements that I know some people really don't like (Severitus, Dramonie, an original character) but it's absolutely fantastic. There's one tiny sub plot towards the end that I think it could have done without, but I love it and have read it a good number of times.

The "A Very Slytherin Harry" series is also great.

I also read a very good one that has the Dursleys as decent people who are cool with magic - I can't remember what it's called but Vernon becomes the Muggle Studies professor and regularly shoots Death Eaters with a blunderbuss. I think I liked that because "nice Dursleys" is an underdone concept.

*** Cauterize is the right answer.

Everyone's responding with stuff that ranges from painfully fanfic-y to reasonably good, but still stuff that would be kind of embarrassing to recommend to someone who isn't already sold on the fanfic enterprise.

Cauterize is the kind of thing you could hand to someone, say "this was written by Rowling and posted online, but never actually published anywhere" and they'd read it and love it and ask for more. Then you could spring on them, "actually its fanfic, but it's amazing, right? Wanna read more?"

Then, depending on their preferences, you could hit them with post-canon or pre-canon or Alexandra Quick or whatever.

  Voldemort was too obsessive and too picky not to have had all seven horcruxes (including a Gryffindor relic) completed when he moved against the Potters in October 1981. So he didn't stay dead at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and things got very, very bad. Ancient magic returns a 20-year-old Hermione back to her 15-year-old body, and she must set up complicated plans in secret to ensure the end of the world doesn't come to pass. Her first goal is to stop Voldemort before his body is restored, but she cannot do it alone. She must enlist the help of at least one of the champions of the Triwizard Tournament if she has any shot at stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in the process. And she is as surprised as anyone when she finds love along the way.If you enjoy Fleurmione stories, sibling dynamics between Hermione and Harry, or time-travel fix-its generally, this is the story for you!I make no promises about any kind of an update schedule. If you're a fan of any of my other works, you'll know I can be all over the place. Sorry! But I'm a busy lawyer.

**** It depends. If you want to read about Harry and co., then you'll probably be very disappointed. It's not the British Wizarding World and doesn't try to be.

But if you want to read something that's really well-written and constructs a really well-done world, and are forgiving of a very abrasive protagonist and brash Americana, then the quality speaks for itself.

A lot of people don't like it for subjective reasons, so I can't give you a full-hearted recommendation. But it's certainly worth starting, most people have a strong opinion of it within five chapters.

** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin (or anything else by the author) linkffn(9911469)

It's female!Harry but it's unlike any other fic I've ever read. It's really hard to explain what the fic is about, but it's a wonderful foray into absurdism but still serious enough to keep your attention. It might not seem like everyone's cup of tea, but it's extremely worth a read! It's unfinished but being updated quite regularly.

The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter (and its sequels) linkffn(7613196)

A crossover with The Song of the Lioness (although you don't nead to have read it to be able to follow along - I haven't). It's a world where Voldemort has won, but through political means, and now muggleborns and half bloods aren't allowed to go to Hogwarts. Harry, however, wants to go, and her cousin (Sirius' son) wants to go to America where Harry is supposed to go to school, so they switch. It's on book four, it's absurdly long but still being updated semi regularly. The plot is very intricate and gripping, and I couldn't recommend it enough!

The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501]])

This might be a bit controversial cause I know a lot of people don't like the pairing (it's Tom Riddle/Harry Potter), but even if you don't, I still think it's worth a read. The pairing isn't central to the plot at all, not the romantic part of it at least, and it's an extreme slow burn (it has 400k+ words and it still hasn't happened). It's again one where Voldemort won and Harry grew up in that regime, but the setting is much darker than the last one - most of the world does believe Voldemort's propaganda. What I find so fascinating and why I'm putting it here is how the author presents Harry, someone with a very strong moral compass, living in such a misguided world. He knows something is wrong, but he's grown in the environment so it takes /a lot/ of effort for him to figure out what it is. Again, even if Tomarry is not up your alley, it's still worth a read. Ongoing, but updates semi-regularly.

Evitative by Vichan linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]])

This one I've read a couple of days ago, but I'm putting it here because it has amazing characterisation! It's a slytherin!Harry, but a one where he gets resorted due to a mishap in the summer before fifth year. What I like about it is that it has apsolutely no bashing - all the Slytherins seem in character and their friendship with Harry seems natural, and when he ends up a little at odds with Ron and Hermione, it again seems natural and nobody is villainized. It's tagged as Dark!Harry, but it's one of those fics where dark magic is just a type of magic and not inherently evil (maybe, or it might be the case of unreliable narrator, it's yet to be seen). It's complete, but it seems there is a sequel in the works.

The Changeling by Annerb (and its sequels) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]])

A slytherin!Ginny fic, with the endgame of Harry/Ginny. I /love/ Ginny's character here, and the way author portrayed the Slytherin house. It has themes of female empowerment which is a nice touch, and it really sold me on the slytherin!Ginny perspective. It's complete.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

Implied WolfStar right now, and actual WolfStar later on I assume. Author is currently posting book 2.

About Teddy and his OC friends. Same author as Alexandria Quick series. Very good. Actually has plot. Author /might/ do a sequel some day.

Sad at times but really really good. Worth a read. Harmony but even if you don't like that read it anyway bc I really don't like Harry/Hermione but it's still good.

***** I first read it in 2009 and it already felt ancient by then, but, I do still rate it highly, if for no other reason than nostalgia. 2004-2007 fielded a lot of unique stories that haven't really been duplicated in scope.

**** It's garbage.

C- or D+ even by the forgiving standards of fanfic "comedy". Terrible mechanical writing, bad characterization, and humor that would barely pass muster at lunch in the junior high cafeteria.

It baffles me that it is so commonly recommended, and its value lies not in the story, but as a litmus test: if this person highly recommends Make a Wish or Harry Crow or Stealing Witches, then I can safely ignore them.

***** I'd characterize my problems with these three differently.

MaW is just low effort. He just kinda didn't pay attention to if he made Harry super OP or not from scene to scene, etc

Harry Crow is massively self indulgent. Letting Dumbledore and the Weasleys be super stupid and evil, making his OCs so powerful that no conflict could ever exist, making his goblins his first approximation of "warrior culture". Still, fanfiction should be fun to write so fics like this have their place.

I haven't read Stealing Witches but it's Old Harry getting a big ole pedo harem, isn't it? That's kind of its own thing

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]] - fast-paced plot and good execution place it at fourth on my list.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]] - excellent story, riveting action leads to its position on this list, hampered slightly by its nature of being a humor story - very mild suspension of disbelief is required in some parts.

** Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

Ongoing: Before I read Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. A classic.

Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: Astronaut!Ron, CleverGirl!Hermione, and the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  "I'm not lying!" Arthur yelled and while his knights all nodded, he could see the slight roll of their eyes. "She's real. I swear on my life she is!" He tried again. Gwaine outright laughed. Arthur really should just behead him. That would solve everything. "What's her name then?" Leon asked reasonably. Arthur stared. "My lord, is it...At all possible she might have just been in your head?" He asked, gently. Arthur felt his mouth drop. "I am not crazy!""Well..." Merlin began and the prince turned to glare at him. "I've watched you try to put on a shirt, sire.""He said crazy. Not incapable." Elyan murmured and immediately winced when Arthur gaped at him. "Sorry, I...Sorry." He offered weakly. "You're not crazy." "Just incapable!" Merlin smiled. Arthur hated everyone and swore on his life he would find this damn lake lady even if it was the last thing he ever did.OrArthur comes across a beautiful woman near a lake who likes to talk about her husband a lot. Nobody believes him except Merlin (aka Freya lives).

  “You do know you're picking those up later, don't you?” Gamora raised her eyebrow as she moved towards him, stepping over the clothes that he had so carelessly tossed onto the floor.“Don't I always?” Peter asked, stroking his beard in a mock philosophical manner.“No, usually you leave them lying on the floor for yourself to trip on in the middle of the night.”-Whether it was one of those days when they were both just utter desire, rough and taking what they wanted from each other, biting and growling and fucking. Or one of those days that were all care, gentle whispers of sweet nothings, tracing loving lines into sensitive flesh with diligent tongues, kissing the palms of hands, murmuring praises with every brush of their lips. His hands were always so warm.-“Are you okay?” She asked again, carefully approaching this time. He didn't shy away from her.Peter nodded. “I'm fine. Sorry, I didn't mean to- to do that.”-“You've never told me that before,” she pointed out.“Well, I have a lot happier memories to tell you about,” Peter said, grabbing her hand and playing with her fingers almost as a way to distract himself.

  The Dark Lord wanted a consort and had decided to host a competition that involved nearly everyone in Britain. If they thought they were good enough, they could enter to compete in a certain amount of tasks set by the Lord of the lands himself. Only the victor would have the skills necessary to become Voldemort's consort. Harry unfortunately nabs the Dark Lord's attention. Voldemort does as he pleases.Hermione enters to win, Bellatrix takes interest in certain people, and of course there's the villain causing trouble.A/N: SLASH/Harrymort/AU. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how this sounds like Harry is a slave. Please do so. Nothing at all would suggest it. How about we don't assume that because the word "consort" is involved, it must *obviously* be about slavery. Does anyone actually know what a consort is?

** These are my favorites of all fics, that I can name off the top of my head that I haven't seen anyone post:\\
Lord of Darkness - A refreshing change of pace from all the authors that feel a compulsive need to nerf the MC or buff the antagonists, this story focuses on a character who is the most talented, charismatic and powerful being in the world and how the world reacts to him and he reacts to his place in the world, the MC feels like an actual person despite being a blatant wish fulfillment fic.

Core Threads - Insanity on top of insanity, this I found hilarious once I got past the cringe beginning.

Basilisk Born - This is here because I really liked how the story showed the ways the MC influenced the present and past.

Itachi, is that a baby? - A crackfic that is still hilarious.

Fate's Gamble - Another unrepentant OP MC and how everyone reacts to him and how he gets stronger, I really liked all the creativity on tying elements together.
