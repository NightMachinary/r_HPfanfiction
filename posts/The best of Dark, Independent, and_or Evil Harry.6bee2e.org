I've been losing fuel when it comes to these stories and I simply can't bloody bear anything where it's all sunshine and rainbows for nearly five chapters through (the only way I've been able to bear writing is due to the fact that it contains themes that I'm rather willing to explore).

Please no slash, please let it be completed, and I'd honestly prefer Harry to be in Slytherin, though I wouldn't be opposed to him being in other Houses (i.e. A Cadmean Victory)

** linkffn(10493620) Ruthless is sort of the gold standard in my book. Excellent version of motivated!Harry who really doesn't let stuff like niceness and laws get in the way. Complete, but not very long.

It all depends on how exactly you define 'evil' and 'dark' though. Some people think 'evil' means 'I punch babies for.. literally no reason. Just for fun.' but that isn't evil; that's retarded.

Similarly 'dark' does not mean 'I spend at least twenty minutes of every day bemoaning how cheerful and obvious all these preps are, ugh, I'm the only person who's really /awake/ to the reality of the world'.

linkffn(11634921) Itachi, Is that a Baby? is very cracky, but features a Harry who was raised by mercenary assassins and gives absolutely zero shits about this 'morals' thing everyone seems to feel is so important, but just seems to get in the way of him being paid to murder people a lot. Ongoing, and the author has become a bit erratic recently so...

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is arguably a dark!fem!Harry, because from an outsider perspective she is a schizophrenic sociopath. It might not quite hit your buttons though, because she isn't /mean/ about it, she just quite bluntly tells people that they aren't real and she doesn't really care if they get eaten by her abomination from the bounds of space and time. Fair warning, it is ongoing, but the author is pretty reliable.

linkffn(6985795) Xerosis is one I... seem to recall being good? It's been a fair while since I last read it, but I think the evil!Harry is done pretty well there. Complete, at least.

linkffn(10685852) On a Pale Horse sort of stretches the definition of 'Harry' since he's a billion trillion years old Master of Death Harry dropped into something like canon 5th year summer. Dead, and incomplete, but it doesn't really end on a cliffhanger or anything...

** Well, I believe that one of the best (if not the Best) Dark Harry's would be linkffn(Lesser Evils by Scott Press). I would say this is because

1. The moment/time that Harry begins going down the Dark Wizard path makes the most sense for a canon-divergent series.

2. The absolute /best/ characterization of utterly minor/nearly non-existent characters from canon (Mulciber and Podmore).

3. A far more mature look at what the Dark Arts is and what it means to be a Dark Wizard than you'll see in probably 99% of other fics (even with the sort of angsty start (which will apparently be explained in either the direct sequel or the final of the trilogy (I assume the scar horcrux will somehow be involved))).

4. The writing itself is far more mature than what you commonly see with dark!Harry stories such as The Nightmare Man, A Cadmean Victory, The Sum of Their Parts, Aspirations, Too Young to Die, literally every fic that contains the "Wingardium Leviosa is a dark spell if you use it to kill someone" bullshit, all of jbern's fics, all of Darth Marr's fics, and so on.

5. Harry isn't perfect and always right in it. Rather, he often chooses the absolute wrong or dumb thing to do.

Of course, it isn't perfect, and your mileage on it may very. I didn't get into it the first couple times I tried reading it, but on the third or fourth go I just couldn't stop. Here's the points where it either meets your request in the OP, or doesn't.

- It /definitely/ isn't sunshine and rainbows ever.

- The only slash involves a cutting curse or bladed weapon being used on someone.

- Complete

- Harry is not in Slytherin, because this fic diverges off from canon, with a few changes to how certain things in the HP world work. I guess you could call it AU?

I'd say give it a shot.
