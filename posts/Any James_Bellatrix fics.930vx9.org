Prefer story-heavy, but curious to see what's out there. Any era is fine.


** I've seen Bella/Harry's, hell even a handful of Neville/Bella but I don't think I've come across James/Bella

** I had one favorited but it was deleted =/ Don't know why, it was a pretty good fic. It had Harry finding out Bellatrix was his actual mother and that she had been cursed to become batshit insane (by Rodolphus, I think??). It also featured a dark Harry and an endgame of H/G....with maybe some heavy bashing of Lily, Dumbles, and Ron lol
