As for the others, the savagery Harry showed in linkffn(the lies that bind) is kind of hard to top. Seriously, Bellatrix raped by a rock golem, Pettigrew gets eaten by a cat who is actually a transfigured Draco Malfoy, Voldemort's own brain gets turned against him.

***** tbh this subtext makes sense when you think about it. i just think jk held back from explaining it because her publishers would pull the book funding because they didnt want kids reading this stuff and typical cis parents freaking out. kind of like how she revealed dumbledore was gay long after the series was finished - but the clues were always there. anyways why am i being downvoted for telling the truth? reddit hates lgbt community that much, huh? bunch of cissys. if you don't think that snape had repressed gay feelings for an underage boy (totally understandable, given his position/situation) then you need to get your head checked. :rolleyes: /rant

**** Unlike you, I've read the books. And I really f***ing hate that "logic", because according to it crimes like rape and domestic violence are totally okay as well, since most domestic abusers or rapists hasn't lived happy, stable, peacefull lives.

I bet that you, as a Snape-apologist, would say this to a rape victim: "You must forgive him. He's just unhappy. Just forget the trauma he's put you through. Also, don't forget to name one of your kids after him!"

And you, Snape-apologists, wonder why I hate you and find you disgusting ...

He still did it lol. A person's past doesn't excuse their actions it just makes it easier to understand them.

** Turning this around a bit, in linkffn(7058590) Snape doesn't seek forgiveness because he doesn't think he deserves it. I think it's one of the best shorts out there.
