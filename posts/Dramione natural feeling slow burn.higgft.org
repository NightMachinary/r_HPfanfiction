I made a world building fic. It has rough hints of romance. Im 200k words in and I'm now realizing they should have just stayed friends. I'm great at writing friends. I'm also servicable at writing smut but were T.

Im trying really hard to avoid the unhealthy tropes like confessions in anger, without actual direct consent on both sides (so no random sleep attacks), avoiding jealousy spurns ect.

In any event I need a natural feeling fic to inspire me. I only have maybe 15k until the end and I've managed the build up fine but its kind of at the point where it all tumbles in to place and the current iteration is just... too quiet. And I guess thats normal but it feels flat you in know.

Anyways assist please.

Only hard Nos are cross overs.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP. Now complete with epilogue.

  "It's a veritable PTSD tour. With pastries. And hand-skimmed clotted cream. And Hermione has no idea why she's doing it, but it's becoming very apparent that she is." Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both. [COMPLETE, DRAMIONE]
