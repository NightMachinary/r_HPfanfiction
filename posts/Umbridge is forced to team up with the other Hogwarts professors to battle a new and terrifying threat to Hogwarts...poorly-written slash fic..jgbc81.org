/BY ORDER OF THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR/\\
/Any student found to have written and distributed explicit literature will be expelled./

--------------

/"You're a filthy half-breed." Umbridge declared./\\
/"And you're a filthy human." Bane the centaur answered./\\
/Umbridge nodded slowly and dipped her head, "By all rights, we should hate each other, but..."/\\
/"I know." Bane finished, "Despite being a filthy human...you're the only one who thinks like me."/\\
/The large rugged centaur stepped forward, carefully taking Umbridge's smaller hands in his./\\
/"I loathe you." he whispered./\\
/"I loathe you too." she whispered back, before pushing forward and pressing her face into his chest./

Firenze's eyes widened as he read the parchment that had somehow snuck into his office, as it proceeded to describe Umbridge's downright lewd romp with centaurs.\\
"Who in the world wrote this...?" he wondered aloud, before additionally pondering, "I did not think Bane was that negative towards humans..."

--------------

Severus Snape read to the end of the parchment with raised eyebrows, before he pulled out a self-inking quill.\\
/P/, he marked it, /Acceptable spelling but poor grammar. Weak consistency of character, Dolores Umbridge is unlikely to compliment anybody. Narrative doesn't do enough to describe environment, except during bedroom segment (strongest part of story)./\\
He underlined one of the passages with a note, /'the iridescent shimmering of his well-oiled mane', nice turn of phrase/, before rolling the parchment up and sending it to the Gryffindor common room (home to whom he considered the most likely culprits) with a wave of his wand.

--------------

Hagrid's eyebrows furrowed as he slowly read the parchment that had found its way to his hut. He tilted his head after reading a bit more, then pulled a face after reading a bit after that.\\
Finally, after reaching the end, he put the rude piece of literature down.\\
Then he went to find a copy of Playwizard and a tape measure.

--------------

"This is really getting out of hand," McGonagall complained as half a dozen more 'slash ficlets' dumped themselves on the staff table, "The worst part is that it's probably one of our students writing it! Who would spend their time thinking about their teachers in...this way?"\\
Flitwick just nodded understandingly as he poured out another cup of tea, before a sudden thought occurred to him, "You don't suppose it could be one of the house-elves? Or even one of us?"\\
"I certainly hope not," McGonagall shuddered, "Though, I do notice that a good half of these 'fics' feature our /esteemed/ High Inquisitor, and it's no secret what the student body thinks of her..."\\
Flitwick paused for a moment, then waved his wand to conjure a deerstalker's hat and a pipe, "A motive, then? It seems we have a mystery."


** Plot Twist: The writer is Luna, she's practicing for her new fanfiction column in the Quibbler.

Edit: In a failed attempt to keep the paper news appropriate, she replaced all the swear words with substitutes.

/"Freak me! Freak me harder, Bane!" Dolores screamed as Bane thrust his ding-a-ling into her hoo-hah./

*** My favorite part too. Seems OOC to me, but it's a fanon version of Snape that I can appreciate. It's like how he would be if he got the chip off his shoulder and lived past Voldie dying and healed from his trauma.

**** "Bother me not with thine aisine philosophies!" elucidated Dolores, her clothes failing miserably at suppressing her ecplicit physicality as she moved to embrace the target of her affection "For here we are, and verily I shall not be letting this opportunity escape!"

The words were soon put to action as the generously proportioned, if not particularly esthetically pleasing, female specimen made a valiant attempt to despoil the centaur in a fashion most grievous, and proving once and for all the superiority of good breeding.

The guardian of the forest did not wait, for he sensed that nothing good would come from this encounter. With a clatter of hooves, he shot across the stone floor, jumping down entire flights of stairs in his flight from a fate most foul. T

he wood was thick, hard. It was presented to all and filled them with awe, refusing to shrivel and die even to the foulest of dark magick, standing alive and proud like the Hogwarts catsle instead.

And yet, it failed now, felled by equine self-preservation instinct as a centaur burst right through the oak door and took off in the direction of Forbidden Forest, swearing by the gods old and new to never again to consent to assist Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore in his ill advised schemes to bring about peace, prosperity and interspecies understanding.

Headmaster, watching from his ivory tower, shook his head sadly at the unfortunate desertion. 'That little prick!' The potion had been expensive, after all.
