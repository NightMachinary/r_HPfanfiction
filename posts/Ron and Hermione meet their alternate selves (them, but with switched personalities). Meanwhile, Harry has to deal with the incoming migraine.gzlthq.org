How would such interactions go? How would Canon!Hermione react to a version of herself that is basically Ron, and vice versa? Likewise, would Switched!Hermione and Canon!Ron get along?

What the hell would Harry do? Mediate? Get a drink?


** Canon Ron and Switched Hermione would just lay around lazily playing chess of which each game would last hours.

Canon Hermione and Switched Ron would get into the biggest dick measuring contest ( in terms of knowledge ofcourse) of all time ever.

Harry would get drunk as there would be nothing he could do.

  What if Ron was the know-it-all bookworm while Hermione was the lovable prat? In a world without Voldemort, seventh year Ron Weasley is on a mission to enjoy his last year at Hogwarts while trying to ask his crush out. Hermione Granger wants to do well for her NEWTs and ask her crush out. Can they help one another? Non-canon obviously, with some characters being OOC. Chapter 19 up.
