** Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity. The author literally says it's inspired by Dexter. It is slash, but verrry slow paced, and not the focus of the story at all. The description is: "Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned."

  When he witnessed the murder of his parents, the darkness got in him. Dumbledore took him in, taught him the best he could, and when it was clear the darkness was in too early, Albus taught Harry how to hide it, and how to get away with killing. AU based heavily on Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. Update: New sections in chapter 5.

** Huh. I had something written up for this (A) a few years ago because I'd read other tries and didn't like any of them.

It never got anywhere because I couldn't put anything down except a bunch of scenes all throughout the years - I never got any actual story to be the connective tissue between them. So I had plans and places where I wanted to go, but no path to get there. 40 pages of bits and pieces of (to riff on the Dexter books' names) Horribly Hollow Harry. I was younger, it stuck.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff
