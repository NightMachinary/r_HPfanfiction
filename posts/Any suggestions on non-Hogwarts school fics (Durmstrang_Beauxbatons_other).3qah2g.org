I've already read the Alexandra Quick series (which I recommend). I'm just looking for something that explores the other schools in the HP universe.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by The Santi) is a classic that you really should read. In my personal top 5, and at least in the honorable mentions of other people lists of best fanfics ever. It has, arguably, the best OC in fanfiction and has plenty of great moments and parallels to canon. And while some complain that Ron and Hermione are portrayed badly in this one, I think it's of their best portrayals of them ever.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** How dare you! You, you! It's... It's unfinished (abandoned maybe?)! And it's so good! Thanks for the recommendation! Usually I hate when Harry is super wizard extraordinare, but it was interestingly done.

**** I should have warned that, also i should probably mention that the auther has a puplic draft up on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][Dark Lord Potter]] that goes all the way til Jule Ball fourth year. Just know to acces this site you need accounts, legitimacy and prove you aren't gonna steal it. (Has happend) Also these chaptors are a draft, and it can be slightly seen, so treat it as a beta for whats to come. (The auther has recently become a bit more active) Here are a few links to some DLP modderators explaning the shutout. I will personally recomend going through the hastle.

** There's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][The Irish Choice]] where he leaves Hogwarts for an OC school in Ireland.

I'm hesitant to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4060448/1/Defender-of-Beauxbatons][Defender of Beauxbatons]] because it's both a) Super!Harry and b) abandoned, but damned if it's not entertaining.

It was a surreal read for me as it's not often I read a story set in a location I'm acquainted with.

***** Same. I wish they explored Minnesota more, going to Wabasha street caves and finding ghosts or Devil's Kettle. Plus all the Native history, it could have been much better on that front, but it was about Harry getting away and solving Voldemort.
