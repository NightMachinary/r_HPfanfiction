Hi guys,

I recently read the Year Like None Other and loved it. I especially liked the last few chapters which were about Harry's self-harm and Severus finding out and helping him. Now, I'm looking for a fanfic which is centred around that. So I'm looking for a fic in which Harry is self-harming and Severus either as his father or a mentor helps him. I would prefer something longer rather than shorter :) Also no snarry, but Drarry is fine :) thanks!


** Digging for the Bones by paganaidd ticks all your boxes. Warning: has a pretty depressing beginning.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

*** Man these two stories are so good, good to see both mentioned. I haven't been in fan fiction for long time

** There are a ton of these, but I think I can give you the ones I found were more tolerable and in-character for Snape and Harry:

- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): Snape and Harry are better characterized and canon-like (ironically in an almost completely AU world), with some wonderful banter and interactions that are second only to Harry and Voldemort's mentor-student relationship here. Highly recommend, the sections in 5th and 6th year are truly moving.
- linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar): a post-OOTP divergence where Snape takes a more active interest in Harry's behavior, with a still canon-like characterization (or at least believably so) of the characters.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): Harry has several mentor relationships, but his one with Snape is perhaps the most prominent, especially in 1st year. Snape and Harry are fairly OOC, but so is the world in general.
- linkffn(The Weapon Revised): not so much Severitus as Harry and Snape building a relationship through interaction, as a way of distracting one another from their respective tasks in the war.
- linkffn(The Best Revenge): more OOC than others, but the writing is decent and its nice as a Harry adopted by Snape fic that doesn't bash overtly or do things over-the-top (ex. the Dursleys are still garbage people, but their not breaking Harry's bones everyday or drowning him).

Wyste - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter & the Problem with Potions]]

Edited to add - Oops, neither of them have self harming Harry. The first is Snape as Harry's mentor, when Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys. The second is Harry loving potions beyond anything else, to Snape's irritation.

Please have a look, they are both wonderfully well written and have interesting premises. Otherwise, Paganidd's fic below is a good one.
