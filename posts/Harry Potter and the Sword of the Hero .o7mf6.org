** (Might have some mild spoilers if you haven't read them) I read these a few years ago, and while I tried my hardest to like them, I just couldn't do it. I'm not completely certain why, but it could be because of how ridiculously powerful everyone gets. That, and that by the end there are so many OC's, it is hardly Harry Potter any more.

*** Yeah, joe is a really talented writer, but I feel he lost sight in all the epicness towards the end.

His other works are brilliant though, especially [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Wastelands]].

**** The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

I can attempt to do a more in depth summary if you would like.

** That is a very good fanfiction story, fond memories of reading that one although it seems longer than 4 years ago.
