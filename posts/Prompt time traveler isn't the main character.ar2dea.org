Someone goes back in time to fix things and tells first year Harry about it


** There's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers][Far Too Many Time Travelers]]. It has the exact plot you described, except that more than one time traveler makes the trip linkffn(6728900).

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** I would suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything][30 Minutes That Changed Everything]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5480014/1/30-Minutes-II-The-Gathering-Storm][30 Minutes II, The Gathering Storm]] (currently on hiatus/ possibly dead).

Future!Harry sends a non-physical version of himself back in time to talk to his younger self. The resulting half-hour delay causes a massive butterfly effect.

While it's not a Bash!fic, it does paint Hogwarts in a less-than-flattering light. However, the sequel has one of the best detention scenes I have read with Harry being forced to teach a lesson on Potions and doing so well that the resulting Blood-replenishment potions are considered good enough for use in the infirmary.

Naturally, Severus concludes that Harry was specifically taught potions by Sirius and Remus with the aim of showing him up.
