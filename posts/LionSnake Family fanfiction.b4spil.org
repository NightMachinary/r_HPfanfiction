Ok, so, this was a long time ago, like, maybe 2005-ish? I'm looking for a fic where multiple adult HP characters are in one polyamorous relationship. The only details I can remember are that 1) more than 4 adult people sleep in the same bed, and 2) they decide to send their children (who were OCs) to Hogwarts under the family name Lionsnake.

I believe some of the characters were Sirius Black, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, and Lucius Malfoy. I don't remember if Harry was a major player in this fic or not.

Can anyone help me find this old work? Trying to show my boyfriend for old time's sake!!

*** Thank you for your suggestion! Unfortunately, this isn't the fic I was looking for. It is a very interesting read, though :)
