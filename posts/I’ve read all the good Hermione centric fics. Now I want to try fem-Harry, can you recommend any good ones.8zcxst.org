AU, or not. Crossover or not. Any pairing. As long as it's not crackfic, or not like randomly gender swapped mid story. What I want is female from the beginning Harry.

If you have any you'd recommend, thank you so much!

** linkffn(10942056) Female Harry adopts Tom Riddle and attracts the attention of Grindelwald.

linkffn(12383390; 12323781) The original got abandoned briefly and picked up by a new author but then the original author came back, so now these two Eragon crossovers have the same first 9 or 10 chapters and then diverge. Both are surprisingly good considering one isn't the original author and the other had a long hiatus.

linkffn(12713828) Female Harry sorted into Slytherin and friends with Susan, Daphne and Pansy. Only covers first year so far.

linkffn(12760426) Lily's protection becomes sentient and helps guides her. Has covered first year then greatly diverges from canon with some reveals and her not returning to Hogwarts. Contains world building. This author's other works are good and female Harry also but sadly on hiatus.

linkffn(11517506) Female Harry sorted into Ravenclaw and friends with Hermione, an OC named Nigel, and Morag MacDougal. Radicalized Gryffindor and Slytherin. Lots of world building, particularly the goblins. Unique story.

linkffn(11488630) Female Harry ends up in Slytherin starting as a 3rd year and is friends with Luna, Hermione, Daphne, and the Weasley twins. Contains Greek myth and pirate elements.

linkffn(11024296) Female Harry is daughter of a still unnamed Greek goddess and a Mesopotamian god. Deals with more than just Greeks. Has gotten through Hogwarts, Voldemort fight was very satisfying. Hasn't gotten to Percy Jackson stuff very much.

Someone has already linked Parselbrat.

This list is getting long so here's a couple more: linkffn(9486886; 11602420; 11437578)

** Well, I guess I can link my ongoing story here, but that depends if anyone can call it "good" or not. It is an entirely post-hogwarts, completely original story with a lot of worldbuilding (because I love to worldbuild), and it contains a lot of serious and "realistic" life issues and situations inside all the adventuring. That's the main thing I wanted to do with it, is show how life is: chaotic, and stressful, and horrible, and sudden, just as much as it can be great and fun and relaxing and happy, and how it's all intermixed.

People live, die, suffer tragedies in the blink of an eye and that's just how it is. You can't go back, you can't change it. It's just happened, and it's gone, and that's that. A lot of characters, even ones considered "main" characters are going to die in a heartbeat, and in a stupid way like a car crash, or getting a rock thrown at their head, or a random assault or attack.

My main character is a female Harry who is on the autism spectrum, and she also suffers from severe issues and consequences of growing up in an abusive childhood home - all of which comes from my own experiences with both these things.

Another main thing in the story I really wanted to just get across is that everyone in it is just people. There's no "great fantasy overlord evil" or whatever. Everyone is just people, with their own thoughts, and dreams, and issues, and goals, and things that influenced and shaped them. And definitely nobody in the story is perfect. And most of the time the things that even my main character does ends up causing a dozen more problems at the same time as it solves a few.

  Ellie Potter's introduction to the magical world is a little more complicated than intended. No one, not even Dumbledore, expected the Girl-Who-Lived to Awaken as a sentinel. Which just goes to show you how little wizards understand Sentinels -- nothing like being thrust into a new world, filled with dangers and enemies to Awaken a sentinel's instincts.Goblins have little use for wizards, but sentinels and guides are another matter entirely. Sentinels are warriors; ruthless, fierce, and without mercy on the battlefield. The kind of being a Goblin can respect. So when the Girl-Who-Lived comes into the bank, Awakening...well. There's little they could do to aid an underaged witch without a magical guardian. A Sentinel? Anyone who tries to interfere in affairs between Sentinels and Guides and the Horde courts war.Ellie leaves Gringotts with far more than she might have. The goblins send send her off, already plotting. Change is coming. A storm is building. There will be profit and battle in the coming days.

That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder.
