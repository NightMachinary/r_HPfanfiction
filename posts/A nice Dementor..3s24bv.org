** Totally not what you are asking for but linkffn(7713063) has dementors that while not nice, do have deeper motives than just being creepy and eating.

** I was reading one just the other day with a Dementor named Steve who ate the Diary horcrux. Also Neville mastered his fears so well that he was able to completely control a boggart and kept it as a pet. It was interesting but I don't remember the title. I'll update if I find it.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=13652][Pumblechook by Wartcap]] is a great one. It features a Dementor named (obviously) Pumblechook.

Like most (all?) of wartcap's stuff, it's a comedy. Pumbles ends up having quite the adventure...

** Also not exactly what you're looking for, but has an interesting dementor involved in the last chapter. A very funny fic.

Disclaimer: Involves two characters from another series, but no in-depth knowledge about them is required to enjoy the fic. Very, *very* abandoned.
