:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In it, Harry travels to a parallel universe (though I forget how). He's either late teens/early twenties and the war with Voldemort is still going on in this world. Lily, James, Sirius, and Remus are still alive in it and Harry ends up being transported to Grimmauld Place in the middle of an Order meeting. I don't think they're able to recognize him right away (I think Harry might have put a charm on his face?) but I think Sirius is the first to realize that Harry is Harry Potter who died in that world as a baby.

Does anyone know what fic this is?

Edit: I'm pretty sure it mentions somewhere that Sirius Black finds himself with a stranger sleeping on his couch or something. Not sure if that helps or not!


** Could it be this? It's incomplete and abandoned:

  Sirius hasn't the first clue who this green eyed stranger is exactly, but he's here now and somehow he's Sirius' problem. AU Rating upgraded due to language and theme.

****** Eh.

I just read it, and it's pretty good. It has a few tropes I dislike, but but overall is an almost thoroughly entertaining 30k words. And then it stops right at a huge important cliffhanger.

Don't do yourself the pain, if that's the kinda thing that's gonna bother you.

*** Mmm, no. I think it's a standalone fic. Thanks for replying, though!

  Dumbledore believes he's found the answer to how to end the war with Lord Voldemort by pulling a warrior from another dimension. Reworking of my original story of the same title.
