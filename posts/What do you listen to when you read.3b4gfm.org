Hey yall! Got a question for you guys on the reddits. What do you listen to while reading Harry Potter Fanfiction? Personally I have a nice Spotify Playlist with epic music, battle music, romantic music and some choice songs. Am I the only one?


** I get asked this question a lot, but as in, "What do you listen to when you write?" Honestly, the answer for both of those is nothing. I know, it's boring, but I can't fully enjoy both at the same time. I have to have silence or at the very least just some white noise like a fan in the background. Same with academic writing.

World building/plot building/random daydreaming about a story is a whole different story though. I tend to listen to all kinds of music, but for Harry Potter stuff, I tend to lean toward my favorite genre (indie, specifically indie folk and indie pop). When I work on original stuff of my own, I usually listen to soundtrack or classical...although I do have one particular story set in present day with a 15-year-old protagonist, so that gets strictly pop music. I did create a playlist the other day of songs that remind me of Remus Lupin from linkffn(Against the Moon by Spotlight Delight). That was fun.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** I can't listen to music when I'm reading. To me, it's distracting, like having someone talking loudly while you're trying to read. The most I've done is put on some white noise to block out outside noise/noisy roommates/neighbors while I read.

** Don't listen to any music because I find lyrics distracting. When writing, I might listen to classical music - but hardly ever. I prefer silence. I can imagine though, that it can get you in the right mood for especially sad/ adventurous scenes, but when I'm writing I don't want to waste time looking for the right music first.

** Depends on the sequence.

If it's sad, I have a relative sequence of calming, and kinda sad music to play as well.

However, I do have an AWESOME set of upbeat, EPIC songs I play during battle scenes.

** Whatever I feel like listening to at the time. What I'm reading at the moment doesn't really factor into it. Though I tend to avoid stuff like metal or rap while reading as I find it too distracting. I listen to a lot of post-rock.

** Trance or Chillstep typically. Very important that there is no vocals otherwise it splits my attention from the story.

** I stick my Google play account on shuffle. I don't actively listen while I'm reading, it's more background noise. A sampling of artists: Depeche Mode, matchbox twenty, fall out boy, HIM, the offspring, nine inch nails. It's not often the noise clashes horribly with the scene.

** No, you're not the only one. But unfortunately I don't have a dedicated playlist or anything, I just muse until I think of music I think matches the story, before finding it on youtube.

Recently I've been kicking through the soundtracks for other pieces of media ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vbq8bPeMRI][Open Hexagon]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNmX3mWMPYw][Ink]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1VBeQlmJJA&list=PLE36689FDB43CE335][FMA]]), which is interesting because I subconsciously associate the themes of the other media the the fanfic I'm reading.

Before that I was listening to a lot of alt metal and rock, etc ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbfSQL5Rx7I][Disturbed]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxQkTKRJ3iw][Breaking Benjamin]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrl7pI3mf6E][Avenged Sevenfold]]), mostly to match the emo/angsty powerful!Harry fics I was reading then.

** When reading/writing, I think music with lyrics are very intruding. Great soundtracks, particularly from Studio Ghibli movies, never fail, nor does classical music.

For very action heavy stuff, putting on something like Two Steps from Hell in the background sometimes work, but I prefer action-y but still calm tunes like march songs. Those are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC09TEDeR00][great!]]

** I listen to instrumental music, vocals are too distracting and you end up writing the lyrics instead of your story. Although, I do have some music with vocals but I tend to have the volume rather low. Different music can dictate how you write, so try listening to upbeat music when writing happy scenes and sad music during sad scenes, and... well, you get the point.
