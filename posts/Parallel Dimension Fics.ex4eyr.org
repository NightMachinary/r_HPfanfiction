Parallel Dimensions, so popular culture has it, are created when multiple choices are available when a person is faced with a decision and thus multiple outcomes can occur after a person makes that decision. You could turn left, or you could turn right, and that influences things enough to create two new dimensions where your life continues after both individual choices. So, I was wondering if there were any fics that dealt with multiple outcomes of a single decision at the same time? Not fics where Harry or whoever else is simply punted to an alternate universe and is stuck in that one, but a story that involves multiple universes at the same time.

So, if the Gellert-Albus-Aberforth stand-off ended with them knowing who killed Ariana, then three universe plot-threads would follow where one plot follows Gellert having killed Ariana and the outcome of that, another follows Albus having done so, and the last follows Aberforth where he killed Ariana.

Sort of a 'for want of a nail' fic which looks at the plot where the character has the nail and the plot where the character doesn't.

If there aren't any fics like that, what moments or decisions from the canon plot would you like to see one made for? Please make it clear what the decision is and any outcomes you'd like explored. If you've got any ideas of what that outcome might effect too, do tell. Maybe someone will be inspired and pick it up. :)


** It's certainly a very interesting concept to write that actually serves itself particularly well to fanfiction.

One immediate moment I can think of is, who between Harry, Ron and Slughorn drinks the poisoned mead and dies. Another would be who of the three breaks under the pressure of the locket in the camping trip first. I think who two are left truly on their own would seriously change the timelines and produce very different results in all three of them.

*** I thought so. :)

Amusingly, there's also a TV Show called Awake starring Poppa Malfoy that deals with precisely this concept, though they dragged it down considerably by making it a generic crime show too.

*** On the poisoned mead, getting rid of the bezoar: since Harry knows he's not really a potions prodigy, and has gone through the HBP's notes enough to find out there aren't any additions for antidotes, Harry decides to spend a week or two bashing his head against the wall figuring them out. As a result, he doesn't hand in a bezoar, so it isn't in Slughorns room when Ron (or anyone else) gets poisoned.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

******* Ooof, okay. I'll save that for when I'm little less harried by life then. Let me truly appreciate the new shadow it'll cast on my soul. :)

Thanks for the rec!
