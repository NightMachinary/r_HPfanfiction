Looking for a fic where someone else gets control over the ministry before Voldemort and the death eaters do. They can be Harry and his friends or other good guys idc much. I guess this could also be considered a prompt. Would like it to be completed or still being updated.


** I think I can recall a fic where Harry, fed up with the ministry hunting Sirius, writes to the Queen who then marches into the Wizengamot and dissolves it.

** I'm not sure if this fits your description but Delenda Est and its sequel Para Bellum by Lord Silvere, has a Ministry controlled by a good (morally greyish) Bellatrix and Harry during the war, and with some multi-dimensional shenanigans they are trying to take control of another Harry's dimension to stop Voldemort. In general a pretty good read.
