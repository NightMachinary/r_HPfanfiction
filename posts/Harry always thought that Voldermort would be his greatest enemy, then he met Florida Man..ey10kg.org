** All I can see is naked greased up meth guy running through diagon alley with a tire iron smashing stuff. He's not a wizard, he's just got drunken master coordination and luck.

He took out 2 bars and a convenience store, before finding himself in the leaky cauldron.

Another smashed up bar, a smashed brick wall and greased up naked meth guy finds himself in diagon alley in yet another sensory overload.

He gives Fortescue a black eye, pisses in the ice cream, and exits through the shop window after auror Potter shows up.

Harry chases him into knockturn alley, where greased up naked meth guy causes all sorts or chaotic destruction, good and bad.

In the end, he exits knockturn alley through a brick wall in a brothel, emerging into a Tesco, and continues his flight of destruction.

The chase continues, never really reaching the beyond the bounds of 'highly implausible', but getting well into 'impossible' territory through the sheer number near misses and amount of destruction caused.

The time span of the fic wouldn't be more than like half an hour, just constant action and chaos. You'd be exhausted by the time you're done with it because no one should be able to go quite that hard for more than like 8 minutes.

But he's on meth. And he's greased up. He can't stop. He won't stop. He'll do whatever he wants. Like fucking the Minister of Magic's hat while sprinting through an human trafficking operation, clumsily roundhouse kicking everyone he comes across.

Harry snapped alert when the file slammed atop his desk. A red file.

"Morning, Harry." Ron looked awful, like he'd been on Pepper-up all night and was starting to crash. Probably had.

"Damn, another one?" Harry had barely gotten 4 hours sleep after calling quits. The cases were piling up with this string of break-ins and they had all the former Death Eater business clogging up their work, even years later. The followers that survived were notoriously slippery, and the public was hesitant to go re-opening wounds. Very little had changed in the views of Wizards, despite all the effort Harry and his friends had put into changing society.

Harry took the file and started rifling through the menagerie of papers.

"Yup. Fourth one in twelve hours... That we know of." Ron was surprisingly nonplussed about the whole thing, but Harry knew it was eating at him. It ate at the whole department. Someone or someones had been ransacking homes in a string of burglaries without rhyme, reason, or apparent motive other than to take all their booze and potions supplies. The subsequent investigations turned up a lot of "less-than-legal" /accoutrements/ which harried the owners even further than having their medicine cabinets rifled through, which prompted complaints and more inter-department investigations. Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair.

"Anything new with this one?"

Ron beamed. "Oh, yeah. Plenty."

Harry raised an eyebrow. "Well? You expect me to read this thing or can you just tell me?"

Ron snickered. "Sorry, mate, it's the pepper-up. Think I'm coming down." Well, that confirmed that. "So, it's definitely one man."

"One person did all these heists?"

Ron put up a finger: "One /man/. It's definitely a man. We did tests with all the other break-ins when we got the call for this one. Magical signature is basically nonexistent. Had us completely perplexed." Harry knew most of this already. "But," Ron continued, "we got approval from accounting to hire a curse-breaker, had to be thorough and confirm our spells, so I called Bill up and he checked things out. It's a man, plus some magical creature, or creatures, and what's crazier is it is definitely the /same/ man at each site."

"You're kidding."

"Nope. One muggle, or maybe a squib, can't rightly tell them apart, is trashing houses to steal booze and drugs." Ron finished with an air of victory about him.

"Ron. That makes absolutely no sense."

"I know! Isn't it great!"

"Maybe we should bring this up to the Minister."

"Already did! Hermione is just as lost as we are!" Ron finished with a nod and a smile. Harry sighed again, rubbing his forehead.

"Ron, get some sleep. Your next shift is in..." Harry looked at the time. "Six hours. Christ. Go get some rest and I'll see you later, okay?"

"Thanks, mate. Read the file, it's... educational."

"I bet."

*** --------------

Harry read the file and concluded the same thing everyone else had. It was impossible. Even the Unspeakables brought in were giddily excited about the new case. All eyewitness testimony could only be regarded as exaggerated and unreliable since their stories were so incredibly varied: some regarded the man as crazed; wearing nothing but knickers while threatening with knives and muggle "armfire" (Harry silently cursed wizards' general lack of awareness), found some of Hermione's notes fixing the nomenclature, while other reports noted the man was calm, methodical, fully clothed, non-threatening, but carried around a very large snake-thing and had decided not to risk their lives for their material goods. Many of the civilian reports noted how they didn't appreciate the Aurors "snooping" into things that didn't have to do with the break-in. "I told you what happened, why'd you gotta go and look down /there/?"

It made Harry sick. This isn't why he joined the Auror force. He wanted to protect people, make a difference, prevent another Voldemort from happening, and yet, the Wizarding world hardly learned a thing a from the war. Gave up nothing to continue going on being ignorant, thanks, in part to his sacrifice. Harry and his friends had lost so much... for what? For things to go back to the way they were?

The fact that this man had apparently burgled so many in such a short span of time was also mind-boggling. "A Drip Feed of Pepper-Up?" was noted in the reports in Hermione's careful script, only to be crossed out and replaced with "Amphetamines? Research."

Harry apparated close to one of the properties noted in the investigation. He'd been near enough before, during his Horcrux hunt, and quickly found the small, disused manor past the edge of Godric's Hollow. It was a small farmstead, usually accompanying and supplying horses, small cattle, chickens, and a handful of magical creatures. It reminded Harry of an upgraded Hagrid's hut if it had been nearer the countryside instead of adjacent to the Forbidden Forest. He tested the wards on the edge of the property line and found them amenable, almost welcoming, though they'd obviously been disturbed recently. Probably the other Aurors tramping around.

Harry shrugged and continued toward the main property, casting diagnostic spells and seeing the magical footprints of the past crystallize before him. There was an alarm, alert, and locking spells hastily broken, that much was clear. The door to a shed adjoining the property was ripped open like a giant had decided to pry it open. Some nearby sheep bayed in protest at Harry's presence.

"Auror business!" Harry announced, wand out. "Anyone inside, make yourself known or you will be met with force." Harry paused, heard no response, and shouldered himself inside the shed.

The inside was magically expanded to be a sort of combination barn, garage, workshop sort of deal. Several derelict muggle cars sat rusting amidst hay and old rotten grass. A wall of rusted tools and work benches covered nearly the full northern wall, while on the opposite end, stood feeding troughs and cages for animals. Dust covered everything.

"Hullo?!" Harry announced again. "Anyone here?" Harry cast another spell and made his way to a door that should lead to the main house, a door looking quite ordinary at first. Harry took a look at the door's lock and smiled.

"Hello, indeed." The lock had been /melted/ away. The perp didn't even have to use magic, he just carefully melted his way through the defenses. And the way the old wards of this place had almost /greeted/ him, it was no wonder this burglar was so successful. It didn't explain how he'd managed at other locations, but /this/ place was an easy target. Nearly abandoned, no one around to hear anything, and failing wards. It was a surprise to see it in such good condition: Harry would have assumed an abandoned magical manor like this would have all sorts of nasty creatures running amok, but it was almost tranquil with its surroundings.

"Hey! Boy!"

Harry spun, wand in hand, shield spell on his lips, when he locked eyes with the man who sneaked upon him.

Green eyes met hazel. Standing almost a head taller than him was a man, maybe twenty feet away. The man was armed with a pistol, bearing a shock of wild gray hair, wearing a brown jacket and jeans and heavy boots, and he seemed calm, understanding the situation. He had a wiry strength about him. Harry felt his nerves react and demand a response, but training and general exhaustion held him still. The pistol looked dangerous but pointed just off to Harry's side.

"You'd be dead if I wanted it, boy, lower the stick." The man motioned with the pistol.

Harry grimaced. "Not a chance."

"Then we've got a standoff. Negotiation, then. Who are you?" The man's bullish American accent was clear, but Harry couldn't place it beyond that.

"I'm the one with the stick, so I'll be asking the questions. Who are you?"

The man laughed. It was one of those genuine belly-laughs you can't fake. "Shit. You got balls, kid. Alright. Name's Rex. Your turn." The man's smile was missing a few key teeth and had a few too many points.

"Harry. What are you doing here?"

"Following you." The man's smile persisted. Like a still image.

"Why?"

"To see what you're up to?"

Harry relaxed a bit, but just a bit. Usually, if you got someone talking, they wanted to keep talking. People liked to talk about themselves. Hermione quoted some muggle psychology about it all the time in her negotiation practices. "Someone's been breaking into homes. I'm police, here to investigate. Put down the gun."

"Only if you put away the stick."

"It's just a stick."

The man smiled again. "And my dick is made of gold. Kid, I know what you are and you aren't as clever as you seem. Your magic don't work on me."

That gave Harry pause. Was this some sort of new threat? A muggle-lead counter to all the horrible things magic had done to the world?

"Explain."

"Nope. /Skiiiiinks! Heeeeere!/" The man, well, hissed. A half-snake half-iguana type creature scurried into view. It was blueish-green with stripes of bright orange, bright blue flanges on its head and deadly yellow eyes, and had to be close to 40 stone. It was huge, not basilisk-sized, but a big fucking reptile. Or amphibian. Harry didn't quite know the difference and wasn't keen on finding out.

Harry started casting before the creature came into full view. It /HISSSSSED/ and a sort of sonic force pierced through his various protections, sending him reeling. And nauseous. And confused. The creature flicked its tongue at Harry with another /HISSSSS/ and Harry was buffeted with another round of energy. On the ground, barely coherent, but still gripping his wand, Harry slung spells at random to ward off the offending creature and its human master.

"Not gonna work!" a voice said.

"It's scent is familiar," another voice said. "Can we taste it?"

"Nah," said the first voice. "I think this one's special. Never know with these magic types."

There was a hissing groaning noise. "/Hmmm./ You always say that."

"And I'm always right."

Harry tried to move, to interject, to do anything, but he got hit with another hissing spell and saw only blackness.

**** --------------

Harry woke covered in cold water.

"'Bout time. I was getting worried! Not getting enough sleep there?"

"Who'se a what'snow?" Harry felt the slap about 2 seconds after it impacted his face.

"Wakey wakey wizard. Time to cough up. Who are you exactly?"

"Wha?" Harry was tied to a chair, and slowly the room came into view. Some sort of basement; the walls were bare concrete and illuminated by a few electric lights, though Harry couldn't see their source.

"You stepped onto my family property without a moment's hesitation, started your investigation, and none of my alarms went off. Skinks here won't even erase your memory. Now, we can do this easy way, or we can do it the fun way. Who are you?"

"Harry."

"Hardy Har. WHO?" Harry felt the backhand immediately this time. "ARE YOU?" The man leveled the pistol at Harry's eye level. Harry almost laughed.

"You don't know?"

"What, is it some sort of joke?"

"I'm Harry /fucking/ Potter, you idiot."

"Bullshit. Potters are dead," he said, keeping the gun level.

"Not this one," Harry exhaled some blood out of his nose. "Although, there was that time where I was, but wasn't. Kind of confusing when you look back on it."

"Hmmm." The man lowered the gun, but still seemed skeptical. "Potter? Harry Potter? Who were your parents?"

"James and Lily. Everyone knows that."

"James... James Potter..." The man tried recalling, and Harry reached out with his magic, see if he could find his wand, or anything that might help him. He didn't detect his wand, but he did sense the snake... thing, nearby, curled up next to a vent, no doubt a heat source.

"They'll be looking for me, you know." Harry tried to break the man's reverie.

"Can't recall a James," the man ignored Harry. "Though I didn't get all the info from you Brits when the last of the lines kicked the bucket." Harry was just as confused as ever. If he could get the lizard on his side, it might help. He reached out with his magic again, a bit more confident this time, now that he was waking up.

"Tell me," Harry said, hoping for a distraction. "What is Rex short for?" Harry had just remembered that little tidbit.

"None of your business." The man's attention was back on Harry instead of wistfully recalling something. The gun reentered Harry's view. "What do you mean they'll be looking for you?"

"I'm famous, you know."

"Oh? Really? What for?"

"Killing Tom Riddle, mostly. Twice."

The man looked perplexed, but then shrugged. "What do you say, Skinks? Is this one a lost cause? Wanna eat 'im?"

"Snnnnoooot eeeeeat," Harry hissed. His Parseltongue was incredibly rusty, and it was hard to just, well, speak it, without a snake or something in front of him.

"Shit," the man said.

"Shiiiiiit," Skinks said.

--------------

"Gaunts had a squib line in the Americas?"

"Yup. Changed their name, started Ilvermorny, actually."

Harry and the man were in the kitchen now. They'd agreed to talk, in regular human speak, after several tense moments of trying to get /Skinks/ to obey each other. Harry still didn't have his wand, but Rex agreed to stow his pistol, for now.

"Slytherin's line, I think, made it to America. It's how I got this /ssssssneaky ssssskill/. But!" The man put up a finger, "I got a message saying everyone with magic in the family had died off. So I came to this side of the pond and see if I could clean up and take what's mine."

"Hold on." Harry rubbed his head. This was all getting a little confusing. "That has to be a massive number of families. I'm related to half of wizarding Britain if you go back far enough. How did you find this out? How are you doing these robberies?"

"You're right, it is a big number, but I'm going through the properties one by one. Was on a roll until you showed up. Skinks is leading the way."

"What the hell is Skinks, anyway?"

"Ssssomething old. Ssssomething dangerous," Skinks hissed from its windowsill perch. Another of Slytherin's pets, then?

"Look, I'm obviously not dead, and while this has been very enlightening, I can't just let it slide. I'm an Auror."

"I know, but you /should/ be dead. That isn't a threat, I got a magical whats-a-hoosit that told me." The man produced an old looking pocket watch with too many hands on the dial. He showed it to Harry.

It was like a miniature version of the Weasley clock, except the edges were inscribed with "Peverell," "Gaunt," "Sayre," and "Potter." The hands were all dangling idle, as if the mechanism had died. An inscription at the top said /In domo mortis/ and then the rest was scratched off.

"I'd been waiting," Rex explained, "for everyone to die off. Just biding my time, me and Skinks, seeing the hands drop off one by one. And then they did, and I came here to take back a fortune, and, well, things aren't going as I planned."

"I'll say. For one, I'm /not/ dead, and you really don't follow the news, do you?"

The man shrugged. "Figured that dark lord of yours finally did everyone in, seeing as how all the hands died off."

"That dark lord was Tom Riddle, AKA 'Voldemort,' and he was a Gaunt."

"Oh."

"And I'm a Potter, and I killed him, but not before he killed me."

"Huh?"

"It's complicated."

There was a pregnant silence as the two took everything in. Harry could really use a spot of tea and a nap, but he'd really like his wand back. The department was going to absolutely /love/ this, if they ever figured the connection out. Harry's yank cousin who lived in a swamp by the looks of it, with a pet snake that seemed like some bastard version of a Basilisk mixed with whatever they had in Florida.

"I've got an idea," Rex finally said. "How about you don't tell your friends in law enforcement about this?"

"Oh?"

"And I let you /live/," Rex added, leaning forward.

"Kind of looks like you need me." Harry added, almost regretting the words as they left his mouth. Once he'd said them, though, an idea formed in his mind.

"Is that so? Seems I've been doing just fine until /you/ showed up."

"Yeah, about that, do you realize how much shit you've stirred up? Everyone is distracted, looking for you, and we've got a lot of loose ends to tie up with Voldemort, still."

"So?"

"So," Harry couldn't believe he was doing this. "So, you and me, we team up. Cousin."

"Hmmm." Rex looked thoughtful for a moment. "Done." The pistol reappeared in Rex's hand.

Harry rolled his eyes. "Put that ridiculous thing away, it won't do much anyway."

"Gonna disagree with you there, bucko."

"It's cousin."

"'Kay, Partner."

Ugh. Harry was going to regret this.
