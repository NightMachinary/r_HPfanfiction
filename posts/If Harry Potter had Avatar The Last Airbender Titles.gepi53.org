Long ago, the four houses lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when Slytherin attacked.

*** /Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Gryffindor./

/Not too long ago, the Wizarding World lived in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Dark Lord attacked. I, Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School, formed the Order of the Phoenix, to counteract this threat. When the war was at its height, a prophecy was made that a boy born at the end of July could beat the Dark Lord. The boy's name, was Harry, Harry Potter./

/The Dark Lord, learning of this prophecy, went after him. When he cast the spell to kill him, it rebounded, destroying the Dark Lord. Now, Harry Potter is a student at Hogwarts, and although his magic skills are great, he has a long way to go before saving anyone. But I believe, Harry will change the world./

One part /Avatar: The Last Airbender/, one part /Samurai Jack/.

** Harry "vanishing" in what should have been his seventh year at Hogwarts?

The Wizarding World living in harmony until Voldemort attacked?

This works way too well.
