Basically, I'm going through some medical treatment and am bored out of my mind. I'm open to literally any kind of beta reading, but am particularly interested in editing for writing, grammar, etc. Hit me up!!


** Are you open to Draco/Harry? No porn, and the pairing/romance isn't the focus of the fic by any means.

It's a fic that's still in progress, but I'm posting it as I go despite my better judgement, haha.

I've had one beta go through some of it, but they stopped responding... plus I'm still finding typos in stuff that they already went through. :-/

Currently 133k words, estimating I'll be around 200k at the end.

*** Yes absolutely! PM me any info. I'm best with grammar and typos, but am happy to attempt to do more substantive edits too

** I'm actually looking for a beta for my fic, Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting. It's a humour heavy fic where the Sorting Hat lost its shit. I'm working on my next chapter now

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he'd been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
