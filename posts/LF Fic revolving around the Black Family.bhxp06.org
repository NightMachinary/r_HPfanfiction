When I read it, it was incomplete but the start had Regulus running to Sirius (rather than running away from Voldemort) for help. Then it became about the Black family sort of healing. Dumbledore was in it as well?

Sorry if there's not much I can describe. I read Blackpool and I was reminded of this incomplete fic.
