  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

** linkffn(The Second String by Eider Down) is an awesome, underrated fic, but the slash is admittedly not more than a side note.

linkffn(Shiny and Blue by Der Mondstrahl) is a good romance.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** I love this one, personally [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278]]. It's Draco/Harry, and there's romance in the fact that there's a relationship, ergo there has to be some level of romance, but the story is primarily focused on the more comedic aspects, and the relationship develops very naturally. It's not a sappy true love 4ever (much as I do love those), but rather a realistic portrayal of young adult Harry and Draco who have never met sniping at and getting to know each other.

I also adore [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955]]. It's technically not slash, rather a Gen fic. But the entire premise is Harry and Draco stuck in the 70s taking the long road, and being forced to stick together, so over time they developed a really close bond out of circumstance. It's almost like slash but without any romance or sex. I reread it every so often. (writing this actually makes me want to reread it right now...)

And for last, is the Saving Connor series. It's a massive epic that is highly controversial, quality wise, you either love it or hate it. It's got very long and complex plots, and it's Draco/Harry. However, iirc, the Draco Harry relationship, while not quite a healthy one, does have a fair share of time devoted to it. But at the same time there lots of plot going on to balance it out.

*** I forgot to mention this linkao3(67766). I know this doesn't meet your criteria as it's pretty much soley about the relationship, which is why I left it for last. However, if you're willing to take a risk, this fic managed to make me, a devout anti-harry/Snape shipper, enjoy the pairing, somehow. But it is a pretty divisive pairing, so it's not my main recommendation.

  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.

**** Controversial might have been a wrong word. What I meant is that I haven't hear someone say theyre meh on it. It's also one extreme. It's also not exactly a happy story. In fact it's rather bitter. So it doesn't have the kind of mass appeal that a more "easy" story might have.
