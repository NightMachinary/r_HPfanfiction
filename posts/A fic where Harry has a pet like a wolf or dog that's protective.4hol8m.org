  COMPLETE AU Third Year. What if a certain phone call pushed Uncle Vernon too far, changing everything? The truth will be revealed but which version will Harry believe? The past will be revealed along with the introduction of old aquaintances.

** Linkffn(8286141)

Harry has a new familiar, a grim, so technically a dog with the added bonus it has magical abilities to help him.

Warning: the fic is rather poorly written and so fluffly at times, I had to skip ahead. Dialogues felt rather stiff, too, and characters OOC.

But it fits your request, so read at your own risk.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? cover pic - Harry's cub
