** There's a Harry Potter/Good Omens crossover on Ao3 that's exactly this. Can't remember the title, just search for crossovers between the two and you should find it.

Good Omens is a hilarious book cowritten by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet about the antichrist being born and actually protecting earth from the apocalypse.

** I have an unfinished story on my google drive called "James Potter is the Devil." That's a very literal title. It is neither long nor very good, but meh, [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxQwY1pPMoFXLVplVXMxd2FKLW8][here you go.]]
