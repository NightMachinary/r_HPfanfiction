Basically what it says: someone who has read the Harry Potter novels is transported to that world, could be the day of Harry's first train ride or before/after, but it's a new character that has knowledge of events from the books.

-Ok with writer self-inserts

-Has to be a new character and not an existing one with these memories.

-preferably complete


** Not complete, but still updating, and it's really good: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807][Faith and the Devil]] - writer SI, 60k words, gen, abandoned. The fic is locked to AO3 members (if you don't have an account and need an invite PM me) so no ffnbot, but here's the summary:

#+begin_quote
  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.

  Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

  This is an extremely girly self-insert, very likely a Mary-Sue type of story, where a lot of the characters aren't at all straight. I thought I'd let you know straight up so you can just pass it by it if that's likely to upset and/or offend you. Otherwise - welcome to the Malfoy family.

** This one started not long ago, and It's quite good. The MC is more than just someone who read the books, though, which makes everything that much more interesting.

A Nerd goes to Hogwarts. With full knowledge of canon. Well, as much as he remembers from when he read the books years ago.

So, this Lumos charm creates light? Time to turn it into a deadly laser!

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
