*** This is another crazy fic by Ynyr. It would be great if it were not for the completely OOC Bill Weasley.

** I'm not sure, but I think linkffn(11071872) features Andomeda and Harry in something that may or may not develop into more. I haven't read far into it, but there has already been innuendo and since this is fanfiction and authors here mostly have about as much subtelty as a freight train, I take an educated guess.
