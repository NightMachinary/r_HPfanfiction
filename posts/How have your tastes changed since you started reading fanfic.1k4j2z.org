I used to only read canon fics, but I've branched out a little. Honestly, as I get older, bad characterization bothers me more than it used to. I've recently started to actually seek out AU fics instead of avoiding them as a general rule.


** I didn't read my first fanfic until the series was complete. At that point I was mostly satisfied with how the story turned out, so what I was looking for was continuation; that is, canon compliant between DH and epilogue.

The first site I found was SIYE and went fairly crazy reading everything on it. Then I got tired of Harry/Ginny or OBHWF and redo fics where barely anything changed.

So I branched out, finding Portkey and WHOAH! After reading the first Harry/Hermione Story I realized it was how things should have ended up. I'd already thought that in the first place of course, but I knew from book one that Ginny would be his love interest eventually.

After getting tired of fluffy Harmony fics, and hurt/comfort fics where Hermione is in a semi/abusive relationship with Ron and Harry is cheating on Ginny....

I found LiraSnape and her lists of lists. I branched out into every pairing I could get my hands on (other than slash, I still can't stand it). And eventually found Harem is my favorite by far, followed by Harry/Slytherin Female (ie Daphne or Pansy).

Somewhere in there, I also found FFA and "Hope" which made my favorite female character ever Gabrielle Delacour. But there are surprisingly few of those stories, for fairly obvious reasons. Unless you are into little girls, most veela fics are H/Fleur.

Then I started writing, found I have a pretty good talent for romance...and my smut is master level. I'm not great at plots that don't involve smut...but I'm good at smut...

In any case, Harems are still my number 1, but I get tired of the same cliche's. I also enjoy crackfic from time to time, but I'm no good at writing it for longer than a chapter.

*** What are those acronym fics you are referring too? Also, can you recommend some Harry/Hermione fics? Especially those one where she is in an abusive relationship with Ron.

**** SIYE = sink into your eyes ([[http://www.siye.co.uk][www.siye.co.uk]]) - a Harry/Ginny fansite

FFA = FanFicAuthors.net - an invite only author community, some of the greatest and best known names in HP Fanfiction

OBHWF = One Big Happy Weasley Family (also sometimes called Pumpkin Pie). Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Everyone is a Weasley in some way or another.

I haven't kept track of all the stories I've read in the last decade unfortunately. But if you go to Portkey.org (H/Hermione focused) you should find a Harmony fic pretty easily, in which both are married to canon partners, but end up together in one way or another.

** I used to ONLY read slash. Harry/Draco (my first fic was Plumeria's Draco in Darkness) was my OTP. I was obsessed. Then I branched out to het but even then it was Hermione/Draco or Ginny/Draco. My obsession seemed to be mostly With Draco.

Then I got into some weird powerful!Harry stuff, but that didn't last long. I went on a parody fic kick and any crossovers with the Buffyverse I could find. I have never been that into canon ships such as Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron, because I find that too boring. I actually used to look for the strangest pairings I could find sometimes.

Still having a weakness for slash and angst, you can imagine my delight when I discovered Harry/Severus. Another obsession was formed. I still love the pairing, but I also love Hermione/Severus now too. I also like Severitus-type fics or ones where he is Harry's mentor, which I'll admit is weird. I just love Snape, dammit. Oh, and Harry as a girl fics are good too!

This was a fun question to think about.

** I started with HP fanfiction during the long lull between OOtP and HBP, when the fandom really started to take off. I began, like many, with canon-pairings, canon-characterizations, stuff that wasn't too far out there. Then the Indy!Harry thing took off and I rode that horse for awhile. I read a lot of time-travel, dimension-travel, a lot of AU reimaginings. I began to write in 2006 and that changed things as well as I began to first appreciate, then require good storytelling technique from the new stories I'd pick up.

Nowadays, I pretty much just want to read something that's original, that's polished, and that doesn't make me think I've read this same story already. I'm ambivalent with respect to shipping†, though I won't read slash if one of the parties is Harry (save for rare exceptions). As a hetero male who tends to identify with the eponymous character, this breaks the fourth wall for me.

I think that when you first start to read fanfiction, much like when you first start to taste wines, the world seems huge, that there are so many possibilities to try. In time, as your tastes become more refined, fewer stories appeal like they did, but the best ones are just that much better. The world of fanfiction seems much smaller, but you come to appreciate and relish the few excellent finds.

†With the exception of harems or polyamorous relationships, which, unfortunately, are almost always badly written wish-fullfillment by those whose sexual experiences don't extend far beyond their right hands and watching internet porn. After a few too many Kinsfire stories, I avoid these like the plague.

** I started reading fanfic before OotP came out, and almost exclusively went for speculative 5th-7th year fics. There was one post-Hogwarts fic I really enjoyed (and cannot remember the name of) that was the exception to this rule. Since Sirius was my favorite character after Harry, after JKR killed him off in OotP I really liked fics involving Harry rescuing Sirius from the Veil.

Since the series finished I've also found myself avoiding canon fics due to my dissatisfaction with the Epilogue, preferring completely AU fics, or time-travel fics where Harry tries to 'do things better' the second time around.

**** Yeah, it was fun for a bit, but a bit too much sex and humor and too little real conflict for my taste. I didn't manage to get all the way through it - while I enjoy a bit of sex and humor in a story, I don't like it when they are the focus of the story.

** I used to hate reading Marauder generation fics that weren't AU because I felt like it was too painful to read about these fics when I knew that Lily and James would only die horrible deaths... but thanks to a very stubborn boyfriend I've seen the error of my ways

*** This is EXACTLY how I feel right now. I used to love reading J/L, but I'm in a time-travel phase where I'm shipping Hermione and Sirius/Remus/Regulus (not all three at once, of course). I love these AUs because they almost always end in my favorite Marauders living on, because I can't stand that they don't. But if you can give me a couple of recs on canon-compliant Marauder-centric stories, I'd love to check them out!

**** Have I got some for you...mind, some of the characters may seem oddly done, but the overall series of events remain similar to canon. I've got a whole folder of one-shots and multi-chapter fics alike if you're jonesing for more :) Happy Reading!

Fait Accompli - This one is relatively short compared to some of my favorites, but really well written to compensate. This was one of the first ones that got me started on Jily. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6193007/1/Fait-Accompli][here]]

A Month of Sundays - Lighthearted and leaves you feeling warm and cuddly inside. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5249018/1/A-Month-of-Sundays][here]]

All Right, Evans? - This is quite possibly my favorite. It's the first installment of a trilogy that follows through 6th/7th/post-Hogwarts Jily. The second is called Dangerous Crowds, and can be found on the authors page. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528896/1/All-Right-Evans][here]]

** Probably the biggest thing is that, when I started, I refused to pick up a fic if it wasn't finished. I've become a lot more relaxed since then about just enjoying the story to wherever it ended up, even if it's obviously abandoned.

It took me a while to start enjoying crossover fics as well - the first few I tried were abysmal wankishness. But, as with everything, you just have to keep looking to find the gold in the mountain of dross. At least with fanfiction the quality is fairly obvious within the first few paragraphs.

** Early on, several years before the series ended, I remember my favorite fic was "I Am Lord Voldemort," by Nemesis, and that was my head canon for a long time until it was finally contradicted by HBP.

Pretty soon after starting to read fanfiction I got into slash, and was a dedicated Remus/Sirius shipper until very recently, when I just got tired of reading it.

And at various times I've alternated between Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Severus, and Hermione/Lucius, the latter two not just because I love the characters, but also because they're such a challenge to write that a certain level of skill is required even to make it feasible, and this meant that those fics tended to be better on average in my experience.

I also read an amazing Hermione/Tom fic recently, so I guess I'm getting back into the Tom Riddle fics after a 10-year break. :P

I tended to use FictionAlley a lot in the beginning, but then I've just stuck with FFN.

** I read Fanfics for more than 5 years, but only 3 of HP Fanfics. The first time time I read a HP FF i choose a random and complete, wich unfortunately I do not remember the name, and it was a mild bashing of Dumbledore and Ron. And the author explain a lot of things that happen in canon that, for me, made sense. I was thinking "why i didn't notice before?". Ever since i read some that put Dumbledore in the good guy position, but only 1 or 2 with Ron as good friend of Harry.

When Harry married Ginny in canon I was not surprise and didn't thing much of it, but afeter reding HP FF I start to think that Harry didn't married Hemione because Ron didn't have anyone else that he could have a relationship. Poor Hermione :/

** I started out reading the more fluffy FICA but I've started to find of the years that anything goes and I have a much more cynical view of the story, characters and world. I've stayed liking mostly Harry or Hermione centered stories that are a bit angsty and/or have them paired with some of the stories Slytherians. I've a special weakness for Harry rescued from the Dursleys by Snape adoption stories.

I couldn't stand AU and now they are some of my favorite. It's such a huge fandom that there is almost something for everyone.
