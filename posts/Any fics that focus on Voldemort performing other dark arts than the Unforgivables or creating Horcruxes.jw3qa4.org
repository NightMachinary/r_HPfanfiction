Dumbledore says that in the ten years after his disappearance, Voldemort had played so much with Dark Arts that they had transformed him. While it's never specifically stated, a lot of the fandom assumes that it was because he created the Horcruxes. However he was really secretive about the Horcruxes and the only person whom he ever talked to about them, did not wish to disclose that. Yet when he comes to Hogwarts to interview for the position of DADA teacher, Dumbledore claims he has heard about his reputation and would be sad if half of the tales surrounding Voldemort were true. Therefore I was wondering whether there are any fics covering Voldemort's absence and what other dark experiments he performed that altered him so much. I know there are a few in which its stated that he made himself immune to poisons, mind altering magic and basic human needs such as food, sleep or shitting, but they are always mentioned in passing.

Edit: this was supposed to have a 'Request' flair but my head is all over the place today.


** 7 hours and nothing but if you ask for a story with any variation in Harry's magic you get 77 ff links written this week. Fics that include or even mention side characters THAT ACTUALLY KNOW MAGIC are so rare. And Voldemort is basically a main character!!!

** A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magicand Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. But it's a Tomarry fic. Still I would highly recommend you to check it out. Even if you are not into that, it's slow-burny enough that you get a lot of focus on Voldemort and it's from his perspective. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

*** Thanks for the recommendation. It's actually really good. Also tbh Tomarry is not my favorite pairing, but none is really if the characters get too lovey-dovey. One of the reasons I really enjoyed the original series was because, even though novels about teenagers, they focused on the action, while the romance fell in the background.
