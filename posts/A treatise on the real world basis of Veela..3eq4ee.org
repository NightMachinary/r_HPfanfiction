*A big block of text, but I put a little bit of thought into it.*

Veela are some of the most mysterious beings that exist in the Harry Potter canon. There has been much variation in their powers in fanfiction ranging from the typical “mistress of sexual desire” trope seen in many smut fics to the “beings of love” in many HPx__ fics to the oft misunderstood ice queens of harem fics. However, there has never been any explanations or real world examples given to form the basis of the Veela mythos in the canon. Therefore, as a typical college student with loads of time on his hands in the summer, I took it upon myself to append that. After doing a good amount of research into the subject of the “beautiful woman” legends, I feel that the Veela myth can be narrowed down to two forks of origin. One is a more mythology based approach that take a look at the legends and narratives surrounding mythological creatures like Harpies, Muses, Sirens, and Vila. The other approach, which is also my favorite approach, is more of an urban legends explanation that takes a look at a specific legend called Alexandria's Genesis.

The mythology based approach is fairly typical. Throughout Slavic, Greek, Roman, and even Indian culture, there have been women of immense beauty existing in their tales and legends. These women, often the creation of gods or nature, have been seen to have a more carnivorous tendency. For example the sirens from Homer's Odyssey lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Sirens were believed to combine women and birds in various ways. In early Greek art, Sirens were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially harps. In canon, Veela are similar. Women of immense beauty that lure men consciously or subconsciously. However, when angered, they take more of a bird like appearance, much like how the harpies were seen to look in Greek mythology. However the problem with this is that the myths do not explain the distinct characteristics that we see in most Veela, i.e. platinum white-gold hair, sleek figures, blue eyes, etc.

We can explain this with an urban legend called Alexandria's Genesis. There has been much debate regarding whether or not Alexandria's genesis exists. It seems as though this condition is the result of an urban legend since no one with this disorder appears to exist today so far as the scientific community is aware. It also seems as though this condition could exist or it may have existed in the past, leading to further speculation. The legend of this mutation began 1000 years ago in Egypt when a mysterious light flashed in the sky and everyone that went outside to see it developed pale skin and purple eyes. These individuals began to be known as spirit people who moved north and eventually disappeared. The story also notes that the first recorded instance of this disorder appearing was in England in 1329. A newborn known as Alexandria was born with purple eyes and was said to later give birth to other girls with the disorder that lived well over 100 years of age. The actual generic variant that causes this disorder was said to be discovered in the 1960s. The proposed basis for Alexandria's Genesis is a genetic mutation that causes the eyes to turn from blue or gray to purple for around the following six months after they have been born. During puberty the color is said to deepen to a royal or violet-blue purple and remain this dark purple way, but will not affect the person's ability to see. Those that have this mutation are said to never grow pubic, facial, body or anal hair excluding that on the top of their head, ears, eyebrows, eyelashes and noses. Some also say that women with this condition are fertile but do not menstruate or have a period cycle. Additional sources say that the mutation also causes shimmering white skin that is immune to burning or tanning. Women are said to carry this mutation and it is said to affect those with black hair more often. People claim that those with this mutation can live up to 130-150 years with aging stopping around 50, they do not gain weight and have a good figure no matter how much they eat due to their hyperactive metabolism, rarely have bowel movements and are immune to most diseases so they rarely become ill. This mutation is said to affect Caucasians more often but interracial children may experience this mutation if they get it from multiple genes. From a scientific point of view, Alexandria's Genesis is complete farce. Many of the symptoms, specifically the age expectations, sunburn, and bowel movements, are medically illogical due to how the body works. However, if we add the aspect of magic into the mix, it is completely possible. JK Rowling confirmed that magical ability is based on genetics, so having a specific genetic mutation can lead to an epigenetically driven condition where all of these symptoms can pop up. I mean, 130 to 150 is often middle age in the wizarding world since many wizards are incredibly old both in canon and fanfiction. Immunity to tanning and sunburn can be a cause of natural magical abilities, much like what Metamorphmagi can do. The lack of hair can be epigenetically driven. Bowel movements, lack of a period cycle and disease immunity are harder to explain, but it can be noted that the body can potentially magically handle waste expulsion if the magic protein set is somehow crosslinked to proteins involved in the nitrogen cycle. Veela could be just a direct offset of this. We have only seen brunette and blonde veela with blue eyes, but who is to say that we can't see Veela with black hair and purple eyes. The beauty aspect of Veela can be explained via the fair skin and the ability to never gain weight or fat. The mutation causes a great figure and all the popular aspects of having a “beautiful” face.

All in all, Veelas are fascinating beings. I believe that they are human and not some creature that can simply crossbreed with humans. I feel like Veelas always breed true (i.e. veela always gives birth to another veela), but find it difficult to conceive due to how their periods work if we believe Alexandria's Genesis to be true. As a career geneticist, I also believe the mutation might exist in the real world, since there are many aspects to human genetics we do not know about yet.

So what do you guys think? What are your thoughts on the Veela mythos? Also, I apologize for any mistakes and lack of professionalism in the post. It's hard to keep this consistent when you're tipsy off cheap champagne and Redbull, but I think I did a fair job in conveying what I want to say.

*TL;DR: Veela can be seen in the real world from a somewhat believable mythos called the Alexandria's Genesis mutation.*

** I always thought that JKR just used the idea of the Nymp and changed it a bit.

Anyway i suggest you to post this wot in [[/r/harrypotter]] way more people should interested in your analisys.

Google Scholar has no hits, and what I can find says it was invented in fan fiction in 1998. So, no, there's no debate.

  I also believe the mutation might exist in the real world
#+end_quote

One mutation that:

- Stops ongoing growth of cartilaginous structures (ears and nose, primarily)
- Stops or significantly delays cancers
- Stops or significantly delays heart disease
- Changes hair color
- Changes eye color
- Prevents the growth of pubic hair
- Automatically adjusts metabolism based on food intake or current weight

Several of these are simple changes -- eye color, hair color, pubic hair. It'd not be terribly surprising to see any one of them. There is evidence that eye and hair color are linked -- albinism occurs in humans; and I have seen a leucistic African child whose parents had dark skin, brown eyes, and nearly black hair, but the child had blond hair and blue eyes and skin as light as a Caucasian (and genetic tests verified the child's parentage). But that's where the plausibility ends.

For any one mutation to prevent cancer, we would either have to have a dormant set of cancer prevention genes (and how would that come about in the first place?) or an active set of genes that primarily functions to make us susceptible to cancer (yeah right), or it would have to be dead easy to eliminate cancer (why hasn't it already evolved in at least one species?). Similarly for heart disease.

Instead of an automatically adjusting metabolism, you could have a mutation that makes it difficult for you to absorb fats or sugars. This means you would have to eat a lot more to survive, but at least you'd be less likely to be fat. And that option should be much easier to mutate to -- it's just very unlikely to survive.

I wouldn't rule it out entirely, but I'd almost place a higher probability on magic existing.

Pull the other one, it's got bells on.

That I'll believe.
