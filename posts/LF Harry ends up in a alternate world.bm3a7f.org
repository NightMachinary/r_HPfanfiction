Here's the jist.

Harry ends up in the body of his alternate self and his parents are alive. Tom Riddle is his grandfather and the headmaster of hogwarts. The muggle world knows magic and is at war with Dumbledore who controls Eastern Europe. Harry is a bit of a prick and finds out he has a son with Hermione.

I read it last year and can't seem to find it again after my phone died. It was on going back then don't even know if it is already finished. Anyone know what the title is?
