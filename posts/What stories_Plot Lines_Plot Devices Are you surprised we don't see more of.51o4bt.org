I've been looking for fics with either of the following storylines:

1) post battle Harry/Ginny where the difficulties of a long-distance relationship in the school year after the war, coupled with the fact that both Harry and Ginny are highly desirable among the opposite sex, causes issues in their relationship (not necessarily them cheating, but just issues of jealousy and loneliness causing problems but ultimately they end of together)

2) time travel fic where Harry goes back to start of hogwarts (but keeps his older mind) and, in addition to more efficiently destroying Voldemort, also tries to befriend Ginny earlier (always thought that'd be interesting if Harry knew he would marry her but she was still really shy; would she still wind up dating Michael and Dean to "get over him")

Interestingly, I can't find too many stories that deal with these plots. It was surprising because I would have thought both are obvious plotlines for writers to tackle. This got me wondering:

What are some storylines or plot devices you are surprised we don't see more of in the fanfiction community? Why do you think we should see it more?

Also, if you can recommend stories for anyone who says we don't see many of them, please do!


** u/MacsenWledig:

  would she still wind up dating Michael and Dean to "get over him"
#+end_quote

We know from the end of HBP that Ginny never gave up on him, which has led to accusations of her being a fangirl who doesn't really know Harry at all:

#+begin_quote
  “I never really gave up on you,” [Ginny] said. “Not really. I always hoped."
#+end_quote

Some people have said that Ginny's affection for him has matured by this point in the story, but I think it's up to the individual reader to decide if they believe this or not.

For your original question, I'd think that Harry's 'Saving People Thing' would lend itself easily to a slew of Healer-Harry fics, but they seem to be uncommon.

*** Not to derail my own topic, but when Hermione suggested Ginny date other people, what was the ultimate goal? Was it to move on from Harry, make him jealous, or just get more comfortable around him?

If it's the 1st option, I'm kinda surprised Hermione would do that since I assume she did want to see her and Harry together.

If it's the 2nd option, I can't see that working because at the time, Harry barely even talked to her. Why would seeing someone he literally had no feelings for date other people make him jealous?

If it's the 3rd option, how would that work? Dating other people would do nothing to her hero worshiping.

**** It gives Ginny a chance to compare her feelings toward Harry with other dating relationships. This makes it more likely that she chooses a course of action that accurately reflects her desires. She also gets a chance to figure out how dating works before she tries to impress Harry. If it's lingering fangirling, it gives more time for that to fade. Dating boys will make her more comfortable around boys she's interested in, which will make it easier for her to talk to Harry. (The hero bit will still be present, but the omigoshaboy part will be diminished.)

The downside is time -- it's more likely that Harry will find someone else while she's off dating other people.

**** I think it's option 1. Hermione is ultimately a practical creature. Of course she'd be glad to see the two together, but if it looks like it isn't meant to be, why waste time forcing it? Practical advice runs along the lines of "there are other fish in the pond", and less about the romanticism of holding out IMO.

2. More generally, Hermione-centric fic in which her romances occupy about as big a fraction of the narrative and have about as big a plot impact as Harry's did in canon. (I.e., not big at all.)
3. An Independent!Harry fic where it is /Ron/, and not Hermione or SlytherinIceQueen!Daphne, who is his main ally his age in getting out from under Manipulative!Dumbledore's thumb.

** Fics that focus on Hagrid's time at Hogwarts from his point of view (not time travel, which honestly bores me). He lived in one of the most interesting periods in Hogwarts history! A young, aspiring Dark Lord opened the Chamber of Secrets, a girl died, and he straight up got expelled for it. There is so much plot to toy around with, characters to play with, and alternate stories to tell. I'm already considering writing a story for him because he just doesn't get enough love and is always, always a blip on the radar of stories, and his true character is rarely shown.

You'd even think there would be Hagrid/TMR slash... to be fair, I doubt there is a great market for any romance involving Hagrid since he's not sexy like uh, Voldemort is, and I'm not interested personally, but everyone knows HP slash fans like their enemies to lovers plotlines.

****** I do agree that many of his actions are prompted by other characters, for example, Dumbledore has to get him to return to teaching because of his inital failure. But many aren't, like his relationship with Madame Maxime and his willingness to help her accept her heritage, his decision to buy a dragon egg, his proactiveness in "rescuing" Grawp (even though Grawp was awful, it shows Hagrid's determination), and his loyalty to Dumbledore and Harry. And I think a similar argument can be made for Harry being passive, but everyone is willing to write about him, plus the books were about him.

Of course, as you mention, it's just a matter of taste, and everyone interprets characters differently. I see Hagrid as a character with a lot of fear who can let it take him over in those situations where he feels threatened. It makes him somewhat passive, but still interesting to me.

It is made. Harry often carries the idiot ball in canon. Most of time, though, in fanfic, Harry is made a lot more active and smart. I like Hagrid, but it's the same type of character than Luna in that they wouldn't work that well as main characters. Or, rather, it would be difficult to make them main characters.

** Honestly, I'd like to see a more intelligent rewrite of Book 7:

- Dumbledore gave his stuffs to Harry through Professor McGonagall.

- Dumbledore warned key Order members about Taboo in case the Ministry fell.

- Dumbledore and key Order members set up contingency plans in case Dumbledore or Harry died.

- Harry, in disguise, transferred all his vaults to multiple secure foreign locations, and withdrew significant amount of Galleons and Pounds.

- Bill/Fleur wedding was held in France at bride's mansion, according to tradition. Due to rapidly deteriorating security situations in Britain, it would make even more sense.

- After Dumbledore's Death, Harry did not waste an entire month holed up in Number 4 Privet Drive, but in a safe house outside Britain, protected by a Fidelius Charm. He spent his time training, reading, and occasionally procuring supplies, under disguise.

- Delacours were an influential and wealthy French wizarding family. The wedding was held at Delacour Estate under heavy security precaution. The British Ministry still fell on the wedding night, and Voldemort launched a major attack on the wedding, in order to eliminate a large number of his enemies.

- The attack caused large casualties on both sides. The French were ticked off, and the Weasleys were stranded in France. Ginny would go to Beauxbaton as a result. Remaining Order members in Britain went into hiding.

- The Trio needed to infiltrate back into Britain. To provide diversions, polyjuiced 'Harry' would occasionally pop up at important magical sites in Europe, and Voldemort would deploy a significant number of Death Eaters in pursuit. Voldemort himself would seek the Elderwand, while trying to eliminating exiled Order members at same time.

- The Trio successfully returned to Britain through Muggle means. They began searching Number 12 Grimmauld Place and returned to canon track here. During the Ministry Op, they liberated dozens of Muggleborns, took the Locket, and killed Umbridge and Yaxley. With Sword of Gryffindor in hand, they quickly dispatched the Locket.

- At Hogwarts, Neville, Susan, and Luna reformed the DA. At Beauxbatons, Ginny became popular quickly and together with Gabrielle, tried to enlist volunteers for their cause.

- In France, pursuing Death Eaters went skirmishing with exiled Order members and French local authorities. As retaliation for the killing of Umbridge and Yaxley, the British Ministry demanded extradition from French, but was promptly rejected. Weasleys tried to seek more support from the French, but only achieved limited success.

I will stop here. I'd like to read what you think.

*** I'm all about an intelligent rewrite of Book 7. I love the idea that Ginny is sent away to Beauxbatons for her protection, and it would tie in nicely with having the wedding in France beforehand. It was so weird that canon had it at the Burrow considering it's traditional to go to the bride's hometown and the additional security problems wizarding Britain had.

It's also a commonsense way to draw the French school back into the story. I always thought a main point of book 4 was to give some introduction to future international allies for the Final Battle. Turns out I was wrong!

*** I've noticed you seem to like the idea of exploring the realities of the aftermath of the battle, like the fact that the war isn't over with Voldemort's death. I really like that idea. I tend to gravitate towards the relationship stuff after the battle, and I think a good compromise would be a story where Harry immediately becomes an auror to continue to war until all Death Eaters are eradicated, and Ginny gets frustrated because she wants time to actually be with Harry (when will the war ever be over and we can be together) and she wants to fight alongside him but he still is trying to protect her.

I like your specific ideas that make the story more political, militaristic, especially using the Delacours as a reason why the French would get more involved.

One thing you mentioned was Ginny going to Beauxbaton. I never loved the idea of her being sent back to Hogwarts that last year as she realistically would jhave been in much more danger than the books portrayed. If she went to Beauxbaton, it would be in violation of the new law about Hogwarts being compulsory. But could the Death Eaters try to get at her at Beauxbaton or would that just risk involving the French in the war?

Let's say Harry went back immediately after canon events. He's seventeen. Ginny is /ten/. I know it's popular to seek a younger bride, but that's well into creepy territory. And realistically, it would take some time to research a way to go back in time. For instance, in /Backwards with Purpose/, it took two years after the Battle of Hogwarts for the crew to decide to go back in time. At that point, Harry would be twice Ginny's age.

Of course its not unreasonable to expect that you can trust your significant other. I'm not sure I see your point.

So for you its just a personal preference of liking couples who trust each other, it's not about whether it is plausible such a situation would occur with Harry and Ginny? Fair enough, but in case you don't think this would actually happen:

keep in mind they would still be teenagers so they likely wouldn't be like an older couple who has more general maturity. Also, it's not a matter of not trusting each other. It's more about being lonely and not able to regularly communicate with each other, plus being constantly hit on that might lead to friction. Add in the fact that Ginny is a jealous person (and Harry too at least based on the whole Dean thing) and it's easy to see how this could be an issue.

I like to read stories with conflict in relationships as its more interesting than reading about a couple where nothing goes wrong. I get people not liking that because they don't want Harry to suffer any more, but again, I need conflict in my story.

I'm not suggesting I want to see something where Harry tries to immediately date Ginny. I agree it would be a bit creepy. I'm talking about examining how Harry would actually interact with the woman he knows he will one day marry. Does he try to befriend her much sooner and how does that work since Ginny can't even utter a sentence around him until her 3rd or 4th year? When does he feel its appropriate to officially date her, and does his hesitation to do so lead her to think he isn't interested and start dating other guys? How would Harry feel seeing that, since in his mind, they are dating, but in the alternate timeline they aren't? Let's say they start dating around the same time as in the original series, but Harry still feels the need to keep it relatively PG because he is older in his mind. Does Ginny get frustrated? When does Harry tell Ginny the truth? How does she take him lying to her?

There are so many interesting questions to answer that have nothing to do with them actually being together when she is 11.

Yeah, people don't really think about that. This girl that you were supposed to marry: She now didn't grow up with you. She didn't get to know you as a child. She didn't do any of those things with you. She got to know you as an adult and if you begin courting her before a certain age you are a real big creep. Unless you live as a hermit you will get to know other people (maybe your age) during the time that you wait and she might fall in love with someone else.

That you would get together again with your 'original' wife seems like a very remote possibility to me. Especially because you'd always have to consider the possibility that you manipulated her into the relationship with your prior knowledge.

When I first discovered fanfiction, that was what I was looking for (specifically stories about Sirius) and I was genuinely surprised not to find more - especially as I thought Sirius was a pretty popular character.

It doesn't surprise me any more - I do realise that the reader demographic generally is very young and they want to read about character who reflect their own experiences, but it still disappoints me.

** To Nr. 1: Of course we don't see that often. Most romance authors can't write tension - /at all/. If its a Harry/Ginny fic then the tension is superficial and made up. If its a Harry/AnybodyElse we see the relationship crash and burn in the first few chapters.

There are some exceptions, but in general fanfiction romance is fluff galore.

To Nr. 2: Most timetravel fics include the theory that the timeline has to be kept going or something bad happens (because that is how timetravel in the HP universe works /s). That is mostly the reason why Harry doesn't approach Ginny earlier. Well, that and the fact that most of these fics also make him see what a HugeMistake^{^{TM}} his relationship with Ginny was.

edit: forgot the plots that I'd like to see.

For one, Healer Harry. Working together with Neville the Master Herbologist to develop a cure for Neville's parents (or something. I'd like a story like that).

Then I always wonder why there aren't more fics with Harry growing up somewhere else, either geographically or with a more diverse set of potential guardians. I'm still waitinh for that fic that has Harry grow up in the alps, befriending wyrms, spirits and dwarves and being completely unable to pronounce squirrel when he eventually gets to Hogwarts.

Finally, I don't understand how there aren't more fics where Dumbledore is taking Harry and preparing him for his eventual destiny by making him his apprentice.

** I think some of the big ones we lack both quality and quantity of are: *McGonagall steps up as head of house, a house is a family she says so what if she filled a grandmother sort of role for Harry.

*Harry doesn't necessarily embrace his fame but he accepts it and the expectations placed on him. He works hard to be everything a good boy who lived should be. Does this mean he actually learns something from Lockhart? Does he save people because he should or because its the right thing to do? If Harry is a charming brilliant but hollow child does that remind the Headmaster of a certain Mr T M Riddle?

*The troll kills Hermione, how does Harry cope with failing to save her? how does an eleven year old face death and their own mortality? how does he overcome so many challenges without her?

- A horcrux contains a piece of a soul, what if that was a piece of humanity, what if Harry found the diadem in fifth year poking around the Room of Requirement? What if Tom had sliced of his remorse and all that made him good, the reason he is evil is because all that could make him good have been carved off and put into the diadem? Would it recognise the horcrux within Harry? Would Harry willingly sacrifice someone to the diadem to gain a version of Tom Riddle with the majority of his knowledge and power but actually is good?

  2) time travel fic where Harry goes back to start of hogwarts (but keeps his older mind) and, in addition to more efficiently destroying Voldemort, also tries to befriend Ginny earlier
#+end_quote

There might be other fics, but Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]) has that. It seems an obvious plot line, indeed, for any time travel fic that doesn't feature Evil!Weasleys.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** I've been holding off on reading it since it isn't complete if I recall correctly, but guess I should give one of the most popular fics out there a read. Can you at least tell me if the story is satisfying enough where I won't feel pissed that it will never be completed? Does it end on a cliffhanger or something like that?

**** I love that fic, but it's been one of my first ones. It's well written (as much as I can tell, being French, and not that gifted in English), compelling, well thought and well paced. It's also probably dated (I've heard it sometimes). It ends just before the triwizard tournament, don't remember if it was a cliffhanger, though. The fic isn't abandonned though.

All in all, it's a really enjoyable ride so far.

***** Just looked at it and says last updated a full year ago. So you're right, but i do wish we would get a sense of when the next update would be.

The 400k works scares me a bit, not because I can't read fics that long, but when you are essentially doing a rehash of the books, taking that many words to redo years 1-3 worries me. It's not a brand new story so I wish it wouldn't take even more words to go through the events of those books, when the books themselves took far less time.

****** It diverges rather fast. It didn't feel like reading a rehash (then again I wasn't as used to HP fanfic as I am now). I'd say give it a try, nothing forces you to finnish it.

******* I'll give it a whirl. Currently reading HP and the Bonds of Time, which is probably why I was hesitant for another 400k word time travel story. I really like Bonds of Time but the writer covers books 1-2 and then 3-4 in about 450-500k words each. That's basically the same word count as books 1-4 combined. And it shows with the slow pacing at times.
