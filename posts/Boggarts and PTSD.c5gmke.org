** I feel like I read a fic of POA from lupins POV and lucius was dracos boggart.

You know honestly you bring up a really good point. It must be really awkward for certain kids Boggarts. But likely it's pretty rare that the kids would actually have a practical lesson like that.

We know querrel and Lockhart definitely didnt do an actual boggart as lesson and definitely not umbridge. I cant see snape trying to find a boggart and with moody it would be a giveaway it someone saw it. And the carrow siblings were more focused on teaching actual dark arts.

Its possibly only lupin and a couple other teachers would have ever bothered with it. Maybe some teachers would have let kids sit out the lesson due to these issues?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042771][Let it choke]] linkao3(12042771) - Susan Bones's boggart is the Dark Mark, Susan and Lupin friendship (the same author also wrote [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]], which is a really interesting exploration of a boggart's abilities, in addition to being a great Lupin character study)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15230892][Dementors Within Us]] linkao3(15230892) - Harry's boggart is Vernon, Harry & Lupin friendship

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17842037][rotten on the inside]] linkao3(17842037) - Harry's boggart is about the Dursleys' abuse, Harry & Hermione friendship

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1986708][To Laugh At Our Fears]] linkao3(1986708) - Draco's boggart is Lucius, Draco & Harry friendship

(I must admit that I never really understood why so many people see Draco as an obvious candidate for being a child abuse victim - in the books, the one redeeming quality of the Malfoy family is that they love each other. But apparently I'm in the minority on that one.)

And, well, I've written two fics where a student facing a boggart goes a bit sideways, though both are for /Fantastic Beasts/:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16650817][left yourself in your warpath]] linkao3(16650817) - main characters are Leta and Dumbledore, gen, warnings for past child death
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11445738][Worst Fears]] linkao3(11445738) - Ilvermorny AU, main characters are Newt and Credence, gen, warnings for past sexual abuse

*** Thank you so much! And in regards to Draco, I don't think his mother would hurt him but Lucius seems like the type to love someone in fucked up, abusive ways. I don't think it's necessarily canon that he's abusive, just canon adjacent.

Thank you again, this is great!

  Remus Lupin certainly knew what he should do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine and understandable. Have her write “I will not skip Defence Against the Dark Arts” five hundred times and then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: Through avoidance and denial.Except he knew where that path lead.And if he ever wanted to help the Boy Who Lived With Terrible Memories, he should probably start heading down a different one.

  "Sometimes dementors are within us, too." It's third year, and the dementors are leaching the happiness from Harry. He's majorly depressed and to make matters worse, his boggart turned into Uncle Vernon in front of Professor Lupin.Harry gets by with the help of Remus and his friends.

  Professor Lupin teaches all of their third years to face their fears in what looks to be a fun lesson with a boggart. Everyone's laughing except for one person who doesn't want to participate. He knows what his boggart will reveal, and he's not willing to go that far. And then Draco's friends intervene anyways.

** Huh. I have PTSD myself and love Harry Potter. This idea never occurred to me, most of my fic ideas take place after the war. It'd be interesting to see a more emotional, vulnerable side to Draco. I'm not sure I have the confidence to write it, though - I've only returned to writing a few months ago after an 11 year break.

** this is something that's always annoyed me about POA, and i find it irksome how few fanfics deal with this.

The Anti-Heroine has this; it's a somewhat dark Tom/Harry/Hermione fic, and not for everybody. Hermione's boggart is the corpse of a younger girl she mentored when she was homeless. linkao3 (The Anti-Heroine)

The Green Girl has this, in what i find to be a much more realistic portrayal. Slytherin!Hermione's boggart is Draco calling her a Mudblood. linkff (The Green Girl)

** The Prince of Slytherin has a few chapters/plot points regarding magical PTSD and it involving the person's magic attacking itself. There are a few chapters with this being caused by boggarts and a few chapters with it being caused by other triggers. Not the focus point of the story but I find the whole fic fascinating

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
