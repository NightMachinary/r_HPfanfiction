Looking for fics where Snape is a mentor to Harry and/or Hermione. Anything goes, I'm especially a fan of Snape rescues Harry from the Dursleys, Hermione acting in a spy-type role, or Snape helping the trio during the Horcrux hunt. Bonus points if Snape is a grudging mentor.

Thank you!


** So, these are the ones I have bookmarked but I've been collecting fics a while and have poorly tagged them. So I can't promise they're all good as they may just be an ok fic I read after a really dreadful few.\\
/The Secret Language of Plants/ if you stick with it, Snape becomes much more of a mentor than occasional visitor.

linkao3(631214)

It looks me a little time to warm up to /World in Pieces,/ but I like some of Lomonaaeren's other work. It kept me interested until the end, just not my usual fic.\\
linkao3(1493333)

/Crime and Punishment/ - Harry is framed for a crime. Snape is put in charge of the supposedly delinquent Harry.

Portrait Snape features in /Azoth./

linkao3(1049966)

/A Very Slytherin Harry/ is one of those fics that I bookmarked, but left no notes on so... who knows.

linkao3(737220)

/No Difference/

linkao3(708019)

/Harry's Cousins/ admittedly features the Malfoys more than Snape, but he's still important.

linkao3(9973940)

The Wizard's Nephew has Harry rescued much earlier than I normally choose, but is still well worth a read. Learning-to-parent Snape cracks me up but it does mean that it winds up OOC.

linkao3(47006197)

/truth's like blood underneath your fingernails/ has a more realistic Snape, according to its summary, anyway.

linkao3(27103908)

/To Recollect the Future/

linkao3(593979)

/A Brother to Basilisks/ - I'm not sure whether Snape is a mentor in this fic, tbh...

linkao3(2435531)

/When Family Fails/

linkao3(22413314)

/A New Place to Stay/

linkao3(1999790)

/Mudsnake/ is one of the only fanfics I've bookmarked where Snape mentors Hermione.

linkao3(17828398)

/Along Came a Family/ - I very nearly didn't post this one. I bookmarked it in 2014, the first chapter doesn't look great and the title seems a bit eh. (Not the only eh title, mind you.) Still, at your own peril!

linkao3(603374)

/A Different Beginning/

linkao3(10442991)

/A Hero's Strength/

linkao3(10821878)

Different Not Defective - Very OOC

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Elton was already starting to drift off, his arms hanging loosely on the cart's cracked, plastic bar. However much he looked forward to spending his weekends with his uncle--it sure beat helping Mom hot-glue centerpieces for the Atlanta Rotary's annual fundraising dinner--sometimes Uncle Alton was kind of...boring.

A couple of years later, he's invited to a family event, which makes things super awkward for you because you're still single but you don't want him to know, and you're well aware of how communicative and pushy your relatives can be, not to mention how much they will be praising him all evening long.

** Half my kingdom for decent fic in which Snape meaningfully mentors Hermione and then they /don't/ end in love down the line!

More seriously,

- linkao3(Surprise, Bitches! by OfHealingLove) is an adopted!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(In Which Hermione Granger Becomes Lethal by ladyofnite) is a bit crack and I haven't read all the way through due to overly slow pacing, but it looks like it fits the bill.
- linkffn(For the Only Hope by ausland) is one of the better ones that 'ship them.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

** I've read quite a few Snape!mentor fics over the years, and I think the ones that stand out have already been recc'd, but I have a few more :)

Harry Potter and the Enemy Within linkffn(3417954) - I remember this one being pretty good, but it's been a while since I read it. 6th year fic, if I recall correctly they find a way through Occlumency and the dark mark to battle Voldemort.

Stone of Dreams linkffn(10000538) - I found this one recently and really enjoyed it - it totally exceeded my expectations. As a child, Harry astral-projects or something to the dungeons at Hogwarts. Snape doesn't recognize him and assumes he's a ghost, and they build a relationship over the years preceding Harry's arrival at Hogwarts. I loved it, but updates stopped at such a cliff hanger point, so be forewarned.

Applied Cultural Anthropology linkffn(9238861) This one was pretty enjoyable, but I think fizzled out at some point for me. Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, and Snape is a de facto mentor here, though I think fades to the background a bit. Also, as someone with a degree in anthropology, imho I don't think the title has anything to do with the story, but it is catchy.

The Prefect's Portrait linkffn(1875189) I think this is Arsinoe de Blassenville's best story (shots fired). Hermione finds a portrait of Lily Evans, and uses it to bring her back to life, with unforeseen consequences. A fun story with a fast-moving plot as I remember. Mentor!Snape isn't the focus, but he definitely takes on a significant role as a mentor by the end. Pre-ship if you squint, but I'm pretty sure the full story is gen.

** If you don't mind Harriet rather than Harry, I strongly recommend Laventadorn's The Never Ending Road. The sequel is still updating infrequently, and will eventually become Snarriet but there's a good amount of mentoring with a wonderful characterisation of Snape, who remains a bitter, spiteful and sarcastic character. Sticks pretty closely to the stations of canon early on but imo is worth it for the beautiful writing. [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/455938]]

Would also recommend Grangerous' Phoenix trilogy for Snape mentoring Hermione from the end of OoTP onwards, including giving her private lessons in Occlumency and defence. Does end up as Snamione. Also notable for a really interesting and imaginative use of arithmancy and a backstory for Professor Vector that immediately became my headcanon. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P]]

I also enjoyed Oliver Snape's To Recollect The Future even though I'm not usually a fan of re-do time travel fics. Similarly Far Beyond A Promise Kept is well worth a read. Very strong mentor element in both of these although that does make Snape OOC pretty quickly. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/365648/chapters/593979]]

Finally, if you like hurt/comfort mentor fics try Chrmisha's Last Will and Testament of Lily Evans Potter. It is an abused!Harry fic and has a lot of the usual tropes but I found it well written and engaging. The sequels get pretty dark and could be triggering for people so read with caution.

*** I absolutely second The Never Ending Road, it is incredible. Speaking to the mentor aspect of it specifically, the development of the relationship between Snape and Harriet is so multilayered and organic---a beautifully written relationship arch that changes through the years. Also, it's interesting that you see Harriet take on some of her mentos' poorer qualities, follow their bad examples---I'm thinking of when she begins cursing, and how she got all of her best profanity from Snape, and later Sirius. There are other things as well, but that's the first that comes to mind. All the characters in this fic are multidimensional and flawed, and they are definitely some of my favorite portrayals.
