  "Whatever this life brings us, my youth will have always been yours." Amidst the rise of an imminent threat, some people fall together as others fall apart. Love, power, Marauders, and everything in between. Year 7 with opening Snily and eventual Jily. Prequel to "Clean" and "Marked," book III in "This World or Any Other" series. COMPLETE.

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

  In 1979, Regulus Black goes to destroy a Horcrux, expecting to die in the attempt. But luck and Kreacher's ingenuity keep him alive...which leaves Regulus trying to negotiate switching sides in the middle of a war without getting killed. He hadn't planned past the cave. It's a good thing that both sides can find a use for a spy---isn't it?
