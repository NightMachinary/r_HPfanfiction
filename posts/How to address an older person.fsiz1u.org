I need some British opinion on how Golden Trio would address some of the older characters. Harry and Hermione are close to Weasleys, would they call Molly and Arthur by their first names after finishing Hogwarts or would they still be Mr. and Mrs. Weasley? Would Harry call them ‘Arthur' and Molly' after his engagement to Ginny? After marriage?

What about Hogwarts professors? Is it within realm of possibility for Harry/Ron/Hermione/any other student to address professor McGonagall as ‘Minerva'? Or Madam Pomfrey as ‘Poppy'? What about someone like Andromeda? I can imagine Harry being relatively close to her after the war? Would he call her “Mrs. Tonks” or “Andromeda”?

In Dramione and Drarry would Lucius and Narcissa ever allow the use of their first names?

I also understand that it's different for different people, so I would welcome your insight on specific cases/characters as well.


** I am relatively of an age and place to Harry Potter the character. I do tend to be quite formal and aware of my 'place', so some characters might not do as I do. I'm pretty solidly middle class, which does affect my answer here.

I would call Molly and Arthur "Mr & Mrs Weasley" until they asked for something different. If they did not ask, I would quite possibly call them that forever, which would be very strange later in life. If they asked me to call them by their first names when I was still under about 16, I would just never use a name for them because I would feel uncomfortable doing so. After marriage, it would not be unusual for them to ask me to call them Mum and Dad.

It would be seen as extremely inappropriate to refer to a teacher by their first name, even in private. This includes Madam Pomfrey. Likely if the character stayed in touch after school they would eventually graduate to first names, but this would be instigated by the teacher.

Andromeda, it depends on how close a relationship we had but assuming that she would become like an aunt, it would probably be okay to call her by her first name. I'd probably call her Mrs Tonks and then she would immediately say 'No, call me Andromeda' and then I would.

Eh, it's hard to say whether Lucius and Narcissa would allow first names. I would think so, to be honest. I think either surnames and titles or first names wouldn't strike me as particularly strange.

Hope this is at least a bit helpful!

*** Ditto to all the above!

My mum's fiancé still calls my granny "Mrs [surname]" over ten years after meeting her (and seeing her at least once a week since then) because she's never told him to call her [firstname]. It's become a bit of a joke and I kind of hope it carries on forever!

** In this, I take my lead from canon.

There are, for example, a lot of "Uncle Sirius" fics, but Harry never calls him anything but Sirius, Snuffles or Padfoot to my recollection. This would probably follow through with Andromeda even though the relationship is different.

Another way you can approach this is how Harry and co. refer to older members of the Order. Unfortunately, right now, I can only recall Tonks, but Shacklebolt, Mundungus etc. etc. are worth thinking about. I think they're usually referred to by their surnames... presumably because there's something of a professional relationship.

It also depends on who you're looking at. Harry is always very insistent on calling Snape, Snape and everyone else is constantly going /Professor/ Snape. In contrast, Harry always thinks in terms of Mr and Mrs Weasley. I can definitely see Arthur and Molly asking to be referred by their first names (certainly after any marriage, but probably before as well)... but I also think Harry would sometimes lapse back to Mr and Mrs Weasley. (I can't remember, but I think Harry varies between Remus and Lupin.)

So... let's break it down:

- peers you like => first name (Ernie)
- peers you don't like => surname (Malfoy)
- teachers... either Professor Surname or Surname depending on person
- respected elders... Mr/Mrs (and presumably Ms and Miss) Surname
- elders whose relationship to subject is professional => surname
- elders whose relationship to subject is personal => first name
- elders you're disrespecting... first name (Tom)

with stickiness, i.e. occasionally reverting to an older form of address/how the subject originally referred to the person in question

So, I'm pretty confident Harry would call Andromeda, Andromeda and Teddy would call Harry, Harry (and Ron, Ron and so forth). Not so sure about your other questions.

*** There's potentially a class factor, as well. It's more evident in Enid Blyton than in Harry Potter, but it's there. Mundungus and Tom the barman are only ever that - we dont know Tom's last name, and Dung is rarely called Fletcher or Mr Fletcher. Lower and middle classes are more likely to want informal first name.

**** Interesting.

Just in case it wasn't clear, when I mentioned Tom above I had forgotten Tom the Barman exists.

** Molly - on day one probably. “Don't be silly dear, just call me Molly!”

** I'd call everyone by first names after being invited too. Otherwise it's Mr or Mrs. In public I'd call the Professors Professor and first names in private. Anyone I don't have a good relationship with would be called by surname only. Like Snape or Malfoy's.

EDIT: I'm basing this on being an adult, I would never have called a teacher by first names as a pupil.

** Mr / Mrs [last name] would generally be used unless the adult gives permission to use their first name, or introduces themselves using their first name. For the teachers, it would be sir or miss, Mr [last name] or Mrs [last name]. A lot of Colleges / Sixth Forms and Universities involve students and teachers being on a first name basis, however this depends on said educational establishment. However, for Hogwarts, it would still be professor or professor [last name], or sometimes sir if it is a certain grumpy potions professor.

Essentially, it is formal titles unless said person lets you use their first name (although formal titles would still be used when necessary). However, this permission depends on the closeness of the two people, the situation they are in and their personalities.

** Arthur and Molly would probably insist to be called like this pretty quickly, especially considering both Harry and Hermione relations as in law, hell Harry could even get to call they Dad and Mum (Hermione may too but a bit more difficult when your actual parents are still there).

For the teacher, depend of the context. A Ministry Ball (fanon loves it) where they are here because of their positions? Or a parent meeting at Hogwarts? "Professor" until asked to do otherwise.\\
Just meeting them in Diagon Alley? Mr and Mrs until asked to do otherwise (I would guess that McGonagall would give them a pass very quickly, but other teacher like Flitwick or Sprout would need more time as the heroes are not as close to them).

Pretty hard to guess for other characters, someone like Slughorn would probably insist to be called Horace by "heroes" like the Trio, but someone less well known like, let's say, Dean, may not be granted the right (though Slughorn would probably ignore someone who is neither a genius, a celebrity, or close to a celebrity).

Finally, for the Malfoys in a Dramione or Drarry situation, I think it doesn't matter. Since neither of these ships have any chance to happen with canon character.\\
They are Blood Purist so Hermione would never be accepted by them, so even if you fabricate a situation where they end up together, either "Reformed" Draco is estranged to his parents, or the parents or OOC enough that you can do anything you want.\\
Harry is a man, and while I don't think the Magical World would be as against homosexuality as the real world can be, 2 mans can't have a child together (except in the . . . mpreg fanon). And considering the importance given by Blood Purist to Blood (duh), not being able to sire a child is probably a deal breaker. So either they both have a "deep friendship" while doing their duties to their wife (at least Draco), or not accepted by parents. If "accepted", I guess that Harry statues as the man who killed Voldemort (again) would give him some leeways in how to call the Malfoys.

** It honestly depends on how close they are. If McGonagall is a mother figure then you might see “Minerva” pop up, likewise for Dumbledore or really any other character
