Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but a author going out of their way to hate on a character is usually a no go.

Can be on ANY site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.


** Not Harry Potter, but Tom Bombadil in lotr fits your request
