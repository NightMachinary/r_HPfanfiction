As the title says, I'm looking for something to get into.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

*** The first chapter and summary gives the impressive of not much deviation from canon, does this stay true?

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament)

It's a live triangle (rectangle?) between a Harry, OC, Fleur, and very recently Daphne. Fleur is pretty foward and aggressive in this one but only in the later chapters. I 100% ship Harry/Fleur but in this one I'm all for Harry/OC (mostly because the OC has been developed more). Hopefully Fleur gets more screentime. It's been updated 3 days ago.

Linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic)

My favorite one but hasn't been updated in 5 months. I pray.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter gets ready to take on a Triwizard Tournament that captures international attention. He finds a new home, mentor, friends, allies and works to become his own man. Follow Harry as he dives into international waters and finds out if he is a shark or a minnow. Rated M in case something rated M is added in the future.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

*** I hope it stays ambiguous and that the Hermione in the fic has to deal with social ostracization.

The author says he's not bashing, but he obviously is as Dumbledore is hiding Harry's heritage and his friends both abandon him/nag.

It's still surprisingly decent writing.
