Take it as you will. Main character Harry Potter please


** linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane)

The library knows what people should know and can use. It's not a very major plot point though. Story example: [[/spoiler][Harry learns how to cast certain arcane magicks, while Dumbledore insists that Hermione would only have learned of their existence but not how to cast them because she could/would never cast them]]
