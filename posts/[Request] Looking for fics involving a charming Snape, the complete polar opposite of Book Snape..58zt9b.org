I don't care about whether or not it's romance (though slash isn't my cup of tea), but I would appreciate suggestions for fanfics either centering around or involving a calm, /charming/ Snape, completely OOC as it may be. An Alan Rickman style Snape would probably be on the right track.


** linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always by Deadwoodpecker) also has a Snape who is (in private, away from his Death Eater act) sufficiently decent that he ends up as Sirius' friend at the end, though it has been too long since I read it to remember if he's "charming" in private or not. Still, this does result in a rather amusing after-chapter...

I will also second linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm) as having an alternate universe Snape who has clean, beautiful hair and a friendly personality.

*** Great Story!

"We must be in an alternate universe!"

"You came to that conclusion based upon Severus's robe and hair?"

"Why does everyone mention my robes? And they are not red, they are burgundy! Red would be tacky! And I washed my hair this morning, like every morning!"

** You might want to check out [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/]] if you haven't already. It's all Harry and Snape, but NO slash. There must be a few charming Snapes on that site.

** I don't know of any charming Snapes that don't center around a romance, but you can find a lot on the SSHG site Ashwinder. I'd check in the fluff and romance categories (the two I tend to avoid because I like my Snape nasty haha). [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php]]
