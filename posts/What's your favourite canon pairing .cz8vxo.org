** My favourite canon pairing is actually one that is only briefly alluded to once or twice in the entire series - Ted Tonks and Andromeda Black. The daughter of probably the most important and most bigoted family in the Sacred Twenty-Eight renounces all claim to centuries of inherited wealth and family ties and goes and marries a muggleborn wizard. That's textbook fairytale romance!

And although I'm a strong Harmony shipper, even I'll admit that the Harry-Ginny pairing was great to read, especially with Ginny's wit and both of them being jocks through-and-through. Pity, JKR chose to devote very little of the books to their romance.

On that note, I was wondering what the director and screenwriters were intending when they wrote in that 'Dumbledore reminiscing about past loves' scene in HBP (just before JKR outed Dumbledore's sexuality). I think there was a brief mention of Dumbledore dancing with McGonagall at the Yule Ball, if I'm not mistaken - and as a kid, before all of McGonagall's life history came out on Pottermore, I used to think those two were a couple in secret and that it would all be revealed in the final book! 😂😂

It's never sat good with me. Especially since he's already rejected her before then! She should have respected him the first time and stopped going after him. Anyone who does that has consent and boundary issues. No means no, no matter what reasons the person has. Even if Remus's reasons weren't great or whatever, they were still his.

Not surprising he literally tried to run out on her and Teddy later! She literally forced him into a relationship. It is an abusive canon relationship, just seen through a lovey lense. I wouldn't be surprised if Tonks got him pregnant to begin with to try and force him to stay. Shit, that's also a horrible IRL thing that happens.

I would LOVE to see a fanfic that actually tackles abusive, gaslighting Tonks, and go all in on Remus getting away from her and the consequences and shit. There's not enough exposure to woman on man domestic abuse relationships.

And then everyone is surprised by Remus''s actions in DH when it should have been expected, given the fact that he was reluctant to enter the relationship and that pregnancy seemed like the last straw. And then they go,'oh poor Tonks'...Wll, and what did they think would happen? A happily ever after just because Tonks decided it's the right time to bring up their problems and Remus's fears just magically went away? Under every single fic that has this paring, Tonks is a poor lovely lady and Remus is an idiot for refusing to be with her. It's almost like he should be grateful she wants to be with him.

It's always irked me that when Remus/Tonks relationships go bad in fanfics, Remus is always shown to be the fault, despite the fact that he didn't even want in to this relationship. Harry yelling at Remus in DH did piss me off as well, no matter if Harry's reasons were semi-valid.

****** Harry's reasons were completely valid. Maybe Remus was reluctant to enter the relationship, maybe he was reluctant to get married, maybe he really really didn't want to have a child at all --- but he's a grown man, and he /did/ ultimately do all of those things, and he needs to take responsibility for them.

The time for Remus to walk out was /before/ he agreed to marry Tonks, and certainly before Tonks became pregnant with their child. I have no objections to an adult declining to enter a relationship (whatever the reason) or ending a relationship that isn't working. But you don't just run off and leave your pregnant partner --- let alone the future child --- high and dry during war time. Maybe you don't remain partnered, but you don't get to disappear on the partner or the child. Harry was right to yell at him for that --- Remus needed a wake up call, and for someone to challenge his selfish self-talk and rationalization that leaving his family was the “right thing.” Since all Remus's friends (and presumably family) are dead, that task fell to Harry.

I wish someone had been on hand to yell at /Tonks/ when she decided to leave her infant son and knowingly run into the front lines of an active battle. I get wanting to go after your spouse and I get wanting to fight for a cause, but she and Remus have an obligation to their son as well. Arguably, Tonks should've been the one to go to Hogwarts and Remus should've stayed back with the baby, since Tonks' Auror training and skill set would make her a better asset to the resistance than an older guy with slower reflexes, zero Auror training, probably rusty dueling skills, and a sometimes-debilitating malady.

I hate that Teddy's orphaning is treated like a full-circle version of Harry's, when they are /not/ the same thing at all. Harry and his parents were specifically targeted and they tried to hide as best they could, but violence came /to them/. And when Voldemort busted into their safe house, James gave his life trying to give Lily and Harry a better shot at escape, and Lily died trying to protect Harry. They did every single thing they could to survive and protect their family and son. Remus and Tonks both left their newborn at home to go duel to the death. Teddy could and should still have at least one parent.

******** I'm not sure that bringing along a middle aged man with lycanthropy was going to improve their odds. It really had to be Harry --- it's what Dumbledore had in mind, he'd been laying that track and dropping the bread crumbs for years --- and Harry especially had an intuitive sense of the importance of that.

Lupin had been James and Lily's friend and he had been Harry's teacher and mentor; he wouldn't have been able to be a teammate, he would've been in almost a default position of seniority when he was not the right person to lead them right then. Lupin had been Sirius's friend and Snape's colleague. He had his own history with Dumbledore, Snape, the Order, and the Death Eaters that inevitably would've colored his perspective and interpretation of events in ways that could've skewed those months in the wrong direction.

Looking at it up front, yes, it only makes sense for Harry to accept all the help and experience he can get, regardless of the circumstances of the person offering. A more normal teenager would've been relieved to accept the offer. But the point is, Harry is not an ordinary teenager. It is easier for him to decline the offer from a personal standpoint because of his own history, and from a strategic standpoint Harry has never been accustomed to having a lot of direct hands-on adult supervision on these sorts of things (with the exception of Dumbledore) so Harry is relatively comfortable going without. In any case, they need to keep their footprint small and mobile, and adding more people to the group is not necessarily better.

I suspect Rowling tied down Lupin to Tonks and a baby in part to sideline Lupin more easily (also she's said she liked the “symmetry” of Teddy being “an orphan but better off than Harry” which as I've said doesn't add up for me). I suspect she may have killed off Sirius for a similar reason, or at least it was a plotting benefit of his death. Otherwise, Sirius would've had a very hard time letting Harry go off himself. By the end of Harry's sixth year at least, Sirius wouldn't have really had to bother hiding anymore, since the Ministry went sideways. Without a lot of growth from Sirius in the sixth book, I can't imagine what Rowling could've done with him to keep him sidelined in the seventh. Sirius's death is one of the worst character losses for me so I hate to say it, but there was no other way.

Both are headstrong and for the lack of a better term, they complete each other. Also, it's the relationship that grew with the books and as characters we know a lot about them and at the same time we don't know enough due to Harry's oblivious behavior towards their friends. Due to that, there are enough gaps you can use your imagination to fill with.

Both are very flawed individuals and they might have to keep fighting for each other. That's an aspect I really love. And I love their bickering. Both are extroverts and dominating personalities that keeps each other going and they would clash, but they make it work. Both Hermione and Ron would be bored with someone else who didn't really push or clash with them. Their communication troubles will get between them, but they do tend to wear their hearts out on their sleeves when it comes to each other. So most of the problems they faced in their school years should not come into play after they are married.

I love Bill And Fleur as well. I love everything about them, but for me what I see through Harry's eyes are not enough. I would have loved to see more about Fluer's relationship with the rest of the Weasley more, Before and after the incident. And I loved how Fluer acted when Bill was injured.

I like Molly and Arthur, but their parenting left a lot to be desired. Obviously their heart was in the right place, but they could have done a better job. From what we see Arthur was too much of a pushover and could have helped alot with parenting. Their children does seem to have a lot of issues and we don't really see Molly and Arthur trying to help their kids work through it.

There aren't many other pairings to work with right? I am not even going to start with Death Eaters and Remus/Tonks was a disaster. James/Lily we don't have much to work with. Harry/Ginny is decent enough but Ginny was 'created' to be Harry's girlfriend. Instead of showing us how badass Ginny was, JKR tells us how badass she is and how much Harry deserves her. She goes around using hexes even outside of school and on other students and it is shown to portray how badass she is. She literally gets rewarded for using the bat-bogey hex on another student. She is great at Quidditich because, Harry loves Quidditich. Ginny doesn't really have major flaws in her character and I don't really like that. And while there is a development in their relationship, for me it feels forced. Even in the books. Although, to be fair Harry had a lot on his mind in their sixth and seventh years.

Harry not seeing flaws doesn't mean they're not there. She was an absolute cunt to Ron on a few occasions and I think we're all supposed to see that. She was awful about Fleur, too. While it was established that Fleur was a bitch in her own right we don't see that interaction with Ginny. We just see Ginny being childish and oft times mean.

**** Yeah but I don't think that's the way it was presented. I agree that since we were seeing things from Harry's perspective things probably were a bit muddled, but those flaws are not really shown as flaws imo. Yes, she was a cunt to Ron, but it was mostly shown as that even on those occasions she was in the right and, well Ron deserved it. For example where she goes on about how Ron is inexperienced sexually and romantically. If we really dwelve into it Ginny is in the wrong, but it's not really presented that way. Ron said something he shouldn't have, so Ginny gave it back as good as she got. #GinnyBadass.

It's seriously muddled with Fluer because the three main women in the books doesn't like Fluer for various reasons, but I hardly ever see them gettting called out for it. This is the first time in a long time I saw someone calling out Ginny for her behavior against Fluer and that speaks for itself, doesn't it? It's not really presented that way.

Again, since we are seeing things from Harry's perspective it's really hard to pin down some characteristic. And it does leave room for interpretation with things like this. So you do have a good point.

****** I don't think they are that close. Iirc, there is a 10 year age gap between Ginny and Bill. Bill might have baby sat Ginny. Even that's doubtful because I don't think Molly would let her two year baby girl old out of her sights. But yeah, I agree that it's probably her over protectiveness towards Bill. Afterall Ginny and Ron are very similar in most aspects.

I doubt that Ginny will have that much of a bond with Bill during his holidays. Even in those holidays he probably were in charge of all of his siblings to single out and have a special bond with Ginny. Even if they did, he might just become another occasional parental figure to Ron and Ginny. For example Ron is always going about the cool things Bill told, but he hardly ever mentions Bill specifically spending time with his siblings alone. Same with Charlie tbh.

******* Bill is ten or eleven years older than Ginny, but they still could've been close. I've got age gaps like that in my family, and it creates a pretty interesting dynamic. The older sibling is in the position of having known --- really /known/ --- the baby sibling since birth, and was there for all those baby milestones. The older sibling will have been doting on the baby for a long time, before the baby is even old enough to sustain a mutual sibling relationship. For Bill, that's a serious investment in a younger sibling (almost like an uncle/niece relationship at that stage). For Ginny, she has this super cool big brother --- the age difference and his absence at school and work mean that they never were in conflict the way closer-aged siblings are, so even though she sees him less than her other brothers, pretty much every single interaction and memory might be purely positive and exciting.

They might not know each other as well as Ron and Ginny know each other, but that might be balanced out by years of fondness and care on Bill's end from Ginny's infancy, and by years of Ginny's untarnished admiration of her cool big brother from afar. And now that he's back in the country, she's probably really eager to have him close again (he probably is glad to be closer to family too --- and now his baby sister is more grown up, they can have a more sibling-like relationship which is a cool turning point).

The fiancée twist can often go in two different directions in these dynamics. Either the younger sibling, who is inclined to think everything to do with the older sibling is pretty great, eagerly accepts the significant other, or the younger sibling isn't excited about the interloper and is more critical, and takes some time to warm up. Ginny is only like 14 or 15 years old. She is snarky and judgmental about Fleur, but she's young and she's also not the only family member to find Fleur irritating at first. I think she did/will eventually come around.

It's funny that you say that, because for me, seeing them apparently attracted to each other in book six was rather out of left field. I can intellectually appreciate the arguments that they enjoy arguing with each other, but my general impression of them was and is of non-sexual tension.

**** I generally enjoyed it and personally I took it as their form of flirting and unresolved sexual tension. Apart from two occasions (Scabbers/Crooks Hanks and Lavendar fiasco) they are quick to make up. The Ball incident was resolved quickly and since their fourth year, most of their fights were related to their sexual relationship that they both couldn't really understand. I mean, fuck. If I was attracted to my best friend when I was 15, I'd be confused as fuck as well. I would have acted differently, but still confused.

The biggest hint (apart from Krum incident) for me about this was the fact that it was shown that they enjoy their bickering. They looked offended when Harry called it out. This made me confirm my belief that it was their own form of flirting.

Again though, these things are up for interpretation. Harry is one oblivious teenage boy.

Was it, though? Or was it swept under the rug? Ron certainly didn't act afterward like they had talked it out and resolved how they feel about each other and whether they want to date. He continued to be the same kind of oblivious that upset her in the first place. And until year six, with such memorable incidents as the Twittering Yellow Birds of Prey, she didn't show much of her disappointment.

** I have no positive emotional investment in any canon pairing. This implies I hate them all, but what I mean is that I care little for the vast majority of them and there's the occasional pairing I dislike, either for reasons I consider reasonable, or purely emotionally ("but muh OTP"). However, there is one pairing I have nothing at all against, even if I were to try to find fault with it -- Arthur/Molly. It's the one canon pairing that is, to me, perfectly healthy with no issues at all. So I guess you could say it's my favorite canon pairing, even if I don't really care for it to the point where I go looking for fics with it.

**** Because it is canon, Remus was to uncomfortable coming out as bisexual (whereas Sirius didn't give a single fuck about coming out as gay) and also being a werewolf so no one except James, Lily and Peter knew that the two of them dated throughout their Hogwarts years and after until Sirius got arrested and Remus felt like an idiot for ever trusting him, until he learned the truth, and was too ashamed about thinking the worst of the love of his life that he didn't want to go back to Sirius because he didn't truly believe that Sirius forgave him. So after Sirius died he hated himself(even more) and was feeling so low that he gave into the pressure and started dating Tonks, got her preggers and married her because it was the polite thing too do.

** I think James/Lily is my favorite. I dislike Ron/Hermione a lot, but if Ron had matured like James supposedly did, then Romione wouldn't have been bad (we see in Cursed Child that Ron did not mature at all). Now granted James and Lily died so we don't get to see how their relationship would have grown (or disintegrated) but what we do know it looked like they were very happy. Someone else said Arthur/Molly, and I guess that would be my second choice even if Molly was a bit too loud and overprotective for my tastes.

Worst canon pairings are easily Romione and Remus/Tonks IMHO. Ron didn't grow at all, and honestly neither did Hermione. Remus was at least 13 years older than Tonks and ended up being a coward when it counted most. Oh, he fought in the war, but wanted to leave his pregnant wife behind to go off with his best-mate's son.

Honestly the more I write and read fanfiction, the more I'm convinced that JKR should have left Romance ambiguous for the books. It would have been so much better. As we see them at the end of the BoH, none of the characters are good for any of the others. Good relationships require character growth and we just don't see that a lot in any of the main characters. Ron is still just as much of an immature disloyal arse as he was in book 4. And that's perfectly fine, I guess, since he's only 18. Harry is just as lazy and dependent on luck at the end of the books as he was at the beginning. The closest he ever came to having that "Oh, shit! Voldemort's after me, I should learn some magic and shit!" moment was book 4 and then be went backwards in book 5. Hermione is the only one we see grow any at all in the books, and she goes through a complete character shift in book 6 and then again in book 7. As much as I'm a Harry/Hermione shipper, as they are at the end of the books pre-epilogue, I don't think any pairing was realistic. They all just had too much growing to do, and all of them were basically child soldiers, so stable and healthy relationships at least right away seems unlikely.

** They straight up do not have positive interactions, do not have anything in common, and do not respect each other. The idea that they would last in a relationship over a month is laughable. They are without a doubt the worst relationship in a popular work I have ever seen and I can only imagine people pretend to think they can be together out of blind loyalty to JKR or contrariness.

The arguments I've seen in favor of them come down to "no, really, people like being sniped at all day" and "there's signs they have positive interactions offscreen!" but given what is onscreen I have no idea what that would look like.
