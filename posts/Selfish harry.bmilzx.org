No I am not talking about fics where Harry gets tired and stop caring - I m talking about the where Harry is self-centered through and through. No "grey" wizard shit either. Like, selfish as in " I m gonna go shopping spree at Saks Fifth Avenue while everyone else is fighting for their lives" and refusing to fight Voldemort simply because he doesn't feel compelled too.


** What about the lazy one where he was Hufflepuff. That was fun up to a point. Oh and there was one where he and Black just partied? Sound familiar? Selfish would be extremely difficult to write but it would be an interesting change.

** Hmm, I think the fic I'm reading sort of fits those requirements. Harry is EXTREMELY Slytherin and does things based on whether or not it'll make him or his house look good, rather than doing it because it's the right thing to do.

*** Already read that but dropped it because of too many side tracks.

**** Understandable, I find myself scrolling past some of the side plots myself at times.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
