I'd like to read some more stories involving Harry or him along with other characters building a country, civilization, community, etc. either just because or because they've been put in circumstances that make doing so important to survival.

Situations like being stranded somewhere, lost in space, etc.

Suggestions and even tangentially related things would be cool too!

This is probably my favorite one, but it's abandoned. It's a SG: Atlantis cross where Harry and surviving members of the wizarding world go to Atlantis and create a civilization there.

****** I haven't read the story, but I guess depending exactly /how/ angry Harry gets, it could be considered in character for him. In the books, he does express annoyance more than once when someone else doesn't agree with him. And under sufficient stress (End of OotP pops into mind) he can have a rather volatile temper. Getting angry isn't necessarily wrong or bad, in some situations it's totally justifiable. I guess it depends on context.

Like, if the other characters decide that Harry is in charge. It's up to him to figure out the best way of achieving *insert random goal* and Harry says "This is the way we should do this thing." and everyone completely disregards his suggestion and blows him off, then he's justified in being angry. Why put him in charge and then not listen when he makes a decision?

Now if he's being whiny and petulant because he /wants/ control and no one is giving it to him, then yes, that is OOC.

******* In the first chapter, Trelawney dies after giving a prophecy. He gets into an intense argument with Hermione about the legitimacy of said prophecy. I grant you, his anger in this is fine, if a bit too much in my opinion.

But then he goes to Gringotts, and gets angry that the Goblins dare get angry that he robbed them -- then goes on this tirade:

#+begin_quote
  "I want what is mine," Harry snapped. "I want all the galleons from the Potter vault, from the vaults of the dead Death Eaters, and from the vault of Tom Riddle. The bastard must have had one at some point during his miserable life. Most of all I never want to see another treacherous goblin for as long as I live."
#+end_quote

Then he goes to a law firm because he wants royalty rights on all BWL merchandise.

#+begin_quote
  The pretty receptionist at Osborne & Partners looked at Harry's ragged clothes with disdain. "And you are?"

  "I'm the wizard who just killed Voldemort, so tell your employer that I want to see him right now."
#+end_quote

The lawyer tells him that there is no such thing as royalties in the wizarding world, that no one had ever gotten money from, say, having their face on a chocolate frog card.

#+begin_quote
  "So when a Weird Sisters' record is played on the Wizarding Wireless Network they don't get any royalties?" Harry asked.

  "No, they do not," Osborne replied. "It's the same when they place your picture on a Chocolate Frog Card. All the profits go to the company which produces the cards, not to the individual wizards."

  "Well, I don't really care how things were done in the past, I care about the future. So I want you to send cease-and-desist letters to every company which is currently producing "Harry Potter" products. Tell them I want at least fifty percent of all their profits. If they refuse tell them I will sue them in the Wizengamot, and that I will demand one hundred percent of all their profits---including everything they have earned during the past seventeen years."
#+end_quote

Then he does this:

#+begin_quote
  "You seem very concerned with your financial situation Mr Potter. May I ask why?"

  "No, you may not. Solicitors are paid to keep their mouths shut. If you wish to continue this profitable business relationship in the future you would do well to remember that."
#+end_quote

Then he arrives back at Hogwarts, and proves himself smarter than any magical theorist that has ever lived.

#+begin_quote
  "Mr Potter that has been a subject of intense debate here at Hogwarts since the muggle Isaac Newton published his Principia over three hundred years ago," Professor Flitwick explained. "We know that magic breaks some of the laws of physics, but does it break all of them? Or are there certain universal laws that even magic must obey? To answer your question, we honestly don't know if magic allows a wizard to travel faster than the speed of light."

  "Why hasn't there been any experiments conducted to test the theory?" Luna asked.

  "That is easier said than done Miss Lovegood," Sinistra replied. "You can only travel a limited distance using apparition or portkeys. That makes it very difficult for an observer to conclusively measure how fast you are actually moving."

  Harry tried to remember what that long-range apparition had felt like. "Your body is squeezed by intense pressure, and then you instantaneously reemerge in a different location. I'm positive that no time passes at all."

  "Perhaps you are right Mr Potter, but it's a moot point. No wizard or witch has ever apparated more than a thousand kilometers at a time," Sinistra argued. "The process would be completely useless for traveling to another star."

  "*I am right, and that means magic does allows us to travel faster than the speed of light*," Harry shot back. "At least it's a place to start. What about a using a portkey?"
#+end_quote

And then after this magnificent display of arrogance, he has this conversation with McGonagall, which is the cherry on top of all of the shit he's pulled so far

#+begin_quote
  "Well, I didn't think this was going to be easy," Harry sighed. "Professor Sinistra, thank you for all your help. Professor McGonagall, I was hoping to move into the Head Boy's suite tonight."

  "I'm not quite sure I'm following you Mr Potter."

  "I will be returning to Hogwarts to repeat my seventh year. *It's pretty obvious that I will be chosen as the new Head Boy*, so I would like to stay at the castle this summer. After living in a tent for a year with two other people, having a private room and a private loo will be a wonderful change."
#+end_quote

In OotP, Harry was justifiably angry, but he was never unjustifiably so, nor did he take out his anger on random goblins, random civilians, or random lawyers. He never demanded anything that wasn't his due. And he was put in his place rather severely by Ginny when he went off on his friends, which had him properly chastised. This Harry is none of the above. He is rude, abrasive, arrogant, and egomaniacal.

Note that this is just the first chapter. There are 21 more after this for his ego to ramp up even more.

** It's probably only tangentially related, but as far as building a new civilization/community goes, I'll recommend Bobmin356's excellent HP/Pern crossover /The Queen who fell to Earth/, and its sequels. linkffn(The Queen who fell to Earth; On the Wings of Dragons; Beneath Sovereign Skies)\\
Sadly the last few remaining chapters may never be written, as the author died of cancer earlier this year.

And of course if you want some /literal/ building, there's nothing better than [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harrys-island-home-harry-potter-that-flies-off-the-rails-quickly.325447/][Harry's Island Home]] (no bot, sorry, I don't think bot links work for SpaceBattles).\\
Okay, nothing except what is perhaps its original inspiration, linkffn(On An Island In The Sun by Rorschach's Blot) - which is perhaps less incredible, but has the big bonus of the building being done mostly /by/ Harry rather than, at least initially, /for/ Harry.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
