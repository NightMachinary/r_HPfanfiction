So I am currently on the final story of GreenGecko's series. So far it has been a pretty good time. If I had one major complaint it is that Harry is by far annoyingly underpowered/overpowered. In almost any situation that isn't the climax of an arc he is constantly being thrown around everywhere, with no sign of improvement at all, but in the climax of an arc he wins almost too easily.

But I can get over that, what kills is I just reached [[/s][Chapter 32 of Revolution]]

I guess as a follow up question, has any story gotten you really far into it, gotten you emotionally invested, and then done something that just made you drop it?

It didn't make me drop the story because I liked the series as a whole, but some of the decisions made by the protagonist of the /Alexandra Quick/ series almost had me banging my head on the wall in frustration.

**** I agree, this complaint about the AQ series always gets on my nerves. The main character is an impetuous teenager. She makes bad decisions. What a shocker.

****** I'm not sure about that, I think the real issue is that Alex learns the /wrong/ lessons. Through the books adults keeping her in the dark have pushed her to break rules again and again despite the consequences, because there's just so much dangerous shit going on in AQ. The real make or break it pout I think is going to be the next book. If Alexandra learned absolutely no caution from all the pain and trouble she caused people, I'm done. If she finally had to come to terms with how badly she's messed up so many people's lives, including her own, then I think the arc will be justified.

***** It's not that I don't understand why she makes poor decisions, it's just that it hurts. Her stupid choices make me feel like I'm hearing nails on a chalk board in my brain. I liked the stories and read it all, but I had to take breaks in between readings!

***** Yeah, no I completely agree. Also, she's pretty much textbook ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), which is a childhood disorder marked by extreme disobedience. I think when you consider that she is a troubled kid who really has an issue with obeying figures of authority...it becomes less annoying and more believable.

Because these kids exist. They just aren't particularly /fun/ kids...

** BarbLP wrote one of the best trilogies ever (Psychic Serpent etc.), and then tacked on the absolute worst ending in all of fanfiction, ever. Seriously, you're 1.2 million words in, it's so well written otherwise, and then boom!

I've never re-read it. I probably should eventually - its got some great parts in it, especially for when it was written (between books 4 & 5), but it just pissed me off that much. Thankfully I've never seen another story that ended anything near like it.

Currently falling out of love with The Arithmancer, as I commented here elsewhere... Hermione seems so overpowered and doesn't act her age anymore. She acts like a prim, nagging 20-something year old. She has an answer to everything and everyone, and the story has her solving or leading almost every situation/plot point. It seems like the other characters put her on a pedestal. It's disheartening, because I loved the concept of this.

If a fic is already complete once I've started it, I'm pretty good at stomaching a fic and just skimming/speed reading on to the end. WIPs, though, I'm more likely to abandon halfway through if the characters just become OOC. I find that authors start out writing ok, but as their story diverges from canon, the characters end up acting really OOC.

** Yeah, that really bothered me as well. Once that happened, I think my reading of it slowed down, and i stopped being upset about there being no complete ending to the series. Idk I just really didn't like how imposter Snape was handled.

** I kinda understood Harry's reasoning behind /that/ decision. What made me a bit disinterested in the whole story was that Harry even let the impostor run free in his native world in the first place. It's a being from an alternate dimension, all he knows about him is that he (the impostor) could've ended up like his Snape but he didn't, and yet he lets him run things in his very own house.

Everything turns out fine eventually, sure, --- the impostor even kinda helps him --- but that's precisely what I had problems with in that story. The author was making his protagonists act on a string of idiot balls and later was /rewarding/ them for making irrational and stupid decisions.

Other than the opening story itself, I think I'll also mention /Mastermind Hunting/ and /The Sacrifices Arc/. Both, unfortunately, go very bad at the very end, so you don't even have a choice of meaningfully dropping them by that point.

**** Yes, it starts off rather originally and then keeps it up for the most of the story. Maybe you'll even like the ending, and if not --- just pretend that +nothing ever happened+ it's been abandoned near the end.
