  Dear Padfoot,

  Thank you, thank you, for Harry's birthday present! It was his favourite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I'm enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so funny, says he's going to be a great Quidditch player, but we've had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don't take our eyes off him when he gets going.

  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn't come, but the Order's got to come first and Harry's not old enough to know it's his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell -- also, Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. *Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard.*

  Bathilda drops in most days, she's a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I'm not sure he'd be pleased if he knew! I don't know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore

I mean IRL I know of plenty of people who say something like this. Another would be Mr. Smith? That's my dad, call me Joe!

So why does phrasing like that bother you in fanfiction?

** For the purposes of this subreddit:

1. Standard Bashing Storylines #1 and #2: Dumbledore's deliberately setting Harry up to fail, and the Weasleys are only getting close to Harry because he's rich and they want that moolah.
2. Anything that'd break Rule 8 if I linked to it, for obvious reasons.
3. Being surprised by the first 2. It's one thing if I can figure from the description or an early chapter that that's the way the story is going to go, it's a whole other can of beans if it's sprung on me halfway into a long fic.
4. Not many fanfic authors seem to realize it's perfectly possible to make their OTP happen without bashing the people they canonically get together with (or killing them off).
5. The fact that ArchiveOfOurOwn has 3 separate tags for Harry/Voldemort, 900 different tags for the Standard Bashing Plots mentioned above, and people who abuse the tagging system by only tagging their work with stuff like "i wrote this at oh-hell-no-thirty in the morning" so it's impossible to filter out everything that makes me immediately dislike a fic.

** - Temporary transfiguration.

- Magical exhaustion or "magical energy".

- Muggle technology or natural forces overcoming/circumventing spells (unless that natural force also has magical significance)

- Wish magic (intent is all that matters!).

- Dictionary magic (magic is just knowing incantations!).

- Magical knowledge/understanding being irrelevant to the use of magic.

- Muggle/scientific knowledge being relevant to the use of magic.

- Trivialising the effectiveness of wizarding secrecy/Muggle governments "in the know" beyond what they are permitted to know by wizards.

- Weak Harry (emotionally, mentally, magically).

- Notably short Harry.

- Veela!Fleur.

- Hermione as a Snape-level magic user or higher.

I won't mention all the indy!Harry/manipulative!Dumbledore tropes but you can assume all those are included too.
