**** don't give in to the guilt. that's a fun story, especially the Ron/Melissa escape from the graveyard.. when Melissa clocks Bella with half a tree and runs off with Ron kiting Voldy into range so Emma can unload five rounds of 00 buckshot into Squirrelmort.. what more could you ask for?

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
