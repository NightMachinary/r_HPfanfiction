I can't remember the name but its a story where Harry is a expert in languages and eventually trades a dead or almost dead language to the goblins for access to their library. Also after a couple of years the grangers adopt harry and take him out of the country just in time for SG-1 to try and contact him through his fake name for help translating something


** I totally remember this, but I'm unable to find it. For the record you're not missing much, it died right after they tried to contact him and no real plot or character interaction had occurred yet.

  Harry has a talent for languages, he learns fifteen of them before he reaches Hogwarts. Will he be able to learn the British Spell language fluently? And what other uses might that language have?
