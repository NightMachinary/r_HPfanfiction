Mine was a crossover with Jet Li's Dog/Unleashed where Hogwarts starts at seventeen, giving Vernon enough time to have Harry trained as a martial artist and mold him into a weapon that only acts when told, hates the idea of magic, and can only fight when his collar is released.

The magicals then, of course, find them and aurors decimate vernon's little criminal empire but don't understand what harry is and pack him off to school.

Harry is forced to interact and slowly gains a friend in Neville and Hermione until one day, Draco fucks around and hurts Hermione as he removes Harry's collar for some reason.

Hermione realizes the significance of the collar when he removes it himself later to attack an out of control creature in care then puts it back on afterwards.

Eventually, she helps him to overcome the conditioning until one day Draco attempts to rape Hermione and Draco dies at a collared Harry's hands.

Hermione and Harry go on the run, hunted by Aurors beholden to Malfoy. Climactic battle scene ensues and his collar is damaged.

She removes his collar and waits. He hesitantly smiles and she kisses him.

Epilogue: they return to hogsmeade as lucius malfoy's body is torn apart by dogs in an abandoned muggle town.


** Summer before +Sixth+ Fifth Year: Fudge passes an Educational Decree stating Dumbledore has one week to find a Professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts, or Dolores Umbridge is appointed.

Due to Voldemort being back, that position is more important than ever. Dumbledore has only one choice: Fake Gellert Grindelwald's death, and have him teach under an assumed name.

*** That'd be kind of interesting, especially if Grindelwald develops a Lupin-Harry relationship with Harry, undermining Dumbledore's original plan of having Harry rely on Love and Chance to win the battle. Although, it would be summer before Fifth Year, right? Sixth Year is when Snape became the DADA Professor.

** Harry dies and is reincarnated as his 17 year old self (the same body he was in the last time he dies). He is reborn into a universe where Harry Potter died on October 31st 1981, and that universe's Harry did not survive the killing curse. Sirius Black is 'The Boy Who Lived' because he confronted Voldemort after finding Harry, James, and Lily's bodies in Godric's Hollow and witnesses saw him struck by the killing curse and rise again. But that isn't the same Sirius either- the original Sirius Black died when the killing curse struck him. The Sirius Black currently inhabiting that body is the soul of canon Sirius Black after he fell through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries.

The problem is, I don't have a plot beyond that.

Dumbledore persuades him to play along, as he'll be in a great position to pass on false information. There would be a lots of interactions between Snape and Ron, as the former attempts to teach Ron. At first, Ron remains publicly friends with Harry, while passing on "intelligence". Eventually, he's found out and for the sake of the operation has to abandon him and join the Death Eaters.

** A story with a Harry who is a natural Legilimens, much like Queenie Goldstein from FB is. Queenie seemed to read minds almost by instinct, and from time to time you had the impression that what she reads in minds and sees in reality is a bit blurry at the edges from one to the other. Her greatest perk coming from this was the fact that she saw someone /literally/ for what he's inside rather than his looks. So in the movie she finds a truly kind, honest, loyal and loving man with which she falls in love, even if he got a few pounds too much. Frankly, one of my, if not my absolute favorite part of Fantastic Beasts.

I wanted to explore this with Harry, but it never went over a few lines, which you can now see here:

#+begin_quote
  The truth of attraction, as sad as it is, lies within the fact that humans see. Many may claim they don't, but everybody judges by looks first. The capability to judge on sight has made humanity as successful as it is, yet we know that even under the most beautiful skin, demons may slumber; even under most ghastly faces, a beacon of kindness may wait to shine out into the world.

  Unlimited secrets hide behind the eyes of every human, guarded by their behavior, their clothing, their hairstyle and mannerisms. Every human wears a mask, stitched together from show and shine, to dazzle the world. To know someone means to get rid of the mask, with painstaking patience and growing closeness. People only see each other as they are when they have long become so close, their eyes no longer see the skin, but the soul of each other.

  Harry had never experienced this mask. His gaze knew no patience when dealing with masks. His eyes were bulldozers, breaking down walls around mind and soul, yet his stare was as subtle as a mouse in a haystack.

  Harry knew the ugly as a amalgamation of arrogance, narcissism, hate and brutality. He knew beauty as kindness, compassion, love and happiness. Skin and bone were nothing but things - flesh as dead as a rock without soul and mind for him. While other children would hover around the pretty teacher, eager to have her attention, Harry prefered the wrinkly and old one. He had seen in the young ones mind and was repulsed and he had seen the old one and the truth of her neverending love and devotion.

** Harry Potter/Series of Unfortunate Events crossover.

Harry comes into contact with the Baudelaires while they're in the dubious care (A word which here means, neglectful, abusive, and forced to clean an entire house, all while their guardian is plotting to take their fortune.) of Count Olaf.

He confounds Mr. Poe, and obliviates Count Olaf of the Baudelaires, and takes guardianship of them.

During this chain of events, it comes to light that Sunny Baudelaire is a muggle born witch, and therefore, Harry doesn't have to worry about telling them about magic.

The children stay with Harry for a couple of months, until Hermione becomes aware of the Baudelaire's presence, and out of her duty as a member of VFD, tells them of their presence, which leads to Harry losing the Baudelaires, and him being obliviated of any and all knowledge of them.

The Baudelaires don't get memory wiped, and get sent to Doctor Montgomery Montgomery, and the plot picks back up from there.

A month or so later, Harry breaks through the memory charm by seeing something Sunny bit, Violet made, and one of Klaus' books, which causes him to go on a quest through America, looking for his children, VFD, and eventually catching up to them during the events of The Penultimate Peril.

I wanted to write this, but I simply don't have the time.

** I've had a plot bunny for nearly a year. The plot is based on what would have happened if Harry never entered the wizarding world. Dumbledore prevented it because he believed that Voldemort wouldn't have returned if Harry didn't go to Hogwarts. Instead, Harry becomes an apprentice of sort to Dumbledore. Harry grows up primarily living as a muggle with some magical training but he is never aware that an entire magical world exists. Dumbledore dies and Death Eater attacks begin to resurge. The Order of the Phoenix reassembles and Harry is found when he's about 20. There is also a romance side-plot.

Harry of course feels betrayed by Dumbledore, who kept him from his heritage. He has difficulty coping with the betrayal of the grandfather-like figure of his difficult childhood with the Dursley family.

The fic would explore the fight against Voldemort, and Harry's past.

I'll likely never write it because I don't have time but it's really fun to think about!

** An AU where Voldemort never became a Dark Lord, instead he's your average wizard man working as a healer, while Harry is your average wizard boy attending Hogwarts with a loving family and friends.

Except is not that easy.

Harry can only take pleasure in other people's happiness, living in a reckless, almost suicidal, way of life where he tries to help people at all cost. He must live with the fact he can't really connect with the people around him, and later, Harry begins to doubt himself as he thinks he unconsciously yearn for others to be hurt in order to help them. Harry, feeling guilty of this, wonders if his desire to help people is truly a good thing as some people tells him.

Then, there's Voldemort, who lives most of his early life fighting his horrifying impulses to hurt people. Trying to atone for his sinful desires, Tom becomes a healer, only to learn he relishes in his patient's suffering. Tom begins to experiment with the different ways he can make people suffer without being caught thanks to his natural charisma. Later, he embraces his dark nature and becomes the healer in Hogwarts after Madam Pomfrey's sudden disappearence, where he meets Harry, someone who soon realizes there's something wrong with him at first glare.

** The show "Cops" follows muggle police officers enforcing muggle law. The show "Magic Cops" follows Harry as a young auror enforcing magical law. Each short story would follow a case from beginning to end. If I really got into it I might have a common thread through some of the cases, which leads Harry and co. to unravel a grand scheme, which solidifies Harry's rep and leads to his nomination to become the head of magical law enforcement. Maybe Hermione is an investigator, like a CSI technician, and solving the case leads her to seek to replace the corrupt minister for magic.

  Witches and wizards are disappearing in a seemingly random fashion. Coincidence? Abductions? But no one is claiming ransom. The Aurors are not even sure the disappearances are connected, then one of the missing turns up dead. Meanwhile, Auror Harry Potter is thrown into the infamous Sirius Black Muggle murder case from 25 years ago. Given a chance to clear his godfather's name for good, Harry is not above accepting even the help of magical specialist Draco Malfoy.

** The wizarding world in the United States is something I find fascinating when looked at from the perspective of lower income witches and wizards with no-maj parents. There is no reference in the Harry Potter series to students having issues with testing with their year from first year (the only examples come from the later years). Personally I can't imagine magical American education without acknowledging how, here in America, schools in states with far worse funding for schools turn out kids who test far below grade level, especially if they live in a low income school district.

The idea was to follow a few low income witches and wizards who have no-maj parents who attended poorly funded schools, at least one with special needs. It would be slice of life and show how they got through Ilvermony, while also showing the difference of growing up poor with or without magic.

I want maybe a rewrite of my god awful fic, which explores the concept that magic grants sentience. Legilimens Sorting Hat, evil Mirror of Erised, Deathly Hallows etc. My fic had this, but it also had like 4-5 other plot devices worthy of their own story which should not have been mixed.

A fic which focuses on magic as an expression of symbolism. Other fics touch on it, and certain aspects, but I want to see someone taking a vial of someone's blood, tossing it on a mirror and then breaking the mirror to give them bad luck. That sort of stuff, with rituals, and sympathetic magic.

I want to see a fic explore the some aspects of the Wizarding World. Everyone is armed with a deadly weapon which can spit out weapons of mass destruction with a thought. At this point, wizards don't even care about such weapons as nukes, because they have already had their existential crises. Nundus and Basilisks could kill cities easily, Dragons are akin, and in truth superior to Muggle tanks. A complex rune array designed to do some task combined with a perpetual Geminio curse set to be constantly active would create what Muggles call grey goo. Fiendfyre is nearly unstoppable, and is also a sentient fire which actively tries to kill you. They already have their own form of AI, since magic seems to encourage sentience anyway, even in a broken down flying car. Obviously they don't have to worry about some things. They don't use connections the way Muggles do, so Rogue AI is probably not a factor, and they aren't at risk for a Singularity event.

On the other hand, while they don't have gene editing, they don't particularly need it to make scary lifeforms. Genetics doesn't seem to work at all with regards to magic. Inbreeding should show much more pronounced effects than they seem to, and with the exception of the Gaunts, everything could be explained by chance. It also appear that DNA is laughable to wizards. They can crossbreed Manticores Firecrabs to make Blast Ended Skewts. Thats right. They had a venomous dart throwing lion fuck a burning crab, to make a highly durable, spell resistant man sized carnivorous lobster which propels itself by blowing itself up, seemingly with no need for chemicals. I think there is a very good reason that animal breeding is banned, and that a number of Wizarding weapons of mass destruction are animals.

EDIT: I also want a Russian Harry. Like stereotypical Russian accent, values, etc. Idk if just raised in Russia, or time-traveled to be born into the Communist Party. But I want a Russian Harry, smoking, squating, wearing Adidas and drinking Vodka.

** Myrddin Wylt - a non-human shapeshifter - gave into death after centuries of life at the loss of everyone he cared about, safe in the knowledge that they would all meet again one day.

Fast forward several centuries and the oldest human around is Nicholas Flamel, someone who remembers the wizards sad old eyes - the one, in his own youth, to bury him alongside a lover that had been gone far too long with a promise to meet again someday. Then you have Hermione Jean Granger - who's usual soft brown eyes change with her mood, who seems to see through people instead of at them, who never gets along with children because they can't understand that she is broken in a way no one around her can comprehend - in a way she cannot remember. Her childhood is lonely, there's a taste of something else, something better, that seems to dance around her and because of that she is always looking for answers that aren't anywhere she can find.

Then, I have plotted out the end; the final battle and the history of the reincarnated characters - you'd have a Harry that's Arthur, orphaned soon after birth in both lives, a Lancelot and Guinevere - best friends and worst enemies - and a Morgana, an ally in disguise - a grey witch, the first animagus, an alchemist, and someone that fell in love despite all the odds.

There's more somewhere, but it's buried, and fading - I've been thinking about it since before I accidentally deleted all my notes - 'cough' FanFiction 'cough' - and for a long while after. If I ever get around to writing FanFiction, the SS/HG, possibly played out from Harry's eyes for most of the time with all the background from theirs, would be the one I would started with.

I've been hesitant to post it, because it's an idea from before I delved into the realm of HP - reluctantly because I knew then that it would consume me and yet could not resist - and thusly is, to my knowledge, completely original. By now it's certainly adopted elements from other stories, but the core idea, a former non HGSS fic, is hopefully different from anything else. I'm less greedy now, at least in the realm of ideas, and thus - here it is.

** I keep having thoughts about a world-weary dimension-travelling MoD Harry that ends up in Marvelverse. He finds his counterpart in Jean Gray who is dealing with being the avatar of the phoenix. The fic would be about him struggling to build a relationship with her and trying to dig her out the psychoses layered onto her by Phoenix, Xavier, Hellfire, and Dark Phoenix.

He'd also be trying to stay alive and keep her from killing people as everyone and their mother try to kidnap her back and/or control her.

I have a scene in my head where Harry convinces Dark Phoenix to separate from Hellfire and they run off together. At some point Jean's consciousness wakes up next to Harry and she's clueless and pissed and he starts to really understand how fucked up her mind is.

** Ravenclaw Harry, slightly paranoid Harry who doesn't trust the HW staff after the events of Yr 1.

Harry realizes that he is actually fairly well off, and chooses to use his money on himself. He doesn't do the SpoiledRichKid thing, but after the events of his first year in Hogwarts he decides to spend one year each at other schools. Spends year 2 at Ilvermorny, year 3 at .. say Mahoutokoro, year 4 at Beauxbatons and still gets dragged into the TWT. Krum is killed instead of Cedric at the end. Year 6 at Durmstrang would be difficult but engrossing, especially with people who remember what happened. It would be interesting having modified canon taking place via letters with R&H, and the butterfly effect would get pretty large.

Just havent had time to sketch it out, but it could make an interesting story. Might have waaay too many OC though.

** I had this bit I wanted to write with a magical breakway country stealing a modern fighter jet to figure out how it works and how to replicate it (specifically, a Croatian MiG-21 UM). Two witches, a rider ("pilot" in big quotes) and an overpowered duelist would operate it. They would disillusion the jet and fly it west over the Bay of Biscay, before turning north and heading towards the Celtic Sea, where a ship was waiting to catch it.

Just after passing over France, the disillusionment would fail. They'd make it halfway to where they were headed before a couple of RAF Typhoons would pick them up. With no weapons, this would force the duelist onto the tail of the jet to defend it from attacks. This meant knocking down incoming air-to-air missiles, and eventually disabling the RAF fighters when they closed to fire guns.

The whole bit was going to be one-half military porn, one-half magic action hero. There would have been exchanges of double-checking the startup procedure, and the RAF guys reporting that there was somebody literally standing on the plane at nearly mach 2.

It fell through for a few reasons. For one, it was really putting the cart before the horse. It'd be pretty far into a story that I wasn't prepared to write. For two, there really wasn't a good reason to steal a fighter jet anyways. The point of getting a jet was to examine its shape, not its internals. You don't need a 1:1 physical model for that anymore.

I still want to write a duel between a wizard and a fighter jet though. It just won't be this one in particular.

** Even though HP fanfiction is usually what I like to read the most, my favourite fanfiction is actually a Bleach fanfiction called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5815880/1/][Unexpected Baggage]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2051889/Raicheru][Raicheru]].

(If you don't mind male x male relationships, I highly recommend it. Even if you are unfamiliar with Bleach -- the story is so completely AU you don't really need anything from the original works to understand it.)

After I read it, I thought something in the same style would work wonders in the HP universe. Looked hard for it (and found great fics!) but didn't find exactly what I wanted.

So now I've been trying to write something myself. Not a rip-off, but something loosely based in. I even outlined the whole plot twice (and I'm still very unhappy with some parts) and wrote the first few chapters, but I'm a horrible writer because I'm one of those people that are never satisfied with the finished product and keep redoing what it's already done instead of working on, and because I don't think my English level is good enough to write an amazing story (not my first language).

Maybe one day, when I have more time in my hands, I'll try again. :)

**** I've been toying with the idea for quite some time, and that's sort of the direction I usually take.

In the story, the character (an OC) is obsessed with Quidditch; her father is an old pro who lives vicariously through her and her mother is dead. At school, she's a mediocre student at best and her best friend is usually Hermione-esque, a top student who puts grades above everything. For extra drama, the fic is usually set in the 5th year, with the character not even making an effort for her O.W.L.s, before her accident (usually mid-term) forces her to reconsider her options.

There's also a romantic component but I always worry that it'll end up dominating the Quidditch element.

It could be a fun mid-length story in my eyes (like 40k words maybe?) but it's so much effort, and Quidditch fics barely get any traction, that it's hardly worth it.

** So a few years ago I realised that in my mind I had cast Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys as Regulus Black.

This of course led to the idea of writing a (rather lengthy) story where each chapter was based on an Arctic Monkeys song, written in the same order that the songs were released. Reg wouldn't be a musician, it would just be like the songs are background tracks.

The story that seemed to suit the songs best saw Reg at the stage where he's becoming a little wary of old Voldy's plan. He's feeling overwhelmed being surrounded by the constant issues of the magical world during the war, and so to escape from it he takes to drinking at a muggle bar so that he won't run into fellow death eaters.

At first he keeps very much to himself, just drinks and leaves, but then one of the bartenders (who, let's be honest, is going to end up being the leading love interest) takes an interest in this mysterious young guy and tries to find out his story.

Reg begins to really question just what is so terrible about muggles after a couple of weeks, and can't seem to stop going back to the bar. One night after he's probably been out with the death eaters and they've done some maiming and torturing he shows up already pretty plastered and can't get past the bouncer. He desperately wants to see the girl bartender and almost comes to blows with security but she shows up to see what the commotion is about and ends up taking an almost unconsciously drunk Reg up to where she lives above the bar to sober up.

I'm getting blurry on details. I know that he catches up with Andromeda at some point and Ted Tonks is in an (awful) band. Also Lucious Malfoy gets curious about where Reg goes when he's often not at Grinmauld place at night and tails him to the bar. One night when he's there and Reg isn't the girl notices his dark mark and comments about how she's seen that tattoo before. Lucious brings it up to Regulus and starts blackmailing him or something. That's about where my brain got to before I realised that I really really really need to finish writing my half-published Lupin story before I commit to a fic of this volume.

** Hermione is the reincarnation of Esdeath from Akame ga Kill. She finds out about the magical world, finds out about Voldemort, and spends most of her time trying to find him and fight him. She displaces the meek Harry and rushes into the final room of the third floor corridor and beats the tar out of Quirrel. Voldemort flees. She owls him the stone afterwards.

Voldemort's Horcrux provides a nice fight in the form of the Basilisk, and fighting with eyes shut was an interesting handicap for once. She lets the Horcrux fully drain Ginny to become solid, then beats the tar out of Diarymort as well, killing that soul fragment, but because it had time to fully manifest, its memories get sent to the real Voldemort.

Voldemort turns up third year, gets defeated again. Fourth year happens with the Tournament, Harry is entered but Hermione entered herself for Hogwarts and got chosen anyway. She lets Voldemort get reincarnated with Harry's blood into a more powerful body, then beats the tar out of him, killing him again. Voldemort starts to fear her more than he fears Dumbledore as she /never stops/.

And so on and so on. Dumbledore gets really confused at why Harry is having such an insignificant role when the prophecy says he was the chosen one. Hermione starts tracking down and killing Voldemort again, who has resorted to ever more esoteric branches of magic to try and find a way to kill her.

Soon enough, the lack of proper competition and a nice, frozen eternity with Tatsumi start taking their toll on Hermione. She goes out and starts picking fights with any powerful wizard/witch in the world, severely threatening the statute of secrecy. Dumbledore re-examines the prophecy and realises now /why/ it was written in such gender-neutral terms (in this fic). Hermione is the Dark Lord, and Voldemort is the choson one prophesied to defeat her. She put a tiny fragment of ice in his wand to track him, marking him as her equal, and his current form was born of a soul that defied her (but lost) three times. Que shenanigans, as that's the limit of how far I've planned this out.
