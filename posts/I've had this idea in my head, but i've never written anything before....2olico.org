so I've never written anything creative in my life, and i've had this idea hounding me. I'd like to give a quick rundown, and post the prologue I wrote just to see if this is something i can do, and get some opinions.

Prologue

Vernon Dursley had always hated Halloween. It was just a silly holiday that celebrated the freakish. If only he could be left out of it, but no. he knew that that evening his peace and quiet would be ruined by little brats running door to door disturbing him, begging for candy like vagrants. Even after their baby girl, Raya, was born, Vernon never really got into the Halloween spirit. Sure, Raya was incredibly cute last year in her purple dragon outfit, but he still would have preferred a quiet night with his daughter and wife, petunia.

This Halloween would be just another year of annoyance. Oh well. At least it was half over, Vernon thought to himself as he drove home, pulling quickly into the driveway of his home at number four, Privet Drive.

“I can make it through this Trick or Treating nonsense and then have a nice, large brandy.” Vernon said, and with a sigh of anticipation, exited his car and went inside to see his family. As he saw his wife, a genuine smile lit up his face. Vernon didn't like many people, or things for that matter, but he did love his wife. Which was good, as she was one of the few who could tolerate him in turn.

“Vernon, honey!” petunia exclaimed as she greeted her husband with a kiss, “Come see Raya! She looks even cuter than usual!”

“What is our little angel this year?” Vernon asked as his wife pulled him up the stairs to the nursery.

“why, an angel of course!” petunia exclaimed as she entered the nursery, and picked up Raya.

His first reaction on seeing his daughter was involuntary. A soft awwwww had left his mouth as soon as petunia turned around. Raya was absolutely adorable. Her round, rosy cheeks were a stark contrast to her pale skin, and her gorgeous hazel eyes looked extremely gold today. She was dressed in a flowing white gown with feathery white wings, and she had a thin gold band acting as a halo around her angelic white-blonde hair. Well, not “her” hair, it must be a wig, Vernon thought. This hair is much longer then Raya's dark black curls.

As Vernon was inspecting Raya's costume, petunia exclaimed “oh Vernon! Where did you find this wig! Its perfect! And how did you sneak in here and put it on her?”

“What do you mean dear? I haven't been home yet, and I certainly didn't buy that wig.” Vernon said, distractedly, while he kissed raya's head softly. “I'll check it for a tag, maybe her aunt Marge sent it for her.”

Vernon slowly started the lift up the wig, and quickly found that it wasn't a wig at all! But it had to be. Hair didn't grow that fast. As he tried to pull the wig off, Raya screamed and started crying, the pain seeming to upset her. Both parents started cooing lovingly to her, but she wouldn't calm down!

As she was screaming, it happened. Raya's face was completely red, and suddenly, starting at the roots, her hair changed to match. The blonde giving way to bright, fiery red. Vernon was stunned, shocked into a stilled silence. Petunia was stunned as well, but the colour sent a spark of recognition in her mind, to the part of her family she had tried to forget. Her sister, Lily. That was Lily's hair.

Raya also noticed her hair, and stopped her tantrum immediately, giggling at the new colour. She slowly closed her eyes and screwed up her little face in concentration, and her hair changed to a deep lavender. Raya giggled like mad and looked to her parents for them to gush at her for her new trick, but petunia and Vernon was still standing there, staring at their daughter with shock evident in their faces.

Petunia snapped back first, having seen this type of accidental magic before. Her daughter was a witch. Like Lily, the sister she shunned because she was different, evil -- a freak. But this was Raya. Raya couldn't be evil. Raya couldn't be a freak. Her daughter was special, extraordinary - Perfect. It only took an instant for petunias entire world to shift, for her to rethink everything. Her hate for magic melted away with the warmth of a mother's love.

After her swift revelation, petunia quickly went back to cooing at Raya, lifting her in the air and playing with her, while Vernon continued to stare. The cogs of his mind slowly resumed work, and he thought about what he just witnessed. His daughter. His Raya... She was a freak. She would grow up to be just as much as a stain on society as petunia's silly sister and her deadbeat husband. In a sick perversion of the mental shift his wife had just had, Vernon's thoughts on the world changed as well. Instead of warmth and love prevailing, the cold ice of hate filled his heart, snuffing out the love he held for his daughter, and wife. Abominations, their entire gene pool were infected with sorcery, tainted with evil.

Vernon said nothing, he just turned and left the nursery. Petunia didn't even noticed, wrapped up in a compulsion from the little demon most likely. It took him less than five minutes to pack his clothes and personal items, and the roll of cash he kept for emergencies, and to write a simple note left on the kitchen table. The note was the last communication Raya and Petunia would ever receive from Vernon, its contents simple, and to the point.

Goodbye.

As Vernon Dursley drove away from number four Privet Drive, across the country another cold, heartless man walked the steps to a small cottage in Godrics hollow.

alright, so thats the prologue, the basic premise of the story is that Dudley was born a girl, Raya. demonstrating magic early, her father left them. harry is introduced to the magical world early, as Raya needs training to control her powers in front of muggles.

the magic system i have in mind is pretty in depth, but it wont be super harry. Powerful? Absolutely. I've always wanted to adopt a little bit of the blood magic aspects from Miranda Flairgold's excellent (if unfinished) akren trilogy.

let me know what you think! Harsh criticism on the writing (mainly) or on the idea is welcomed. I really juist wanna know if my writing is good enough that my story won't get immediately dismissed =P


** I don't think the Dursley's would name a daughter "Raya." That's too nontraditional for them. I think a flower name (following the Lily/Petunia tradition) would fit or an older, more solid name.

"The warmth of a mother's love" isn't strong enough to instantly change Petunia's views on magic. Think of gay people coming out to their parents-it's rarely a smooth process.

How come Petunia's love is strong enough to instantly turn her, but Vernon's isn't? It seemed like he really loved his daughter, but then just pfft it's gone? And why would Vernon leave the house? It's more in line with his character to kick them out (filthy freaks) instead of leaving it to Petunia. I also don't see them living apart-the Dursley's are very concerned with their public image.

Obviously, have a magical child would be very hard on their family, but I think it would be a great source of conflict for you to write about. On one hand, they love their daughter, but on the other hand they've learned to hate and fear magic. Showing how they reconcile the two issues is more interesting than insta-love Petunia and disappearing act Vernon.

How come the daughter changes her hair to blonde? She's what, one or two years old? She can't know what the stereotypical angel hair color is. And why would she change it multiple times? I get that she's a magic prodigy, but I think there are better ways to show it. Dancing toys, disappearing baby gates, toys inexplicably finding themselves into the crib, are better possibilities.

You could write about the Dursley's catching inconsistencies, but always explaining it away. They start to catch on, but are too afraid to voice it with their spouse, until something happens that is blatant and they can no longer sweep it under the rug.

I think you have some interesting ideas, but it could use some tweaking to be less "fanfictiony."

  or an older, more solid name.
#+end_quote

Names daughter "Gertrude". Has deep golden eyes, angelic features, and supermagic.

The rest of the story has people constantly speaking her name in breathy gasps and boys falling over themselves to be with Gertrude.

Screw popular fan names like "Rose" or "Lizzy" or "Lovely Buds the Fourth, Duchess of Hamster".

I ship Gertrude/Cedric at the Triwizard Ball.

"Your name?"

"Yes, remember Harry? Gertrude Ivy A'Marie Dursley."

His cousin waved her wand like a pen and the words appeared as burning lines as she spoke, floating in midair. She then started mixing them together with flicks of her hand. It took rather a long time.

Harry gasped at the eventual result.

******* Or perhaps Verna Mia Dursley becomes Voldemort's right-hand man and protege, code name Slayer. As in "I am Slayer under V." Slayer is a name feared by all.

She enters a torrid affair at the age of 16 with not only Luscious, but sexy Severus as well. Meanwhile, Fleur and Cedric are fighting over her and for her to bring her back to the Light Side. Little do they know, she is Dumbledore's right-hand as well and is deep undercover.

But wait, she is actually on her own side (neutral chaos) and plans to eliminate both Dumble and Moldy and rule with an iron fist! After she wins The Battle, everyone lives happily ever after.

*** I agree with the name being a little out there, and I will change it. Her character is going to be pretty mischievous(who wouldn't prank TONS with magic?) so it needs to fit with that as well. Maybe Heather?

Good point about Petunia not loving her instantly. It would probably be more that Vernon didn't want Petunia anymore because she was a "carrier-freak", and then Petunia being stuck with their daughter.

I also agree with her turning her hair blonde was a bit of a stretch, it should probably just cycle colors or something when she gets upset.

Thanks again for your ideas, I'll definitely be looking at them all deeper.

** This sounds like a really interesting idea to me, but Dudley being a girl, AND magical, AND seemingly a metamorphmagus (presumably a Black trait, unless you want to make Lily's parents squibs instead of muggles, I don't see how she'd get it) might make her seem a bit.... sue-ish. The name is also, as the previous comment pointed out, a little non-traditional for people as 'ordinary' as the Dursleys.

I'm sure you'll still get readership and good reviews (I still get favourites on the fic I wrote in middle school, soo......) but some editing may make it more appealing to those more.... discerning... readers that seem to populate Reddit and other discussion websites.

As for the comment about Petunia's shift being too sudden, a mother's love is a very powerful thing, reinforced not only by social stereotypes or affection based on closeness, but real hormonal things happening in the mother's mind and making her willing to give up everything for her baby. Fathers..... not as much, usually. Petunia has had previous exposure to the magical world. I can't remember exactly now if it's canon or fanon, but Petunia seemed to really love her sister, it was only after Dumbles rejected her from Hogwarts and her parents ignored her in favour of the 'special' one that her bitterness began to fester..... Vernon's hatred of magic, on the other hand, is all on his own, and JK doesn't seem to give us any insight into it besides that he is a self-centred, self-indulgent, vile man that comes from a self-centred, self-indulgent, vile family, if Marge is any indication. Lacking an excess of oxytocin, previous exposure to magic, and previous love (even buried under years of resentment) of magical people, it doesn't surprise me personally that he would reject his daughter for her magic.

Even when people 'come out' to their parents, one may react by giving unconditional love, and the other through rejection. It depends on the rigidity of their mind in relation to the love they hold for that person. Sometimes love is strong enough to overcome morals and values. Sometimes it isn't. I think a mother's love has a greater chance of being stronger.

The implications of Harry growing up with a loving guardian and sibling, and early access to magic, may have been done before, but will always be interesting.

I'd say go for it.

Also, I think in the book both Dursleys are blonde, though I'm not sure about Vernon. Not sure about a dark-haired baby.

*** I agree that Petunia would be more receptive to a magical child than Vernon, but she wouldn't be able to instantaneously overcome it. I mean, look at how she and Harry got along. She hates, fears, and envies it. You can't just drop that at the tip of a hat. She'd find herself jealous of her child and that would take some working through! She'd be simultaneously proud and envious. Then the fear would hit-she fears magic in general and also knows a bit about the war. Soon she would find out about Harry's involvement in Voldemort's death. And isn't that an interesting dynamic because now her child would be in danger due to proximity to Harry!

Boy, this just gets more interesting as I think about it! Also, good catch on the blonde hair.

** Watch capitalization and consider more to-the-point paragraphs.

Paragraphs shouldn't be formatted just for length, after a certain number of sentences that is, but to help organize ideas. Try to put the strong, impactful statements you don't want the reader to miss at the start of end of paragraphs, if at all possible.
