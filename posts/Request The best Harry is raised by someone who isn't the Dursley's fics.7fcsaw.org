Rather it be Severus, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Minerva or whoever.

Any rating, any Genre, Any pairing. Would rather have very little to no character bashing.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** linkffn(The Son of Prongs and the Snitch and Stone) Sirius takes Harry from the doorstep, and raises him with Remus.

If you want a crossover, my own fic linkffn(A World Unseen: Vol I) First installment is complete, second is a work-in-progress.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I liked the linkao3(Stealing Harry) universe. Harry starts out with the Dursleys but is ends up with Sirius and Remus. Technically the series is incomplete but there are 11 complete stories starting when Harry is 8- 3rd year plus 15k words on where the author had been planning on taking the rest of the story.
