Something like Linkffn(Seeing Death Eaters). Any short fic about an original concept that's not that well known.


** Here are some short fics that imo are pretty original, though heads up for some reason original seems to mean dark to me, so some of these are legitimately quite dark. Hopefully these are new and interesting to you! :)

*Pot, Kettle, Black* by TheDivineComedian has a really unique take on the Polyjuice Potion and why it's in the restricted section. linkao3(13095258)

*Not by Force* by TheDivineComedian an interesting take on the Fidelius Charm, and an upsetting AU where Sirius was the Secret Keeper. linkao3(13335930)

*How to be happy* by TheDivineComedian is an AU where Harry couldn't produce a Patronus at the end of POA. linkao3(11172114)

*tell me whether he is dead* by LullabyKnell is a light fic, with a unique take on the Master of Death trope. linkao3(9191315)

*Reclamation* by copperbadge is an AU where Professor Gaunt has been the DADA professor for decades.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  Sirius is captured by Voldemort, and his Occlumency falls like France in the war. Lily and James are trapped inside the Fidelius. Someone needs to warn them, but Remus is busy running from the law... oh well. He takes the time.Maybe Peter should have been Secret Keeper, after all.

  The Patronus charm requires a happy memory. Harry Potter doesn't have many, and the Dementors get Sirius, after all.But the story is far from over.

** linkao3(15171164) where Voldemort travels around the world learning magic, murdering and creating horcruxes. Unfortunately, it seems to be abandoned after the first two chapters.

  "He disappeared after leaving the school... traveled far and wide... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable." --- Albus Dumbledore Tom Riddle's four most pivotal encounters in the years between his departure from England and his return a decade later as Lord Voldemort: a vampire hunter in Albania, a voodoo queen in New Orleans, a snake charmer in India, a Seer in Greece---and somewhere on the way, a transformation.
