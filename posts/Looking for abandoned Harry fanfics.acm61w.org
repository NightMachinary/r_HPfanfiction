There's this one that I remember where Harry is called Little Harry by a few store owners in Diagon as he worked odd jobs after being abandoned by his parents for his brother (who is considered the BWL).

Also, I think this story also includes Harry being his art runes, and also includes a scene where both Harry and his brother are at Gringotts for their inheritance tests and Harry is named heir to house Lucifer (I think), because he kills lucifer when he is in his satyr form. And also Harry inherits this claw like thing from him, which he uses to make the runes that he carves on himself permanent.

Any clue which one (or many, in case I have mixed up a few) I am taking about?

  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?
