Looking for a certain kind of time travel fic where it's not Harry or Hermione that goes back (or forward) in time. Would rather not have Severus go back (or forward) in time either since I read a couple of them. Anyone else is okay.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** linkffn(Ananke by Eunike) has Lily going forward in time.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

**** This one is really good. Just a heads up, it isn't completed yet. It's on hold until Shayalonnie finishes posting the edited and revised Debt of Time which is a must read if you haven't yet.

It's a Hermione time travel fic that starts at the end of HBP continues until Voldy is dead, she goes back to Marauders time and eventually returns to the present.

** I really liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices]] by Aebbe. It is a next-gen time travel fic where Lily Luna goes back to Maurader time and meets her grandparents and Sirius. Then Sirius time travels forward. I don't want to give too much away but it is really well done - especially the time travel aspect. linkffn(5846417)

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/753415][Paradox series]] has a cool premise where adult Draco travels back in time into his 16 year old body and changes sides and eventually joins the trio for the Horcrux hunt. It eventually ends up Draco/Harry. linkao3(753415; 979182)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182][Cartographers Craft]] is a great DH - AU where 16 yr old sirius comes back somehow out of the marauders map. There is a lot to like about this fic - really great writing, interesting characters who are well-developed, a slow building and believable love story etc. It is my first (and maybe my only) sirius/harry fic and because there wasn't an age-gap between them, I really liked it. Also the search for the horcruxes was believable and interesting.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.
