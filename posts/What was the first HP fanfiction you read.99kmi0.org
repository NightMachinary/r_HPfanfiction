** I can't remember exactly. I do know that I was looking for a specific premise: a canon compliant Sirius Black romance. I found something which, if I remember right was about a Muggle (OFC) teacher at Hogwarts who had a love affair either with Snape or Sirius---or both---or couldn't make up her mind. Anyway it was immensely long and I don't recall any actual plot so I gave up pretty quickly. I think it had a lot of reviews though. I also found one about an OC who was some sort of elemental American witch (I know, I wouldn't even touch that these days) who had a romance with Sirius. But something made me check out the last chapter (I think I wanted to see how the writer handled a sad ending) and discovered that Sirius magically didn't die at all and he and the OC got married. I stopped reading that one too. I think that was when I realised that I was going to have to write the story I wanted myself.

** I honestly don't recall, it was back in 2003/4 (eek!) on mugglenet fanfiction. Back when I was 14 and was also trying my hand at fanfiction writing. Me and a friend had a whole AU which squeezed the first 4 books into 3 years and started writing from 4th year (ignoring OOTP because it came out part way through writing our stuff). Looking back at it, the idea was OK, but the writing was terrible!

** I think the first HP fic I ever read was Underwater Light by Maya (in retrospect, it's kind of amazing I keep reading HP fic given how how much I dislike Drarry). I found it through [[http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2081784,00.html][that article in TIME]] about HP fanfic, which included 4 "must-read" fics. (The [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Lived_Forever][other fics]] it listed were [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/898884/1/Crossroads][Crossroads]] by Emmyjean, [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever, and Call of the Wild by WolfieTwins.)

** The New Trio: The Helion Wands by QuickQuotesQuill77.

Albus, Rose, and Scorpius are sorted into Gryffindor, and one day when Peeves is harassing them, they all point their wands at him and when the tips touch, a tremendously powerful fireball, more like weaponized sunlight, emerges.

An enormous hole in burned into the wall and it's revealed that the three children have been chosen by the Helion wands--a project that Ollivander and Gorgovitch had worked on together some decades previously.

The children are destined for magic that far exceeds their youth.

There was a pack of vampires that tried to invade Hogwarts, and their Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was a vampire who fought against his own clan.

Their Transfiguration professor was an old buddy of Teddy's.

Albus had a crush on a girl called Artemis Burke, and made a goof of himself. Scorpius and Rose had minor feelings for each other--Scorpius actually almost got squished by a Boggart-troll (or maybe a golem) that was going to squish Rose. This injury wins Ron's approval. Scorpius's Boggart was Bellatrix Lestrange.

I don't remember much more than that.

** Twas /HPMOR/. I kept hearing about it on TVtropes, then finally gave in and read it over in a couple of days. This dipped me back into the /Harry Potter/ fandom which I had never /strongly/ been a part of, and I craved more. Someone recommended White Squirrel's works and /Seventh Horcrux/, and from there I entered the wider HP fanfiction world.

** I think it was called Aftermath. It was a canon-complaint post battle of Hogwarts fic that was a hot mess. Ron and Hermione got engaged about a week after the battle, among other ridiculous plot points.

Luckily the next one I read, Australia by MsBinns was much higher quality. At least high enough that I didn't give up on fanfiction.

** A french one that I think isn't even on the fanfiction sites. I don't even know if I could still find it online but I took it on Word when it was still being released. It was a 7th book fic before the official one was released. The second fic I read was also found and kept in a similar manner and also a 7th book before official release. The first english one I'm not sure but clearly a post DH cannon one.

** I'm really not sure what my very first was, but the earliest fic I have favorited and that I do remember reading very early once I got into HP-fic is The Misadventures of Draco Malfoy, Ferret by Saber Shadowkitten. A cute, weird, and funny Drarry that's well written, still enjoy it and go back and re-read it every now and then. I can easily tell this fic would nooot be some people's cup of tea so I don't usually bring it up though lol.
