Ever have those moments where you look at all the fluff you've written up for countless characters, events, places and story lines (unused or otherwise) and just think of what else could've been achieved in that time?

I just did when I looked at all the character profiles I had made for each and every one of the students in Harry's year, made up of a rough copy of the “Original 40” along with some extras... bloody hell


** It's perfectly fine to spend all of your time doing something you enjoy, as long as it's not getting in the way of anything more important

** What else could you have achieved in that time? You could have guilted yourself into doing something 'more productive' like reading a book you don't enjoy or learning a recipe for a food you'll never eat or any such thing. At the end of the day if you enjoyed yourself while writing all that and it didn't get in the way of anything really important then it doesn't matter what else you could have been doing. Put your happiness first.

Not everything we do in life has to be maximising productivity.

** It occurs to me that I should've inflected more humour, this definitely wasn't a legit cry for help, though I do appreciate the life advice you bunch of wise ol' souls

I'm very much okay with the time I spend with HP, now just trying to figure out how I can use it all story wise heh

** So I should stop trying to invent a complete family tree for every witch and wizard in existence, back to the initial discovery of magic?

*** For my own work I'd say 5 generations back from present + notable people + founder. Anything else is most likely useless or can be figured out when it becomes usable.

** Did you enjoy it?

If yes, you should consider that an accomplishment. If not, you just did work for no reason.

Neither calls for an intervention. Just that you take a moment to 'step back' and evaluate what the pros and cons of your actions have been.

** Did it take time away you would otherwise have spent doing something 'worthwhile', or did it take time away you would otherwise have spent watching television?

Has all this fluff helped you grow as a writer?

Would you look down on any of us for doing the same thing?

** Well, all you need to do is use all that fluff in stories. That way, you can count the time spent on doing that as time spent on a story.
