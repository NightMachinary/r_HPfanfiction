A story were Harry uses accidental magic to create Real Senzu Beans from Dragon ball z in the Durselys Garden as a child.

Bonus points if he also uses accidental magic to Change himself into a Part Sayian. Because he thinks that the Durselys call him a freak because they had to cut off his tail when they got him so he use accidental magic to try to regrow it.

double bonus points if he has the love of battle like a pure Sayain so he enjoys fighting like Goku and Vegeta
