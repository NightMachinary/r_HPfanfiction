For example, sending a letter to 'snuffles' in a fidilius charmed house.

What I would do is tell the owl to find me a winning million dollar lottery ticket and put a tracking charm on the owl.


** It probably didn't yet have a fidilius, and owls in Harry Potter seem semi- sentient, I think it's possible that owls would have to be told the secret- as hilarious as that would be it should have been included in the books/fanfiction but I haven't seen it yet.

As to nicknames- I think it matters that the owl knows who they're talking about, but... there are no limits seen or tested really, though they are in fanfiction- more than a few people follow owls to some warded location, and wizards never thought of it before the main character- usually Harry- gets creative.

What I'd like to see is someone trying to mail letters for profit and shit- like "Take this letter to a rich dying widow." or "Take this letter to a lonely supermodel or veela" and following behind on their broom.

*** Yeah, basically I think you're right on the money. Post Owls speak their own language but they're as sentient as House-Elves or Portraits, and so if /they/ know who the target is or how to locate them they'll go. Presumably most Post Owls would refuse to go along with "Take this letter to a rich dying widow"-type loophole abuse because they would see it as compromising their honor ("I'm a delivery-owl, young man, not a money-detector! Hoot! Hoot! Hiss!"), but they /could/ do it.

** My headcanon is that owls can find people rather than things. So I'm sorry, but lottery ticket hunts won't appear in my AU :') I like the idea of familiars, though, so perhaps if the owner know the secret of a place, their familiar does too?

** Harry Potter owlies are super cute and super cool because they do have magic power to find people like anywhere. :) Yes that is their magic ability. But they can be blocked from finding someone with like magic barriers and stuff.

I don't believe that's canon.

**** It's pretty darned implied by the fact that Harry has been a celebrity since before he figured out that whole "don't shit yourself" problem, and yet /never/ got any fan mail.
