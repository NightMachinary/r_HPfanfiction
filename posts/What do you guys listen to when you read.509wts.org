For me, it's mostly [[https://open.spotify.com/user/caydenf19/playlist/1ZwXPi2Hs3xPYyIPuIBjpg][this playlist.]]

Mostly a mix of slower songs, usually about romance so it goes with my fics. And a lot of unrequited love. But some stuff is there on for specific reasons:

Nothing (The Script): The song's basically a fanfic by itself. Harry (or Ron) goes to a pub, gets sloshed, then proceeds to run all over town, searching for the girl that got away. Check out [[http://genius.com/3142158][the lyrics.]]

Break Up with Him (Old Dominion): Harry (hopefully) calling Hermione. At least in my headcanon.

Harry and Hermione (Nicholas Hooper): No explanation needed, hopefully. Plus, it's a good song.

So what do you listen to when you read and why?


** Nothing. I read in silence. I feel like music would only distract me from the story

**** Check out "SpeakIt!" for Google Chrome (not sure if it's available for Firefox or IE).

You can choose the language, accent, gender, speed, pitch, rate, volume, etc.

It's not flawless, but it is free.

** I prefer to read in silence, usually. If there must be music, it is most often some kind of instrumental. Any song with words causes me to loose focus on the words I am meant to be reading.

I listen to music more when writing, but it's still instrumentals. It also depends on the story. When writing my HP/LotR stories, I listen to the Lord of the Rings movie soundtracks, for example.

** Depends entirely on my mood (essentially: Whatever strikes my fancy - I do dislike only very few genres of music!)...sometimes I have nothing on (seldom, I kind of hate silence...makes my brain go even more crazy than it is normally - the ADHD makes it jumpy enough as it is! If there's silence my thoughts are all over the place!), but otherwise?

From Oldies to contemporary music and even classical music (Beethoven, Mozart, Bizet etc.)...hell, sometimes I've got an opera on in the background :)

Nothing too extreme of course (no metal or techno etc.)...sometimes it's just the radio (but I prefer recordings, the hosts voice on the radio is quite distracting sometimes...lack of filter (my ADHD again) makes me "home in" on the voice to listen to it :( (same for noises in silence, that's why I sucked at tests in school - little noises the other people in room made where more distracting than any music could have ever been!)
