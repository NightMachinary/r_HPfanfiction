Hey so I am looking for fics where Harry enjoys the situations he is put in, like he doesn't spend half the story whining about how he doesn't ask to get in trouble, but takes it all in stride and talks cheekily about it. A story where Harry feels pride for his achievements instead of trying to hide behind them. For example, a good story that has this is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Grimoire). Please no bashing and no Slash fics.

  AU 4th Year on. After Sirius sends Harry a book for his birthday, his world changes. When the TriWizard Tournament is opened at Hogwarts, he must make the choice of if he would continue as he was, or honor his roots. Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families? Or will he buckle under the strain? Now in Year 5 Cover Courtesy of Tempest09
