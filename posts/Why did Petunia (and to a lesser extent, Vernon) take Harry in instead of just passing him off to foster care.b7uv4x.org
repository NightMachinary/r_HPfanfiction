** Harry symbolises a lot of things to Petunia. We're shown how bitter she is over not being magical herself, and her feelings of inadequacy in regards her perfect sister.

Petunia, instead of coming to terms with her own flaws, comes to view magic itself as what really pushed Lily out of her life. So she internalises a hatred for the magical world, convincing herself that she's too noble, too clever, too good for them. She doesn't really believe this, but she wants to all the same.

Then Harry shows up on her doorstep because Lily went and got herself killed in some freakish wizarding war. Petunia must have felt so vindicated. Because she was right, the freaks killed her!

Here is proof that the magical world is just as flawed as her own world. Here is proof that Lily should never have gone with that Snape boy on that damn train, should have stayed with Petunia, with her sister.

Perfect Lily finally failed at something and now Petunia has to step in a raise the child. The child who looks so much like that arse, James Potter, with his good looks and old money.

Maybe she even intended to treat Harry humanely in the first months he stayed with them, prove that she was the bigger person, the better person.

But Harry is the embodiment of everything she hates about herself... and she has power over him.

*** "Dumbledore's last" is not a threat against the Dursleys to expose them as abnormal. It was Dumbledore's explanation to Petunia that if she didn't take Harry in, he would almost certainly die:

#+begin_quote
  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, while you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.”

  “Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.”

  He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.

  “You sent that Howler. You told her to remember - it was your voice --”

  “I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.”

  “It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well - my uncle more than her. He wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she - she said I had to stay.”
#+end_quote

Petunia took Harry in not because Dumbledore threatened her, but because he appealed to the small shred of compassion she still possessed. She may have resented taking Harry in, but she was willing to do so in order to keep him alive.

*** Definitely not. Dumbledore left a letter that said someone killed Lily and her husband and tried to kill her child. That he's still in danger, but in living with you(Petunia) he will be safe. She kept him, it was this act that make Lily's sacrifice persist. Petunia despite her many many faults kept a child she didn't want in order to protect him. This is what Dumbledore's howler was appealing too.

Also if we look past the child fantasy tropes of PS, we can even sympathize with the Dursley's quite a bit. Harry is a hellraiser with magic. He talks back, he causes trouble, and he uses magic that Petunia has to try to explain away.

#+begin_quote
  “We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we'd stamp it out of him!
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Haven't I told you he's not going?” he hissed. “He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it.
#+end_quote

Again if we look past the evil step parents trope the Dursley's are looking out for Harry.

**** They "may" (still not reallyconvinced of it) have had good intentions, but their executions was nothing short of attrocious and had pretty much the inversed effect.

Most of Harry accidental magics were at least partly due to the Dursley, Harry's hairs regrowing, him apparating on a roof to flee from Dudley, even turning his teacher hair blue could be potentially explained by the teacher attitude toward Harry due to his reputation.

​

Il would have loved a little conversation between Harry and the Dursley after he finished his education : "So, despite your best efforts, you can't stamp the magic out of a wizard, if anything you made my accident worse. And be glad you didn't try harder because when you convince a child to refuse magic, to hate it, it eat the child from inside and he become an obsucus, a berserk creature that kill everything in its path, with the child enemies first on the list".

But well, Rowling probably invented the Obscurus after Harry Potter ended.

***** You're running into the problem of looking at the Dursley's through the lens of Deathly Hallows. Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets are very much a different tone from PoA-OotP, which is different from HBP and DH.

The series grew up with Harry, it went from a children's fantasy story, complete with faerie tale story elements, into a darkish young adult novel. If you don't recognize this, if you don't account for it, many things don't make sense. It's the source of nearly every horrible bit of fanon, at least the one that actually derive from canon instead of being made up entirely.

You also hit right on another important point. The books were written one at a time, so somethings didn't exist until later. If you ignore this you get hard to answer questions. Such as "How did Harry never hear of Death Eaters before GoF?' The answer is simply that the name didn't exist yet, and someone had to ask the question, and it couldn't be Ron since he'd know, and it can't be Hermione since she's the know it all. If you look at this straight on Harry seems like an idiot, which we know he's not.

** Because she wanted Harry to live. Dumbledore stated in no uncertain terms that if Harry is to live, Petunia has to take him in. And Vernon agreed because Petunia said so.

** I think the letter she got with Harry implied that Wizards will be checking in on Harry, and she may have felt threatened by that implication. Imagine if she did send Harry off to foster care and the Wizards turned up? How does Petunia know they wouldn't kill and/or torture her and her family? That could be another reason why Petunia and Vernon hate Harry so much. They felt like they had been bullied into taking him.

** Dumbledore probably explained to them, that Death Eaters were looking for Harry. The first place they are going to check is with relatives and they will torture and kill them for information, that they can't give. It's in their best interest to accept Harry and the protection, that comes with having him there.

** it's interesting that Petunia took Harry to keep him alive, but it was the dementor attack that made her realize even her own son was in danger from those freaks. I know the Dursleys are horrible, but they kept him after Dudley got that pig's tail, Arthur destroyed their living room and Harry turned Marge into a baloon. Come to think of it, they should have realized that being nasty to magical people caused too much trouble and never ended well.

** Harry was still her sister's son, and despite it all Petunia did love her, perhaps she wanted to keep that one fragment of her still alive. Harry after all infamously had Lily's eyes and I imagine it was much harder to get rid of a baby knowing that.

** The original reason was because the protagonist needed to live with evil step parents for thematic reasons, so that's what happened.

Later the books explain it by stating that Dumbledore said in his original note that Harry would be killed if he didn't live with them. But that is probably an after the fact justification, I doubt much if any thought was given as to why when Harry living with the Dursleys was first being conceived as a plot point.
