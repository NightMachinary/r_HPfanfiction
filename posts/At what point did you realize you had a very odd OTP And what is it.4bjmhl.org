** For my "not limited to Harry Potter" ship, I got into Percy Jackson fanfiction right after the third book had just come out (the Titan's Curse). I really liked the Percy/Thalia ship which admittedly doesn't seem like an odd ship. The thing is at the time the community was kind of critical of ships that weren't Percy/Annabeth, to the point that some people were doing some bad flaming towards authors that were writing the Percy/Thalia stories. That along with Rick Riordan as good as killing off Thalia in the following books stopped the pairing from really going anywhere...

So yeah, not really the oddest paring maybe but pretty rare. Maybe I should try writing a story for it one of these days...

What is it about Sevmione that creeps you out? I'm always interested in understanding how other people view particular pairs.

That said, what is it in the Hermione/Bellatrix dynamic that appeals? I tend to think Bella is the prime example of why you don't stick your (metaphorical) dick in crazy, but that's obviously only my inclination.

I feel plenty bad for him and teared up myself when we found out the truth about him and Lily and all that. That doesn't change the fact that he wasn't a nice guy. He was bitter and took out his anger by tormenting the son of his childhood enemy. He was too caught up in the idea of Lily even though she is been dead for over a decade to even consider being paired with someone in my mind... especially with Hermione.

** Oh, instantly. That was part of the point. "Ordinary" ships almost never hook me in fandom. Canons of all kinds supply that already. Plus my ficcish preferences tend towards beauty in ugliness, marginal characters, outsiders, older characters, history from the loser's or enemy's perspective, that sort of thing.

So almost every ship I enjoy is odd. My first and still favorite, my OTP, is Snape/Harry, and of /course/ I knew it was odd from the moment I encountered it. So is Snape/Dumbledore and Snape/Filch. Snape/Minerva is probably as 'conventional' as it gets.

I also love all kinds of unexpected pairings. HP Beholder (an exchange fest that ran on InsaneJournal for years, although it closed its doors in 2014) was my favorite thing ever, and its whole /raison d'etre/ was unconventional pairings.

**** Well, anybody with modly powers and aspirations could probably start a fest along the same lines but with a different name. I get the impression, though, that ff.net doesn't understand the point of exchange fests (although this is an impression formed by a couple of offhand remarks made on the - what is it, the Teacher's Lounge forum?). It could conceivably do outreach to the LiveJournal community, which was the fest's life's blood and the reservoir it drew from for both readers and writers. Or it could start afresh.

One reason HP Beholder was so beloved was that the quality of the writing tended to be pretty high. It was all one-shots, and popular pairings weren't allowed, although popular characters could form one half of the pairing.

As with all fests, it needs a dedicated and organized mod and a certain amount of publicity. If the former audience caught wind of a new incarnation, I'm pretty sure they'd all want to check it out.

****** I think this was a few years ago. I recently skimmed the comments in one of the forum topics to see what the TL was like, and one main participant - possibly a moderator - dissed those silly LJ fests a couple of times. There may have been a perceived tension between LiveJournal members and ff.net back then; I gather there wasn't a lot of overlap amongst the fans. But now LJ is fading because much of its active fanbase has moved to Tumblr.

***** My gateway drug was Chasing The Sun by Loten. (The third act is not quite perfect but still excellent).

All time favourite is without doubt Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars by Scumblackentropy. It isn't complete and I doubt it ever will be but it is a bleak, brutal and beautiful piece even incomplete. I warn you however - this does feature student/teacher sex, the characters themselves are aware it is wrong but there is a certain quality of desperation to their coupling that makes it understandable if not forgivable. It's hard reading but well worth it.

The Art of Brewing by Note-A-Flat is a WIP, it's gentler and ventures into OOC territory a little but there is plenty of story here it isn't simply a ship fic.

The opening chapters of The Unspeakable Files are amongst some of the best I've read in terms of hooking the reader. It's a double header - SS/HG and DM/LL I haven't read it all yet but it's certainly worth a look.

That's a good start I suppose. I will be happy to link you my own as I start publishing as it comes under this heading as well.

***** I really love linkffn(Pride of Time)

Hermione goes back to the Maurader Era and is the same age as Snape, so you don't get the student/teacher dynamic. She doesn't ever return to the future, and it's one of the only fics I've seen that continues telling the story with her in the future.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Probably my favorite OTP from HP is Harry/Luna.

For Naruto, it's Danzo/Tenten. I also like Naruto/Tayuya, and Naruto/Tenten; I hate Naruto/Hinata, because most authors just use the "WOW HINATA LOVED ME ALL THIS TIME I LOVE HER TOO EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY TALKED LIKE TWICE AND WE'RE BOTH STILL TWELVE" excuse. I read Blind, and enjoyed it; their relationship made sense in it.

In AGK, it's Tatsumi/Seryu. Justice is best girl.

** Harry Potter/Tom Riddle through time travel or one just being born in another time period. I like their characterizations to be as close to canon as possible too. I know that comes off a bit odd and twisted to some.

Harry/Pyro (X-Men): I only found one author who writes them, but I love this pairing. - linkff(7748339)

Supernatural: I got hooked on Sam Winchester/Brady (the demon.) He was only in one freaking episode, but it gave him a history with Sam at Stanford that was so full of possibilities.

Star Wars: Han Solo/Anakin Skywalker. I have yet to find a fic with this pairing, but I want it so, so bad.
