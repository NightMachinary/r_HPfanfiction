Actively updated stories are ok, but completed ones are preferred.


** There's a 3 story completed series, I can't recall the first story but it's a Harry that has bloodlines of the founders that he must maintain. The second story is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forever Mage) and it's a Star Trek crossover, and the third is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lord of Light) which is a Star Wars crossover.

Be aware though that these are 5 wife/harem fics, which plays into his immortality. Besides that, well-written, not pornographic, and with a good deal of world building.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** There's also a 4th story in the series that [[/u/mufasaLIVES][u/mufasaLIVES]] mentioned (by Darth Marrs) that just began about 10ish weeks ago. It's a HP/Worm crossover, and it acknowledges the previous harem stuff from the last 3 stories but won't have any harems in it. It's not complete, but it's updated once every week. If it isn't updated, the author always updates his author profile page to explain why and to tell when the next update will be.

#+begin_quote
  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?
