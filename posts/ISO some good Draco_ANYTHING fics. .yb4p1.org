** I myself am a Draco/Hermione fan

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] - NC-17 and quite smutty- In a whirlwind of pleasure and angst, can Draco and Hermoine end up happy and together? Or are they destined forever to keep their relationship physical and above all secret?

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=85][In the Darkness All Cats are Grey]] - NC-17, smut, need to register at this site I think - Hermione has a secret assignation in the Ravenclaw dormitories. So does Draco. Somehow they both end up in the same dark dormitory together with their respective dates nowhere in sight. Rated dub-con because she doesn't realizes the mistake and he does.

all of that author's works are very, very good

** You should definitely check out this Dramione Fanfic author - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/491287/Bex-chan][Bex-Chan]]

She is honestly the best I've read. Quite a similar writing style to J.K. Rowling.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] - He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5853767/1/Hunted][Hunted]] - COMPLETE. Forced to work together when their old schoolmates start dying, Hermione & Draco must overcome their differences to solve the mysterious deaths. The tension in the office is getting rather...heated. Mature themes. 4years PostHogwarts/War.

** I'm a Draco/Ginny person and when I used to read fanfics they were REALLY popular... I never see them anymore.

I'm still mad about how Disney the cannon is.

**** I think that between you and the person ahead of you... I will have lots of reading to do...

And reading leads to writing... which is really what I'm after.

I'm thinking if Cassandra Claire can start out with Draco Dormeins and end up writing the city of books... I'm damn well going to try to be a millionaire.

Same goes with those Fifty Shades books. That just proves you don't have to write well to be a millionaire.

***** Hey, same! I'm writing a book now. Hahaha, fifty shades of gray is so poorly written. I can't even read it. Check out Alex Day's YouTube video What The Fuck Is 50 Shades of Gray if you want a good laugh about it.

I do love Cassandra Clare's concepts in those books, but damn, they could have been written at more than a fifth grade level reading. Sure wish I'd had the idea first.

Good reading! I hope you enjoy everything and find some inspiration to write!

** Here are some goods ones!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7753649/1/Allegiance][Allegiance]] by mugglehugger

When eleven-year-old Ginny Weasley is sorted into Slytherin, she is thrust into a world where the line between good and evil is blurred and where the boy she was supposed to hate becomes the man she was never supposed to love. DG, AU.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622766/1/Envy_and_Manipulations][Envy and Manipulations]] by rabbit

Sixteen year old Ginny Weasley has her first summer job at the Folk Hills Country Club, the most prestigious high society club in the wizarding world. When Draco Malfoy comes home from his summer internship at the Ministry of Magic things get complicated.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5530828/1/A_Phoenix_Does_Not_Fear_Ashes][A Phoenix Does Not Fear the Ashes]] by KatyTyler

GWDM Draco joins the order, Ginny is raped. When he becomes her savior, who would have guessed that the two would become more? Or that together they would form the most badass team the Order has ever seen? A story of love, revenge, protection & sacrifice.

The Beautiful Trilogy by KatyTyler

And yet, he had still told her, every night, after they had untangled their sweaty limbs and each retreated to their corners to gather their clothing, avoiding the other's eyes, that she was nothing, meant nothing, she was merely a beautiful distraction"

That starts with [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5920484/1/A_Beautiful_Distraction][A Beautiful Distraction]] and then moves on to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6152109/1/A_Beautiful_Lie][A Beautiful Lie]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8437138/1/A_Beautiful_Mess][A Beautiful Mess]]. It's a really interesting, incredibly poetic series of one-shots. But I thought I would explain how it's set up because the author made it kind of confusing.

You said you like Ginny/Draco and this is all non-fluffy, excellently written D/G. They're all full of action and suspense. I hope you give them a try! They're some of my favorites.
