Tom Riddle* doesn't go dark but continues on pursuing power (because he is a genius and powerful before he goes dark).

Thanks!

*technically wouldn't be Voldemort then


** Would he still be called Voldemort if he doesn't do dark?

These are the only ones I can think of:

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

I don't think it automatically impossible. After all, we don't know how he got to “I am Lord Voldemort”, and for all we know it's something he did not because he was evil but to entertain himself in some way and for some reason.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][/Rectifier/]] --- a non-dark TMR gets dimensionally misplaced.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][/Reverse/]] --- TMR isn't dark, but instead many canon characters are, and the story in general has lots of abuse content.

Kinda-relevant stories that you may also like:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][/LV & the Intricate Plots/]] --- more ruthless VD than a dark one, and academically curious one at that.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1030535/chapters/2053034][/A Slytherin At War/]] --- Draco's the protagonist. He goes back in time and tries changing his alignment.

p.s. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5pzyqh/request_voldemort_who_doesnt_go_dark/dcvyxi0/][The one that sephirothrr recommended,]] [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838/][/Realignment,/]] is similar to /Altered Destinies/ somewhat. Differences include more questionable decisions made by TMR and better story quality. And TMR's also the protag here, which isn't the case with AD.
