I've already read through Sacrificial Second Chances

I'd rather that he just takes over the body of the alt Harry, but I suppose I'll take ones where the shitty Harry is still there, and there's just an additional Harry, our lovable Harry.


** Hmm...funny thing, a while ago I was planning to make a request where Harry swaps places with a dark!Harry alternate when they time travel, but I never got around to it.

Like, the idea being that a good!Harry, for whatever reason, tries going back in time after the final battle, but a dark!Harry also goes back in time after the final battle, so they end up in opposite universes somehow.

So good!Harry has no idea why Dumbledore is trying to obliviate him and/or flee the country, while dark!Harry is having trouble finding proof that Dumbledore is evil, and yeah.

**** I am so itching to write that, but I want to write finish one story and write two others before, so it's likely to never happen.

One of the stories is where after OOtP Dumbledore becomes indy!Dumbledore, wonders what the magical world has ever done for /him/ and decides not to give a fuck. He still helps Harry a bit, but he had enough of that shit.

** A Stranger in an Unholy Land fits that bill, linkffn(1962685), its fairly well written even if the pacing slows down during the middle. I enjoyed it. It also wraps itself up nicely enough, so you can ignore the abandoned sequel.

** Ok, there is one that kind of fits your request but it will take you awhile to get there. linkffn(darkness within by kurinoone)

I linked you the first part. The premise is that Harry grew up with Voldemort as a father and hated his real parents. There is absolutely no bashing, at all, so don't run away. The story is very emotionally complex.

But back to your request, in the 3rd part of this fic, AU dark!Harry swaps places with canon!Harry. Au!Harry is definitely an asshole, but not exactly evil. No one in this story really is and that is what I like about it, there are only shades of gray. The author can make you relate to any character, because they are not as cartoonish as in most fics. All three parts are complete and the rewrite of the 1st part is currently in progress.

  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.
