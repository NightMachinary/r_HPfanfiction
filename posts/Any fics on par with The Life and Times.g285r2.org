I just finished reading this fic, and unfortunately the author has abandoned it. So now, I have a huge gaping hole in my heart because I was reading 600k words of build up with absolutely no pay off. The author's writing was truly amazing, and I haven't been able to find anything that captivating after.

So any suggestions?


** Please, link.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  It's 1975 and Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the 1st Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.
