I know it's a terrible title, but I couldn't think of a better one that would encompass the entirety of my thought experiment.

We know that magic is just magic, it literally has no barriers (apart from the Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration, which are murky at best), what are the limits of canon HP magic. I stress canon HP magic, because it's the only guideline we have, if we go AU we can, of course, have magic do ANYTHING, but that's not my intention.

Canon HP magic seems quite wondrous and practically omnipotent. Because JKR is terrible at rationalization and her magical world has a lot of holes (crops, livestock etc.), we can either assume that she just bungled, as is true, or we can hypothesize that magicals can use spells to accelerate their corn and get several yields per year (otherwise they wouldn't be able to sustain their population).

After that short introduction to my idea, let's go to the meat of it. What would you consider to be reasonable limits to magic? Can it literally do almost anything? Can it grow crops in an instant? Can it accelerate the growth of animals? Can it create a whole society totally separate from the muggle world? (as you can see that is my main question).

Magic in JKR world is fairly tame, but in an AU world it could probably achieve all that. I just wish that more HP fanfic writers would acknowledge that HP is just a series of young adult fantasy books, and the world doesn't make sense, unless we make it so.


** Well we saw Hagrid enlarge pumpkins and we know food can be enlarged, multiplied, and replenished just not conjured. I don't see wizards having grocery stores. I see them having bakers, butchers, gardens, farms and the like.

#+end_quote

They, by and large, /are/ totally separated from the muggle world. Most wizards don't know nor care to learn how muggles live. Witches and wizards who marry muggles pretty much give up magic.

They only involve themselves in muggle affairs to keep their world hidden. Petunia's letter getting to Dumbledore through the muggle post, Ministers for Magic meeting the Prime Minister, the obliviation squad, etc.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

/Shrugs/ it makes a lot of sense to me and I'm far too critical of the whole thing.

Yes, HP magic can do almost anything and it goes far beyond foolish wand waving and chemistry sets, but there are also more rules and limits than Gamp's 5 Exceptions to Elemental Transfiguration. Such as bringing people back from the dead, inability to create real love, and Felix felicis.

** The main canonical limits to magic are (per Snape in OotP) time and space. That is, while wizards may be godlike, they're extremely local gods.

The main exception to the distance limitation are spells which affect information/ideas directly (e.g. the Fidelius). A secret has no location; when you hide a piece of information with the Fidelius, it appears to affect the entire universe.

The other key limit is death (no resurrecting truly dead people).

Pretty much everything else seems to be on the cards.

Yes, I know laziness is the primary reason for that. But still. Magic without limits, apart from those you spoke of, would create a post-scarcity society. There would be no reason for Weasleys to be poor, because that would be simply not possible (considering how Arthur can enchant a car, we can ascertain he can enchant other objects, so he can easily make money from enchanting if that's even a thing, which, if we take broomsticks in case, is a thing).

**** There's two points to make in response:

1. The true limit is on wizards' capability, not on magic. Just because magic can do something doesn't mean that any given wizard can do it. Magic is /hard/, especially transfiguration. Even students getting good scores in the OWLs like Harry are still transfiguring imperfect objects and taking an extended period of time and multiple tries to do it.

2. Scarcity is relative. The Weasleys as depicted have plenty of food, a large house, lands containing an orchard and a pond. What they lack is the ability to purchase magical goods and services. So a person who was very skilled at transfiguration such that they could make any non-magical good they desired would still not live in a post-scarcity world, because the goods and services they demand are magical ones.

***** I would agree, if we were talking about floo-powder or something strictly magical, like wands. But they also use second or even third hands robes. This makes no sense. Arthur is definitely a powerful wizard, Molly as well, not to mention Bill, Percy or Charlie, and yet none of them could even create a passable robe for Ron?

It makes no sense, no matter how you twist it. With Voldemort being able to create actual arms out of magic, the Weasleys (especially the older ones, who by all accounts were powerful wizards) should be able to modify and/or make a robe.

** Maybe the distance that a portkey can travel to? I can't remember if "International portkeys" are a canon thing. (I doubt interplanetarial portkey could theoretically exist though)

Maybe there's a limit regarding the user's knowledge. Meaning it's unlikely that a common wizard could transfigure items made of, say Tungsten (just to name an element).

There seems to be some medical limits too. Malfoy's grandfather does of Dragon Pox, and Slughorn lamented that it was "at his age", implying that it can be treated earlier. Meaning that, while wondrous, magical medicine is limited to the wizard's age. (And overall State?)

Basically what I'm saying Is that Its limits depend on the user.

Rowling actually talked about the magical limits of healing, according to her wizards can heal pretty much any non magical disease and injury, but damage through magic like dark magic, creatures or diseases are harder to heal and often permanent. Though you're right about the age thing, it does seem to play a role since Harrys grandparents also died through Dragon Pox because of their advanced age.

*** Animals ***

Let me rephrase.

Animals are "familiar" to wizarkind. They have a somewhat similar structure, they have parts that are analog (analogue?) to humans. Besides, they probably have some empirical knowledge about them.

Conjuring an animal (/Serpensortia/) is something a 12 year old can do.

Now, could that same 12 year old conjure a block of Oganesson?

Probably. Eventually. It would possibly take more knowledge that the one needed to summon a snake.

*** Hard disagree on that blanket statement. It's entirely dependent on the fanfic and the author - having limits can breed creativity in different ways, or help to world build, and make some stories better.

Now, that may not be what you like - which is fine. But there are going to be some people that like having some additional limits and exploration/pushing the boundaries of those limits in stories, and in reading said stories. I tend to be much more impressed by clever uses of spells to work around limits a character has, than just having something super powerful.

Eg, most of the more interesting situations surrounding Harry come from the limits he has. Extending that to magic as a whole can allow for some interesting situations to occur, particularly if (unlike JKR) the ground rules/limits on magic are thought through in advance.

** There's only one real answer - and that is, whatever works for your fic.

The things people can do with magic in canon shift with every book - along with the ease of it/use.

In fanfiction though, I would recommend you stray towards weaker rather than too strong - particularly for your main character of note (unless you absolutely want them to be completely mythical). The first reason is that being weaker forces creativity on you - how your character can handle thorny situations is much more pressing if they're not able to wave a hand and instantly make everything work the way they want it to. The second is that powering up someone too much, too quickly, is usually fairly boring. And the third is that certain drawbacks/difficulties (eg, needing to heavily concentrate/focus) aren't particularly easy to really show.

For example, spells in canon seem to have a few components - often wand movements, incantation, and intent. However, wand movements and the incantation tend to read as not all that hard - after all, who /hasn't/ mouthed along with "Wingardium Leviosa"? And, from the perspective of a reader, how hard would it be to get a simple movement down right?

Suddenly, it all comes down to intent/concentration being the only 'real' challenge that the reader can see. And for that, how hard can it be to visualize a feather or whatever going up? It can't be /that/ hard...

If you extend it away from first year spells and towards more complex ones, it doesn't actually change all that much. If writing that magic is complicated because of focus, I would make sure to show your protagonist heavily struggling with it on a few occasions - and it having consequences. The more you show them struggling with learning spells (and in a more impactful way than the canon books, IMO), the more it really sinks in how difficult those are to do.

But past that, the limits are whatever you decide. That's what JKR did, after all - you see different limits with each book, different abilities, etc. For the fanfic you want to tell, you'll need to think about it.

Eg - let's say you want to flesh out the wizarding world, and you like the idea of wizard farmers. So you backtrack from that - why would there need to be magical farmers? It means that there are some things that can't effectively be made with magic food related. If you could duplicate food, or grow crops in an instant, no one would need to run that position to grow food.

Or maybe you take a different approach. You /can/ use magic to conjure up or increase food - but only a true master can make it taste decent, let alone good. Suddenly, there's a need for farmers that grow it through the use of, say, slower enchantments - that make it much tastier.

You can take plenty of different approaches, depending on how you like to work. Like in the example above, you can find an aspect of society/magic that you'd like to include, and work backwards to explain it from limits. Alternatively, you could set stricter limits up front, and then run forward to see how they would affect society.

Eg, let's say that a limit is that it's impossible to make transmutations last for more than ~1 hour without using an enchantment to 'lock' it. What would you get out of that? Well, you'd make people have to buy things - you wouldn't be able to, say, transfigure a piece of wood into a sofa and have it be there permanently. For things that would be much simpler to have transfigured permanently, you'd probably have wizards specializing in the enchantments to lock it in place - or maybe a set of runes they'd sell to let anyone do so. And so on.

Back to your main question though, that means that the answer to "Can it create a whole society totally separate from the muggle world?" is... /it depends/. You can make it so that that's the case. You can make it so that it isn't the case. It's 100% up to you.

The reason I dislike wizard and muggle fighting in stories is because of how one sided you make it for one side or the other depending on the situation.

Do you know how much energy it takes to convert to multiple kilograms of matter? Because wizards do that very often when they use magic, just the amount of energy Hagrid created when he enlarged the pumpkins is multiple times larger than the amount of energy in the largest nuclear detonation that ever happened. If you're just comparing the amount of raw power of magic compared to muggles, then wizards have clearly the upper hand. Though just comparing power is stupid anyway since there isn't even any evidence that there is limit to the amount of physical fore magic could withstand, like why would a magic system where names matter more than mass care about energy just because its a larger amount of energy.

And yes a bullet travels faster than a wizard can cast a spell, but just aiming and firing the gun wouldn't be faster than the spell casting, it literally takes them just the time to think a word.

Also there is no piercing hex in canon.

  Do you know how much energy it takes to convert to multiple kilograms of matter? Because wizards do that very often when they use magic, just the amount of energy Hagrid created when he enlarged the pumpkins is multiple times larger than the amount of energy in the largest nuclear detonation that ever happened.

If shields affect physical objects then why wouldn't they be able to break it. I mean you could make the argument that spells just have fucking bonkers amounts of force because we have no way to really check that other than their effects at the final stage so it's entirely possible and I'd be ok with that. Thus bullets and bombs are really non factors against a shield.

The point was that saying magic cant resist something because a lot of force doesn't make much sense, when we know that even simple spells have access to much more energy.

No, think it the other way around, why should physical objects be able to break a spells that defends against them. We are talking about literal magic here, not highly advanced science that looks like magic, but something that can alter and interact with things like souls and secrets and job positions.

Well the average shield spell wizards use isn't meant to defend against physical harm even though it does to some degree. (Paraphrasing OotP) Maybe there's a physical shield charm out there but we never see it in canon.

If shield spells are strong against physical objects why does that waterfall at gringotts break it, granted it is magic water, why doesn't snape use a shield to defend against knives in DH, and why does umbridges shield not work against the centaur's arrows?

In the end there is no real answer to this because we lack too much information to come to a true conclusion. No points either of us can make can prove or disprove the points of the other. But this was a fun break from my studying. Thanks.

I am not arguing muggles are superior, just in this situation of wizards blocking bullets and bombs. Wizards could easily collapse muggle governments if they wanted to. A good wizard would likely never really worry about getting shot because he would slaughter them, turn them into animals, or something before they could get any shots off.

BUT in this situation where the gun has already been fired and the bomb is coming down...

** I think that the magical world is a lot more limited than magic itself because they just don't have the manpower to make significant progress. There's really not many wizards, and only a few of them are good enough to seriously study the nature of magic and explore what is possible, but compared to millions of muggle scientists the pace of progress is really slow. Magical inventions are still done by individuals, not by research labs of large organizations. So what they are doing with magic barely scratches the surface of what is possible.

*** That could be possible with AU magic. But with canon magic, a single wizard could topple down any muggle county with ease. Hell, have a single wizard on the New York stock market and they could make billions in a single day. Send a wizard to any military compound of a major power and they could cause WW3 in a minute. All within canon.

Of course, I realise there are Wizarding laws against such actions, but tough luck if they enforce them after all the chaos an unscrupulous wizard is let loose on the muggle world.

That's why I'm asking about limits of magic and (this just came to me) possible hindrances they inflict on one another when dealing with muggles.

** It's kinda hard to find the limits of it in cannon, but some are simply Gamp's laws of Transfiguration (I hope I spelled it correctly) and knowledge. If I remember correctly, the thing needed for the spell that would be cast is simply knowledge of how to cast the spell. It would take focus to do it correctly, but knowledge is something crucial on how the spell may work. Another limit could be on what wand they have and how many. It isn't completely stable and set in stones about the rules in harry potter with magic, such as "What happens when two people with the Felix Felicis potion duel" or "Could Clothes be lost whilst appariting". We kinda have to assume how some of the things work.

** I have come up with a decent answer to this, fusing Fate/Stay Night's magic canon into this to gain some philosophical limitations and inspiration.

In Fate/Stay Night, there is this thing called "The Age of Gods" where magic was much, much more powerful, versatile, and widespread, and both Magical and Divine creatures are widespread, which is why it is called "the Age of Gods". Mystery is in the air, and it affects humans to the point that they are superhuman by default and can grow to their version of Peak Human. Magic is used in a way presumably similar to the Potterverse, in that humans run on pure magical energy, allowing them to manipulate their own energy and that of the world around them. The implication here is that in the Nasuverse, magic research kicked off at the very beginning of humanity's existence, and they actually kept records. In the Potterverse, that is very much not the case.

The general, broad strokes of how I think that Magic works in both universes is the following: In the Nasuverse, in the Age of Gods, humans themselves ran off of magical energy, and used that magic like Ninjas use Chakra in Naruto. Eventually, that shifted to a different magic system, with Mages being born with "Magic Circuits" due to various circumstances created by an incredibly powerful Mage named King Solomon, ending the Age of Gods due to that, making Magic, Magical Creatures, and Gods, less and less widespread.

In the Potterverse, this could generally be the same, except for a couple factors. First of all, unlike in the Nasuverse, people in the Potterverse neither researched magic, passing it down for generations, nor did they keep decent records. There was never a King Solomon that shifted the Age of Gods to an ending, but the Age of Gods still ended. Because of that, magic gradually got weaker, and less and less widespread, until we reached our modern day in the Potterverse, where only a minority of people still ran off of magical energy (as evidenced by Wizard's durability feats), and that magic was much weaker.

As for what Magic in the Potterverse and Nasuverse can achieve, that's fairly simple. Quite simply, whatever can be achieved with an unlimited amount of time and resources, without magic, can be done with magic, and nothing more.

The following is just me trying to match the Potterverse's magic system to the Nasuverse's on a 1 to 1 level, so feel free to skip it, unless you want to read some interesting ideas on the Potterverse's magic and culture.

In the Nasuverse, Magic gets weaker as more people know it, from individual spells getting weaker when shared to other Mages, to Modern Mages hiding Magic from the general population, unlike how it used to be shared. That means that all that research actually weakens magic. It is worth noting that in the Potterverse, most of the more useful and powerful spells are actually recent inventions held among only a few people. Fidelius Charm? Recently made, held within Dumbledore's trusted few. Lily Potter's protection on Harry and Voldemort's blood ritual to get around that? Both likely incredibly recent, most likely made by each party that used them. There is even more recent magic, such as the spell "Point Me" made by Hermione in Book 4 of Harry Potter, which shows that spells don't have to be in Rowling's ugly pig latin.

On the other hand, in the Potterverse, it seems like the Magical world was divorced from the Mundane world around the time that the scientific method was in it's early years, stifling magic research in it's crib, and produced generations of anti-intellectual Wizards. What are magical researchers called? Unspeakables. Further evidence of anti-intellectualism in the Wizarding world are the main characters' lazyness. Do you remember that scene where Harry and Ron were complaining about "having to write a foot of parchment for an essay?" That is literally just a page. There's even more evidence of anti-intellectualism in that "blood purists" are a thing, how they go about supporting their views, and how the likes of Dumbledore go about opposing their views. How is /everybody/ anti-intellectual in this topic? They never actually test their views against evidence.

** I think this is precisely why we have so many fic where people have Harry, Hermione, or some OC bring in idea s from the muggle world to have a kinda of... Wizarding renaissance. Because they appear to be stagnant. Of course it's a book series primarily targeted to kids, so naturally it doesn't go too deeply into technical, complex stuff, but from what we see the Wizarding world seems to be pretty... old-school. And the average witch/wizard doesn't seem to even vaguely understand the potential of their power (of course it could be argued that this mirrors the real world, with most people not really realizing their potential or even understanding more than basic things about their culture, government, economy, etc)

What I find weird (though understandable if we remember it's a kids' series) is that no one ever seems to question the origin or nature of Magic itself. It's treated as something that just /is/, it has hardly any rules and what few rules it does have are seemingly arbitrary. Where are the philosophers and the people questioning “Why”???It especially seems like an oversight considering the whole blood purity issues throughout the series. You'd think you'd have people on either side of the issue pondering the nature of magic and why some people have magic and others do not, and why/how magic exists in the first place.

*** Yes, it's a big issue. If we approach it rationally, then the wizards have lived on their own, totally separate from the muggle world for 350+ years. They had to have their own infrastructure, their own agriculture, etc. They HAVE to be a fully functional society, even if we acknowledge that they are at the 1650+ level of development, they need to have a supply and demand economy. They need to grow crops, they need bakers, milkmen, builders etc. The entire civilization must somehow work.

It's something most fanfiction writers miss, even if they do it because the authors think food comes from grocery stores.

Personally, I find the view of Wizarding superiority kinda icky, tbh. It reeks of the kind of people who believe in eugenics. Like even the supposedly “muggle-friendly” Weasleys didn't understand a bit about them, because they didn't care to. Its like “oh I don't dislike [insert cultural group] but I just would rather not associate with them” Sorry end rant. I just get annoyed and don't understand why people can't acknowledge that the muggle world has done prettygreat for itself in a lot of ways without magic. And also acknowledge that while the Wizarding world has some really neat stuff, it should've been better. So so much better. They didn't have to expose themselves to the muggles, but if they'd actually bothered to pay attention, they could've made some progress, too.
