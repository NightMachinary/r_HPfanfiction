What is the Harry Potter Canon?

It was simple in the old days. The books were canon. JKR would occasionally make a comment in interview and those were considered canon too. When the movies came out, there were not considered canon, because they contradicted the books.

Now it's become rather more complicated. You have stories told by JKR but set in the same universe as the movies. We have a proliferation of extra-textual statements on Pottermore/Twitter. We even have a play of uncertain authorship, but which JKR had some role in producing. And it is not unusual for there to be tensions between these materials.

So, how to structure this mess?

First of all, let's understand what the point of canon is. The purpose of canon is to act as a standard of correctness, a source of authority. It is saying: the Harry Potter world constitutes a universe, so what are the facts of that universe?

Therefore whether a given individual likes some element of canon is completely irrelevant. That would run completely counter to the concept of there being an authority.

With this approach in mind, I would propose a system inspired by Common Law legal systems. In particular I would borrow the following concepts:

1. Binding Authority. Simplifying, this consists of decisions made by courts higher than the court you're in. These are the decisions which a judge must follow whether they think they are good or not.
2. Persuasive Authority. These are decisions of courts at the same level as you, lower than you, or in other common law jurisdictions. They are decisions which a judge should follow unless there's a very good reason not to.
3. Secondary Authority. These are materials which collate and analyse legal authorities, such as legal textbooks and academic commentary. They are not authority in themselves, but they are considered valuable materials for the purpose of understanding authority. Not all secondary authorities are equal and a well-established practitioner's text (e.g. Chitty on Contract) will carry a lot more weight than some random textbook for undergraduates.
4. Non-Authoritative sources. These are materials which are not in any way binding on the court, but nonetheless may be of interest and use, in particular in cases where English authority is completely silent. Most commonly this takes the form of judgments made by legal systems outside the common law system e.g. France.

So let's apply this to HP canon.

*Binding Authority*

These are the sources which are, without a shadow of a doubt, canon. They establish the core and immutable facts of the HP universe. I believe they must have the following features:

1. A written work.
2. Authored by JKR.
3. Published (in the sense that it is distributed to the world in a "official" form which is unalterable once released).
4. Intended to exist within the same universe as the Harry Potter books.

The only items that fit these criteria are:

1. The original 7 books.
2. The side-books Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Tales of Beedle the Bard.
3. The "Short Stories from Hogwarts" e-books.

There can be different levels of binding primary authority. Just like a judgment of the Court of Appeal overrules a judgment of the High Court, so too do the original 7 books overrule the side-books. In this regard, I would say that (i) stories override commentary, and (ii) later materials override earlier ones.

*Persuasive Authority*

These are sources which are definitely produced by JK Rowling, so reveal what JK Rowling considers to be the facts of the Harry Potter universe, and which have been distributed in a somewhat "official" manner, but fall short of the characteristics of primary authority.

I believe this category contains two items:

1. Pottermore's ‚ÄúWritten by JK Rowling‚Äù articles
2. The scripts of the Fantastic Beasts movies.

Pottermore is in this category because, while it is a written material produced by JKR and is intended to exist within the book universe, it is not ‚Äúpublished‚Äù in the same sense as the materials in category 1. Articles can be posted quite informally, edited, or removed. Pottermore therefore exists in a state of flux which prevents it from achieving binding canon status.

As for the scripts of the Fantastic Beasts movies, we know that these are written by JKR and published in an official, irreversible manner. However, it's not clear that they are intended to occur within the same universe as the HP books.

Rather, the Fantastic Beasts movies appear to take place in the same universe as the Harry Potter movies. We can see this because certain elements contradict the books, such as McGonagall teaching at Hogwarts in the 1920s when in OotP she said she had been teaching for 39 years. We can also see this in the general aesthetic of the wizarding world in the FB movies, which follows the aesthetic established in the HP movies. I think it's clear that the FB movies occur in the same universe as the HP movies (and are therefore non-canonical), but that still leaves the question open regarding the FB scripts.

I think the best position for the FB scripts is that of persuasive authority. They still reveal what JKR considers to be the facts of the HP universe, but when citing this authority one must be careful to account for the fact that JKR was writing a story to take place within the movieverse. Therefore one must attempt to separate out those elements which are part of the book universe and those parts which exist within the movie universe.

*Secondary Authority*

I believe that interviews, Tweets, and other informal, off-the-cuff comments made by JK Rowling best fit into this category. Those comments are useful, because they help us understand canon.

For example, in OotP Mrs Figg describes Dementors. Her description is bad - so bad that everyone, including Harry, doubts that she actually saw them and that the most she has ever seen is a picture in a book. Only when she describes the effects of a Dementor does everyone believe her.

It's implicit in this scene that squibs cannot see Dementors, but they can feel their presence. JKR then confirmed this in an FAQ which has since been deleted. Her comment serves as useful and illuminating commentary upon canon.

However, these comments are not canon in and of themselves. If JKR said tomorrow that actually, Harry Potter is blonde, this would not serve as an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù to canon which revised previous canon. Rather, she would simply be wrong.

*Non-Authoritative Sources*

Where the HP canon is completely silent as to a matter, it can be useful and instructive to look to certain sources. These sources can be useful to fill in gaps in canon, but only so long as the material being used fits well with canon.

I would identify the characteristic features of these non-authoritative sources as:

1. It is an officially endorsed HP material.
2. JKR must have had some involvement in the creative process for it to fall within this category.
3. However, it's not clear what level of involvement JKR had.
4. The work may or may not be intended to take place within the same universe as the books.
5. The work may contradict some part of canon.

In this category I would place: the original 7 HP movies, the Fantastic Beasts movies (as distinct from their scripts), Cursed Child, Chocolate Frog cards, and video games in which JKR had some involvement like Wonderbook: Book of Spells.

As regards the HP movies and FB movies, we can say that they create a separate, alternative ‚Äúmovieverse canon‚Äù.

*** Fan fiction doesn't just use the source material as a starting point, it uses it as a middle advisor and finale guide. When you're deep into figuring out whether or not your special magic system needs to have a willow wand or banyan tree as its material, you don't want to worry about what ollivander looks like, so you use canon.

You have an intricate love triangle involving your OC, Hermione, and rubeus hagrid. Obviously, your OC will treat hagrids cheating on the triangle for maddame Maxine in this way, but what would Hermione do? Grab a look at how her relationship went with Ron and canon and try to make it fit.

Changing canon is making fanfiction, but change it too much and its not fanfiction anymore, it's just fiction. I would argue that fanfiction doesn't use canon as /just/ a starting point. It requires a continual look and relook at canon to maintain cohesiveness in regards to the original harry potter series. The more you deviate from canon the closer you get to fiction.

** As Taure copy-pasted this topic from DLP, I figure I can do the same:

I'm not sure how well this approach really works.

The problem with it is that 'canon' isn't really a single, unified, non-contradictory unit of knowledge. It is not curated by any authority into a form that allows it to be used as a meaningful measure. It is a collection of semi-random snippets and statements, from a variety of different sources such that even within the books themselves, you might have different levels of reliability thanks to the unreliability of the characters within the story. And that's not even getting into areas where seemingly reliable statements may not match up to reliable observations (McGonagall, I'm looking at you).

I am reminded of how the idea of 'canon' is regarded in Tolkien. There, there's an understanding that the 'canon' (if that's the right word for it) develops over time. One just needs to look at things like Balrogs, or the nature of Orcs to see that while there /are/ some statements from Tolkien on those subjects, his thoughts changed over time, and the stories themselves slowly changed with them. The issue is, that there are still places were 'old' ideas were left in, which seem to be incompatible with the newer ones.

Tolkien nerds don't tend to get hung up about that though. Usually, the issue is simply addressed as an uncertainty, with multiple possible interpretations, each of them having potential support in the form of Tolkien-sourced statements at different points in time.

Basically, if we apply Tolkien-fan logic to Rowling, we'd treat every twitter post, Pottermore entry, spin off and novel as equal. In the cases where they contradict, there's no /need/ to choose between them, or make up convoluted excuses. Rowling's vision for her world/characters changed subtly over time, just like Tolkien's. If you want to write 'canon-compliant' fanfiction, choose the version that works best for the story you want to write, state that you are doing so, and go to town.

Really, the fixation on acting as if the Harry Potter world somehow has some kind of transcendental existence which must be unified and internally consistent, and which is only imperfectly expressed by the works that describe it, is baffling. It is a constructed world, built up over years. It's never going to be wholly consistent, and that's /fine/.

Thus when regarding this like conflicting statements like the original comment was talking about, the context for whatever the conflict is is most likely there with Tolkien, whereas with Hp unless it's something that took place during the book series context is probably missing.

That's exactly the problem that this approach is designed to tackle, by addressing the fact that there are different sources and treating them in accordance with the nature of that source.

Your approach essentially boils down to saying that all universes are fictional and flawed so you can only ever have Doylist discussions about them, discussing them by reference to author decisions and motivations. The problem with this is that people /want/ to have Watsonian discussions - that is, discussions about the universe as if it were real.

Fan communities exist entirely because people want to have those discussions about the fictional world they love to inhabit in their imaginations. To constantly force the conversation onto Doylist terms - "Harry didn't come back to life because Lily's blood, he came back because JKR wrote him as Jesus" - is about as welcome as Amber Heard's shit in a bed. Frankly, people who insist on the Doylist approach remind me of people who refuse to read because it's just words on a page - it's a fundamental failure of imagination.

Ultimately, people care about canon because they want to have those discussions, and in order for those discussions to occur there needs to be a standard of correctness. Otherwise it's just two people stating their equally baseless opinions, without ever being able to engage with the other person's opinions, because there is no common ground between them. They're just talking past each other and would have had an equally productive conversation with a wall.

** Cool, but irrelevant. You're no more an arbiter of canon than anyone else here. The only person who gets to decide what canon is is J. K. Rowling herself. Canon is the authoritative statement of what is or isn't true in a fictional world. The only person with the authority to make authoritative statements is the author. For the purposes of writing fanfiction it doesn't matter anyway, since fic authors are able to include or exclude whatever elements they like.

Also, it's pretty clear you decided what would go into each category /and then/ came up with reasons to justify it. Your definition of binding authority is written pretty clearly with the intention of excluding Pottermore and Fantastic Beasts.

Your definition of published does not exist anywhere else in the world. Articles released on the internet are considered "published" under all definitions, legal and otherwise. Even if we accept the "unalterable" argument, there have been changes made in later editions of the original books; they also cannot be considered binding under your definition.

And if the fact that some things in Fantastic Beasts contradict the books disqualifies them, then why aren't most of the books themselves disqualified, given that they contradict each other at times? The existence of contradiction is an extremely dubious ground on which to argue that they're not intended to exist in the same universe as the books. You even say that "later materials override earlier ones"; why would you mention that if not acknowledging that contradictions are going to exist between works? But for you, contradiction creates a problem only for one set of works, not for any of the others.

Overall, this obsession with saying "X isn't canon" is pointless and exists only for emotional reasons. If something people don't like, such as Cursed Child, is canon, then they feel that the canon they're invested in as a fan is devalued. Or, at least, that the canonical works they do like are devalued. We've seen it from the very beginning, with people trying to argue that the epilogue wasn't canon, or even that the last two books weren't canon. It's stupid. The question of whether something is canon is completely unrelated to the extent to which you enjoy it---something a fanfiction community /should/ be able to understand better than anyone. But everyone persists in wanting some external justification for "liking Harry Potter" but not liking particular works that are part of the Harry Potter universe.

** The real answer is that the universe is far too unstable and contradictory even in prime materials that it doesn't really matter. From word of author Fantastic Beasts might have the same canon legitimacy as the books but the movies that adapted the books don't (simply because of things that don't make sense like the whole Harry-eye fiasco, no Peeves in Hogwarts etc...)

So it's hard to discern what actually matters/what actually trumps what. Especially when the prime materials also clash in meaning. Take a look at Magic itself, in the original HP books Magic, isn't really a "physical" entity, it is merely the means in which a Wizard performs his craft. It leaves traces as Dumbledore has said, and it applies importance and significance to things like numbers or events.

‚Äã

But Magic itself is not a tangible force that one can see. Hence the whole Magical Core fiasco and all these things people used as a means of measuring Magical "Talent" like it's Star Wars with midochlorians. Yet, Fantastic Beasts state it is not only physical but can manifest.

For example, if in the epilogue she'd mentioned Harry's blue eyes, even though she's said they're green a hundred times, does that supersede the original mentions even though it happened later?

** That seems rather complex and unecessary. Literal rule-lawyering about what is and isn't canon run contrary to what canon is: canon is the shared knowledge about the HP universe.

If there is a fact most fan of the serie will know about it, then that fact is canon: changing it without warning your readers might annoy them because you're changing something they know about the universe they want to be reading about. Fanfiction is all about writing in a shared universe - so if you change basic thing about it, you need to warn.

Conversely, a source from Pottermore or Twitter that you can hardly expect your readers to even know about is not canon because you cannot assume your readers would know about it and write accordingly. And conversely, you can change that fact easily and without warning, since most would not notice.

So what canon is what most people know about the serie. This include the books, and a few well-known factlets from outside the books, like Dumbledore being gay.

‚Äã

The contraposition to that is that if you need to resort to legalese argument to justify why your chosen factlet is canon, it is not canon.

** For a more legal rebuttal, I disagree with the common law approach. JKR is the ultimate authority, yes - but that means everything published by her counts. Assuming she would make a mistake or that a particular passage or text wasn't actually approved by her isn't acceptable in that case - she is the ultimate authority, and as such, has the authority to alter earlier statements.

That means we have two ground rules to consider when interpreting "canon": "newer beats older" and "specific beats general". Which means something stated in book 7, if contradicting something in book 1, takes precedence, and that something stated in general will not take precedence over a more specific statement. Like "magical beings are defined by..." compared to "this specific creature isn't a magical being" (even though it might meet the requirements stated earlier). Which also means that something stated by her later takes precedence even over the books. So, if she says Harry is blond, then that would be canon. (It would be stupid - but JKR is the ultimate authority over HP and not bound to her earlier statements. She can retcon things as she likes.)

This is a very unusual approach to canon. A canon is traditionally a series of authoritative works - namely, the books of the bible considered to be "official". The concept of canon is inherently tied into the idea of there being a fixed, published set of works, and the idea that statements made by people can be canon in the same way that writings are is unusual.

You simply need to have a mechanism for dealing with inconsistencies. E.g. take the most recent version, or just exclude the inconsistent parts from the canon. And of course many /apparent/ inconsistencies are not in fact inconsistent - it is possible to find an interpretation, in many cases, which reconciles all canon facts.

I should not intervene into what looks like an old argument between 2 authors, but it's a bad example, If it was only a matter of quantity, any boat that let Dumbledore in (or for that matter, Voldemort) should also let several wizard like Fletcher in at the same time. Ever 16 years old Harry is already stronger than several adults. At best, the magic of an adult may have a different "quality" than that of a child.

Voldemort probably used a "conceptual" magic (like Privet Drive Blood Protection or Dumbledore's Age Line). to enchant the boat so it would only let one "Person" ride it at the same time. For the boat, only one "Adult Wizard" (no matter how powerfull he is) was considered as a person, a muggle, an underage wizard (like Harry) or even an House Elf (Voldemort could bring Kreacher with him despite him being powerfull in his own right) were ignored by the protections.

****** Dumbledore explicitely stated: "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed this lake." Now, people can twist words as much as they want, but that clearly stated that Voldemort had a spell that measured the *amount* of magical power. You don't use the word "amount" if you cannot measure it. (Amount: "a quantity of something, especially the total of a thing or things in number, size, value, or extent.")

And then he goes on to say that as under age and unqualified, Harry's powers wouldn't register next to Dumbledore's.

Honestly, the whole "Oh, you can't measure magical power" is not canon according to the books, unless you start throwing in stuff like "Dumbledore didn't mean it" and "that's actually means it only counts adult wizards, even though he said magical power, it's not powers" and such stuff.

The fact is that Dumbledore explicitly talks about "magical power" in relation to a spell that registered it.

Dumbledore literally explains /in the sentence following the one you quoted/ that when he says amount of power he is referring to the fact the enchantment determines amount of magical power by counting the number of adult wizards, and only permits passage if that number is not greater than one.

There are many parts of canon open to various competing interpretations, such as the nature of the food exception to Gamp's law. But this really isn't one of them. The only way you arrive at quantifiable magical power is by sticking your fingers in your ears and pretending words don't exist.

******** I think you're the one who sticks fingers in your ear. If you use the word "amount", it's meant to be quantifiable. Anything else doesn't make sense. If it were the number of adult wizards, and not related to a quantifiable amount of magical power, Dumbledore wouldn't use that wording.

If there was no measurable magical power, Dumbledore wouldn't have mentioned dit - he would have said:

********* Your interpretation is not only against the explicit wording, but also conceptually incoherent.

As I understand it, you're proposing that the boat works as follows:

1. The boat measures the amount of magical power within it, where each wizard has a range of possible power levels.

2. The boat has some sort of reference for how much magic one wizard should have.

3. The boat divides the total measured magical power within it by the "magic per wizard" reference figure.

4. If the result is greater than 1, the boat does not permit passage.

But this just doesn't work. The result would absolutely be higher than 1. Dumbledore on his own would surely have more power than a single wizard by the boat's reckoning, because he's one of the most powerful wizards in the world. And on top of Dumbledore, you have Harry, a wizard who we see overcome Voldemort's Imperius curse, who repelled a large number of Dementors, and who beat Voldemort at Priori Incantatem. His magical power, if measured by reference to some kind of "quantity", is surely also at least 1 on this scale.

The sequence /only/ makes sense if the enchantment works as Dumbledore describes it i.e. a counting mechanism which just completely ignores Harry, and which treats Dumbledore as a single wizard. Magic is either "on" or "off", Dumbledore's count's as "on", Harry's counts as "off" because he's not yet 17. The boat counts the number of occupants with "on" to determine the amount of magical power crossing the lake, and only allows passage if the amount of "on" is 1 or fewer.

And of course, all of that has to be read together with the entire rest of the series, which continually reinforces the idea that the difference in power between wizards is a quality they possess, not a quantity of expendable magical power.

Ultimately your argument rests entirely on the fact that, despite Dumbledore explicitly describing the mechanism of the enchantment, you consider the use of the word "amount" to be odd in that context. That subjective sense of oddness is a very weak basis to override an explicit explanation as to how a spell works, especially where it produces even more oddness if you apply it.

This. That damn boat isn't a weighing scale for magical power. The closest real-life equivalent I can think of is an x-ray scanner, and anyone below the age of 17 simply doesn't register with it. Dumbledore's usage of "amount" is just a colloquial term for Harry to better understand how it /might/ work.

********** My argument rests on the fact that Dumbledore talks about magical power at all - he wouldn't that if it didn't exist. He also directly says that *Harry's powers* wouldn't register. Not that Harry wouldn't count.

And the enchantment can easily work if the amount of magical power cannot be greater than what Voldemort considered the minimum for two adult wizards combined. Which, in turn, depends on what exactly "magical power" is - which wasn't really defined. It does, however, lead to the conclusion that "magical power" isn't the sum of skill, talent, experience etc, but just a limited innate ability or baseline, not nearly as important for actually spellcasting as skill. Kind of the "magic" a wizard or witch has.

If your interpretation were valid, why would Dumbledore even talk about "amount of magical power"? He'd talk about the *number of adult wizards*.

Your interpretation doesn't work with the wording, nor the intent you assume behind it.

*********** No one is saying that magical power isn't a real thing. It obviously is. The question is as to the nature of the power difference between wizards: is it a difference of /quantity/ or a difference of /quality/?

Per my "Magic of Harry Potter" doc:

--------------

The question arises: what is the nature of a wizard's power? We know from the above discussion which factors influence it, but what actually is it?

Many people answer this question by proposing that power is a property wizards possess in addition to the factors I have discussed above. My fundamental thesis, however, is that this idea contradicts all of the textual evidence I have already presented. Wizards discuss power, and we see the effects of power, as being influenced by those factors. Power is therefore a property which emerges out of the contributing factors, not something separate to them.

To be clear, I am not saying that magical power does not exist. The thesis is not (as some people argue) ‚Äúthere is no such thing as magical power, only magical skill‚Äù. Rather I am saying that a person's power is a complex, multi-polar property determined by a number of factors, rather than a simple point on a linear scale which is fixed at birth.

Nonetheless, a person's magical power has a genuine effect in the world. We see the reality of magical power in numerous places:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúAvada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it (GoF Chapter 14)
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat. (GoF Chapter 35)
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúListen to me, Cornelius,‚Äù said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch.

  [...]

  ‚ÄúYou are blinded,‚Äù said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, ‚Äúby the love of the office you hold, Cornelius.‚Äù (GoF Chapter 36)
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. (OotP Chapter 36)
#+end_quote

There can be no doubt, I think, that magical power is a real magical property which has its own presence. It is not just a shorthand way of referring to the complex mix of factors I described above. However, the fact that power is real does not imply anything about what determines that power. On that front, I hope I have demonstrated the many different factors which contribute to power in canon.

************ But if magical power exists, then Dumbledore talking about its amount clearly implies it can be quantified to some degree. That's simple logic. If it were not quantifiable, he wouldn't talk about its /amount/.

Also, if it were a complex mix of factors, then, as you claimed before, Harry would twing whatever spell is measuring it.

With regards to the quotes, none of them talk about /magical/ power. The force of a spell, the force behind a spell, power - and most seen through the eyes of Harry. Certainly nothing one would describe with "amount".

I don't think you can easily, or at all, measure the complex mix of factors that makes up a wizard or witch's power - skill, experience, intelligence and natural talent, for example. But measuring some magical power, that is mostly the same for an adult and at most twice the average for a uniquely talented individual, but weaker for a child? That's something else.

Yes, and that degree is "has it" or "doesn't have it", as Dumbledore explicitly explains in the scene. The boat simply determines whether there is more than one adult wizard in it. You're attempting hang far more on the word "amount" than the word implies.

Ah, you've shifted your argument! You used to argue that the boat didn't count the number of wizards but rather measured their power.

Well, this becomes a lot easier, now that you admit that the boat operates by counting the number of adult wizards in it (which is what Dumbledore explicitly states it to do, so I'm glad you have admitted it). It's simply a matter of clarifying our vocab.

When I say "quantifiable magical power" I mean the idea that wizards have different amounts of magic. An enchantment counting "1 wizard, 2 wizards, 3 wizards" does not prove (or even vaguely suggest) quantifiable magical power in this sense.

To the extent that you say that counting a number of wizards means that magical power is quantifiable, I completely agree. But that does not show in any sense that wizards have different amounts of power.
