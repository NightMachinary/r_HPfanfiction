Posts where harry travels back in time to his really young self and is actually smart about everything etc

requirements: - harry goes back to his younger self with atleast his memory intact. - harry is smart (or atleast able to use logic) - no Luna bashing - no ginnyxharry - straight or asexual harry

pros: - weasley parents and three youngest kids bashing or not bring involved too much - no relationship until later (i mean harry would get mentally aged a lot so its weird) - politics - aging potion for an alter ego - overpowered or godly harry potter

cons: - love potions (they just creep me out) - suddenly heir to get a powerboost - metamorph harry - lots of sex with little story

btw writing this down was hard enough because my mind kept switching around so big respect to any writers out there y'all are amazing


** Reprise, Herald of Dreams on ao3. Harry/sirius. Cliche harry goes to gringotts, finds out he has different parents and a soulmate, and weasleys stole from him. Not complete but it's pretty good. I know it's not straight but the only straight one I have right off is "Oh God Not Again!" Which is fantastic but hinny.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
