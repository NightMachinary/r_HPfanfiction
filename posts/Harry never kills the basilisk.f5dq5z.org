When the triwizard tournament comes he just summons the basilisk and has it do all the work and for the maze just rides on it's back to victory (assuming parsletonges are immune to the basilisk deadly gaze)


** Wormtail is killed and Harry returns with a deformed baby who is put up for adoption ( as Fudge does not believe that the aforesaid baby is the Dark Lord Voldemort).

** This happens in shanastoryteller's fic, survival is a talent, Harry just knocks out the basilisk. In 5th year he returns to the Chamber and befriends her, her name is Theophania and she's basically reptilian Meryl Streep. She likes Luna the best

I also like the idea that Parseltongues are immune to the death stare, but I find it hilarious that this would mean Harry ran around with his eyes closed, tripping over his own feet for no good reason in CoS lol

****** I remember reading one of those, the basilisk was turned into a girl. Then the author decided to make her a sex slave. I dropped it quickly after that.

** Not exactly what you're talking about but years ago, I read a fic where the diary was dealt with during second year without the chamber's location being discovered, thus, the basilisk is still alive. Near the end of the fic. Voldemort shows up for the Battle of Hogwarts and releases it causing a lot of devastation.

I've looked for it several times since then and can't find it. Does this ring a bell to anyone?

Edit: a word

**** Maybe? It's hard to say, I've read so many fics between then and now that they start to blur. I am pretty sure, however, that this fic also had a devastating chapter written in one of the Weasley twin's POV and they share one mind but during the chapter one of the twins dies in battle and the other experiences being alone with his thoughts for the first time.
