In my experience Draco and Hermione are more popular characters among fanfiction authors . Honestly the quality of the fics in this pairing is way above anything with Harry as a main character. I have been going through some of the threads and most of the people here seem to only like fics with Harry as the main character. Why is it so different here as compared to say Tumblr or Livejournal ?


** [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNWTOcubzPLMYcc_CdhAH0uwBMSloTgTdjTQZxINdHovbnRQ/viewanalytics]]

It was the favourite pairing for 10 out of 600+ responses. For me the big reason is related to the average age of the people here. For the most part this is an older crowd than Tumblr. Draco Hermione holds no interest for me. I dislike Hermione and am neutral on Draco. I know a lot of people who dislike either one or both. Its a drama pairing, the whole forbidden aspect, its all potential drama and I think a lot of people have outgrown that.

I posted a while back that a lot of the plot can be worked out from the pairing for Harry stories. People seemed to agree even if they felt that it might not be a great thing. What can be worked out from Draco/Hermione? you've got too people on opposite ends of the spectrum, neither one showing any signs of compromising. This means conflict and drama. In real life these two would just avoid each other and I think a lot of people agree that the pairing just doesn't make sense, or at least to me. What this leads to is a bunch of stories that are very similar, they have to be forced together and forced to address their views. Since purebloods in the books are shown as the bad guys we can expect Draco to compromise and realise how great Hermione is. Done. I've never read one of these but I'd bet that I've guessed the plot of 50%+

***** I made a post for last year's survey dividing the results by gender: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bbvna/meta_hpfanfiction_survey_2016_results_summary_by]]

While it doesn't look like there was a question on favorite pairing, Draco was only selected as a favorite character by female responders. Draco and Snape were also most often disliked by male responders. [[http://imgur.com/yuqeZXx]]

Also, from reading fics involving Draco and Snape, it's often clear that the fics are often written for and by women.

I should do another post for this most recent survey, but the pairing question was not well coded so it will be difficult to get total numbers for favorite pairings for it. Although maybe I should work on that just to see how many people prefer which pairings.

****** I've already said thanks but I have a question. The result I found most surprising was the amount of women who put Ginny as their favourite pairing for Harry. Do you have any guesses/explanations as to why? I guess it might be something to do with she went out and made her dreams true but I'd have thought that the way she treated Fleur at the start of the sixth book would have been more off-putting for women.

******* I would think it's because it's a canon pairing and makes sense for Harry. She is not a best friend like Hermione is and is a neutral option. Ginny is a strong character too, she isn't afraid to state her mind and doesn't take bullshit from people. At least that's why I picked the pairing even though I am fairly neutral either way. I also find Fleur kind of annoying so I don't care about how Ginny treated her. It's a very small part of the books and not in the movies so I doubt it's a detail that many recall.

If you look at the graph for the pairing preferences: [[http://imgur.com/ZsXFC87]] It looks like pairings like Harry/Daphne and Harry/Fleur are way more popular among males too so many guys have preferences towards them so they pick those over Harry/Ginny. While women don't care for the ice princess/super hot girl pairing and choose the pairing they are more familiar with. I feel like Ginny is way more relatable to women than Daphne or Fleur.

******* I don't know how true it is for everyone, but as a woman I can tell you that when I think about the pairings I put myself in the place of the girl/woman instead of the boy/man as would be the case with many other readers (who are presumably male). I've noticed that many of those who protest the pairing do in on the basis that they think Ginevra would not be good for Harry and don't put much of their attention on the opposite, whereas for me it's more natural to check whether or not /he/ would be good for /her/ with the opposite not being completely ignored but not exactly being of the same weight. Humans are selfish, after all, and relationships /are/ give-and-take, so it probably shouldn't be surprising that when we look at a pairing from the eyes of a character we are judging the other party's ability to give and their desire to take but not ours.

Additionally, I will note that one often cited reason for the pairing not being good is that Ginny's character development was ... not there. And here is something for that too: being someone who at least to some degree went through some of the stuff she'd been going through during the series, it's easier for me to look through her eyes and let it all play out to the point where any holes in character development due to lack of screen time can be substituted with my own experiences which match well enough to give me a believable end result. That, I feel, makes it easier to accept her as a viable pairing partner because for us she is not the same kind of character she is for men.

And I say that as someone who really doesn't have a favourite pairing, so I'm not one of those women. I do see it as /viable/, however, which already is something.

****** Why do people hate Umbridge more than Voldemort? You don't compare like for like. Draco isn't a good person, I don't like him but really to me he's almost irrelevant. A large amount of fanfiction could do away with his interactions and nothing would be lost. He's a bully but nowhere near the level Snape is. He tried to kill Dumbledore and didn't care who got caught in the way. He was also a teenage boy who was given an impossible task with his parent's lives held as collateral. He's certainly a bad person. I just don't really care about him, thus my indifference. Other than the 6th book and the Slytherin common room bit in the second you can mostly skip anything involving Draco and not lose too much.

Hermione is rude, irritatingly self-righteous. Has no regrets about kidnapping another person and extorting them. She's more than willing to use other people for petty grudges and gets petty if anyone comes close to her academically when she doesn't accept they might and yet still claims the moral highground. I can't really remember her owning her failures. The first book is my favourite and by far my most read and in it she's annoying and unlikable. In PoA she's never willing to accept that she might have done wrong or Crookshanks might have been in the wrong. It doesn't matter that she turned out to be right, it was the way she went about it. She doesn't get much better. Its her lack of regret that grates since to me it suggests she sees no reason to change. She doesn't ever seem to think she did a bad thing so long as she can justify it. By the end of the books I get the feeling Draco might look back a decade later and know he was an arse. I think JKR did her a disservice by having her come out right so often. The sixth book and Malfoy being up to something is the only time she's wrong in a big way and we never see her realise it as we wrapped up in the aftermath. Every other time JKR comes in to point out she was right all along so don't worry.

I'm, not sure what you're reading, but Draco as a protagonist alone is an almost 100% guarantee that the fic is sub-par. Add him in a pairing with the girl he insults - not just bullies - insults with the worst the wizarding world has to offer, wishes torture and death on her - and it either becomes unbelievable, a Death Eater apologist bullshittery, some weird ass AU,... and in general to 99% not good.

Draco Malfoy is a repulsive, irredeemable psychopath for the first five books who, like every other character in the goddamn series changed in book six, and was probably the most unbelievable of the changes. Film Draco, like film Snape is made quite different, but for different reasons. Film Snape is great because Alan Rickman was an awesome actor even if he was nearly twenty years too old for the role. Tom Felton, while not a bad actor, is mostly just good looking. The teenage girls who write 90% of the Draco/Hermione fanfiction really want to be with an uber rich Tom Felton and put themselves in JK Rowling's own personal avatar in series to fulfill that fantasy.

Why do you find his change unbelievable? He was stupid, pampered kid. And then reality slapped him in the face. The leader of his dreamed regime that was supposed to place his family even higher than it is turned out to regard him and his family as tools, disposable ones at that. He was oh so good at talking about killing, but killing himself, actually "pulling a trigger"? It's no surprise that he failed at that.

**** Well the Death Eaters were far past the point of "two sides and reason". I'm with you that purebloods don't just wake up one day and go out killing muggleborns. There has to be a problem, perceived or real, that they have with them. The one springing to mind first is, of course, that they feel their culture is threatened by the influence of more and more muggleborn.

But at the time of Voldemort, we're far past the point of reasonable argument. Death Eaters are fanatic terrorists. They are the ones who have devolved any possible argument in the past into a civil war.

If Draco would be sympathetic to a traditionalists and conservative politic, I wouldn't call defending him apologism. That would be a legitimate view to hold.

But Draco is full on having a boner for a terrorist organisation. Or to put that in perspective, Draco finds what ISIS does really cool and is in total support of it, to the point of joining them. Draco is literally like one of those twats who travel to Syria, join ISIS and then realize that they're goddamn monsters and wants to go home. Not because he thinks what they do is wrong. But because he's too much of a coward and pushover to be a topdog in the organisation and is victim of occasional violence. But until that realization hit, Draco has assisted in an assassination, performed /several/ terrorist attacks, and in general vilified everyone who didn't adhere to his view of the world.

Draco Malfoy is a terrorist guided by a racist supremacy-doctrine.

Anyway, I agree that all those things could /in theory/ be done right. But I'm pretty sure I'm very close to the actual number when I said that 99% of everything written with one or more of these plotlines is utter trash.

There is no "let's only listen to muggle music! Let's only wear muggle clothes" scene.

So, since the whole books are about the good guys fighting the wizard nazis who are bent on mass-murdering muggleborns, why would anyone sane assume that the wizard nazis actually have a point? That'd be like watching Schindler's list, and then claiming that off-screen, the nazis might truly be defending "their people's blood purity" against "jewish corruption".

I really don't get why, with the parallels to the Nazis blindingly obvious, people still claim that canon leaves any room for blood purity being anything but an evil, sick ideology. In canon, pureblood bigots are evil. Anything else is fanon.

** Tumblr and livejournal, by their very nature, are going to spawn fics of a lesser quality. They are more of an echochamber than anywhere else I've ever been, and I've only read a single decent fic on LJ, and none on tumblr. I'm not saying that's all there is, but there's a reason stories are being posted there, rather than an actual fanfic site (though I suppose some are on both).

Then there is the nature of the pairing itself. Of course, popularity does not translate to quality. But the pairing is very fomulaic, perhaps moreso than any other pairing. There's just not really much to explore with it, and I can imagine the well probably ran dry pretty early. Like, you've got the intelligent muggleborn, and the high-strung pureblood heir - make it work. So, you get a ton of cookiecutter drama followed by it eventually "working". It's not really a recipe for a good story, unless you really, really, like that sort of thing. And the people who like that sort of thing will read 500 fics of that pairing with only minor alterations in plot.

Truthfully, it's not really that much different from other pairings. Sure, I hate how Hermione is often portrayed in fics (though I like her in canon), and Draco is almost contorted to be unrecognizable to fit the author's badboy fantasy. But honestly it's not like Harry/Daphne is that much better. There's 500 identical stories with that pairing, and its not exactly full of quality either. And they often tend to use the same "selling points" to make the story work, and it always ends up not being the very interesting.

Demographics shows us that this sub does not like Draco. Last year's survey showed that not one of 60% of the users of this sub chose him as part of a pairing of a story they'd read.

Quality refers to the undeniable fact that like 99.5% of fics featuring Draco suck. There might be a handful that are well written, but then you run into demographics again, extremely few people will actually read those, if they even manage to locate them.

Nope, just nope (just like Hermione/Snape or Lucius or Voldemort)...sorry, but with all those mentioned (including Hermione/Draco) she would have to abandon who she is and Hermione is too logical to do that (we are talking about a girl/woman here who wasn't above meddling with her own parents minds and basically play god - emotional ties be damned! - and who is basically: My way or the highway - which Draco and the others wouldn't accept! Not to mention that Draco believes that Hermione is barely above some dirty animal!)...OK you could argue that she has to do that with Ron, too (that's why I'll never get this pairing and I am thankful that Rowling admitted that it was basically wish fullfilling) but it would be worse here because at least Ron is not an anti-muggle bigot and neither is he that bad of a bully (sure he abused his prefects badge if I remember this right, but otherwise? Nope)
