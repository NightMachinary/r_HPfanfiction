  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

**** ...66 chapters isn't a binge? ðŸ˜…

They're updating pretty regularly, too, I like to give it a bit and then catch up on four or five chapters at once.

Glad you like it!

****** Twice a week, I think, as a courtesy during quarantine. The author had a substantial hoard of chapters written when they started posting.

** Linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) is the one that pops to mind.

Also the quidditch world cup by the same author.

I really like TE7's OCs from Vitam (and i think a few of them are recycled from Quidditch world cup)

That said, i get the feeling TE7 doesn't like these stories so much anymore, based on comments i've seen. Which is a shame, as i loved them.
