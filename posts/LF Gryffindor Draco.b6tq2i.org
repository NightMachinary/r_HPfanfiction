There are so many Slytherin Harry fics, I was wondering if there are any good gryffindor Draco pics. Maybe sort of a Sirius situation there. I've read Innocent by MaurauderLover7 linkffn(9469064) and its sequels. Draco's characterization and growth throughout the series is very well written. So I was hoping for something similar.

Just to be clear I'm looking for Draco in Gryffindor with the trio, ideally befriending them. No slash please, nothing against it, just not my cup of tea

â€‹

Edit: Ideally no bashing either, but if its well done then go for it


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11006892/1/A-Sorting-Like-No-Other]]) is what I thought of.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** The Dangerverse has this (although not until the sequel linkffn(Living Without Danger) which covers the beginning of Hogwarts. But Harry, Hermione, and Draco are raised as siblings so I am not sure if it is what you are looking for.

  AU, second in main Dangerverse, complete. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger--Lupin, and Draco Black were raised by the Marauders and their wives. Now they and their friend Ron Weasley are off to Hogwarts. Heaven help Hogwarts. Years 1 and 2, twisted canon.

  After he fell through the Veil, Sirius awoke back in his eleven year old body. There was just one problem. He was four years in the past! Given a second chance to help his godson, Sirius pretends to be his own son in an effort to ruin Dumbledore's plans. Will Hogwarts be standing when Loki returns? Or will McGonagall finally retire when she finds out who Loki really is?
