:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There are multiple fics I've seen pop up that deal with the Fantastic Beasts movies in some way or another, but I remember a particular scene where Harry's sad for some reason and he's really into creatures, an expert really?

And his family or friends bring in Newt Scamander and they talk about creature stuff and it cheers him up? I think Newt's wife is Tina and maybe she bonds with Lily Potter but I'm not sure, could have been another female character. And there's a creature problem that they need Newt's help with, that relates to Harry somehow.

It's been in my head all morning but I can't recall which story it was! Please help!
