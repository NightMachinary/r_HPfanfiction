** Meh, this reeks too much of the recently much requested theme of putting Hermione in her place.

Unless, that is, the SI is replaced by Luna, whose deductions alternate between being serendipitously brilliant and unmitigatedly disastrous. Hermione, when she isn't being blown away by Luna's insight, is forced to use her cold hard logic and general competence to clean up the latest mess created by Luna's latest intuitive leap.

Seriously, the world needs buddy cop comedy starring Hermione and Luna.

**** Oh, right, Emma /Watson/ played Hermione in the films. I had completely forgotten the actress's family name. (Her first name, I will never forget, thanks to the popular fanon name for her mother.)
