** Title is so misleading. By awkward I thought you are talking about timetravel story in which 30 yr old Harry is in 12 year old body going after 11 eyar old wife who reminds him of his mum. Creepy on several levels.

*** No, real awkward is a 30 year old Harry in 12 year old body going after his 11 year old mum.

**** I dunno, that's not /that/ weird imo. The way I look at it, Harry has never even really met his mother. He has no memories of her beyond a glimpse of her sacrificing herself for him. I can definitely understand a logical "ewww" reaction but he doesn't have that biological imprint (I believe that it's called the Westermarck Effect) that tells his body that it's a poor choice - for the health of the species, that is - to find that lady attractive.

Edit:

I derped pretty hard here. I read this as Harry going back at a similar age to his mother, not 30 year old Harry seducing his 12 year old mother or whatever. That's totally creepy.

***** No weird would be 30-something Harry going back to be 12-13. Years old and hitting on women the age he was or slightly older like Molly or Peirs mom.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1513042/1/Hold-Me-While-I-m-Here]])

Hold me While I'm here has close to what you want. Its long abandoned but they definitely get into the awkwardness and the Marauders think he's keeping secrets.

It's honestly sad that it's not even surprising, no matter the thread this gets recommended and it's honestly not even well written.

*** Linkffn(Stepping Back By TheBlack'sResurgence) is a WIP that may well have elements of what you are looking for involved. James isn't confronted though more sort of brought in on the secret.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
