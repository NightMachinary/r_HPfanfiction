Some people think that Prophecies are proof that the Universe/Fate is somehow sentient and wants certain things to happen. Or as proof that the god of their choice is real. But there's an explanation completely in line with what we know about how magic and time works (mostly from PoA) that doesn't require any supreme sentience.

What if a lot of wizards hear about a very important event at roughly the same time? A thousand magical minds processing the same bit of information and being very emotional about it? Like a disturbance in the Force? Could this be enough to trigger a form of combined accidental magic where the bit of information in question gets sent back in time? Then someone who is skilled at sending magical probes into the future and receiving the information - essentially what Divination is, the tea leaves or crystal ball are just random pattern generators used to receive and visualize the data - could pick it up in the past.

Which explains why Prophecies are always about major events. While normal Divination is somewhat controlled by the person doing it, since the Seer subconsciously sends magic into the future to grab data and send it back, a Prophecy is caused by a significant event in the future and the Seer just receives it with no control over when or how.

At this point both normal Divination and Prophecies (and information carried by time turner) act the same: Once the information is in the past, it "locks" the universe so that it somehow turns out true, since a universe where it doesn't turn out true would contradict itself, and as we know from Hermione and Harry's time trip in PoA there is only one timeline that stays consistent.

There might be multiple ways in which the conditions of the time data can be met, Harry could die at the hands of Voldemort or Voldemort could die at the hands of Harry (Original Prophecy), Harry could die or he could meet a big black dog (Tea leaves class prediction), Macnairs axe could kill Buckbeak or just hit the fence post (Hermione's memory of the axe sound), but one way or another whenever information is carried back in time it can't be contradicted.

It is kinda annoying whenever time travel fics create splitting timelines and completely ruin this wonderful bit of consistent behavior of time physics inside the HP-verse. I'm a physics major, so I like consistent physics, even if there's magic. One thing HPMoR did well.


** A very interesting theory, and also seems like something that came straight out the quibbler, yet somehow, in the quibbler's rash way, turn out /half/ right
