**** That's fanon. His paternal grandparents are Fleamont and Euphemia, and we don't know her maiden name. His aunt and cousin are the only two blood relatives we know about.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings.
