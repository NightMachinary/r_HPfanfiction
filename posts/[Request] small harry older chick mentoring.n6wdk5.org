I liked that one slytherin fanfic that I can't remember the name of where Harry is mentored by some chick from a dark family that no one will go near since she badass.

Some fics like that


** does it have an incredibly complex Slytherin hierarchy & she leave him as her successor?

  Harry Potter's life was not a very good one, but then one day that all changed, one day he found a snake in his cupboard. Slytherin Harry, dark/grey. There will be bashing. HarryxDaphne (pairing could change in the future).
