Alright I've been looking for this story forever but I can't freaking remember any of the details. :( I remember that him and Luna are friends and i swear he is in Slytherin and when Luna comes to Hogwarts she calls him my lord, and he has to tell her not to cause people will over hear her and think he's the next dark lord. Now with my usual interests it is probably a slash story (Draco/harry, Tom/Harry) , with a gray smart Harry who is plotting in the background and bashing of at least Dumbledore but that is just a guess because i really can't remember the story.


** I'm not sure that this is the story you are looking for though it has several similarities as what you requested. Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135 has Harry in Slytherin, as a lord, and has luna calling him my lord etc. Not sure if he tells her to not say anything but I do know he tells others to keep the knowledge of his status quiet. There is no slash in this one and it's a Harry/multi (to include Hedwig if you want a twist).

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

** linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) maybe? She calls him Prince there, instead of Lord, but still, that might fit. He's not in Slytherin though.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
