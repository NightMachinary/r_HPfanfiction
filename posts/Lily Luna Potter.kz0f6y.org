Seriously, did the writers think Luna died?


** I always took it as naming her after her godmother.

My old friend had family that did that with middle names. Aunts or Uncles mostly were used.

*** I assume that's what it's meant to be. It just comes off as weird because there is a clear trend in Harry and Ginny's naming scheme which Luna doesn't meet.

** You don't have to name your children after dead people.

Harry *James* Potter was named when James was still alive, also I think most of the Weasleys namesakes were still alive when they were born

*** Albus, Severus, James, Sirius, Lily. There is a trend. It's weird specifically because of how Harry and Ginny named every other child.

** Luna means moon.

Remus Lupin was nicknamed Moony and he died in the Battle of Hogwarts.

** Headcanon: Luna is the one name that Ginny got to pick.

** No, but Remus did.

The godmother headcanon works, too, though.
