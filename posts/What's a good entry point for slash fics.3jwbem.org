I've never read a slash fic. I want to at least read one so I can know if I'd like the genre or not. So what are the best slash fics that would allow me to begin? Since I like Dark!Harry, preferably something with it.


** Can't stand this fic myself but the most recommended one is linkffn(saving connor).

I will say this, if you treat it like a genre as opposed to something incidental to the story you're going to get smut. Which I think is something you'll know if you enjoy already. :P

Yeah, I can already tell you that I'm definitely NOT going to like smut. It's just that I've been avoiding any slash fic like the plague, but my favorite topic (Dark/Slytherin!Harry) is full of slash fics.

**** Then your better off just ignoring slash warnings and going for it. Maybe i'm biased but imo the only reason to write a slash story is to make the romance a major part of the story and if you're not into that you won't enjoy a large chunk of the story.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** I recommend the following:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]]\\
  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Pretty decent.

I would also recommend this one even more:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]]\\
  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source.

but that one has NSFW bits.\\
Also, sfw slash is a bit of an oxymoron. Just saying.

** Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo is the best slash fic I've ever read. It's not on ff.net, but you can find it by googling easily. It's Harry/ Cedric, very different from most slash fics IMO.

** Linkffn(keep this wolf)

It's has a great low key romance between Harry ,Draco along with only one sex scene that comes at the end of the story.

This is my favourite slash fic.

  HPDM slash. There is no reason for the Ministry to pull Unspeakable Draco Malfoy off his Dark artifacts detail and assign him to negotiate with Harry Potter's werewolf pack. Draco suspects a set up. When he meets Harry, however, he has to wonder if it's a different kind of set up than he anticipated. Updated every Tuesday. COMPLETE.

** There is a series by Nightfall Rising / Potionpen called [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][The Truth is What I See It Is (subjectiverse)]] that I recommend all the time. The latest story in the series is Valley of the Shadow, but you really want to start with Album of the SangReal. In this case, there is slash but it is incidental to the story, and if you don't like it then the author has versions on ffn that don't include the slash, so its a good jumping off point.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is way more true than that. Lily Evans doesn't know she looks different depending where you're standing, the Blacks know exactly how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't exactly who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.

  *Canon Compliance*

  It is advised that the reader be familiar with the biography of Harry Potter written by Ms. Rowling. The reader should be aware that this seven-volume series was fact-checked by Ms. Skeeter rather than Miss Granger, and cannot be relied on in the matter of dates. Furthermore, Ms. Rowling's books are written from the point of view of the subject, and not only contain a distinctly pro-Gryffindor bias but largely confine themselves to what Mr. Potter saw, heard, assumed, and speculated.

  This is a Slytherin story, and truth is subjective.

** Ignore everything Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Lucius and Harry/Voldemort(Riddle). That's probably 70% of all slash on FF.net so what's left is easier to sift through.

I'm sure that some people like those pairings and with something like fan fiction you have to maintain your suspension of disbelief, but they go too far. Even if canon Harry had wound up gay, he wouldn't have sullied himself with the likes of them. This is obviously my personal opinion and you don't have to agree.

There's one story where Harry goes to the Delacours after 4th Year and winds up unwittingly dating a Death Eater and it's not totally unbelievable. I think it falls off the wagon into an mpreg story, though, so...
