** Harry watched the ongoing carnage with a look of disbelief on his face. Turning to the twinkling Headmaster, Harry said what everyone else there was thinking. "Holy s***, so that's why you sent her to look after me. I'd been wondering why you didn't send a wizard or witch, but not so much anymore.". "Language, Harry." Hermione said on autopilot, the cogs of her brain trying to process the scene in front of her. Dumbledore said nothing, merely watching merrily as Mrs. Figg tore apart a squad of senior Death Eaters with her handbag and walking cane.

"I don't know why you are so surprised." McGonagall piped up from where she was reclining in a Conjured lounge chair. Harry, Ron, and once it penetrated the whirring and clicking of her brain, Hermione, turned to gape at their Head of House. McGonagall smirked. "After all, we cat ladies are very protective of our prides.". A bound and gagged Umbridge, who had been captured as a recently marked Death Eater, nodded in solidarity.

** Lucius: It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to.

Draco: Who? That fucking squib?

Lucius: That "fuckin' squib"... is Figg. They call her "Baba Yaga."

Draco: The Boogeyman?

Lucius: Well Figg wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. She was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman.

Draco: Oh.

Lucius: Figg is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw her kill three men in a bar... with a quill, with a fucking quill. Then suddenly one day she asked to leave. So the ministry made a deal with her. They gave her an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies she buried that day laid the foundation of what we are now. And then my son, you steal her car and kill her fucking cat.

Draco: Father, I can make this right.

Lucius: Oh? How do you plan that?

Draco: By finishing what I started.

Lucius: What the... did you hear a fuckin' word I said?

Draco: Dad, I can do this! Please!

Lucius: Draco, Draco! Listen! Huh? Figg will come for you, and you will do nothing because you can do nothing, so get the fuck out of my sight!

** Over the weeks, she gains a reputation. "The Fig" they call her, not that she cares. None of the Death Eaters know who she is or where she came from - is she a powerful witch from the continent? A vengeful widow, daughter or mother?

All they know is that if they arrive at one of their fellows' houses and the entire structure is burned to cinders, they have a few seconds to get out. Any survivors who escape via portkey are inevitably half-skinned, insane and expire shortly after speaking of a dark figure looming over their broken body.
