So following [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b276c2/dudley_dating_a_witch_or_sqibb_meets_up_with_harry/][this post]] I'm looking for a specific fic. Here's what I remember from it :

Dudley invites Harry for dinner (maybe with Ginny) Dudley is dating a witch but doesn't know it Dudley's girlfriend is surprised when she learns Dudley's cousin is Harry Potter (if I remember well, learns only when meeting him)

Unsure but there also may have been A scene where a table was changed into an animal (a cow?) May be a one-shot.

Obviously it's none of the stories mentioned in the other post and I'm pretty sure I didn't dream this one so if someone knows which one it is, please do tell.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10228563/1/I-m-a-Witch-Dudley][I'm a Witch, Dudley]] sounds similar, though I think you might be looking for something along the lines of:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12544259/1/][Unlikely, Impossible, and a Little Bit Looney]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923249/1/][Cousin Harry]]

You might also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Potter Runs Into an Old Muggle Classmate]] which is kind of similar.

I don't think this helped, but good luck!
