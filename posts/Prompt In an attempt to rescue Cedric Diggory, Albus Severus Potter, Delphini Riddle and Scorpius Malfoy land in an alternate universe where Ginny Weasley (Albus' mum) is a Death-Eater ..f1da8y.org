After reading Black Ink, Red Rose linkao3(19381933), which was psychologically traumatizing, I decided to amuse myself by reading the Cursed Child which is a blatant violation of canon, not to mention the Trolley Witch, Death Eater Cedric, Voldemort being fertile, etc., and it would be quite fun watching Albus Severus Potter interacting with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Sirius Black from the Black Ink, Red Rose universe.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

*** Same here, though I think that I found it traumatizing because Ron Weasley is my favourite character in the HP series and I ended up sympathizing with Ron.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Dude i can just imagine the look on Albus and Scorpius's face if that shit started going down. They would have totally erased themselves out of existence and caused a paradox though lol.
