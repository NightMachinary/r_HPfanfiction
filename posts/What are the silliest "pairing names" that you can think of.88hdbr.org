**** Good one. I raise you:

After Bathilda Bagshot's interview with Rita Skeeter, Ron and his brother, Charlie, go to Bathilda's cottage to try to confirm claims in Rita's book /The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore/. While there, they run into Severus Snape who has maintained a relationship with Bathilda all these years due to her connection with Lily Potter.

The four engage in an all out free for all sex romp which can be summarily described with one phrase:

Child Rape

#+end_quote

"Hinny" actually is a hybrid of a male horse and a female donkey. Yeah, if only on that basis, "Harmony" is much better.

I don't think "Hinny" gained in prominence until fandom was in the process of migrating from Livejournal to Tumblr. It's probably because Tumblr prevents the use of the "/" symbol in the tagging system, so the names where just mashed together like for most other pairings. And as many people use Tumblr for fandom blogging, that ship name also made its way to the mainstream outlets like Buzzfeed and Mugglenet. However, it still makes little sense, as even something like "Ginarry" would be better.
