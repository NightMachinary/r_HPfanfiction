I'm looking for two different time traveling fics, one has Harry after a potions accident traveling back to merge with his younger self. He ends up going to gringotts and is aged to be older and through blood adoption becomes the son of McGonagall and the triplet sibling to Sevrus and Hermione (who also traveled back in time) Harry also ends up with Sirius in the end. The second I can't remember much of it I just know Harry and Ron go back in time (there where several other who traveled but I can't remember who all did) and Ron ends up saving Narcissa at her engagement party and then ends up engaged and eventually married to Lucius Malfoy.
