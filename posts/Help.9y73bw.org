I just wanted to have some recommendations of any Harry Potter fanfics that have time travel in them. But it's Harry that time travels. Please no harem or female pairings. It can have no pairings as well. Also no FemHarry.


** There are a lot of these. I recommend going to AO3 and searching under the general tag "time travel." From there, you can use the sort/filter feature to specify you want fics tagged with Harry, that you want the Harry Potter fandom, and that you want to exclude M/F pairings. (If you exclude all pairing types, you'll get those without tagged pairs.) You can also exclude Female Harry Potter, and of course sort by rating, warnings, and other such things, including completion status.
