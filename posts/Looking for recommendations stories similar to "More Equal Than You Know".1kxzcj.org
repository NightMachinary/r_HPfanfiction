Just finished [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3787073/1/More-Equal-Than-You-Know][this great but old and abandoned story]]. Liked it lots and am looking for more recommendations on stories with similar characteristics.

In particular what I liked:

The magic world and rules of magic were extensively fleshed out to make the magic system more structured both in respect to how magic in fights is used and how magic affects society economy. I like stories there the world makes sort-of sense to an adult. There was a sense of balance and while some characters were extremely powerful, it made sense in context and wasn't taken too far - Harry still looked to be in a lot of danger when threatened.

Decisions by Dumbledore and the rest of staff were explained and made sense in context. To people very protective of children it might not quite seem as that - but at least it was a major improvement to canon which kind of made the adults look less then competent.

All characters actually are competent with appropriate level of difference to the story line. I particularly loved this Snape - his role is minor, but he is basically the kind of Snape I would have loved to see in canon given the role he plays. (I seriously had the urge to clap a bit at most of his scenes - and I am normally not a fan of him). Enemies are equally competent and dangerous - Voldermort and Bellatrix were actually scary in this story and all action scenes were pretty tense.

Harry is complicated and has issues but deals with them with sense and maturity. No one being an idiot. All other characters share these traits to an extent. If someone has less or more self-control it's justified by plot and explained in characterization.

A sprinkle of romance - I usually like some in my stories and split my time equally between stories where it's central to the plot and ones where it is on the sidelines such as here.

Just to clarify aside from not liking slash, I am not focused on any particular character/pairing and would just as happily read a story with the above qualities if it wasn't focused on Harry or Hermione. (well not quite - I really like Hermione, but close enough)

To save on time I've already read Firebird's Son and Natural 20 (and judge them similar in quality to this one)

So please share anything that fits the above.

*** Without romance at all, stories usually get boring to me quickly but thanks for the effort. Will try it out.
