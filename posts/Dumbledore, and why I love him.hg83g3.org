Say what you will about Dumbledore's execution (pun not intended) in the books, I love the idea of his character. I've recently decided he's my favorite, moving past Luna Lovegood in my stack ranking, and I'm here to explain why and perhaps also to do some complaining about the fundamental misinterpretations of his character I see in fanfiction.

What I love about Dumbledore is the genuine wisdom he carries, and the ephemeral and almost abstract way he floats through life. As an ENTP, he, an ENTP, (fight me) was a big role model growing up. He has a sort of foreknowledge of everything that happens around him, born of experience and suffering. Nothing he sees stands alone - rather, it fits one of several patterns that he watches weave their way through life. He sees the inevitably of these patterns and is comfortable with them and their end. He's self-aware in the most beautiful way, at peace, yet assaulted by the guilt and demons of his past. He's almost prescient in the way that he moves. Everything is metaphorical to him, because he can draw wisdom from his words the way he can draw magic from the air. He's the kind of man who could teach you more about life by interpreting your fortune cookie than a preacher could from their bible. More than that, he's at peace with the future. He's comfortable there, in a way none of the other characters in Harry Potter are. In world full of uncertainty, he's learned to be an anchor where once he was rudderless.

Even his journey I find beautiful, in an archetypal kind of way. He grows up gifted, with a need to prove his skill and power, yet paradoxically alone as a result of his decision, and in typical Dumbledore fashion, probably aware of this irony but resolutely ignoring it. He meets Grindelwald, and it's way out! He is to cast off the shackles of wisdom and humility and join him in his quest. You see, this is the great beauty of Dumbledore's journey - his movement from powerful opposition to the winds of fate born of intimate knowledge of their workings, to his acceptance of the inevitability of the cyclical nature of time. With Grindelwald, he seeks to disprove the prevailing notion that to play God is folly. The irony, of course, is that in defeating Grindelwald, he simultaneously fulfills this goal and and disproves it. It is only at the moment that he learns humility that he becomes the new God of the wizarding world - it' savior, its guiding hand and vision for the future. This is really Dumbledore's great irony - in every effort he makes to oppose fate, he both learns that he ought not to have done so and ends up doing so anyway out of necessity, as a result of his greater wisdom and knowledge.

Later, Dumbledore faces his second moment of growth - the 1st Wizarding War with Voldemort. This is where he truly learns wisdom and establishes his philosophy for the second war. He has humility, yes, but here he learns to temper that humility with the knowledge that he needs to take action. He finds himself once again frozen, as he once was when Grindelwald was advancing across Europe, and has to learn how to move forward in the light of the knowledge that he knows nothing. In much the same way that Socrates both taught and held that he didn't know enough to properly teach, Dumbledore knows he can't lead a war perfectly but has to do it anyway. It's why when his friends and allies throw criticism his way, he accepts it, with the knowledge that he is fallible but must continue to lead anyway. Coming out of this war, Dumbledore finishes learning the lesson that perhaps defines his character during the years of Harry's schooling - that he has no control over fate, and never did. This moment is defined, of course, by Voldemort's defeat at the hands of a baby. This a complete one-eighty from the folly of his youth. He is close to the end of his development.

During Harry's years, Dumbledore has but one more step to take to fulfill his character and his destiny. He must learn to wield the darkness inside him and sacrifice everything to deal the killing blow against Voldemort. Armed with the humility that they won't find a better method of removing Harry's horcrux and the wisdom that sacrifice is sometimes necessary, he weighs the odds and finally discovers what is ultimately right and wrong. He puts into place a plan that ends up putting Voldemort down. He does his best, and is allowed to be put to rest. His arc is thus completed.

Now, my fanfiction rant! Writers, for the most part, don't really grasp Dumbledore's spirit. He isn't quirky for reason, and it's not his defining character trait. Also, he's far, far, far more wise than fanfiction makes him out be, or how the books make him out be, to be honest. The thing that irks me the most is when they make him this manipulative bogeyman, because it doesn't fit with his arc at all. The special thing about Dumbledore is his peace with the future - why would he be desperately grabbing for money or power? Dumbledore's wise enough to a) be a better manipulator than that and b) not care about those things more than is necessary. The thing that usually gets Dumbledore isn't that he has some fundamental flaw at the end of the books - its that he's old, and tired, and there is no one, no one, to take his place. I have yet to see a fic that really grasps his prescience and the way his mind spins through the world. If you have "taught Dumbledore" a lesson in wisdom, what that really means is that he forgot a lesson and he saw the pattern of that lesson he forgot in you. That's what I mean when I say he's old and tired - he can forget some of what he learned over the years in especially emotional or strenuous situations, although the spirit of wisdom stays with him.

Thoughts? Surface-level pseudo-intellectual analysis's of Dumbledore I don't want to fight but will anyway? Fightin' words about Dumbledore's type? Leave'em in the comments!


** Yeah, I gotta say Dumbledore is ultimately a plot device. He has the potential to be as you described, and I agree that fan fiction should focus on bringing this out, instead of repeatedly bashing him. That still doesn't change that the books weren't very well planned out, the sudden genre shift from children's stories to YA in GoF mucking that up, and JK's over-reliance on troops leaving so many characters two dimensional and holding the idiot ball just to make the plot work.

*** The character of Dumbledore doesn't really exist before book 5, or even book 6 since he isn't really present in book 5. Before that he is your standard boarding school book headmaster. The highest authority that is disapointed when students misbehave and is catalyst for plotlines.

** Dumbledore, Ron and Sirius are my favourites.

I really like certain fics where Dumbledore is portrayed like Jiraya, the Pervy Sage from Naruto.

I hate all the bashing of this character

** I'm working with my bad memory and warped fanon but I don't care.

Part of the problem with Dumbledore is no one feels like they can tell him he's wrong. People just blindly follow him. This is not entirely on him. He's not a puppet master. He's a chess master and he is also a piece. He's not even the King.

He's in a role where he has to handle everything. He's just one dude and he's bad at it. His only reliable informant is Snape and that's just because Snape is a good spy. He puts him in charge of children. He's so bad at it. He put Arabella Figg in charge of Harry's wellbeing.

I think the last thing he actually planned was the stone debacle. Voldemort booked it into a castle, severely weakened, went through three dramatic puzzles and felt really good about himself until he comes across a mirror puzzle that couldn't have been more effective against him. He gets burned out, prophecy over. Then Tom Riddle, in all of his dramatic teenage diary glory, gets dumped on him and several horrible dots get connected very quickly.

Prophecy hurls child against fated enemy again and again. Fate works in strange, mysterious, and inconvenient ways.

It's just occurred to me that prophecies fatelock things into a narrow wobbly A to B line and I've lost my train of thought completely. It's the most messed up thing in the HP universe. That's going to bother me all day.

Anyway someone tell Dumbledore there is no I in team or to at least get friends.

** I absolutely love what you've written up here ! He's my favourite character to write. A while back I wrote a fic about Dumbledore's punishment after his death was to be reborn as Harry and I kinda messed it up (I really want to go back to write it, but I've got an author's block on it) but up until now it is definitely the best fic I've ever written. In mbti I've actually tested as intj several times so really his character is the exact opposite to my personality. Perhaps that is why I love delving into his character to try to write him and his motivations ! Consider your post upvoted and saved.

** Dumbledore was JKs device to spread the story out to seven books. Have everyone on the "good side" irrationally believe Dumbledore had all the answers and have Dumbledore consistently fail at planning and have things happen under his nose. He was wrong so many times. He was tricked so many times. He was reckless with children's lives so many times.

You wax philosophically about what a wise, ephemeral being he is...comfortable in his own skin. He should have been more worried...he should have been less comfortable...he should have had a sense of urgency and accountability to actually take part in executing some of his brilliant plans. He put himself in charge and should have done more.

He had the potential to be the great character you see him as but in the end he was just a plot device.

And oh my god, that is a spot for the kind of mentor canon!Harry needs. If you fuck around with big concepts like fate, death and sacrifice you're not going to like the answers you find.

** I honestly agree with the way you see him, but that is also the reason why I dislike him so much. It's all well and good being comfortable with the future, but what if the future isn't a desirable one? He's too comfortable with it in my opinion, and because of that he ends up assuming everyone else should be just as happy with where fate is taking them. This then leads to him making unilateral decisions about other people's lives without their input; such as forcing Harry to return to the Dursleys' each summer. He has his reasons, but doesn't care to listen to another opinion on it because he sees patterns, as you've said, and thinks the minutiae of another person's life is irrelevant to the larger pattern at play. There's nothing wrong with "rag[ing] against the dying of the light," but I think Dumbledore would disagree and tell you to accept the hand that fate has dealt you.

** That's a funny way of writing Gandalf.

Book!Dumbledore is a plot device, if he was half as capable as he should be, the books would have ended by PoA(he would've captured Pettigrew) or by GoF(he would have roflstomped people at the Graveyard and captured Tom).
