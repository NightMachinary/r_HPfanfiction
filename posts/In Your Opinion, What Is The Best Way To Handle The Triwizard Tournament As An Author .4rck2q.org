Do you like original challenges or stay true to canon? 3, or more? Do you change the solutions to canon challenges?


** This is a tricky concept.

The original challenges were perfect for a wizard like Harry in canon. There were shown multiple ways of winning each... And i think that is where authors who are attempting to stick to canon are having issues. Imagine if you will that you have a harry of around the same abilities at the beginning of fourth year having to murder a dragon without any planning. That doesnt seem possible. If we are being honest i dont see anyone short of a person willing to AK the eyes of a dragon killing it on its own. Without the dragon injurying itself anyway.

Now if you are attempting to write stronger harry... Then the challenges have to be adjusted to fit that criteria. A harry potter that is already capable of holding his own against three grown wizards at 14 should not have to summon his broom to beat a dragon. Or rely on an elf for the second task.

The best way i can put it is if you are changing harrys abilities change the tasks and make them more difficult. It doesnt have to be major. Unchain the dragon and all of a sudden you have to put the beast down hard to get within 20 yards of the egg. Make the third task where the champions are kidnapped in the middle of the lake and they must get back, only hide their wands at first. The third task... Thats the fun one. Make the maze sentient. If a hat can talk, a goblet can make decisions. I sure as fuck think that maze can learn how to fuck some champions over. Make some lore about it. The maze is always the last task... And so far its the deadliest. For over 5 centuries it has defended eternal glory... And it sure as hell wont give it up without a fight.

Thats my opinion of course. And all are being used in my story.

This is really well said. Too many authors scale up Harry's abilities without doing anything in regards to the challenges he faces. The result is often boring to read.

Entertaining adventure stories have - at their heart - a protagonist who overcomes tremendous obstacles to achieve his/her goal. If the TWT tasks are identical to canon, then Uber Harry usually steamrolls through them.

**** This is exactly true. While it is fun to read an Uber Harry steamroll the TWT the first time through, it is not as entertaining to read the second time, or farther times down the road. Also a major portion of the TWT is how Harry and company interact with people who may or may not be their enemy. This is the first time in the books that this is the case, as every other book has a clear antagonist for the entirety of the work (PS/SS whomever is stealing the stone, CS whomever opened the Chamber, PoA Dementors and Sirius) In Goblet of Fire, Harry has no clue who his enemy could be since that is the first time the entire school including his friends (ron) abandon him. An Uber Harry in that scenario will react extremely different to how the normal Harry did. Canon Harry attempted to ignore it while doing the minimal to survive until the Third Task when it was clear that he could actually win it. Even if you are not writing an Uber Harry, but your Harry would drown himself in work to hide from the pain of being betrayed by his world yet again, then you NEED to adjust the challenges to reflect that. The Hogwarts library, and several teachers such as Snape, Flitwick, and Mcgonagall are all masters at their crafts, with Snape and Flitwick are shown to be fantastic spell workers. (Flitwick being a former Dueling Champion and Snape being able to easily duel Harry, Minerva, and Sprout in canon) To state that a Harry who escapes from pain by self improvement would not be able to turn to one of these three, especially for non-TWT related lessons is absurd. Therefore, how your Harry reacts to the people react around him also dictates the tasks. It is one reason why authors either flop or flourish when creating or modifying the tasks.

**** thank you. I am attempting to write the entire work before posting due to my fear of not completing it.

I will give a short summary however

Harry Potter was in many ways an ordinary wizard with an extraordinary past. All that changes when his Godfather gifts him with the legacy of the Potter family in its Grimoire. He will learn his family history, the powers of blood and friendship, and rise to new heights. But all power comes at a price...Harry must excel, or else. AU after Third Year.

How far along are you? I can totally get behind wanting to finish it. I tried my hand at writing, but it didn't get very far. I'm a great technical writer (if I say so myself), but not a very good novelist. I was shooting for a groundhog day kinda thing, with a 72hr time loop. Was gonna have a lot of kinda short chapters with all sorts of zany shit. Wanted to get at least 10 chapters done before I started to post, and finished two before I decided I wasn't a good writer.

Good luck, I look forward to it!

****** Power is subjective. Magic isnt that simple in my world. The way i have magic set up in my work is... Unique. I don't believe that everyone is equal in harry potter. Draco is clearly better than crabbe and goyle. Harry is clearly gifted in DADA. Hermione is clearly gifted at learning. In my fic, families seem to have these gifts. For example Draco is all around an E student. His father seemed to be the same. The Blacks were known for their vicious love of the Dark Arts. The Potters? They were known for one thing and one thing only. They knew their magic so well that they were the most dangerous people to hold a wand. In my fic Charles Potter dueled Grindlewald to a standstill after dueling 400 other wizards. In my fic dumbledore trained for a year with Charles to battle Grindlewald. In my fic every wizarding family has unique magic.. And the Potters are all for battle

I would also cut out the 'Barty Jr impersonating Moody' plot, because it took only a couple security questions from Dumbledore to unravel the entire scheme. Barty Jr. could potentially question Moody, but I doubt anyone would be able to cover all range of potential security questions.

While I agree with you in principle, the one thing I enjoy about that plot looking back as an adult reader is that it only works because Dumbledore is cocky and overconfident, and believes no-one could get that close, even despite Volde-Quirrell infiltrating the castle three years prior.

It really shows that even though JK presented Dumbledore as a hero and a genius throughout a lot of the first books, dig a little deeper beneath the surface and there were seeds of his flaws and those same flaws causing a lot of the negative events in the books.

On that note, Filch as a character in general is an odd one and one that is never really expanded upon in the books. Why does Dumbledore hire a Squib for the one role in the castle (all-purpose cleaner and security guard) that would benefit the most from having access to magic in order to do?

Because, you know, tradition. With that, it might very well be that no witch or wizard even wanted to do Filch's job, but someone has to do it and so it fell to a squib a bit out of his element but not out enough to make others care.

**** Basically any way anyone would have of getting one of Harry's essays and putting a torn piece of that in the goblet, really; or getting him to willingly sign anything else and then throwing that in. The possibilities are endless, and the only actual advantage impersonating Moody actually gave to Junior with this one is that there wasn't any teacher who'd noticed it being done.

Want to be silly? Get a polyjuice potion with a hair of some random firstie or so witch, stick a piece of parchment to a book about Harry Potter in a way that makes it look like a part of a book, and then armed with cuteness and a simple confounding jinx go ask for an autograph.

Or get one of the school owls and send him a fake love letter or something, asking him to write back. People usually sign letters.

Or use the gemino curse to make a copy of one of his essays, leave the copy for the teacher, and get the original and use that.

So basically whatever you have the imagination for, really.

** From a reader's perspective, I enjoy seeing new challenges or reading about new ways to solve the known challenges. If everything plays out the same, it's best not to rehash the details. Assume the reader has already seen several (hundred) variations of the tasks and unless there is a character-defining moment to include, it can be told in retrospect rather than shown.

As a writer, I think it's important to recognize why the Tournament was happening at all. Consider the timing; just as Dumbledore learns about a new prophecy heralding the Dark Lord's return, he arranges to reach across the seas to possible allies in Europe. He may have started negotiating with the other schools sometime after Harry started school and he could see that Harry would rise to challenges. By finally acceding to the requests of the others to have the tournament, Dumbledore can evaluate their allegiances and enable Harry to build alliances that might be needed in the coming conflict.

As for the Tasks themselves, it bugs me when authors ask other people to suggest new tasks for them: this is the best opportunity within the known storyline for a writer to exercise their creativity, and you want to outsource it?

** Depending upon when I start an AU, I may change the challenges. Something like the tournament would be organised at least a year in advance, so if my AU starts at the end of PoA, the challenges won't change meaningfully.

To stop the original tasks being boring, I usually pick from a few options depending upon what best fits the story:

Focus not on the tasks, but the changes: Demonstrate the character's different traits (e.g. the other hostages in the lake are knowingly left to die, as the priority is on saving their hostage - then /maybe/ coming back for the others)

Ignore the tasks: The tasks are so irrelevant to Harry, they're dealt with as background colour (e.g. Dean's reading out the Prophet's coverage of the first task when McGonagall comes to inform Fred and George they have yet another detention for plot reasons).

Different PoV: even if Harry's doing the same thing as last time, jump into a different character's head as we've not seen their thoughts and, ideally, because of events in your story, the thoughts they're thinking should be different that canon.

Do it anyway, but do it briefly: If you're writing it well, people will be dragged along long enough to deal with it, but not long enough they start skipping paragraphs.

You don't have to write the whole task: Unless told otherwise, people usually assume it has happened like canon. Rather than begin with everyone at the start of the maze waiting for the whistle, you can signal readers at the end of the prior scene (e.g. Hermione gasped, looking at her watch. "Harry, you're going to be late - you should have been at the start of the maze ten minutes ago.") and then have the task start with, for example, Harry blasting through a hedge and seeing the Tri-Wizard cup in the centre of the maze.

If you really need to, you can combine all of the above to tick all the boxes extremely quickly and get back to the meat of the story - though if it needs to be done that quickly you may have bigger structural issues. I once planned out all the tasks and everything else, then realised that it was essentially irrelevant to the story, so I started in the graveyard with Voldemort and used the rest as backstory - and then used most of the above to keep the graveyard scene interesting.

Reading this back, basically what I've said every time is this:

if it's important to the story (shows character or moves plot), do it. If it isn't important to the story, don't show it.

If what you're doing is both important to the story and the same as JKR (hence boring), you're not writing fanfiction - you're copying out the book /really/ inefficiently ;)

(Disclaimer: One of the reasons I like fanfiction is watching one tiny change snowball until we're not in Hogwarts anymore. The other reason is I like watching one big change ripple through everything so we never see Hogwarts)

** Like [[/u/Zerokun11]] said, you really have to scale your challenges. If your HP is close to cannon, then cannon-esque challenges would be good. Although I like to think we're all pretty tired of nearly word-for-word rewrites of the book, so either skip through the tasks fairly quickly, or change what happens a little.

Or throw out the rulebook and improve the tournament.

I recently read a story where Harry & Hermoine were in a time loop of their own making (something with Runes), and the tasks were fairly different each time. But there were a lot more events, something like once a month. And they had different types of duels (wand & wandless but with potions/items), broom races, hunting/tracking, etc. One of the best rewrites of the tournament that I've read.

I really like the idea of multiple events. Why would they all come stay at some school for a whole year and only do three events!? It doesn't make a lot of sense, but I guess the book was long enough as it was, so JKR didn't want to add more tasks or make the tournament more complex.

I also really like the way the Olympic Trials (IIRC) went in linkffn(The Brave New World by bellerophon30). While not the Triwizard Tournament, I liked a lot of the competitions that were involved. They seemed a lot more like skill and knowledge challenges should be.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

*** 1. Agree.

2. I also agree here.

3. A good point, but who do you plan to have as judges to replace the headmasters?

4. More sounds good, maybe one that is suited to each wizard, and then the last one an overall challenge? Like a DADA challenge for Harry, a flying one for Krum, etc.

** I prefer a more character driven piece, so the tasks themselves aren't terribly important, but rather, how the characters react given a different change in circumstances. Otherwise you get nonsense like a broom race, or speaking to the dragon in parseltongue.

*** It's only nonsense because you don't keep an open mind (sorry, but more diverse tasks is only fair, the original 3 for example didn't have direct competition (like say the champions duelling each other...we don't even know if taking an other champion out is allowed) and neither did they use all the skills wizards are taught...potions for example wasn't utilized, just "stupid wand waving" (Snape!) and a bit of flying and herbology on Harry's part!))

**** Ah yes, the old "keep an open mind" that people throw out there to justify bad ideas. Using an original idea doesn't automatically equate the idea to being good or enjoyable to read. I read tons of year 4 fics (and have written a fair share myself), and the amount of times that having an original set of tasks that actually mattered or merited their inclusion at all is quite small.

** The problem is that it's far too easy to think your way out of the challenge and it's not interesting to read a curbstomp.

Task1: summon egg, if that fails transfigure rock around egg and then summon that.

Task2: If there is a feather light spell it stands to reason that there is a lead heavy spell as well

Task3: This one is actually alright because the wizards are actively competing with each other instead of trying to solve the problems alongside each other.

I think that if it's a funny story you should have a creative solution to the existing tasks but if it's a serious story you should probably change them so that the competitors are in direct opposition to each other instead of finding solutions to problems.

** Add on something for the rest of the school to do and make a way for people to spectate on the champions' challenges. At this point, with twenty years of fan fiction, strongly consider replacing the canon tasks, just to make things feel more fresh.

There's a weak elemental theme to the tasks. You can look at, say, Magicka's elements, and pick from there. You could also look at different types of conflict -- person vs person, person vs environment, person vs self -- and produce challenges that explore those. You can look at different disciplines within magic (enchanting, potions, wandwork, magical creatures, herbology, etc) and produce challenges that emphasize different disciplines.

The alternative is if the competition is in the background. Then, I'd say, keep things close to canon. Your readers know what happened in canon, and they can pay less attention to the tournament itself and pay more attention to what you want to say about things happening at the same time.
