Fics with cool battles. That's it


** I've been enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098062/][The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen]]. It's a fic focused on a cast of OCs set some time long after the events of the books. It has the most varied and well-written magical battles I've seen in HP fanfiction.

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I've given this recommendation in the past, but I'm honestly still a little iffy on its actual quality, so I guess judge it for yourself, if you're interested. It's a oneshot, if that means anything to you one way or the other.

*** It was pretty good in the battle department but I am with you on the questioning of the quality +1/2

The ship is not one I read but I won't despise them,so that's +0 (if it was bad it would have been -1 point)

And I also don't read many one shots but this is one I did and it was worthwhile so +1

The thing with one shots is that it's not allowed to be too good or you get left craving more that you can't have and I personally hate that feeling, but this wasn't one of those so +1

Total of 3/5 points which is pretty good for a oneshot imo

  The saying "opposites attract" is proven true when two very different people come together, despite their own (token) protests. Long-ish one-shot, heavy AU. Super!Harry, kinda (it's not really relevant, it's just kinda there). Basically my answer to Harry/Draco shipping: Harry/Draco's more worthwhile twin sister. Footnotes! Terrible summary, but such is life, yes?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded; Time, Mr Potter?) both have some awesome fight scenes. In the Third Key, the two that stand out to me are the Durmstrang battle and the prison escape. Time, Mr Potter has a bunch of really strong battles, but I think the strongest are the Hogwarts Express duel and the final battle. Cheers
