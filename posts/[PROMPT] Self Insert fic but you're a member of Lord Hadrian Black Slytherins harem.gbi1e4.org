He stared into your soul, with those Avada Kedavra orbs. "Miss..."

"Y/N" you say breathlessly.

"Ah, Miss Y/N, a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I would tell you my name...but you" he flicked his long, luscious locks behind his shoulder, "already know."

You cringed, hating to disagree with this weird, yet oddly articulate, eleven year old who sounded like he hadn't even hit puberty yet. "I... Actually don't." you say, somewhat apologetically. "Care to introduce yourself?"

Ronald Weasely groaned besides you. "Why'd you have go and ask him? Now he's going to-"

"Ronald Weaslebee," the child glared haughtily at the redhead."Just because you're jealous of a slimy Slytherin and you're dirt poor doesn't mean-"

Ron whispered next to me "He's mad, Y/N mate. He hasn't been the same ever since the goblins told him that-"

Whatever Ron was about to say was cut off by the child saying.

"But that is neither here, nor there. Please to meet you, Lady Y/N. My name is Lord Hadrian," Well, that wasn't so bad, you thought. But it seemed that the pompous child was just taking a breath. "Lord Hadrian Black Emrys Merlin Slytherin Ravenclaw Potter Charlus Prince Malfoy Gryffindoor Orion. But, a fair young lady as yourself," he bent down to kiss your hand, which you very hastily retracted and cleaned with bleach, "Can have the honour of calling me Lord Hadrian Black Emrys Merlin Slytherin Ravenclaw Potter Charlus Prince Malfoy."

Next to him, several girls including Ginny Weasley swooned in jealousy.

You decided that you needed to speak to Dumbledore. This was... Absurd. "Um, sir, would you please direct me to the headmasters office?" there was no /way/ you were saying that mouthful.

Lord Hadrians orbs glowed like twin emeralds. "How dare you ask for Bumbledorkpork! And not address me by my correct status! You shall pay!" Hermione Granger, Susan Bones, Luna Lovegood and Daphne Greengrass started to comfort their Lord.

You shuddered. He was eleven! You didn't need to see /this/!

Ron patted you on the shoulder ,"It's okay mate, I know how you feel, I know."

God, at least there was /one/ sane person here.

So you'll get "Umbrus Shade" and similar ones. And the Author plays it /completely straight/.

**** Self-inserts in the HP fandom are pretty rare because the average person would not be able to do much when everyone else has magic and they don't.

They are way more popular in, for example, the Game of Thrones fandom, where a person from the 21st century could achieve a lot with just basic school knowledge. Mass Effect would be another example, because cybernetic augmentations are a thing, everyone carries around a supercomputer and plot knowledge would get you pretty far.

** "Professor Dumbledore! What the hell is going on?" You shouted as you ran into his office. If he was perturbed by your sudden presence, he didn't let on.

"I'm afraid, miss..." "Y/N" "Miss Y/N, by the way what kind of name is /that/, that the universe is experiencing something called 'narrative instability'."

"Narrative... Are you telling me that all this," you gestured around yourself, "is fictional?"

"Not as such, miss Y/N. Our universe very much exists in reality, but there is some sort of entity outside of it which has the ability to alter it. When the Ministry detected this alteration, they created a small taskforce of people which must not be named, or else they can be altered too. It appears that this outside entity is not omniscient, which is why people were chosen who had the lowest likelyhood of being known to this entity."

"Why do you trust me with this?"

"That is where our first successes come in. The first thing we did was create an artifact, a sort of 'stability charm', that would prevent narrative alterations to our identities, personalities or souls. Our second invention was a detector of sorts that could map out alterations. So far, we have identified Hadrian as the focal point."

"So he's what, a protagonist?"

"Of sorts, yes. The entity seems to focus on him, and he has had the largest amount of alterations to his being. I'm afraid the quiet, kind boy he once was is no more."

"And what about me? Why do you trust me?"

"Our detector has determined that you appear to also be somewhat immune to the alterations, but not entirely. In fact, there was a large burst when Hadrian spoke to you for the first time, and yet you were almost completely unchanged. This leads me to believe you are perhaps of similar origins as this strange outsider."

He walks around his desk with a very intent look, and you try to back away, but the door has already been sealed.

"You must be careful. Here, take this charm, it is the one all our members wear. It will protect you if and when your own protection vanishes, as it appears to be doing right about now. Don't say anything. Don't move after putting on the charm. It is focusing on us."

You quickly hurry and clasp the chain behind your neck, before falling to your knees. You had a /name/? You were... you were from somewhere else...

**** I've been toying of writing a fic which features a narrative battle between a SI and a different SI for some time now.

However, it's very, very hard, as I have to essentially make up two people, both of which are authors, then create two inserts based on their fictional personalities and different writing styles for both.

Then, I need to build the gameboard - the HP universe, of course. Unaltered. I'd need to map out which changes the first author would make, then which changes the other author would make. Interactions between the two.

Then, I'd need a plotline for both, and a plan for how they collide.

I'd of course need to map out the plotline overboard, which combines the two on a meta level, and serves as my reference guide.

Then I'd need to write the thing.

It's a complex process.

** You enter into the Headmaster's Office, so frustrated that you barely notice all the gizmos and artifacts there.

"Professor Dumbledore, I- we need your help"

"Please child, be calm, what is the problem?" he raised his hands in a calming gesture, though by the look of his eyes you guess he already knows.

"There's some-some kid downstairs with some twenty surnames saying he's a Lord and walking like a pimp"

Dumbledore's eyebrows rise to his forehead "A pimp?"

"He-he has all these rings on his fingers and is surrounded by girls, and he's eleven"

The Headmaster merely nodded, a resigned look on his face "Ah, you met young Harry"

"But he said his name was Hadrian"

Dumbledore sighed deeply and nodded again, removing his glasses and massaging the bridge of his nose.

"Mr. Potter visited Gringotts under the counsel of his friends and discovered he comes from a noble line" he sighed and looked at you "sadly the goblins failed to impart on him the important difference between being a descendant or part of a line and being it's heir, or maybe they just played a prank on him" he looked at one of the portraits to the side "though he seems to have added even more names, among them the title of Emrys, the name of the one who had that title, Merlin, and his grandfather's first name, Charlus"

You are thoroughly confused "But-why, and what about all the girls? They are his age"

"Ah, the foolishness of youth."

You just stand there gaping before recomposing yourself.

"And I thought he was a Gryffindor? He's dressed like a Slytherin"

The Headmaster just grimaced before rising from his chair.

"And he is, but after he returned he ambushed young Mr. Malfoy and stole his robes along with the password of the Dungeons, saying there was no way he could be a dumb lion or some other such nonsense, I thought we had settled the situation but from what you said he did it again"

He straightened his robes "Now if you excuse me, I need to put an end to this, while once again being called a manipulative old man who only wants to steal his fortune and separate him from his true loves, notwithstanding the fact that I have no need for gold nor do I care with who he has a relationship with" he indicated the beautiful bird on the perch "Now please, stay here with Fawkes, the undoubtedly Light and immortal being I seem to have somehow slaved for my evil ambitions"

Fawkes /snorted/

As he left, you caught him bitterly murmuring "/Greater Good/, as if"
