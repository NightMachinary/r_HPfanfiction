TL;DR: No super powered Harry, NO super intelligent Harry, NO perfect Hermione, NO Weasley bashing.

So; I'm going to come out and say it, I do not like Harry with Hermione.

For several different reasons:

The first reason is that I see Harry and Hermione as brother/sister, as they get older, I see them becoming close, and him talking to things he can't talk to Ron about. But, I can put that aside, if the pairing is written well; which I've tried a few out of curiosity, and they just aren't to me.

Harry normally ends up super OP or super intelligent. I don't want him changed too much, slightly smarter or slightly more powerful, but not an insane amount. No as powerful as Dumbledore, and no even smarter then Hermione.

2: Hermione is often made as absolutely perfect in these stories. I love Hermione, I really do, but Hermione being seen as nothing but perfect, making no mistakes or anything, gets annoying, I don't want that in the story.

3: If Harry and Hermione end up together the Weasley's end up getting bashed. Yes I can see Ron and Ginny being upset, but knowing them, I can also see them getting over their hurt feelings and staying friends with Harry and Hermione.

I DO NOT want Weasley bashing. No Ron, no Ginny, no Molly, et cetra; no Weasley bashing AT ALL. Them moping in the story is perfectly fine and understandable, but I don't want them to stop being Harry and Hermione's friends ALL through out the story. If they need to take a little break away from them, that's perfectly fine, but I want them to be friends with Harry and Hermione by the end of the story.

If anyone can find any stories that handle what I want (or don't want), please let me know.

Note I'm also okay with Het/Slash/Femslash, for any background pairings or whatever, just to have you know.

Can be on fanfiction.net or another site.

Edit: The pairing can be in the background, as long as it fits what I'm looking for.


** I don't really understand the brother/sister thing. They don't really act like brother and sister at any point. He says that to Ron to try to emphasize he isn't trying to steal her, but I mean, he's never had a sibling, he doesn't really do any sibling-like things with her... like compare Ron/Ginny to Harry/Hermione. There's really no similarity at all.

I understand the criticism that she treats Ron and Harry like her kids. That's kind of a generic flaw of hers, that she kind of takes responsibility for controlling the behavior of others because she believes she knows best. (exemplified by the firebolt situation) But I have two sisters and neither of them were anywhere near as involved in my life as Hermione is in Harry's.

A much better criticism is that Harry's actually kind of a shit friend. We don't know Hermione's parents names, her birthday is never mentioned in canon, we literally don't know anything about her life outside of Hogwarts, because Harry doesn't care. He has never asked her anything about herself on the page, or think about what presents to get her, and she gets him thoughtful presents every birthday and christmas. (Most of this applies to Ron as well, ie Harry is a shit friend to both of them)

I like reading Harmony because it generally involves Harry starting to treat Hermione like he likes her. It's another thing like noticing Dumbledore was irresponsible or that wizarding economics makes no sense; I don't just want more canon, I want canon+, and that means Harry learns to appreciate Hermione, which lends itself to romance.

*** I think it is safe to assume that Harry did actually do all the things to be a good friend but it just wasn't mentioned. Don't forget that the books are written from Harry's point of view and that those events while they are interesting aren't relevant to the plot

** As a foreground? The best I know of is Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

The characters feel very cannon-like. Ron has a falling out with Hermione (but not Harry) for reasons that make perfect sense (Hermione isn't as forgiving at Ron's behavior of her being champion as Harry was), and Harry/Hermione happens in a pretty natural way (Hermione's relatively unpopularity and inability of Krum to interfear leaves her dateless, so professor kitty plays matchmaker).

I'm also partial to Escape ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape]] ), but I have to admit it doesn't really have the best Harry/Hermione (neither goes through very many flaws). Honestly, I like it mostly because of the secondary characters. Percy, The Grangers, The Twins, Snape, Remus, McGonagall all have great characterizations. Some of my favorite Grangers.

There are a whole lot that have it as more of a background thing. A Little Child shall lead them is fun, Stages of Hope kinda has broken harry and hermione leaning on each other. Grains of Sand has Harry/Tonks with a potential for Harry/Hermione/Tonks (it was going that way)

​

Edit: Shorts/one-shots are an entirely different catagory.

***** Sorry, I thought I was clear, Escape is my guilty pleasure h/hr fic that I enjoy even though it has those flaws.

And it doesn't really have Weasley bashing, except for in that Harry/Hermione's negative character traits are removed/glossed over while Ron's are not, so he looks bad in comparison. I would say Ron is more in character than Harry or Hermione in it.

Part of what I thought was done well in that fic was the Weasley family Dynamics...

****** Ron, in this fic is just a dim-witted blind Dumbledore follower, and molly, is also a blind Dumbledore follower but add that she actually thinks of muggles as less than wizards, so much as to brush off Percy's girlfriend as worthless.

For no reason only a handful(probably the authors favor characters, like the weasley twins for example) are now immune/wise up to Dumbledores manipulations.

And hermione's mom for some reason is the only one who can put Dumbledore in his place?

Mom fic imo, I personally didn't enjoy it and the "harmony" is stale and bland.

******* Exactly. Harry and Hermione don't tell him that they're bailing, contact everyone else for help but him, then expect him not to be angry at them.

My (partial) review for chapter 53:

Insensitivity aside, Ron is in the right here. If they offered him a spot and he refused, that's one thing. But they never gave him a chance. And contacting the twins rather than him? Why couldn't they give him a mirror?

******* Eh, he certainly was written out of the story. But him handling being cut out poorly isn't exactly out of character, and it didn't escalate to comically bad overreactions. It isn't a positive portrayal, but he isn't some kind of mini death eater in training or pampas jerk.

I really just read it as a write out and the author doing the minimal needed to do so. They don't take him into the story, when he confronts him about it he acts jealous and then feels bad afterwords. Extent of the story for Ron.

This wouldn't be the story I would suggest if you want a good Ron characterization, but I also wouldn't say if you are sick to death of Ron and Dumbledore somehow becoming criminal masterminds jerking harry around, you need to avoid this fic.

**** From your other post looking for lesser known characters: Escape has a crazy good Percy, and then the writer wrote a sort of sequel/spin off fic "Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley", which shows how well that character was received.

He doesn't come in till the end (last 1/4) though.

***** Oh thank you! I added Percy, but yeah, I was just looking for any minor characters. Though I do have a strange fondness for Percy, since he doesn't really get written much, and there's so much you can do with him.

** Anyone who is curious about or who loves harmony should definitely read

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]]

Post hogwarts, angsty, does a great job of keeping everyone in character and no bashing. It starts after the epilogue, without the common, (oh I've loved you since xxx, I only married the Weasley because xxx) trope. unfinished but oh so sweet. Even though it stands abandoned I still say its the best harmony fic out there.

If it doesn't sell you idk what will because although harmony is 100% my otp, and I don't really read anything else, it's a trope-filled, wish-fulfillment, bashing, mess out there.

Good fics without a focus on romance, also no bashing, and in character.
