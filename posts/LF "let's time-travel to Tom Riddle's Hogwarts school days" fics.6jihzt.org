Preferably fics without a Harry/Tom pairing, and no slash in general


** Whelp, if you read the vent post about this very topic, you know what I'm recommending.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.

** I posted this in another thread :

Most of them are Volmione, not Tomione : LadyMiya, Nerys, SerpentInRed, uchiha.s, Lunalelle, sharkdiver1980, ObsidianPen, Speechwriter, Winterblume, HarmonyB, larissalee, and Shan84. Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. LadyMiya is my personal favorite, especially Shared Flame (Volmione). For Tomione, Tied for Last has already been recommended, so I'd say Ultima Ratio by Winterblume : [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/420124/chapters/700131]] Another poster is right, more often than not their relationship is full on abusive and some authors portray it as if it's normal. I personally prefer fics where Hermione is older, so it's often Volmione. I love when she fights back and they end up in a relationship that has defaults, but there's a common understanding of the way things are, and Voldemort ends up respecting her. Another one I love is Blood and Gold, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517]] , it's new and the updates are relatively regular. It's the first time I find a good HG/TR fic where Hermione doesn't go back in time to go to school with Riddle, they're both a bit older and for now it looks very interesting. EDIT : and how could I have forgotten The Scientist by uchiha.s ?! It's a no magic AU, Hermione is in law school and Tom is her teacher. It's seriously one of the best fics I have ever read of this pairing, but it's very AU and very different from some common characterization of Tom. But he's still a "bad"guy with dubious morals and such. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7499274/1/The-Scientist]]

A few of these authors have time travel fics, notably Winterblume, Shan84, sharkdiver, SerpentInRed, and possibly Nerys. I tend to mix things up in my memories so it might not be exact, but at least you have some names to search for ! Most of them are on AO3, and some are on both AO3 and ffn. I think uchiha.s is only on ffn.
