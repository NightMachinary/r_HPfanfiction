Basically what the title says. I'm looking for examples of stories that rework the magic system or world to be... better basically.

Also a discussion about what that would look like to you guys.

Personally (as a language enthusiast) I think it would be cool if the wizards all spoke a different language, since they've been isolated from the muggles for hundreds of years. Not everyone else's first thought though so I can understand why it's not a thing.


** Perhaps not a totally different language since so many of them live/intermarry with muggles but perhaps a different dialect, or even something as simple as different accents.

I feel like a true representation of a magical community that separated from the mundane community hundreds of years ago and still retains the trappings of medieval/early modern society (like castles, robes, and ideas of blood and class supremacy) would be much less whimsical than the world we actually got. Not to say that everyone would be drab and morose because that wouldn't be accurate either but I feel like canon basically has the magical world adopt the same general morals/attitudes of the muggle world. I think an intentionally isolated society would definitely develop a different set of societal principles.

Now that I mention it, it would be quite interesting to have the magical world be portrayed in a story as the strict, “moral” society that views the muggles with their modern viewpoints as degenerates. It would flip the situation that once existed between them almost on its head. Imagine a Voldemort who is just as power hungry and amoral as canon but operates within the confines of pre-modern society and justifies his views not based only on blood supremacy but on the “proof” that muggles must be controlled because look what they've done to their own world; we can't let them influence our own like that.

Would certainly be different. Now I'm imagining Voldemort and the DE as a magical Claud Frollo and I kind of like it.

** In my story "Patron", the wizarding World split from the muggle world in 1692 and developed independently. Wizarding Britain is, in part, more progressive than muggle Britain - they consider the muggles prudes - but in other parts more archaic (they have a caste system. Custom has softened the caste divisions, but it's still there). And the wizards use magic much more than in canon, and follow a pagan religion with their own rituals. Other countries have different cultures - the story visits Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, France, Jamaica and Scandinavia.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
