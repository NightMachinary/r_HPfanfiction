Looking for a fic where Harry studies some of the more obscure magic, like spell creation, warding, enchanting, wandlore, ect.

Preferably over 70k words.


** linkffn(Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold)

Tons of obscure magic...lots of OC's... Honestly it turns into a completely original novel that reminds you that this main character used to be Harry Potter every now and then.

but in a good way
