Preferably long, no romance (if that's not an option, then please no slash). Bonus if it's a solitary Harry.


** I wasn't able to get into Basilisk-Born, but I have seen it recommended as similar to linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh). Fem!Harry. Unfortunately seems to be on hiatus.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(Strange Visitors from Another Century) -- WIP with all three of HHR going back to the founders' era. Hasn't updated in a while, but I don't think it's fully abandoned because the most recent chapter came out of nowhere after a fairly long wait, so I'm willing to be patient and let the author work on it. (But even if they don't, there's lots of fairly obvious foreshadowing about what direction things are going in, so it's easy to fill in the blanks yourself.)

#+begin_quote
  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.
