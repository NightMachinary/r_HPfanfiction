** Wouldn't that only work if they knew Harry for a long time before sorting?

Or do you mean they get lost in Hogwarts and /literally/ end up in the middle of Slytherin Common Room? XD

*** No I mean like they are sorted into Slytherin

All though Draco's face would be funny if they ended up in the middle of Slytherin common room

**** "Ron, move your foot! You are standing on my toes!"

"Where? I cannot move, the Cloak is slipping off already!" grumped ginger to his Accomplice in Crime.

Harry Potter took off from Gryffindor tower just before curfew. Very suspicious indeed. Hermione went to fetch Invisibility Cloak (that she ingeniusly, borrowed before from her unsuspecting friend/target.) And now she and Ron were following at the safe distance.

Harry turned left sharply. They hurried after him. No one noticed the one brick, laying undisturbed and innocent, just got triggered.

A trapdoor opened under their feet.

Cue Draco Malfoy deer-in-the-headlights face when their Secret Slytherin Slideâ„¢ in the ceiling opens and /two screaming Gryffindors/ land in the middle of Common Room.

***** /The Slytherin Slide of Secrets has been opened. The enemies of the heir... Beware/

Also it's ambigeus if Harry knows about the spying or trapdoor or is just his usual adorable oblivious self :3

I know that is not what you looked for but that's what you got xD

** First year Ron's greatest desire is to outshine his brothers and stand alone. I think the only thing that kept him out of Slytherin is the fact that he's intellectually lazy. A Ron who was cunning enough to _pretend_ to be Harry's friend on the train might well tip the balance back the other way making Ron the first Weasley in Slytherin, just as Sirius was the first Black in Gryffindor. So this wouldn't be all that unbelievably AU as a premise.

I do not think it would work very well though. Hermione wouldn't be included in the plan - there is no indication that she and Harry would tolerate each other until the Troll. And Ron is sorted after Harry. Would Harry and Ron remain friends if sorted into different houses? Especially if you keep Harry in Gryffindor, I suspect Dumbledore's plans would go sideways rather quickly.

*** While Ron wasn't ever some intellectual giant I personally disagree with the idea of him being lazy so much beyond the norm. He is a 11 years-old, normal kids are more interested in hanging out with friends, playing games and reading only for entertainment, not on schoolwork (which they see as something invented with the sole porpoise of boring then out of their minds) or on accumulating unreasonable amounts of power (either magical, economic or political). Personally I feel that changing Harry's character to become like this defeats the idea of having him still be a kid, having him figure out some magic earlier and lash out against his abusers is one thing, but most times the story goes beyond any semblance of reason.

** Were they evil by then though? It is likelier that dumbledore manipulated them through their hogwarts years and turned them on harry circa 5th year in my opinion.
