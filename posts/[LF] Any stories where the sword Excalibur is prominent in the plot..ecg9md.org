** Euh...well in my time travel fic the Sword of Gryffindor /is/ Excalibur (including historical explanation), but it holds no centre stage in the story so I don't think you'll be interested.

Yes it is a Snape/Lily story so I completely understand if it's something you'd rather not get into. It's also on AO3 if you prefer that platform.

** As I remember it's the key element in "Angelica" (by author of the "Forever Knight"): [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056]]

** If I remember correctly, it's prominent in The Labyrinth, part 4 (really book 3) of Crow Rides A Pale Horse, which is still WIP. A long chapter or two about once a month. Since it's ongoing, it's hard to say how it will be important to the plot later, but it has already been hugely important to Harry. I can't say more without spoilers, just that I'm anxiously awaiting this fic to be complete!

Book 1 begins with The Boys of Crowhill

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

** Pretty prominent in Basilisk Born by ebenbild.

Basilisk born is a really nice story, but it has flaws that keep it from reaching its full potential
