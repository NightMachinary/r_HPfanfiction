** Not a rec/suggestion, so much as an agreement with the sentiment you seem to be exhibiting, but...

I really never understood the logic allegedly supporting the idea that people would go along with something like a 'marriage law'

It's never struck me as being terribly enforceable from a legal standpoint because anyone who wasn't gung-ho for it just... leaves. If you're preventing them from leaving it stops being a fic about a marriage law and starts being a fic about border controls.

Am I missing some key aspect of the genre?

People's lust for romance coupled with not actually having enough experience with romance to be able to tell when it's good and when it's bad, or alternatively coupled with them not caring at all. Basically a “virgins write porn” kind of thing.

*********** For one, I'm talking in general rather than about the specifics. But yes, you are right, it would have to be both done and explained properly, it's just that the job would be an author's and not mine.

For two, I am not relating it to the marriage law or anything like that, just adding to the idea of a border control story that this branch of comments derailed itself to. So whatever whoever would write, I do acknowledge that they would have to think up a good reason for this, yes, and a marriage law would not count, but you talking about it makes me think that you /might/ be perceiving me as someone who would try to justify nobody getting abroad with such a law taking place when really it couldn't be further from the truth and I wanted to make that clear.

And for three, ignoring the fact that the whole camping trip in the last book was ... not the best thing ever, they only really moved in the country so the issue of border control is moot there. I mean, yes, I have no doubt that on the continent border control would be much more difficult and that even with moving from (or to) Great Britain to (or from) the outside it would require quite some resources to be spent, but for as long as you aren't actively searching for them in a way that leaves the target with no ability to move onto the areas you had already scoured through, it's much, much easier to find someone trying to cross borders than it is to find them in just some area if they don't want to be found. And in any case, we don't know because the last books had failed, scope-wise, to show the big conflict that this was supposed to be.

So yeah, it really does depend.

*** I have no idea, either, as I can't speak for everyone, but from my personal experience, I was /really/ into marriage law fics when I was about 14-15 years old. Something about the idea of a taboo relationship with an older man combined with the angst of being forced to do something unwanted by a Cruel Higher Authority really spoke to my whiny teenaged self. It certainly didn't matter at all that the whole concept is illogical. I never wrote one, but I read so many I forgot for a while that it wasn't an idea with any basis in canon. Now I'm 28, and I regret the time lost, as I no longer understand the appeal.

the part where arranged marriages was the norm for vast majority of human history in many places on the globe and things got along just fine without any mass exodus. (see majority of our civilization up to last few centuries)

Also the part where 'average citizen' is sometimes both attentive and patriotic enough that the government's justification for extreme measures is accepted by majority despite those measures being a huge pain in the ass.

Again something that happened quite a few times in human history. (eg: Soviet Union lasted 80 years, and the shit they demanded their people to put up with, makes arranged marriage look like a minor inconvenience. Took 3 generations for patriotism to wear off enough for that to fall apart)

Also arranged marriage isn't dungheap material. It's a useful tool for society under certain conditions. When those conditions re-emerge, the tool is used again - eg. see Japan.

([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage]] - see Late Marriage section and the supporting sources. Funnily enough that was also a country that has long discontinued this tradition but than a population crisis + conditions created by modern society is bringing the practice back)

People have in the past and are right now letting themselves 'be raped' (as you insist on putting it) to save themselves from things like that for as long as humans existed and people born on that particular island aren't special in that regard.

by the way - your premise of 'save such a society' is yet another example of a mindset accustomed to the privilege of modern convenience. So easy to move around the world nowadays, isn't it?

"If things start to really suck over here, that's not MY problem, because I can awlays say 'fuck this society' and go elsewhere"

I think the big complaint is that since most marriage law fics seem to be about smooshing two characters together as fast as possible... we never see those conditions portrayed in a reasonable manner.

Worse, I think the logic is somewhat flawed in that wizards marrying and having kids with other wizards isn't the most practical way to increase your population... Weasleys aside. Wizards knocking up muggles so that you get a whole slew of halfbloods would make more sense... I think? It would double the number of people making babies, and the various students with one muggle parent would seem to indicate that the resulting offspring would be magical.

It was also written not long after the invasion of Iraq and institution of the Patriot Act -- not to mention during the prison abuse scandals of Spring 2004 -- and is chock full of political frustration, and examination of and commentary on those matters as well as more general Social issues such as Reproductive Rights and Marriage. Therefore, caveat lector: if you like Romance and more escapist fare, this is probably far too gritty for your taste.

I understand that forced marriage isn't optimal for happiness, but people seem to seriously overhype the bad factors and the likelyhood of bad outcomes.

Significant portions of the globe had people living for centuries practicing various forms of arranged marriages and it wasn't *that bad*.

I get that arranged marriage is a worse option vs picking your own mate, but to the people who harp on it and expect it to aboslutely fail miserably - our civilization literally grew on this concept for centuries and society still advanced into modern era without falling apart.

*** Arranged marriages are contracts and agreements made between individual families and people, and they often work out well.

Marriage Laws, however, are a totally different beast: they are enacted by governments to force couple together against their will, and in many cases enforced by the police (aurors). They are nothing but government sanctioned rapes, and an abuse of power in the worst form. Even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't go that far (although marriages in Maoist China often required party approvals).

**** the epoch of human history that was Feudal and than Monarchy revolved around the 'government' forcing couples to marry for the interest of said government and the system functioned for centuries. Those types of marriage form a rather big bridge between your definition of 'arranged marriage' and 'marriage law', considering that rather frequently the interests of the couple being wed were of little concern to anyone.

It happened in real life and people went along with it, it can happen in fiction.

Marriage Law fics are just another example of fiction revolving on idea of 'extreme solution to extreme problem' - any attempt to evaluate the concept out of the context of said 'extreme problem' is ignoring the premise on which it's built.

Those countries didn't go that far because they had no need to. They definitely could have though.

**** 1. Freedom to choose? I'm not sure we know what marriage and courtship customs are like in canon. We assume that they are much like muggle Britain, but we have few examples to work from - almsot everyone is already married when we see them, so we don't know what steps were taken to get to that point. The only examples we get to see anything of are the Weasleys, who are well-established as different from most purebloods, and the Tonks family, who are also different.

We don't know if divorce is permitted or not, or how easy it is if permitted. We don't know if prenuptial agreements are common, necessary, or what. We don't know if there are required counseling sessions. We don't know if magic might create some extra problems that muggles never have to deal with.

On top of that, even if there is at least some freedom to choose, at least among the non-aristocracy, we don't know if that's a relatively recent development or not. So it could exist, but long-lived wizards and witches might not yet have a deep attachment to it. If it were established anywhere in the last two centuries, I could believe that people's attachment to it would be weak.

1. Civil war? I'm not sure how much of the canon population actively fought - and even those who didn't like Voldemort didn't necessarily object to a restrictive government coming in afterwards. How many of those who didn't like Voldemort, but kept their heads down out of fear, would be willing to accept restrictions that didn't affect them much personally so long as the government was promising that those restrictions were part of keeping everyone safe and preserving their way of life? My guess would be: a depressingly large number.

And muggelborn? They would have the deepest commitment to being free to choose whom they'd marry as well as the strongest passion for fighting against a restrictive government, no matter who was in charge. But how many of them are there? Precious few in Hogwarts, as far as we know. Mabye that's a tragic consequence of the previous war, or maybe it's the norm. If the latter is the case, then there won't be many muggleborn in the community to lead a charge against oppressive marriage laws.

All of these unknowns create a perfectly acceptable foundation for a story about marriage laws. That doesn't mean that it would be easy to write such a story well, just that such a plot idea isn't coming completely out of nowhere and with absolutely no precedence or basis in reality.

It's just another example of playing in the large, empty spaces of what Rowling left unsaid in her books.

***** I'd say that as long as you have Harry, Ron and Hermione, the heroes of the war against Voldemort, you have enough to topple any government in Wizarding Britain, especially if you take their fame and reputation into account. You need a lot of changes to their history and characters to make them accept a marriage law. and even if tehy didn't raise their wands in rebellion, you'd Need even more changes to make them actually marry whoever the law says they have to, instead of leaving, plausible.

Wizards, due to their individual power, make for poor "trapped in an arranged marriage, but learning to love the Partner I was forced onto" stories. Unlike female "protagonists" in bodice-rippers.

That's probably true, but as in the muggle world, there's a difference between making a change and keeping a change. That's why your story was effective - it showed them doing one of the only things which would likely cause deep, widespread changes to stick quickly.

Short of something that drastic, they might be able to use their fame to force proponents of such a law to back down, but that wouldn't change the underlying culture any time soon. They could keep using their fame to make others back down every time something awful comes up, but that would lose effectiveness over time. And if they didn't have enough popular support to change the system peacefully, from within (by "change" I mean the awful things stop being proposed), the question they'd have to ask themselves is: why are we beating ourselves up trying to save this society?

You can win a violent revolution with a smaller number of committed fighters, then pull in support from those who are willing to accept any government that keeps them warm and safe. Non-violent shifts in political and social culture will need a larger base of support to push back against centuries of inertia. So absent the revolution you described, and without the large base of support for peaceful change, I imagine that they'd find a way to leave. Harry especially doesn't have deep, personal ties to Britain.

The question why people do not simply leave Britain for greener pastures is a problem for many plots, including the canon one. One answer could be that the other countries are not better than Britain - though by the time the death camps start up, that tends to wear thin.

Well, even in the muggle world, people don't change countries very often or easily. It's no minor thing.

Granted, there are ways that it would be easier for witches and wizards, but only up to a point. Packing and travel are the things that are probably easiest, and they are the initial barrier that everyone thinks about. But what about when they get there? Will they be able to get a job? Will they be able to find housing? How will the locals view a foreigner? I won't even get into language issues.

Other magical governments and communities might be wonderful, but they may not be very welcoming towards immigrants - especially those who just pop into the middle of the street! :)

Then there are the intangible things that tie people to their home country - things that make it hard for someone to give up on entirely. I can't see the Weasleys, Longbottoms, or many others being able to leave Britain so easily.

But that's what makes questions about Harry and Hermione leaving especially important - they aren't like the others! Neither have deep ties to magical Britain, and Harry's ties to muggle Britain are just as poor. Both could manage in the muggle world, so wouldn't need to worry about magical restrictions if they are worse than the muggle ones. And after the way Sirius and Remus have been treated, I can see them supporting a move (more so than Molly, Arthur, or any of the other adults).

Most 14/15yo kids don't think about such things, though. Even just the prospect of moving out of their home would be rather daunting, never mind picking up and leaving the country. It's realistic that they wouldn't explore that option, but it's such a terrifying threat to those who need those kids to stay that it's too interesting to ignore. :)

Let government assigning the partner is the big no-no, and will either lead to revolution or mass exodus. Unfortunately, this type of marriage laws is the predominant one in HP fandom, often written by people who either have issues or no idea how the world works.

  We're talking about a society where a big part of the population was raised in the western world, with all the freedom to choose that entails.
#+end_quote

are we actually though? because the source material gives us next to nothing about Wizarding society outside of school and if we judge things by the general era of development that we do see (things like Wizarding Britain being so small, there being only 2 news sources mentioned in the books, the relatively clumsy bureaucratic apparatus, having only one major bank) than the closest we could link that with our real history would actually put that society well into the territory of archaic practices like arranged marriages being the norm.

as an additional point of contention:

Also people from the western world keep looking at ides like that from the perspective of those who have never know true danger to their entire way of life being just gone - and from that perspective any extreme measure is automatically rejected in favor of personal freedoms and liberty...

But that is not the perspective that would be shared by people who are seriously looking slow extinction in the face. (which is the premise of most such stories)

I grew up in Soviet Union in the 80s where the whole patriotism thing was dying out already. But even glimpsing the last vestiges of it, it's really easy for me to understand how a population can be convinced to do some really extreme self-sacrifices "for the cause" when the right amounts of obvious necessity aligns with a few receptive mindsets.

Think of it this way - everyone looks at muggleborns in the books and say things like "Well a strong young woman like Hermione, who is product of our society (despite her being basically out of it since age 11) will surely just tell that idea to fuck off..."

That expectations ignores things like the fact that muggleborns like her would:

a) Be seriously aware of how soul-crushingly MUNDANE a world without magic truly is and how important it would be to preserve a magical society

b) Be just as aware that extinctions of a species isn't just a possibility - its the default fate of vast majority of species that has ever existed

c) be aware that without magical society to back them up, they are seriously lost in the Mundane world - even a smart girl like Hermione isn't going to be accomplishing much if she drops out of magical society considering she has been out school since age 11, learning medieval alchemy and astrology. Which means they will be really invested in the world on which they have bet everything not just dying out.

And as for you point about them fighting a civil war and that affecting their reactions:

- first they really haven't if we go by the books - that wasn't a "war", there is literally a single major combat that happens over the entire course of it

- second, putting one's life on the line to save a country also makes one really invested in that country not dying out despite everything you saw sacrificed for it. So their 'civil war' experience would actually make them more likely to support sacrificial ideas like a eugenic program than they otherwise would be - especially if it's framed as "if you don't, Voldermort ends up winning anyway. Instead of ruling our society, he just destroyed it and and everyone who died, died for nothing"

To reiterate, people have been sacrificing themselves to arranged marriages for the good of their family and country for centuries - that capability to put something else over one's own potential happiness isn't something that the human race just lost. The modern world just doesn't tend to require that sort of sacrifice from us - that doesn't mean people lost the strength of will to make such a sacrifice if they think it's necessary.

edit: to support my last point, remember that Soviet Union - a regime that has demanded the most self-sacrifice out of their population than any other - was born out of a revolution and it is in fact that public wave of opinion created by that revolution that made Soviet Union possible to exist. So we have a case in real history that exactly fits scenario of "everyone fought a war for their lives and than sacrificed (or gave up, considering there was plenty of opposition) all said rights for an ideal, en-masse". It wasn't smooth and more than a million of suspected dissident were executed in the aftermath - but even with that clumsy and inept handling, the change still happened.

So in light of that real event, a few thousand young, impressionable people being convinced to give Arranged Marriage a try isn't nearly as unlikely or doomed to fail as most people first think.

***** I disdagree completely. According to canon, muggleborns are a significant part of the population. The idea that they let themselves get raped just to preserve a culture that demands that is insane.

Hermione especially has shown that she'd not give a damn about Magical Britain's norms if they do not correspond to western democratic ideals. She stood up against the enture school and endured ridicule for her SPEW campaign, for example. She also stood and fought the worst Dark Lord of Britain. She'd not sacrifice her ideals to protect an inhuman, evil system just because "it's magic".

A society that's willing to have children raped to save itself has already lsot all right to be saved.

you are interpreting the premise in the worst possible way. If it was implemented it certainly wouldn't be done as 'lets rape kids' - to assume so is to try to build a strawman argument.

as for Hermione - you are talking about a girl who mind-wiped her parents 'For The Greater Good' and forcibly relocated them to another continent. She sacrifices ideals just fine when she thinks it's justified.

If arranged marriage laws come about, she will likely be the one front and center supporting them if she thinks that is what it will take to save/fix this society.

"an inhuman, evil system" - that may be your head-canon, but it's not everyone's and definitely not that of canonical characters. If they considered the British Wizarding world to be such a system, they wouldn't stick around to fight for it. They have, which indicates they see its value and are invested in preserving/saving it.
