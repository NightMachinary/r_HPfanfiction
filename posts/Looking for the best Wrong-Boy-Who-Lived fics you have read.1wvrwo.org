As per title. No particular preferences for other story elements.


** "Unsung Hero" was pretty good. I'm currently reading "Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King" which has been... weird.

*** /Unsung Hero/ has arguably the most disappointing ending I've ever encountered, to be honest. I won't spoil it, but anyone wishing to read and enjoy the resolution should definitely stop shy of the last chapter.

***** For the most part. The final chapter has the feel of a contrivance tacked on just to make a sequel happen.

Rather than give a spoiler, imagine if the Epilogue to the main series were replaced by a resurrected Bellatrix showing up at the train station and hitting Harry, Ginny, and his kids in the back with a Killing Curse. The fates intervene and then tell Harry, "Guess what--you get to go back in time and do it all again, but this time we'll make it even harder!" That's about the level of satisfaction one gets from the ending.

  Sequel to UH. Harry finds himself standing on the edge of a dark and dangerous precipice with only partial knowledge of how he got there. Will he become the leader he is meant to be or fail like he did once before? Possible long waits between chapters.

** Seconding [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived]] is the other one I would recommend.

*** Seconding this. More chapters are available in the Work By Author thread on darklordpotter.net (membership needed to read).

Pity it's abandoned.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4417534/1/Darkness-Falls-Upon-Us][Darkness Falls Upon Us]] also doubles as a darkHarky! story if you have any interest in that. In this story Neville was named the Boy-Who-Lived not Harry who was left to be raised in an orphanage by the Dursleys. I feel like mentioning that any semblance of cannon is thrown out in this story Neville is very arrogant when he shows up and Harry is vastly different because of the orphanage among other changes made through out the story.

*** Love that series! Everyone who dislikes that series has told me it was because they were irritated that no one saw what Harry was going through as abuse and that he was just powerful and didn't have flaws. And I'm always just like "You didn't read through the books did you? It was seen as abuse. And Harry had a million different flaws because of it."

**** Yep. Or they didn't like the pairing, which some people don't like hpdm, so I get that. I'm not the biggest fan of it either. But the things that I really like about the series are much more numerous than the things I dislike. And I always loved that Harry was powerful, but he really had to fight bigger battles because of it / had to fight for the power.

***** Exactly!!! It's not the typical powerful Harry! He has to fight it and learn to adapt to coming into that power. Oh, and the author was so detailed when it came to talking about customs, tradition, light vs. dark, and I loved how they actually built the relationship with characters !!! Especially Lucius and Narcissa.

****** Mhm, definitely! Lucius and Narcissa were amazing. and yeah, the culture and the traditions... like even the whole courtship thing was so cool. And I don't usually go for that sort of thing, lol.
