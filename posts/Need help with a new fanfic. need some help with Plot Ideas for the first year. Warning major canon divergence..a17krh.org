** It seems kinda ridiculous that you have a warning for "gore and graphic depictions of injuries" in a T rated story. Either the rating is off, or the description. And judging by the first chapter, it is the rating.

Orphanages aren't really a thing in the UK in the 90s.

So after skimming over the story I would recommend turning the existing chapters into some kind of prologue and then jump back in whenever you want to set your main plot. First/Second year arcs are not really interesting either way, so you might as well skip to the part where your protagonists are grown up a little. You should be able to explain whatever happened in between within a couple of paragraphs.

...really? I mean, I think we're /all/ sick of the Troll, but I like the Philosopher's Stone plot fine if something's done with it, and similarly Diarymort can be a great villain.

**** But you are severely limited by the age of the cast, both regarding maturity and combat ability. You could probably make something interesting out of both main plots, but not if you keep the ages. Most of the basic spells (stunner, shield) are taught after the second year, with the disarming charm being the exception in the middle of the second year.

I mean, even after a year with fake Moody most of the DA were not proficient with the basics, and that was in their 4th year or later.

***** For me, I will be using the prologue book to develop the charachters

***** Sure, but not every fic has to be about dueling. The basically-agreed-upon jettisoning-of-realistic-11-y-o-behavior is enough to get interesting /character/-driven plots.

*** Thank you for the comment, I am wanting to use first year as a foundation for the changes to the universe. And I am wanting to combine first second and third years as a prologue book more or less. Similar to a prequel before the story really starts off in fourth year

**** Don't write a separate prequel. Keeping everything together gets you more attention, at least on FFN, where you cannot create a series.
