I don't remember much of it at all to be honest, just one specific scene in the story. It's post war if I'm not mistaken and Tom did something so Harry sent a howler to him in school. Then Tom obviously had to open the howler, and it was calm voice. Harry said something before he started to narrate "The Talk". That's all I remembered. Does it ring a bell for anyone?


** I think I know exactly which one you mean. Tom's deaged in the final battle and Harry adopts him. When he gets to Hogwarts, a friend of his starts calling him "Your Lordship" and at graduation he gives a speech? I've been trying to find it, but it may be deleted. I'll have to try to look deeper tonight when I have time.

*** Idk about your lordship but yes now that you say; it's post-war. And his friends didn't think he was serious about giving the talk using a howler. XD

**** I've combed through all my favourite fics and it's not there. Either I didn't favourite it - which I doubt very much - or it was deleted. Sorry I couldn't be of help.
