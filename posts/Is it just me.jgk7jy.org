Or is anyone else sick of the fucking boring Dumbledore and weasly bashing that goes on, like I get it to some extent Dumbledore needs to be criticized in fics but I am fucking sick of him wanting all of Harry's money or some other ridiculous shit. It's just fucking annoying to read.


** I mean, I don't find it annoying. Just a little saddening. There's just so much more interesting stuff you can do with a Full-Villainous Dumbledore that "I stole your money 'cuz reasons" can't help but pale a little in comparison.

**** Same feeling about that type of Dumbledore, too. There's still that sad feeling of "Oh, he could've been so much more!" to it for me.

I mean, imagine if Harry'd gone up against Dumbledore, been surprised to find it incredibly easy (where Dumbledore is more of an annoyance than a threat), and then slowly had it revealed over the course of the story that the man'd been suffering with some kind of magical disease for decades and due to the myth and his general whimsy, nobody had noticed until Harry destroyed his life and brought the house of cards tumbling down.

Or if he'd found out that Dumbledore had been suborned by a Horcrux and was being puppeted around as he tried to fight off its influence.

Either way, you turn an annoyance into a tragic figure and really get some good use out of that version of Dumbledore's character.

***** Alternatively, maybe Dumbledore actually had a valid reason for having to use Harry's money (instead of basically throwing it at people who like him and buying himself a metric ton of useless junk). For example, if he is either too closely observed to steal from his positions (which don't have great salaries), but needs the money to buy information about Horcruxes or other esoteric magical knowledge that enables him to equate Voldemort on a fight.

He would be filled with guilt over it and possibly not only be as upfront as possible with Harry about it, but also try to compensate the boy by making sure to give him all lucrative investments possible and hiring lawyers to sue the hide out of anyone who uses Harry's image without paying a large amount in royalties, plus leaving all the things that he /did/ buy with Harry's money (which he couldn't have others learn from since it would take a firm theoretical grounding that only he and Voldemort have to understand without investing years or even decades of study on) back to Harry in his last will and testament. Maybe even throw in some extra bits that he got in his academic career, like a book he got from Flamel or some particularly unique object he enchanted himself (like the desluminator he gave Ron, or even his pensive) that he thinks Harry would appreciate.

Yeah, he would still be stealing from an orphan (which is reprovable no matter the circumstances), but it would be a much more interesting characterization than the one of him being an unidimensional villain who steals only for the sheer pleasure of being an asshole.

****** Precisely. There's so much more potential to a Dumbledore like this than just 'steals fur the lulz'. With a bit of thought and prep, there's so many different hows and whys to explore that'd add so much more depth to him.

Plus, it fits Dumbledore's character as well, 'cause there's no way that guy wasn't absolutely /mired/ in guilt.

*** Donald Trump is President of the United States of America, holder of the most powerful office in the world, and bills the taxpayer [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-has-paid-rates-as-high-as-650-a-night-for-rooms-at-trumps-properties/2020/02/06/7f27a7c6-3ec5-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html][a shitload of money]] for the rooms for the Secret Service agents protecting his sorry butt. Other less notable world leaders routinely fall for corruption - other far right authoritarians, self-proclaimed "communists", Islamist revolutionaries, general royalty/warlords, such "fine" examples of democratic politicians as Olmert and Netanyahu, and then the bureaucracy apparatus.

Corruption is everywhere, especially at the highest levels, and the more money is up for grabs, the more people will be interested in getting a slice of the pie. Especially when the victim is absolutely clueless and unlikely to ever find out, as Harry is - with his parents dead and his godfather in wizard hell-jail.

*** I work in taxes and I've learned having prestigious jobs does not equal being good with money. Some of the most intelligent people I meet make incredibly bad money choices üò¨

I'm not defending the trope, just that his jobs and prestige aren't why he wouldn't be tempted to steal money. I think that kind of thing comes down to morals. I always liked this quote:

** I mean. There are new people taking their steps into the HP fandom all the time. New writers, old writers who haven't been in the HP fandom before. Maybe someone took a break and returned. It's not like popular ideas and tropes die out - new people discover them, like 'em, and use 'em. Some do it well, others do not.

And I do see a theme with people recomending the same popular stories where these tropes and prelevant and naturally writers see this and do the same thing. Someone asks for recs and I promise there's at least ten common ones that always makes an appearance despite it having been /years/ since they were completed. Dumbledore/Weasley/etc bashing tend to be pretty popular in fics from some ten years ago.

** I won't say I don't like a little old Dumbledore bashing but I agree with you that sometimes people take it so far it gets cartoonish in a very boring way. Most of the time this cartoonish bashing is to hide the lack of an interesting plot, because they write Dumbledore in a way that is not even evil, just dumb.

** I always find it upsetting.

He killed Grindelwald his lover (almost positive thats canon) and went against the believs he had as a young man because he was a good man.

He had faults but JK had to make them so that the plot of Harry Potter could even be made.

The traps in book one, knowlage about the basilisk and Sirius to name a few.

And i think people take too much advantage of that.
