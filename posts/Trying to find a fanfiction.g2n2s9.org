:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find an old fanfiction that I read once. What I can remember is that Harry traveled to a different universe where his parents were alive and that universe's Harry was an asshole. That universe's Harry hates werewolfs. Also Siri's and Remus were married and adopted a werewolf child together that was in the same year as both Harrys. If any one know it, I would love to be able to read it again.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
