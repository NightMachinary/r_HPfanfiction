Im looking for Harry as a ravenclaw where he takes little Luna under his wing and protects her from bullies, and perhaps fulfils a sort of big brother role.

Extra points for smart Harry, takes no crap from Snape Harry, etc

Puff Harry welcome as well in a pinch. Just no slyt or gryff Harry


** It doesn't exactly fit your requirements but The Merging by Shaydrall features a Harry who is very protective of Luna. Harry is still in Gryffindor but his Characterization is excellent and the story is very compelling. It's up there in terms of one of my favorite fanfictions ever. Give it a shot you won't be disappointed!

** It gets... weird, but linkffn(11669575) features a smart, Ravenclaw Harry who takes ZERO shit from Snape (or anyone else). Luna shows up Harry's second year, right on schedule.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** What year is the fic currently in? I'm fairly interested in reading it but I really can't stand fics that spend 200k+ words on each year of school.
