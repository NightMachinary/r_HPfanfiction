So recently I started to reread the series. As I'm going through book 1 I began to wonder what if Dudley got a Hogwarts letter too. So HP fans I'm sure these fics exist! I would like it if Harry and Dudley eventually became friends and no character bashing. Thanks!


** linkffn(Magical Relations) is the best fic I've read with this premise.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone linkffn(9662175) is good and has a sequel. Sequel hasn't updated in over a year though.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

** Just started reading linkffn(Bad Press by AshaMerc) and was pretty pleased with it. Wasn't a huge fan of Magical Relations

Edit:Sigh. Should have seen that coming, always risky putting just the title without an author

  Despite the Dursley's best efforts, they are unable to stamp the freakishness out of Harry Potter. Much to their horror, the dreaded Hogwarts letter comes for Harry...and their son as well. What will happen when Dudley goes to Hogwarts with Harry Potter, intent on telling the wizarding world how terrible their saviour truly is?

** So I want to plug a fic that I think deserves a lot more love but doesn't fit completely with your request. linkffn(7129525) it's a fun fic about Dudley while he and the elder Dursleys were living at an Order safehouse during the last book. It shows a somewhat realistic change of heart for both Dudley and Petunia accepting magic. It sort of plays loose with the magic in it. It also shoehorns in a relationship a bit and throws in major-ish characters like Stan Lee cameos (quick in and quick out just for appearances without much relevance to the plot). Still a good fic to read if you want more 'Dudley accepts magic' stories.

  When Dudley Dursley and his parents are forced to spend a year with-gasp!- witches and wizards, Dudley decides this is the opportunity to learn more about his apparently famous cousin. Potterwatch, tall tales and magic, oh my! Rating changed for safety...

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
