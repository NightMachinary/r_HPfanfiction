**** I generally don't read Marauder stories set in Hogwarts, unfortunately :c I'm actually a bit picky with my Snape/Lily overall, because I prefer it remaining unrequited (unless it's an AU like this one).

***** Yeah, it sounds good so far. It has me captivated. I am doing myself a disservice by sticking to Snape/Lily and Snape/Hermione ( I KNOW ... I know... Don't pelt me with olives!!) there are a lot of great authors out there that I should give a try. I would be interested to read some fics that follow JKR's style more closely (ie Harry, Herm., Ron fics) most of the stuff I have read is post Hoggy warts/ au.

***** Pssh!! No, I don't like this, I /refuse/ to like this fic.

... Ok. Yeah, I do. /whines/ And I don't even /like/ James/Lily..... Guess I do now? Actually I am more amused at seeing how some of the other pairings came to be. Well, maybe not more, but anyway. I like that they don't make Snape out to be a complete ass(yet, anyway) So far, I think this author has done an excellent job portraying all the characters. ( I could stand to see more Remus though) Thanks again for the rec!!

** I've rec'd this before, but The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][Snape Chronicles]] is an excellent story. I highly recommend it.

This fanfic is a beautifully vivid look into what Snape's life /must/ have been like. It is extremely canon-compatible, so it doesn't ship Snape/Lily. Essentially, it is Snape's life from birth until death, like the books were written from Snape's point of view - except that it starts far before Harry is born. Naturally, the author took some liberties with his childhood, since we don't know much from JKR about his childhood, but it is well, extremely well, written. I would go as far to say that this story /becomes/ Snape's canon childhood for me. The relationships that Snape /does/ have (we know they are few and far between) are done wonderfully. This is one of my favorite fanfic portrayals of Dumbledore, as well.

This is a wonderful, wonderful piece of literature. I laughed and cried, and learned more than I ever knew there was to know about Snape. It is completed.

**** Oh god, I love this story so much. (: It's an emotional read for me, so I have to start it with caution. I fully intend to re-read it soon, though.

***** I will finish it, I just needed a break. There are a few other things that I took issue with. I think In his early Hogwarts years, this fic makes Snape seem like he is completely the victim and I really don't think that was what Rowling was going for with his character. Yes, I think he was a loner and picked on quite a bit, but I think he did provoke it more often than this author seems to think. Otherwise, Jk would have made him a more sympathetic character. I understand this is just this fic authors interpretation, but people have said they have gotten to the point where they take this fic as cannon and it just doesn't seem to be that spot on to me, so far. I will keep going though. Maybe it will grow on me more.
