I've kind of decided to start writing serious and plot filled smut fics over the last two weeks. I don't have space in my update schedule for something new right now, but I'd like to be mulling and developing my next several stories as I finish up the ones I've already started.

So, what are some of the smut story plot bunnies that you've thought of or seen done that you'd like to see an author attempt as a serious story?


** A realistically done Harry gets powers from shagging witches fic.

By this, I mean your standard find out that Harry's only shot of defeating Voldemort is to sleep with as many witches as possible, that's it is more powerful the more he knows the women in question, both sides need to have an orgasm for it to work, and there are significant diminishing returns to each 'event'

All the characters remain true to canon. Ginny is insanely awkward around Harry and worried about the impact this will have on their relationship, Hermione is saddened by the notion of losing her virginity to someone she doesn't truly love, Luna has relationship and emotional issues, Fleur is in a happy and committed relationship with no real attraction to Harry, Tonks loves Lupin, Mrs Weasley sees him as a son, the teachers are completely sickened by the notion of sleeping with a student, all are very much worried about the impact it will have on their existing relationships.

Harry isn't a sex god, he isn't that attractive and is entirely new to sex. The pressure, the nature of the relationships, mean he has to fail 8 out of the first ten times and on an ongoing basis, have a less than 50% success record.

Nonetheless, they are aware Dumbledore is dying and don't know about Horcruxes, meaning they genuinely believe this is the only way to defeat Voldemort. None of them look forwards to it, none want to do it, and this reluctance creates real problems.

Add into that, the impact on the male characters. Ron's anger at Harry sleeping with his sister, love interest, etc. Lupin's confused reaction to Tonks, the like.

...

I'm aware it's a weird kink.

  A realistically done Harry gets powers from shagging witches fic.
#+end_quote

I read this first sentence, and I came up with the beginnings of an idea:

- Magic sourced from the power of love is some of the most powerful magic possible.\\
- Parental love is one valid form of this, but sexual love, that intermingling between trust and comfort in the vulnerability of 'bedroom activites', is also valid.\\
- Using a ritual to tap into this form of love power, Harry can weave powerful charms of protection and good fortune in order to stand against Voldemort's magic.\\
- Molly Weasley knows this form of magic well; it's how she beat Bellatrix Lestrange, she stored up a ton of power whilst shagging Arthur like a bunny.\\
- In order to succeed in this path, Harry not only must boink every witch (and maybe a few wizards) in Hogwarts, he must also ensure it's the best sex they've ever had (not literally, but close).

...Why am I coming up with plot justifications for 'Harry bangs everyone'?

**** Makes me think of my next story that will be posted: *Just Magic*

#+begin_quote
  When Fleur asked for Harry's help with a bit of magic that is fairly rare, Harry thought she was playing a joke on him at first. He'd never heard about sex-powered spells in school... granted, that didn't seem like something they would teach there. But Fleur had insisted that it was just magic, nothing more. Well, just sex and magic, nothing more. Nothing more...

** Harry getting seduced by an older student/women and just being in for the ride. I don't remember a single one of these stories where Harry doesn't flip a mental switch at some point and becomes the dominant one, even if he used to be a virgin until a couple seconds ago. The resulting relationship would certainly have an imbalance of power, but they can certainly work out long-term (see the French President Macron) and would give Harry a new perspective on many of his problems. Or simply loads of hot sex.

* Prime candidates for this role would be:

- Andromeda Tonks post-war. She should be between 42 and 47 at that point, so not some frail grandmother fanfic usually turns her into. She isn't too old to be Teddy's mother, so you could throw in some motherly stuff in there (lactation and age-kinks, but please no baby-ing). For example, after graduating from Hogwarts, Harry moves in with her to help raising Teddy, there is some tension, both are horny and have not had sex in a long time (or even never in Harry's case if you want to go down that route), things escalate further. The possible conflict here could be lacking acceptance due to the age difference and the fact that Andromeda already has a grandson or simply the general opinion that Harry deserves "better". Maybe even some drama because Hermione supports Harry's decision and that causes a whole lot of conflict with the Weasleys.

- Narcissa Malfoy. The mum of your school rival wants to spite him/his father and who would be better suited for that than Harry?

* Honourable mentions:

- Nymphadora Tonks: That one has been done countless times (myself included), but the metamorphic abilities alone make that one interesting. Add Polyjuice and a morphed cock for even more kinky stuff with (temporary) fem Harry going through a whole lot of new "firsts". Put a teenager in that position and he would be permanently ruined for anyone in his age group. Add some sneaking into Hogwarts stuff and secret dates (or maybe wingman Hermione), and you have some unique plot right there.

- One of the Gryffindor Chasers: There are plenty of situations where Harry could use some relief or distraction, especially in books 4-6 (although 6 only has Katie Bell).

- One of the female professors which are pretty much name-only. You can write them reasonably young and attractive and get off the idea of seducing the famous Harry Potter.

- The Holyhead Harpies. The stereotypical male fantasy of a hot, all-female sports team with nice uniforms and athletic players. Possible settings would be Slughorn's Christmas party or some postwar gala

** Harry x fem!Riddle.

The diary permanently takes over Ginny's body absorbing some of her memories and traits. She's horrified at what her older self has become, and attaches herself to Harry because he's the only one who knows her true identity and she feels lost in time.

Harry hates her because she killed Ginny, but eventually accepts that she's different from Voldemort at her age. He doesn't tell the Weasleys because it would destroy their family, and feels obliged to keep an eye on her so she doesn't revert to her old ways.

Fast forward a few years and cue lots of angry sex.

If someone writes this, I'll, uh... upvote you really hard.

Or make up some soulmagic shenanigans that let her live, but that wouldn't be as impactful.

*Edit: I'm imagining Ginny's funeral: everyone's crying, and Harry just wants to scream that they're burying Riddle, not Ginny, but knows no one would believe him. After the ceremony, he comes up to her gravestone to carve a symbol into it as tangible proof of her existence, and says he'll always treasure the short few years they had together.

******** Ideally, the culture would improve, but given that the magical community is long lived and well set in their ways of 'it ain't broke, we're not fixing it' (yes, intentionally left out the 'if'); so there is a chance that similar issues would exist for him to take advantage of: Voldemort championed blood purity because it brought followers, not because he, as a half-blood, thought blood purity equaled strength and status.

There's also the element of now being forgotten and thus an unknown (we're assuming between a century and several, so that is possible for him to have become a footnote in history class if something else has happened since). He would surely take things cautiously, biding his time to build himself back up as a threat if he had the means to act on his own after being 'freed'.

This is why I suggested the notion of mutilation and crippling of the petrified prisoner. Morally wrong? Yes, but it could be argued setting up a wolf to be released in a pen of sheep who have grown up without knowing what a wolf even is for generations would be also a terrible thing. It also would help prevent him from recruiting, I'd hope, since I'd include his voice box, tongue and or lower jaw in the amputations. Hard for a mute inchworm to convince people he's something worth following, after all.

** To be honest, doesn't even have to have smut in it, just needs to exist. A Harry/FemNeville or the reverse, a femHarry/Neville. A femNeville probably would have a completely different personality simply because she wouldn't be compared so much, by Augusta, as her father, so maybe she wouldn't have as much confidence issues as canon Neville has. Which could make her a better friend to Harry, actually, Neville is already a great friend, but she would've been a bit more assertive and have a closer bond, leading to eventual romance.

The opposite might be nice, a femHarry that resonates with Neville because of both being orphans and living up to their parent's image with maybe a Snape being the "rescuer" from the Dursleys (without a GG Dumbledore, I abhor this trope. If you wanna make Dumbledore a bad guy, do him a bad guy, not incompetent, which he never was in canon. If you wanna making someone redeemable, present him with choices to redeem himself in your story. Otherwise, stick with canon, or make him an actual grandfather figure as he is portraid in canon, albeit a manipulative one.) and develops both a mentor and a parent figure for her, while also imposing her to act similar to her mother, considering he would've been the one know Lily best.

** Hmm...I have a vague concept of 'Remus Lupin's needing to be caged every full moon (when he doesn't have Wolfsbane Potion) leads to him finding comfort in BDSM outside the full moon', but I don't know how it could be written into a story. Who would he share this other secret with? How would he go about ethically exploring his fetish whilst teaching at a boarding school? How could he be comforted by a bondage fetish when his life comes under heavy scrutiny for being a werewolf and he has a friend who was wrongly imprisoned?

** "A boy and his cloak" - Harry, under his cloak, walks in on Hermione masturbating in the Grimmauld library and doesn't realise it at first. She accuses him of spying on her, but they resolve things the next day (with some pleading on Harry's part). Then they get even (Hermione gets to see Harry naked), which leaves both of them horny and they resolve that issue eventually (oral and fingering/HJ).

It is perhaps the best "in character" smut with more to it than just "let's fuck". It could certainly be turned into a character-driven piece which focuses on how Harry deals with the 5th year stress and a growing relationship.

****** It is a very good story because no one is OOC. If you can capture the same spirit, write a spinoff.

Maybe with a slightly different setting, like Hermione giving Harry the talk because no one else has and/or wants to, or maybe Harry defending Hermione when Ron shows "the emotional range of a teaspoon" and saying something like "She is definitely kissable" and things escalate from there on.

My only wish would be a lack of the common friends to lover tropes, so no endless debates if they are in a relationship, no declarations of love followed by one party fleeing and no catalyst for the realisation (like seeing Hermione in a pretty dress or valentines day as trigger).

I'm intrigued by the kind of story that you're talking about. Actually, it sort of reminds me of Rtnwriter's Two Little Words which I'm beta-reading for him as well.

EDIT: Sorry, removed the link for violating Rule 5.

I think I could definitely work in some kind of story that much more simple/light-hearted in its treatment of the friends -> lovers storyline.

******** The angsty, drama focused "friends to lovers" thing has been done to death, but the lighthearted approach is hard to find.

Nearly all have declarations of undying love before they even kiss, or some drama about the tag they put on the relationships. But I'd love to read a story where, for example, Hermione is fussing over the scars from Harry's latest Umbridge detention, he plays with her hair and suddenly simply has the urge to kiss her. And then he does just that, without even thinking about it. And instead of the awkward "are we going out now?" bullshit that spans two pages, how about a simple invitation on a date? And the "I love you"s are exchanged when Harry has some post orgasmic clarity while holding his "friend" tightly, and not with some grandious gesture involving a truckload of roses and the Imperial German Crown jewels.

  In third year, Hermione Granger is rapidly succumbing to the stress of her workload, worry for her best friend, and the secrets she's been keeping from him. The night before the Christmas Holidays begin, Harry corners her in the common room, late at night, and demands to know what's wrong. In the end, two little words will send her on a journey of self discovery as she finds a new way of life, free of doubt and worry. The only questions that remain are, will Harry be the man she needs him to be? And will they be up to the challenges that lie ahead of them both?

** I actually wrote a couple versions of a story where Harry becomes an incubus at a young age and has to deal with the new urges of his body.

One version gave incubi a pocket dimension that Harry lived in after running from the Dursleys and from where he could be summoned by wizards who wanted to make deals with a demon. He ended up getting summoned by, sleeping with, and accidentally befreinding Narcissa Malfoy.

The other one had Harry become an absurdly powerful psychic, able to read and finely manipulate the thoughts and perceptions of huge numbers of people around him. In this one, he couldn't make himself look normal, so he had to manipulate people's minds out of necessity to hide himself. This one had Harry sleep with Sirius, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. It also had James Potter secretly having been the devil who'd been taking a break from being evil and legitimately fell in love with Lily; thus, unlike mosy demons, Harry had enough free will to chose to be good.

Both stories had lots of sex... not great sex, because that's some of my earliest smut ever, but they had sex. 🙂

** I would honestly welcome just about anything extremely well-written, spanning multiple books within a series, involving multiple plot-lines in addition to a main storyline, none of which are purely there to sustain and/or justify the romance or the sex but which blend perfectly with it, that has an extreme amount of smut of the most depraved variety.

In short, smut written with taste, interwoven with a real story that you would genuinely praise and admire without any of it.

It's rare that we see art depict this part of our lives realistically and well. It seems to always devolve into a sort of caricature. Smutless literature is innocent in the extreme, either avoiding or obscuring this part of human reality; smut literature seems to avoid or obscure anything that doesn't have to do with sex directly, it lacks nuance and depth and is almost always simplistic and bland in the extreme because of it. Bring these two worlds together somehow, and you will not only be writing a fan fic, I honestly believe you will have created something so unique and extraordinary, that people will want to read it from all walks of life, even those who haven't even heard of Harry Potter, let alone read the fan fiction surrounding it(given that you do it well, of course, which may well be extremely difficult to do).

It's like what I often think of the perfect porn film. Something just as entertaining as a regular, popular movie, just as well made, with a very good script, cast, director, and so on, but with real porn in it. This is not a reality today because of the moral constraints of society in this regard. That will undoubtedly change in the future, but I see no reason why books, which involve no other people than the writer themselves, can't achieve what the medium of film won't.

Worry about how each sentence, paragraph, chapter and part(and book in the case of a series) stand on their own, as well as together. Worry about their purpose, meaning, clarity, fluidity, evolution, beauty and raptness.

But to worry about something so insignificant as whether the introductory phase is too long is completely besides the point in my opinion. It is rather what you do with it that matters.
