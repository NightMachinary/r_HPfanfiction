Hey i'm looking for fanfictions where Harry Potter is Evil/ Cruel and somewhat similiar to Tom Riddle or Gellert Grindelwald also he must support the Dark Side not the light side and atleast hate muggles if there aren't any good fanfics meeting the requirements mentioned, Where he also hates Mudbloods (Muggleborns) Or believe in Pureblood Supremacy/ Superiority (Blood Purity) I also want Harry to use Dark and Black Magic And Unforgivable curses are a plus too. (Avada Kedavra And Crucio is cool)


** There is linkao3(The Bone Man) Short but good

  Harry Potter disappears from the Hogwarts Express at the end of his fifth year. The Light thinks he is dead. They're right, in a way, but also so very, very wrong. What has the boy who was once Harry Potter become?

** Linkffn(Too Young to Die) he is not really interested in politics or in trying to rule the world, but he is definitely evil and while not outright racist he has moments where he boosts of his superiority because of being a Potter and at some point in the beginning he says that he is almost a pureblood.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
