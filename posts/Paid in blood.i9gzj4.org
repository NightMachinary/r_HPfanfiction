Hello everyone, i hope i post it under the right one. I wanted to reread the story paid in blood once again, but when i start looking for it, it says story not found and the writer Zaterra22 took all his stories (paid in blood, the potters, sly and gryf enz.) of fanfiction.net. any idea if these ever come back? Because i realy liked the reading of them
