I feel like that was a bit of an extreme thing to do, you know? I mean I understand, there are a lot of supporters of or relations to the death eaters in that house. But seriously, they could have all died because they were sent to the dungeons instead of evacuated with the rest due to a /single student/ not wanting to participate, they're still students! Still children! I mean they can't all have been evil, could they?

If you know of any short fics or one-shots, please comment them. I need a read.

Edit: In the book, they were evacuated, but I still think kicking them out was a bit harsh.


** That's a movie error. In the book, they were evacuated just like the other houses.

**** What actually happened was that she asked all of age volunteers to remain, and the rest to evacuate house by house. I don't remember the exact quote, but all of slytherin left, a few Ravenclaws stayed, a significant number of Hufflepuffs, and nearly half of Gryffindor.

The movie really screwed it up, but in the books, Slytherins were given the chance to fight for the schools if they wanted.

**** I think its a perfectly reasonable emergency response. You don't have the hours required to interview every single Slytherin about their allegiance, so you just send all of them away to make sure.

The books are pretty black and white there, though. I'd think there would have been enough opportunists in other houses as well that could sabotage a defense, but I guess that is where your suspense of disbelief needs to work the extra hour.

***** That's kind of exactly the point. Who had the time to figure out allegiances right before commencing battle?

Some people in Slytherin are good people. Some people in the other houses are bad people.

But, statistically, most of them are in Slytherin. The strategic thing to do would be to eliminate them from the battle.

What else could have been done besides letting them go home while planning for a battle? And everyone under age was sent home. Those who were of age could leave if they wanted.

That's what any sensible person does during a war, get the children out of the line of fire. Thousands of children were sent out to the countryside during the bombing campaings of WW2 to do exactly that.

*** This is the best point. Almost all of them were legally children and McGonagall was getting all the children out of the battle. She didn't care about House allegiances. Some of the other houses had students sneakily stay behind, and we know that some Slytherins did too (Draco, Crabbe and Goyle).

They are--at best--perceived to at least be supportive of the enemy, therefore they *must* go. It doesn't matter if one or twenty secretly support you and there isn't time to investigate each one to determine their true loyalties.

Kicking them out may be harsh (Honestly, though, screw their feelings: people will die today.), but it also means that one of them can't drop you from behind while you're focused on the enemy in front of you.

** I mean, McGonagall was the one at Hogwarts this whole time during Voldemort's reign and Snape's and Carrows' reign at Hogwarts. I think somewhere it mentioned there was basically a return of the Inquisitive Squad and the Carrows were teaching dark magic to students and having them practice by torturing "troublemakers". So McGonagall would probably know who are the shitty, torturing, dark magic users and if the majority of them are Slytherin then it makes sense to get them out of the way.

** I know it is not exactly what you are looking for but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12392763/1/The-Other-Champion][The Other Campion]] by Srikanth1808 is a great fic, where the Slytherins get a bit more credit.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/][The Changeling]] by Annerb.

They are both longer than a short fic and definetly not one shots but still worth the read. They do diverge from canon quite a bit to achieve this (Slytherin in the final battle) though.

** contrapoint: Maye not harsh enough. By sending them away instead of holding them hostage against their death eater families they gave away a huge bargain chip... But that would be an evil thing to do right?
