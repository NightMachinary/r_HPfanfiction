** This won't be the best organized input. I'll just write as I read here.

- I would remove the (secondary idea) parentheses. Stylistically, it could work in some aspects, but I feel it's off when written in a third person POV

- "Piss off, Malfoy" was Ron's eloquent reply.

I would rephrase. Grammatically it could work, but I would simplify it and just go with: "Piss off, Malfoy," said Ron.

There's some other areas where you miss the punctuation in terms of dialogue. Look up tags and when to use the comma and when to use the period. Either way, there should always be some form of punctuation on a dialogue tag. Also, try to avoid the temptation of Draco sneering all the time :)

Overall, some good passages of writing there. I don't know if it's your first ever fanfic, but if it is, it's a good start. My first story was much worse. Work on some of the grammar and dialogue tags. That was your weakest point. Speaking more of the story, I think you need a stronger first chapter. I liked the in media res introduction. You did well not to just have exposition dumps all over the place. I always emphasize a strong first chapter as it is difficult to keep the readers for long if the story isn't interesting. That's not to say you need a lot of action or anything else like that, but you do need a hook. I can sense where it's going, but it didn't really draw me in immediately.

Keep on writing!

** I like the idea I'm getting so far, although you'll have to be careful to keep it unique. And I hope it doesn't turn into another super Harry story.

Not very many grammar errors but there are definitely a few; "Whatever force held the other two in misery, keeping him in his own dreams", for example.

+One thing I'm pretty sure you got wrong is /Rennervate/, which canonically is /Ennervate/.+ - Huh, nevermind.

Let me know if you want a beta.

*** Definitely not going to become a super Harry, I'm not very fond of those stories myself.

The offer of a beta is very much appreciated, though I don't exactly know how that works.

**** Great!

Basically you just send me drafts and I help edit them before you post them. It's good to have multiple pairs of eyes on every piece of writing.

*** Just checking my PDF of Half-Blood Prince and it says 'Rennervate'. I think that was a correction from any earlier editions due to 'enervate' having the common definition of 'to weaken'.

** It seems like a good start so far. I'd like to warn you about a common failing: we're dealing with children here. You're dangerously close to writing the characters far more self-aware than any thirteen year old is. For instance: Ron could already pinpoint the source of his inferiority complex and describe it. He's thirteen, it would more likely be "god I hate this! stupid $@#$ing brothers!" - not morose contemplation.

Also, the tone of the first chapter is decidedly dark in nature - the descriptions of the weather at the end give it a very cold feel. That's quite a risky opening gambit for a story, most ones start with a more neutral vibe.

Other than that, the other comments covered just about everything.

** Haven't read the chapter yet, but you should get a cover image. Just a stock image of a werewolf or something if you don't feel like making something. Personally it makes me much more likely to click on a story or read one.

** I'd shorten the Malfoy encounter. Writing him in a canon-esque way makes it look like you're bashing him, and there's no real point in repeating that sort of interaction. Or just skip the encounter entirely.

I generally either omit Malfoy or change him greatly to be more of a politician-to-be.

*** Canon Draco is one of the characters that gets the harshest treatment by JKR.

It's not bashing when it comes to him - it's his canon character. He's an arrogant, racist, entitled, and overall spoiled little shit. Only Snape (Jew who metaphorically killed Jesus and feasts on the blood of children), Crabbe and Goyle (dumb and dumber) get treated worse. Even Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort get more credit from JKR.

Draco doesn't get much redemption (as opposed to Snape, who dedicated his life to Dumbledore's plan, and Crabbe and Goyle who got none). He tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle from killing Harry, didn't identify Harry to Bellatrix (purposefully? or was Hermione just that good?) and was not able to bring himself to murder Dumbledore. People tend to forgive him because of the many parallels to James Potter and Sirius Black, but there is no evidence he has any of their good features. As opposed to them, he treats his friends as minions (CoS), yet has more restraint as he doesn't "hex people for fun" (quoting Remus Lupin) but rather tries to get his victims in trouble.

That being said, a lot of fan fiction shows him to actually be a decent guy. It's possible. But still, giving him the JKR treatment can't be seen as bashing, because that's the JKR treatment. He serves an important point in the books: the "lesser evil".

**** Sure. It just seems like the Malfoys should be old money and political power and prowess, but they end up looking thuggish instead. Not just with Draco's insults, but with the fisticuffs in Flourish & Blotts.

***** I agree that JKR could have done more with the Malfoys, but Harry never got a chance to see that side of them. Just like we didn't get to see Snape's covert ops, the Order's skirmishes, and so on. As far as we know, all of the Order of the Phoenix do is just sit down and enjoy Molly's cooking and /plot/, come to where Snape tells them, and treat Snape like a pariah. Harry's perspective skews a lot of the perceptions of canon.

****** We see a decent amount of Draco Malfoy, and it's not good. We see less of Lucius Malfoy, and that's also not good. My complaints are not solely that they are missing appropriate behavior, but that they are committing acts that are unbecoming of their station.

It is possible that Draco Malfoy is a model pureblood future politician, suave and persuasive and cunning, every second he's not being observed by Harry Potter. It's possible, but it doesn't seem terribly likely.

******* Draco is a spoiled little shit, but then again a lot of children from influential families are and end up in positions of power and know how to handle them. We only know how he acts around Harry though. The same with Sirius, Snape, and especially Dumbledore.

Dumbledore for instance flat out lied to Harry in PS/SS, but ensured Harry would never think well of Snape... yet seems so nice and understanding. I didn't even think about the consequences of that lie until my second read through (Snape hated James because James saved his life??! Is there a way to make Snape sound worse to an eleven year old?). We can see that as already planning for Voldemort's return with ruthless opportunism, or a bumbling lie because he was caught off guard. This is just a hint of how things are different behind the scenes than they are from canon perspective.

Sirius and Remus for instance lie or twist the truth (Snape was jealous of James because of quidditch, hung out with Bellatrix at school, etc), act irresponsibly (Sirius goading Harry to break rules, Remus putting students at risk by not disclosing facts about Sirius who was a suspected mass murdering death eater), yet seem so awesome. Snape on the other hand is a foul git at all times, yet is Dumbledore's confidant far more than expected (the reveal of their interactions during the Prince's Tale).

Draco does not get this much attention, and we don't see his other sides nearly as much. Lucius even less. Narcissa is rather awesome from what we see of her (using Bellatrix to improve her negotiating position with Snape to save Draco), but again we do not see her enough to make an opinion as to who she actually is. Therefore they are prime real-estate for development ;)
