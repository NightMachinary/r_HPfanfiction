Hi everyone!

I'm looking for Draco Malfoy fics because I'm getting more interested in the character lately. I don't dislike him, but I wouldn't say I like him either. But since reading the “It's tea time“ series by ellizablue, I'm intrigued.

Mostly I want to get to know the character better. He has potential, but I've only read fics with characterization of him I did not agree with because it completely ignores cannon. I dislike OOC fics. I don't mind if he slowly changes over time (obviously, or I wouldn't be reading fanfiction) because I like good character development, but not OOC right from the start.

I seem to tolerate him more in the post-war fics, because I really like Scorpius (only really good thing to come out of Cursed Child) and I can't help but think he must have been an amazing father to raise someone like Scorpius.

I'm open to every idea, every AU, every genre, every ship. I always like a good time travel sorry too!

Anyone know a good fic?


** Exile is a post-war canon-compliant fic where Draco is forced to not use magic for a few years.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Not epilogue compliant (therefore no Scorpius) and it takes place ~10-15 years after the war. Was very pleasantly surprised with this fic as slash isn't often my cup of tea. Warning: he is sort of OOC at the start, but you do learn how he got there as the story progresses.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** I just finished a Dramione fic in which I put a great deal of effort into making everyone pretty similar to canon, since it bugs me when he's written as this sweet, caring dreamboat straight out of Hogwarts. Draco's an unrepentant arsehole at the start and Hermione genuinely hates him. Post war but not epilogue compliant.
