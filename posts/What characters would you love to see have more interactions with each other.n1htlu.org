Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy are two major ones. I need their interactions. Shame it doesn't happen like I want.

Mad Eye Moody, Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt. I need more centered on the Order of the Phoenix in general.


** Harry with other students.

I'm not one of those who hate Ron and Hermione. But the way the books focus so exclusively on them and it seems like he only have two friends is weird.

I'd like to see Harry interact with the Chasers. Oliver Wood. Maybe some people from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Or Slytherin who aren't in Draco's pocket like Crabbe/Goyle/Pansy are.

** Luna and Hagrid.

Luna is this odd little duck, shunned and ignored by her classmates for being different. And Hagrid's no stranger to awful discrimination.

Seeing them bond--especially over animals--is something you almost never see.

Granted, Luna had a very low opinion of Hagrid as a teacher--justifiably, as her baseline for his abilities would be Blast-Ended Skwerts--but one of my favorite scenes in any fanfic was in /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection,/ where Hagrid showed the fourth-years thestrals and Luna realized just how wrong she was about him.

** Sirius Black and Draco Malfoy. Both had the same childhood, one embraced it, the other rebelled against it. A discussion between them would be very interesting. I read a fanfiction once where Draco Malfoy finds Sirius Black's diary, he didn't know it was his since it was signed S.O.B and only mentioned "Padfoot". He assumed it was some old ancestor and began to read it, only to question everything he was raised to believe in. He started to see the wizarding world through Sirius's eyes and realised how much of a farce it was.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.
