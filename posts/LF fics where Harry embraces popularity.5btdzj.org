So any fics where Harry fully embraces his celebrity status instead of hating/rejecting it (as is in most fanfics). Preferably post-DH.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** I'm still kind of disappointed it cuts out at GoF. would've been neat to see glimpses of how it affects a non-Battle of Hogwarts timeline.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
