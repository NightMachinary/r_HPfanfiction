If you've ever wondered how Alastair mad eye moody really lost his right buttock, Then by all means keep reading. I'm sure you'll be interested in the story. It's a useful bit of information that could come in handy when needing to blackmail a new defense against the dark arts Instructor in fourth year. At least in Neville and Harry's Humble opinions.
