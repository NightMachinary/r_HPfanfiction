What I can remember is Harry and Neville are pulled into an alternate universe, I think they arrive in the Forbidden Forest. They compare history, and Neville's Dumbledore treated him as a grandson and had a good mentorship thing going on.

Thanks.

(P.s. Deleted my earlier post. My new tablet's auto correct doesn't seem to work very well. Stupid me for not double checking everything.)


** Oh you know what, now that you're speaking english again, could you be talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]? That's the only one I know of where Harry and Neville both dimension travel and meet in the forest. not sure about the mentorship/BWL part though.

*** Nope. Not Stages of Hope. Don't recall them meeting in a forest in that fiction. It's a good story though.

The story I am looking for has Harry from one dimension and Neville from a second dimension meeting in a third. I suppose my explanation didn't make that clear, sorry.

**** I don't think I've seen any multi-dimension travel like that except maybe linkffn(Lone Traveller by Dunuelos).

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This will never necessarily be "Complete." Now with Xovers and rated T for certain references.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

******* Sadly no. Looked slightly interest regardless, started reading it but it quickly went into cartoon evil Dumbledore. Bad grammar and dropped it.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.
