My favorite is probably GLaDOS calling magic "Will-based Transmogrification Force", WTF for short in Linkffn(Is Your Great-Aunt an AI?)


** I wonder...if Ministry of Magic workers were tattoo'd to mark them as part of the government, would it be written as 'MoM'? I don't think the Ministry has any other recognizable slogan/image associated with it.

**** Maybe, but I think Voldemort already had a monopoly on tattooing followers, and that might make people look too close.

** Order of the Phoenix nicknames used by Indy!Harry to mock Dumbledore (AKA, "Manipulative Old Coot".)

- Fried Chicken Boy Scouts

- Fellowship of the Flaming Fireturkey

- Order of the Crispy Chicken Nuggets

It's as dumb as the nicknames fanfic authors use for Voldemort ("Moldyshorts", "Tommy Diddle") and the Death Eaters ("Corpse Munchers"), but I enjoy the rare occasions when I see ones that are actually creative and original.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Petunia sends a baby Harry to her aunt, living in America, Caroline Evans. Some years later, Caroline becomes GLaDOS, and only Harry stops her from her rampage. Now, Harry is eleven, and he's heading to Hogwarts. Of course, with an amoral scientist/computer for a great-aunt and a mute big sister, the question is not whether he is ready for Hogwarts. Is Hogwarts ready for him?

** For humor based ones, there's good ones (IMO) in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - the MC being a crossover from a D&D world means he's not particularly interested in the /exact/ names of things (very true to most D&D parties ;) ), and has some funny ones for that.

For instance: "Wrongton Wunderbars", "Quidditch Midwestern Final Pseudo-Regionals", "Cuddly Cannons", "House Medal/Cup-Medal", "Gringotts Every-Flavoured Beans", and the like. When used sparingly like the fic does, I find it a lot of fun!
