By headcanon I mean stuff like:

- Understanding of how magic works. Example: "Potions work better when voluntarily taken" or "Shouting a spell makes it stronger"

- Understanding of how the magical society works ("Muggleborns cannot find jobs after Hogwarts", "The minister of Magic isn't elected")

- Understanding of characters ("Dumbledore was evil and eats muggleborn babies for breakfast")

Basically: What actual concepts in fics do you like or not like? Not tropes, but in the world-building.


** 1) Pureblood apologism. "The muggleborns are diluting our magic and don't bother assimilating with magical society and the word Mudblood never started out as a slur so of course Voldemort is totally justified in genocide."

Strangely I've rarely seen people use Muggleborns and the threat to the Statute of Secrecy as an argument. It would be more logical then this "stealing our magic" nonsense.

2) Lucius Malfoy was abusive towards Narcissa and Draco. He was a monster in many ways but the man did love his family. Narcissa did not tolerate any insults towards her husband and Draco idolized Lucius.

3) Regulus Black was a pure innocent cinnamon roll who was pressured into being a Deatheater and didn't really believe in Pureblood supremacy. To an extent, Draco as well.

4) Snape didn't really want to bully children. He had to because he was a spy.

5) Luna Lovegood is a seer.

6) The Marauders being this inseparable group of friends. If I'm being honest, the amazing friendship in the Marauders always seemed to be between James and Sirius. Remus and Peter really weren't as close to them. This culminates in the first war when there were real rifts in the group, but not with James and Sirius.

To my shame I have to admit I didn't really consider how terrible Dementors and Azkaban is before I read HPMOR. I really appreciated Harry's strong stance on that issue in the story, not giving any shit should all those rapists and murderers run free after tearing down Azkaban, because no-one deserves to be tortured like this.

***** /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, an AU fanfic by scientist Eliezer Yudkowsky. The apparent premise is that Petunia married a scientist rather than a drill-manufacturer, resulting in a happy, rationalist Harry who sets out making the Wizardign World more rational. Later on, it becomes apparent that the setting itself (along with all backstory) has been reworked by Yudkowsky to make more logical sense (which includes souls not existing, Voldemort having really been a supergenius rather than a maniac, and other changes to magical theory, among other things). Mostly because of this (and because some find the character of the rational Harry unrelatable), it has a sort of "love-it-or-hate-it" reputation in the larger HP fandom.

PS: I say "larger HP fandom" because HPMOR has pretty much developped a fandom of its own, with scores of fanfanfics set in its continuity.

  Nope, in fact it makes much less sense, because everything is just made up as the characters go along and Harry solves most of his problems with the Time Turner, which is one of the least sensible things in the whole HP universe.

Whether or not Yudkowsky entirely /succeeded/ in making the setting more rational is up to interpretation, but that was definitely the intent, and for at least /some/ things it works. Take, for instance, the way Horcruxes and ghosts work in this version, the truth about Voldemort and why he could simultaneously be so feared and appear so insane, why Dumbledore acts like he does, etc.

Makes a lot of sense to me. Considering the small size/genepool of the magical population Purebloods should actually be extremely inbred.

This seems to be the pertinent point, no? Inbreeding that has reached the point of having negative effects generally has signs: the people look funny, or are prone to a number of diseases.

The vast majority of purebloods appear physically normal and there's no indication that they get sick with increasing frequency. The Gaunts are the only example we see of inbreeding having an effect and they took an extreme position that even most purebloods rejected as odd.

It may be that magic protects people from the negative physiological effects of inbreeding. Or it could be that international freedom of wizarding movement from the Middle Ages onwards has resulted in the gene pool of the magical world being global rather than national. The relatively high proportion of international couples would result in genetic diversity.

*** Partially quoting myself from somewhere else: I rather dislike the idea of inborn power. With the whole anti-purebloodism crusade in the books, I think it's an important point of the Harry Potter series that magic, as long as you've been born magical, is an equal-opportunity thing, and at age 8 nothing inherent about them could divine whether Gregory Goyle or Albus Dumbledore would grow up a powerful wizard. Whether it's Muggleborns or Half-Bloods or whoever, a character's blood status (or the power of their parents in geenral) simply shouldn't have anything to /do/ with how magically proficient they may become. Dumbledore and Riddle got to where they were because they were geniuses who had great control of wandless magic and an unparalleled understanding of magic's inner workings that allowed them to create their own spells as needed. Both, and Flitwick and Moody also, also had physical abilities that allowed them to duel quickly while still mainting precise wand movements. Bottom line being, "raw power" has nothing to do with it.

6. Hermione Granger being perfect in any way. (She's intelligent, book-smart, and her heart's usually in the right place, but she often refuse to see the obvious or listen to other people [or elves]. Also, when she's jealous, she's downright vicious. [See: Lavender and Harry's Potion Book, which he even let her use, btw.])

7. SPEW being wrong on all counts, even in fics that normally put Hermione on a pedestal. (She did, after all, start her career in Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, where she did improve the EW of SPEW.)

8. (EDIT) The DE raid on the Longbottoms was a solo act. (They caught four DEs, yet in most FFs, Crouch and the other Lestranges are usually completely forgotten whenever it's mentioned.)

****** Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by JK Rowling.

I suppose you're going to want the specific passage too... I feel like it's kinda obvious that it's the scene in St Mungo's after Arthur was bitten, but here you go:

#+begin_quote
  “Arthur,” she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, “you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.”

  “What?” said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. “No, no --- it's nothing --- it's --- I ---”

  He seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley's piercing gaze.

  “Well --- now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea. . . . He's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on --- on Muggle wounds ---”

  Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.

  “Do you mean to tell me,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, “that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?”

  “Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr. Weasley imploringly. “It was just --- just something Pye and I thought we'd try --- only, most unfortunately --- well, with these particular kinds of wounds --- it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped ---”

  “Meaning?”

  “Well . . . well, I don't know whether you know what --- what stitches are?”

  “It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,” said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, “but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid ---”

  “I fancy a cup of tea too,” said Harry, jumping to his feet.

  Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek,

  “WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA?”

  “Typical Dad,” said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. “Stitches . . . I ask you . . .”

  “Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,” said Hermione fairly. “I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something. . . . I wonder where the tearoom is?”

******** Most wizards and witches were almost certainly Christians themselves though. The witch-hunts were a blip in a very long history and relatively geographically confined. The Inquisition especially was confined to the Iberian peninsula and was an attempt by the Spanish to root out the Muslims and Jews after the reconquista more than a witch-hunt (which always seems to be forgotten), as evidenced by the tiny, tiny number of witches actually burned. In fact it was the Protestants who burned the most witches anyway, not the Catholics (who much preferred to burn Protestants). Sectarian conflict is not new and far from driving sects away from the religion entire it tends to entrench their sects even more.

In short, Wizards are essentially a cultural snapshot of past Britain. They're almost certainly heavily Anglican with some Catholic holdouts.

Now let's be serious: I posit religiosity has two drivers, being a desire for an explanation of natural phenomena and a way to control them; and cultural inertia. Wizards in 0AD - actually, let's forget Christianity and simply discuss all religions. Wizards have no greater capacity to understand the world than anyone else. They have no lessened need for explanations and no lessened need for control - especially two or even four thousand years ago, when magic use was presumably much more primitive and perhaps unpredictable. The desire for religion is still there. The desire still being there, we can assume wizards took up religion much the same as other people. Now that they are religious, cultural inertia can carry the religiosity on just fine as it does in people today.

Thus I think it's a very defensible position that wizards have muggle religion just like they have muggle decor, muggle governments, and muggle architectural styles.

************ Even if Christ's miracles actually happened, which I doubt, the relation of them is mere storytelling. If I'm trying to convince a bunch of wizards to convert to Christianity then I'll just change the stories. Missionaries did that all the time to absorb pagans into the Church as fast as possible by making the mythology of the Church compatible with the local terrain. Not to mention that you hardly got a choice to be Christian or not Christian. The witch-hunting may not have been as extreme in real life as some believe but the heretic- and heathen-hunting absolutely was.

There are a myriad of extremely plausible ways that conversion of wizards could have gotten started dating all the way back to Constantine and, I think, when you consider that wizards in all other ways mirror muggle society pretty much perfectly, from architecture to politics to styles and titles to journalism, it's clear that wizards do not exist unaffected by the muggle world. It is inconceivable to me that any European society of any significance could exist in Europe without becoming Christianised. None have, and there is nothing special about wizards.

Lastly, Christianity is about God. Christ is a part of God.

With untold powers literally at their fingertips, and proven evidence of an afterline, the compulsion for belief and faith of any kind would greatly shrink.

If magic is as sentient as canon makes it seem then magic is a gift by nature and this is their birthright. They are (or should be) natural citizens. It's just as much their society as it's the society of the purebloods: muggleborns have every right to begin taking their part shaping their own society at any time and in any way they want (unless you presuppose that they ought to be second class citizens and think caste systems are awesome).

Not to mention that the only reason they have to "immigrate" at all is that they were isolated for 11 years (from their own fucking world, through no fault of their own) and then are supposed to immediately assimilate into it by throwing them into the deep end. What a great fucking concept to subjugate a group of people: Oh look at these peasants, they don't even know how we walk or talk and have no idea about their magical heritage - standing out like a sore thumb. Savages!

And finally we should consider how much choice a Muggleborn even has about going to Hogwarts - considering the dangers of accidental magic and also the statute of secrecy. Some fanfics have the concept that there magic is somehow bound if they refuse, which would be terrible if it were canon: Either *be maimed for life* or submit to their wishes. In any case, just because they have magic they are suddenly subjected to a "foreign" jurisdiction (a banana republic where the government controls and even runs the courts no less) and the society there (or just authors who believe in this weird headcanon... The Weasleys certainly don't seem to treat Hermione like a immigrant) has the gall to expect them to make an effort to integrate. It's completely backwards.

I have the suspicion that some authors latch onto this idea, even though it doesn't really make sense, because it gives them a chance to bring their personal politics into play and make a point about how "proper" immigrants should behave.

This is like saying that anyone who speaks English should be admitted into England. Citizenship does not derive from the possession of a trait, it derives from the laws of the society in question.

Legitimate entry into a society is based on one thing alone: the consent of the current members of that society, expressed in the form of the laws they enact. Whether they choose to extend the privileges of membership to a non-member is entirely up to them.

This ultimately boils down to the principle of private property: my right to hold property and to pass it down to my progeny, including intellectual property. Wizards as a whole are the collective heirs to their ancestors' efforts to build that society. Why should a non-member be entitled to help themselves to that knowledge and infrastructure? A society is perfectly within its rights to restrict access to that which it has worked to build, or to set conditions on access such as a good faith attempt to integrate into the current norms of the society.

******** Well, yes. That line is canon - but Draco's views are revealed to be as wrong as the KKK's.

First, all the culture clash we see in the books is pretty much the wizarding world being in the wrong (slavery, torture, casual cruelty towards muggles).

Second, we don't really see a different, alien society the muggleborns would need to integrate into. I don't know why people keep claiming that there is some pureblood culture that muggleborns don't get - canon Wizarding Britain looks like a slightly quirkier, slightly older England, with some magic and Quidditch. Even in the fanfics where there is a pureblood culture made up by the author, usually Hermione and co. just would have to read Jane Austen and would be completely fine with fitting in. They even celebrate christmas at Hogwarts using christmas trees, with gifts given out.

In canon, there is no support at all for the blood purists' complaints about muggleborns.

********** What I mean with a different culture is one where the differences go much, much deeper than some cosmetic changes. Yes, the wizards have different stuff, but the muggles have far more diverse stuff in almsot all those areas you mention - hobby, literature, sports, media - and all within the same culture. Listening to this or that singer is not a significant difference - that's happening within a culture as well and the wizards simply don't have enough people to have enough singers and other celebrities to make up even a fraction of a typical muggle culture's number. Just because a friend of mine is a fan of hockey, listens to different bands, watches TV and doesn't read books doesn't mean we're living in two different cultures. Heck, he even uses a car while I take the train, so there's different transport covered as well, and he uses his phone to pay while I stick with cash or debit card. We even dress up differently for work, too.

Muggles and wizards have far more fundamental things in common, still: Wizards in Britain still marry, same as muggles. The celebrate Christmas. They use a train and cars. They have radio. They have books and newspapers. Write letters. Use watches. Wear the same clothes muggles do, at least part of the time. Speak the same language, just with a few slang words - certainly nothing beyond what muggles deal with in the same country.

In the books we see no real culture clash outside the fridge horror moments; each muggleborn is seen to adapt reather easily to magical life, and the vast majority of the time, the people react as we would expect them to.

There is no deep difference, unlike cultures where honour killings are expected, or where polygamy is the norm - or arranged marriages. Or no marriages at all, just free love, with family lines passed on through the mother. Or some magically arranged parwenthood, divorced from relationships. Or some "slipping someone a love potion is showing that they are interested in you" WTF moment. People changing in the same locker room? Big Deal. Unisex locker rooms are not exactly wizard-exclusive. Wizards apparently still have the same nudity taboo, and their clothes are pretty much what muggles wear, or were wearing in the past.

Even the fridge horror moments we encounter - house elf slavery, torturing prisoners - are pretty much just the wizards still doing what muggles did a few centuries (or less) ago.

Wizarding Britain kept its close ties to the UK even after 1692, and it shows. And that makes purebloods complaining about muggleborns not fitting in when all they have to do - and do - is to learn a few names and terms and be golden - stupid bigots.

Heck, JKR wrote the story so her young readers could follow the characters - of course there are no significant cultural differences; that would have destroyed her goal.

This would imply that the British, Americans, Canadians, Australians, South Africans etc all have the same culture. All this is true of them also. Discount the point about speaking the same language and it would apply to basically all humanity.

  What I mean with a different culture is one where the differences go much, much deeper than some cosmetic changes. Yes, the wizards have different stuff, but the muggles have far more diverse stuff in almost all those areas you mention - hobby, literature, sports, media - and all within the same culture.
#+end_quote

The point is that when you take all the different stuff together it adds up. Take a random British Muggle and dump them into a typical conversation with Magical people and they will not be able to follow the conversation or contribute to it. They have completely different cultural reference points.

How often do people reference their jobs, current affairs, sports, well-known public figures, innovations in technology, new consumer products, etc in their conversations? All these things are different for wizards than for Muggles.

You mention the lack of "deeper" matters than cosmetic, but ignored several of my "deeper" points regarding the way wizards view the universe and their place in it. You mention love potions, another example would be cheering charms. Mental manipulation is approached quite casually by the wizarding world, and this seems to be a result of their magical perspective. Another example: the relationship between wizards and goblins is like nothing which exists in the Muggle world, and the instinct towards imperial-age comparisons seems to be exactly the kind of failure to integrate into wizarding culture which would give purebloods fuel.

You focus on relationships, but (love potions aside), relationships are probably the one area where the wizarding world and Muggle world are most alike. To pretend as if that one domain speaks for all culture seems to bulldoze through many legitimate differences.

To be clear, the fact that Draco uses anti-immigration rhetoric as a socially acceptable cover for his true racist beliefs does not mean that this rhetoric is automatically false. Draco's true motivations in expressing those views do not impact their logical status.

This is not an argument against the proposition that Muggleborns should integrate. This amounts to the statement that in fact they do successfully integrate. Which I would agree with - see how Hermione casually manipulates her parents' memories without any consent and sends them off to Australia. She has adopted wizarding paternalism towards Muggles as well as the relatively casual approach to mental manipulation. It's probably her finest hour.

************ You forgot my most imporant point: The books were written so young readers would have no trouble following the characters. That means by design, there were no significant cultural differences. All the stuff you mention is easily adapted to - more so since the wizards simply don't have much of anything. They don't have the dozens of hobbies, singers, music styles, sports, books, geners etc. because there are so damn few of them.

Also, the "different world view" is never shown much in canon either. That oh so different relation to goblins? Plays no signifiant role.

Different world view? Philosophy? Inexistent in the book.

Cheering Charms? They were mentioned in one single scene, as the topic of a lesson, and then twice more related to tests/exams. We never, ever see them actually used outside the classroom, despite numerous opportunities for their use.

You do the same as many others do: You extrapolate logically (if a bit selectively) from what we see in the books, but what should be there in the wizard culture simply isn't there in canon. JKR didn't write a book about a different magical culture - she wrote a book about a British boy and his friends at a magical British boarding school fighting evil wizards, and we can see the British parts shine through in every scene.

************* I think this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of JK Rowling's worldbuilding. JKR builds her world by allusion, not by comprehensive description. We know there is wizarding radio. We're given the names of one or two singers/bands. It would be absurd to assume that, simply because these are the only two music groups mentioned, they are the only ones. JKR has deliberately used them as examples to allude to a greater world which she does not have the time or inclination to fully describe.

I do not see this so much as logical extrapolation as much as reading the books as they are intended to be read. We're not supposed to think that what we see of the wizarding world is its entirety.

As for the different relation to goblins, it does play a rather significant role in DH. Prior to this point, one could be forgiven for the assumption that wizarding approach to other species' was universally analogous to Muggle racism/imperialism, because of how they treat House Elves, merpeople, etc. But then in DH it emerges that actually, the stereotypes about goblins are true. They're not like oppressed humans who merely look different, they are a different species which is genuinely nasty in nature. Justified racism is not something that exists in the Muggle world and is a concept which is completely alien to latter 20th century Western culture.

************** I beg to differ. If we leave what's written in canon, we're in the area of headcanon - and as you assume that there would be more bands/singers, I assume, given how few wizards are around, there wouldn't be that many more, because there generally aren't that many talented singers in such a small segment of the population. A small town doesn't have dozens of professional bands and singers. On the other hand, you could assume that, extrapolating the effects of magic on the cost of living, many more artists than a comparable muggle populaton could afford since they don't have to earn that much money to live. Thing is, we can't tell for certain.

The same goes for all the other aspects of wizard culture you mention - we never see them in canon, evne if something more should be there.

With regards to goblins, I don't really see the point. Is it goblins as a race, or just Gringotts? We all know that Nazis are evil, for example, so when we condemn people proudly calling themselves Nazis, we are basically doing "justified racism" (in as much as racism can apply to a cultural, not genetical group). So, I don't really see that as justified racism, more like "those blokes in Gringotts are as nasty as we thought" - which pretty much covers a lot of human extremist groups as well.

Except treating Muggleborns as immigrants rather than automatic citizens requires no such arbitrary rule. It merely requires the very general (and widely adopted IRL) rule: a person is only automatically a citizen if they are born to someone who is already a citizen. This is the rule that Muggle Britain uses, for example.

Citizenship by descent is the most common form of citizenship rule. Citizenship by circumstance (e.g. all people born in America become American) is relatively unusual, internationally speaking. It does not seem to me that societies are morally obliged to adopt rules of citizenship by circumstance.

  My understanding is that Dumbledore did have the best intentions for everyone
#+end_quote

Did he really? For everyone? He certainly had the best intentions for their society, but he had no compunctions to throw individuals under the bus. He sure has heck didn't have the best intentions for Harry Potter. Or for Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley who both almost died (multiple times!) trying to support Dumbledore's "clever plan" for a child-martyr. He certainly did not have the best intentions for all the innocent school children of the school that he put in danger every year: He has no business fighting a War with a school full of children as his base of operations. Katie Bell was in hospital for months because someone tried to assassinate Dumbledore and don't get me started about all the other crazy stuff that has been going on: Like hiding a valuable magical artefact in a school in order to lure Voldemort into a trap? How insane is that? Do you think Severus Snape as a potions teacher is having the best intentions for everyone in mind? Or what about how he tolerated a teacher who *literally* tortured children at his school! Ah, and why didn't he just throw her out the door? For *political* reasons! Are you kidding me?!

Yeah, and this is just the school aspect of him not having the best interest of his students in mind. Lets not forget that he has a spy in Voldemort's inner circle. He knows about most major raids beforehand and does nothing, letting innocent people die, because it would expose his spy. Not even his own followers (Emmelin Vance, Arthur Weasley) are protected from being sacrificed for the greater good because of his machinations. Best intentions for everyone my ass! Arthur would have been dead if it weren't for Harry... And for no good reason no less.

He certainly had the greater good in mind, but the way he did go about it is by my moral standards absolutely abhorrent and I condemn him for it.

***** Again, he just wasn't very good at /acting/ on those intentions. He honestly thought he was doing what was best for Harry, because he thought he'd have to die either way because prophecy and it was best to give him as normal a childhood as possible before then. He also thought he could handle a weakened Voldemort. I'm not sure he knew about Umbridge's blood quills, and for all he knew he wasn't any worse than Snape or Lockhart (who are not terribly high standards, but not actively /harming/ anyone). And he honestly hoped Katie Bell and Arthur Weasley and all would make it out okay, he just didn't scheme very well to that end --- and who could blame him? /He's not a Slytherin./ HPMOR's Dumbledore is a tad different from the canon one, but Voldemort describes him with a quote that I find very fitting:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was not born to plotting, but he tries because he must. To that task he brings dedication, intelligence, and an utter lack of native talent.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is not about his failed schemes. He is consciously sacrificing individual liberties and their lives in order to accomplish his goals. He could have had a decent Potions professor at his school if he didn't want to have a spy in Voldemorts camp. He could have stepped down as Headmaster as soon as Voldemort returned if he didn't want to endanger a whole school, but he needed the position to further his goals. He could have not sent Arthur in the DOM to patrol it against Voldemort (sounds like a death sentence to me, but whatever), only because he wanted Harry to remain ignorant. That last one is actually the worst. It shows how little value Dumbledore places on lives if he is willing to sacrifice them for so little gain. Why did Order members risk their lives to protect the prophecy? Give me one explanation that doesn't end with "Dumbledore is an asshole who only cares about winning the war" [Don't forget, he just could have told Harry what's up, let him retrieve the prophecy and hide it under a fidelius somewhere or destroy it... but that would have required being upfront with his little sacrificial lamb and that's just something old Albi is unwilling to do, so I guess Arthur has to die if worst comes to worst, whateva]

But his goal were, as best I can tell, to save as many people as possible in the long run. Don't forget that nearly all the people he endangered throughout the war would have had 100 percent chance of being slaughtered like cattle if Voldemort won.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The most plausible argument I have seen is that the Prophecy was made to serve as a distraction --- the longer Voldemort knew it was within his reach and spent his powers trying to get it, the longer he wasn't going around in the open slaughtering muggles. Having Harry retrieve the Prophecy would have negated that diversion. Of course, you could still spin that in a "Dumbledore is an asshole who only cares about winning the war" way, but at least there's good strategic thinking behind it that doesn't boil down to wanting to keep Harry out of the loop.

So that poor wizards existing makes sense, is my guess. Can't afford new robes? Transfigure your old torn-up robes into brand new, high fashion robes.

Also, like why would anyone buy books? Just transfigure rocks into the books you want. Eleven year-olds who only heard of magic for the first time a few months ago can transfigure a pincushion into a hedgehog, and I'm pretty sure that fabricating the biology of a hedgehog is way harder to get right than a special pattern of ink on some paper.

I don't think the solution is to nerf it, though. Rowling's solution was perfectly fine: don't think too hard about that part, focus on what the story is really about.

***** Rowling's solution is rather that magic is very hard and most wizards can't perform even quite simple transfigurations, never mind robes good enough to wear.

It's important to remember that the average wizard isn't actually very good at magic: recall that most wizards can't cast a shield charm, for example, which is a spell on the Defence O.W.L. curriculum.

O.W.L. exams are the magical analogue of the GCSE exams which English children take IRL at age 16. The "passing grades" are generally considered A/-C. About 70% of children achieve at least one A/-C grade, meaning 30% of people fail completely in all their subjects. When you narrow this down to students who get 5 A*-C grades including English and Mathematics (which might be called the equivalent of a US high school diploma), that percentage falls to 54%.

So general wizarding failure to achieve basic proficiency is analogous to general Muggle failure.

With this in mind, one appreciates how getting solid Es with a good O thrown in is far above the average. The average student likely manages to get an A in at least one subject but has a roughly 50/50 chance of getting an A in all the core subjects. That does not result in a society where the average wizard can use magic to do most things for themselves.

** Lots of good ones in here already. I shall attempt to avoid repeating the ones which have already been stated.

- The idea that the wizarding world is old fashioned or backwards, as opposed to different (newsflash: at no time were robes used as everyday wear by Muggles).

- The idea that Muggles can make potions.

- The idea that wizards have a stock market, large corporations, galleon billionaires, advanced financial instruments, etc.

- The idea that magical knowledge/ability is regressing rather than advancing, i.e. the depiction of wizarding society as static/stagnant.

- The idea that anti-Muggleborn discrimination happens in the open and is institutionalised, as opposed to it being an analogue of racism in the Muggle world: definitely present, but in a insidious way, with institutions being officially opposed to it. (Voldemort's Ministry being the obvious exception).

- The idea that everyone and their mum knows about occlumency and horcruxes.

As a more general point that applies across many aspects of worldbuilding:

- Failure to assume that things are the way they are for good reasons. We only have very limited knowledge of the canonical world. Some people exploit this to depict the wizarding world in the worst possible light e.g. "wizards are so stupid for having a falliable legal system in a world with truth potions and binding vows". But the reasonable position would be to assume that truth potions and binding vows aren't thrown around like candy for good reasons, which we just happen to be unaware of.

*** I prefer to assume that JKR simply didn't think things through since she was telling a story, not creating an internally consistent world. As should be obvious when taking a look how her books changed over the course of the series, and how many things were introduced, used maybe once, and then forgotten and never brought up again.

**** Well, firstly, any explanation with reference to JKR's methods would be an "out-of-universe" explanation which is unsatisfying if you're attempting to have a discussion about how things work in-universe.

Secondly, I would say that your point is only partially correct. You are certainly correct that there are certain factual inconsistencies (e.g. population figures). However I do not think it is right to say that JKR introduced things for no reason. Generally she introduces worldbuilding elements to give the reader a tonal/atmospheric impression as opposed to a factual one.

The Quidditch world cup is a good example. Its size doesn't quite fit into the world in a factual sense (though you can explain it away), but the point was that JKR wanted to convey a tone of the occasion which was reminiscent of Muggle large sporting events. In that aim she was successful.

Conversely Diagon Alley is supposed to convey the charm of a small village shopping promenade full of cute independent shops. Again, in that respect she was successful, but the idea that this is the primary business district of the same population as attended the Quidditch world cup is odd.

So she sacrifices factual accuracy for the sake of conveying the tone and atmosphere of each locale/situation as she wants us to imagine them.

(For example, I wouldn't see Diagon Alley as a small village shopping promenade - far too many shops there, in my estimation and experience. I certainly would not expect a book shop in a small village. Or many clothes shops - I know how far I had to travel from a small village years ago when I had an unfortunate accident involving a canoe, and needed fresh clothes.)

**** My take on how you use magic while brewing is the same as how you use magic when casting a spell.

Think about it: any Muggle can say an incantation and make a wand movement. The wand is even inherently magical. But you will only get a magical result if you are a wizard doing it. A Muggle just looks silly waving a stick around and saying some quasi-Latin.

The same applies for potions. Any Muggle can cut up ingredients and stir them around. Some of the ingredients are even from magical plants and animals. But by analogy: you only get a result if you're a wizard doing it. A Muggle would just get... well, what we would get IRL if we sat around mixing eye of newt with various plants and other animal parts. A disgusting mess.

Going into this a bit further, I don't really see there being so much difference between potions and spell casting. Ollivander says in DH that wizards can use "almost any instrument" to cast magic, it's just that the bond between a wizard and a wand is the strongest. So I just see potions ingredients, the cauldron, fire etc. as different instruments with which wizards can cast a spell.

Fanon likes to talk a lot about rituals as a new, distinct subject. But Hogwarts already teaches rituals! It's just that they call the subject Potions. What else is a ritual, after all, than moving your body and various magically significant items around in a certain pattern, in order to produce a magical effect? There are even some potions that require you to do some of the ingredient preparation under the full moon, the stereotypical image of a magic ritual.

We see this with Voldemort's resurrection. People talk about the resurrection ritual and the potion as if they are two separate things. But the potion IS the ritual. Those three ingredients Pettigrew adds... they are Potions ingredients that just so happen to require very specific, context-sensitive procurement.

****** Contrary to a lot of fanon, there's little indication that wizards can "feel" their own magic. The closest we get is Dumbledore's advanced ability to sense magic, but this is unusually precise. Most wizards are only able to sense magic in a very vague sense - e.g. Harry feeling the magic of Ollivander's in PS, and the power of Dumbledore's spell in OotP.

But yeah, the typical spell doesn't seem to involve anything in terms of wizards feeling the casting of the spell. Rather, casting magic is all about taking the spell from your mind and bringing it into the world via external actions - a spoken incantation, a wand movement, a turn on the spot, a stir of the cauldron, etc. Casting spells with purely mental effort is an advanced skill.

3. Harry is weaker than X because Harry when he was 17, couldn't do what X did at 60.

4. The Veil sent Sirius to another dimension. Despite this being proven completely wrong by the resurrection stone.

5. Dumbledore is gay. The largest piece of headcanon in existence, yet with no proof to back it up other than JKR's words on how she 'imagined' him. I'm not Homophobic but I think that it's really disingenuous to a character to tag something like this onto him to make him a token character.

6. Hermione is African American, Harry is a Filipino, Ron is from Uzbekistan. You can already see what's wrong with this picture. *HARRY IS OF PUERTO RICAN DECENT, OOOOO.* But on a Sirius note, what Rowling wrote and context clues show, is that none of this is actually true.

Once again, she repeats it as "No, I always saw Dumbledore as gay". There's a difference between what she saw and how he came to be, to me he just seemed like an asexual old man who never really married due to losing much of his family and his sister to his own temptations of the physical world. I don't have a problem with him being gay, but he isn't, it's headcanon, it just happens to be the author's own piece of headcanon. It's not written down in any books, not even foreshadowed.

The funniest thing is that she oversaw all the scripts according to this interview, yet didn't change many of the glaring flaws that didn't align with the book. HA!

***** Snape wanting to have some leverage over the boys who would not leave him alone does not justify a murder attempt. And we don't even know if this is true. "Snape was obsessed" is according to Sirius who used Snape knowing dark curses before coming to Hogwarts as justification when we know from The Prince's Tale and SWM that this isn't the case.

And really? He goaded them? From what I remember, he was having a private conversation with Lily during which James Potter interrupts with a very Draco type remark, "Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" and then Snape defends himself with that "if you'd rather be brawny than brainy" comment. After which James and Sirius trip him and call him him Snivellus, which sets the tone for the next 7 years. There's a strange mentality that because Snape wasn't a good, quiet little victim, it means he wasn't a victim at all. Rowling herself called it relentless bullying and *just to be clear, this doesn't condone him joining the Deatheaters or his behaviour as a teacher*.

The timeline shows that SWM happens after the Werewolf prank. The official story going around is that Snape had to be rescued from his own stupidity by James Potter who's being lauded for his part while Snape is forbidden to talk about it. And he also thought James was in on it and got cold feet at the last minute. And considering James's behaviour later, it is more likely he did it to protect Sirius and Remus then for any altruistic purposes. He almost died because of Sirius and they're back to bullying him again because they were bored, which shows that Sirius hardly suffered consequences. Sectumsempra is a huge deviation from the previous spells written in his book, which were mostly harmless depending on how they were used. If he resorted to creating dark spells when the people who almost murdered him continued to bully him 4 on 1 (3 of you forget Remus) because he "existed" then yeah, I think it partly was because of the Marauders. Not the only thing, but if they were the hallmarks of the light side then I can see why the dark would be appealing.

Maybe in later years she had to justify it to her friends because Snape started getting in with the "dark" crowd, but before then, there was absolutely no good reason for anyone to be bothered about them being mates - except James and company were, because he was poor and weird and ugly and in Slytherin.

If they hadn't bullied him, he probably never would have taken any notice of Lupin's condition. He was desperate, and Lupin was the weak spot of the group; obviously sick, mysterious about it, Black and Potter seemed protective of him...he definitely didn't expect what he found though.

They relentlessly harrassed him for seven years and started for absolutely no good reason. If you think that bullying like that is justified just because Snape said something rude in response to an equally rude comment, then Draco being a shit to Harry was clearly justified too.

Of course, probably every canonical source about that era is biased and unreliable: Sirius trying to console his godson, Snape trying to justify his actions, Dumbledore speaking to an 11 year old, and a clearly exasparated Lily. We're filling in an awful lot of blanks here, remember. For all we know, Snape /could have/ given just as much as he got.

If Snape had friends like Hermione and Ron, maybe things would have been different for him - he might have matured into a reserved but decent young man. Harry's background as a favourite target of bullies is what causes him such conflict over his teenage father's behaviour: if he had been raised the same way as James, maybe he would have just found the memory funny.

I bet Snape fought back. I would, if four people were being absolute shits to me for seven years, starting for no reason beyond thinking I was a lesser being. Being made to feel powerless often makes people seek power, he wanted to make them pay. He couldn't freely curse his parents, but by god he could give James Potter boils or a tail or whatever.

With the whole anti-purebloodism crusade, I think it's an important point of the /Harry Potter/ series that magic, as long as you've been born magical, is an equal-opportunity thing, and at age 8 nothing inherent about them could divine whether Gregory Goyle or Albus Dumbledore would grow up a powerful wizard.
- I dislike the idea that Luna uses her "creatures" either as a code or as a method of coping with some kind of depression. In my mind, she's just really convinced that what her father writes is true, and with a father like Xenophilius it's no wonder she never outgrew it.
- The whole "Muggleborns cannot find jobs" thing that you cited as an example. It's cheap and unsupported by canon. In general, that Purebloods rule the wizarding world. I'm under the impression that most Death Eaters were pretty much destitute by the late 20th century and the reason they were so desperate to join Voldemort is because they had no power left in normal society at all. Note how the canon Lucius Malfoy wasn't allowed into the Wizengamot.
- The concept that Hermione is just good at memorizing and is not really that /intelligent/ per se. It's not as harsh as Dumbledore or the Weasleys, but that feels a lot like bashing to me. I mean, I understand some people are annoyed with the "Hermione is the second coming of Merlin" thing, but surely there's a middle ground?
