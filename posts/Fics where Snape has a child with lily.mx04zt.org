#+begin_quote
  Lily Evans doesn't marry James Potter.Severus Snape doesn't become a Death Eater. A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?

** There was a fanfiction where he had a daughter with her, she was harry's older half sister who was left with Severus Snape because Petunia refused to take her in. Harry was left with Petunia because of the protection. I think both of them had a scar and were "the children who lived" or something like that. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the fiction, if someone knows it please link it her.

I'll try to look in my reading history.

*** That'd be Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed. Unfortunately the author removed it from both AO3 and FFN, so it can't be linked.

** Flair should be "Request"; "Recommendation" is used when you recommend something in your post.
