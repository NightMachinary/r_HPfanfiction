the basic idea is like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10733700/2/Relief-s-Herald]]) and the Stag and the flower and winds of change

where bill/fleur either don't get married or break up or bill dies at the battle also if it involves harry growing stronger magically that would be great

edit

not smut pls


** Fleur. /Fleur/.

#+begin_quote
  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
