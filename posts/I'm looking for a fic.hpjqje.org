:END:
I think that Harry is in charge of wizard reincarnation and he keeps reincarnating Tom Riddle into things you really don't want to be. Then Harry gets bored and with Tom (which was supposed to be reincarnated again) decides to make something like new dimension so Harry can live his life again but they get drunk when they are making it and lot of things is wrong. And maybe Tom was Dada professor.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!
