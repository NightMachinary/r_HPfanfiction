I read a fanfic where Harry dies mysteriously and nobody knows how. Later on it's clarified that Ron killed him. Ron is married to Hermione and abuses her. So much so that he takes her wand away and doesn't let her even do magic. She devises a way to go back in time and set everything right.


** Maybe it's this one: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time Warp)

  Hermione makes a potion that will take her back in time to put right the mistakes she made, the worst of which was marrying the wrong man. Why she married Ron she did not know, she did know it was the biggest mistake she ever made.

*** Why do so many authors have the two characters get engaged so quickly? Seriously, Harry proposed not even 24 hours after the two began dating.

**** well, usually when you first meet and learn to know a Person (and potential Partner), you are suppossed to spent a certain time, to figure out, if s/he is the right one. In the Trios Case, they knew each other for about 7 Years. I guess that enough time. But i see your Point. Similar problem is, when they fall for each other in a rush and confess their Love. Way to fluffy, unless you are that Type or in the mood.

**** Yeah have to agree, that is a little irritating for me too. These days I don't generally continue a fanfic if the main pair get together too quickly without any buildup or relationship development. But this, at that time, seemed very normal to me.

*** Yes ! This is the one I was looking for, thanks :) I know it's not well written, but I am a sucker for Hr/H fanfics. And if there's Weasley bashing, I love it even more. Also, this was one of the firsts (Hr/H) I read so am a little biased towards it.

** I couldn't think of the ending of it and wanted to read it again. I like reading good ones again, from time to time. :P This isn't the one that I am talking about. But it sounds interesting, I'm going to read this in the meantime :) Thanks !!
