Looking for a fanfic where dark!fem!harry runs to Voldemort (Marvolo in fic) and they marry out of convenience and fight Dumbledore and Order. Harry and Voldemort are necromancers. It could have been Alternative Universe, but I can't find it on AO3.


** Is there even something like that?

** Linkao3(Historical Importance Of Runic War Warding On The British Isles). Major AU elements. MC isn't "dark" though. The premise is a lot more complicated than that and actually makes some sense. So don't be put off by the insane title.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]
