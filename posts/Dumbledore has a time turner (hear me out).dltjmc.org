And his Animagus form is a phoenix, who, like Padfoot, goes by a different name: Fawkes. What is an event from the books like from Dumbledore/Fawkes' perspective?


** "You must have shown me great loyalty in the Chamber, Harry," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Only that would have called Fawkes to you."

/I would have helped anyways, thanks,/ thought Future Albus, sitting on his perch. /Honestly, how self-centered do I think I am?/

** Albus holds up the glinting gold of the time turner.

"Oooh this will be fun," he says, and turns it twice. Immediately, time shifts around him, and he sees a ghostly image of himself laying the time turner down on a shelf and backing out of his office.

The necklace hums slightly as time normalizes, and Albus quickly places it in the shoebox on a nearby shelf. With a brief moment of concentration, his form shifts into that of a red firebird, and he settles on the perch.

An hour passes with Albus preening his wings before the door opens and Albus Dumbledore steps into the office, looks up, and freezes.

Fawkes also freezes, and their eyes meet.

Instantly, Albus /understands/. He can see all the possibilities and the endless facets of time and space, and he can see a dark knot in the middle. Delving in, he sees an impossible loop of existence and nonexistence.

Professor McGonagall knocks once on the headmaster's door, and frowns when there's no response.

A minute later, and she begins to recite sweets, half an hour later and she's throwing blasting curses at the door. 5 hours later and all the teachers at hogwarts are standing by the door, Flitwick is tinkering with the Gargoyle, until finally there's a /click/, and the door swings open. They can hear cackling from upstairs.

Creeping up the staircase with their wands drawn, they burst into the office proper and are met by the presence of two Dumbledores, one of which is rolling on the floor cackling like mad, the other of which is sitting in the corner with his knees drawn to his chin.

One of them walks up to the one in the corner, while several nurses subdue the laughing one, and he looks up, madness blazing in his eyes.

"It's longer than you think, Minerva! It's longer than you think..."
