Considering it was Bagnold's administration and Crouch's oversight as Head of the DMLE to incarcerate Sirius without trial, I always thought Fudge would have loved the opportunity to politically lambast his predecessor and someone who could be considered an enemy of one of his major benefactors, Malfoy.

Yet, that never happens. He doesn't even appear to be slightly interested in having it looked at. I'm curious if this is because Snape got to him first or if there was some other reasoning I missed.

Thoughts?


** Fudge was involved. He was one of the first responders. He was there when they found Sirius surrounded by corpses laughing. Firstly, I don't think after seeing that he could believe Sirius to be innocent. Secondly, if he was involved in clearing up the mess then he could be accused of destroying potential evidence.

That's actually a really great point. I forget sometimes that he saw first hand how unhinged Sirius was in that moment.

I disagree. The issue is that there was no trial at all, in the first place. Was any evidence even collected to be destroyed in a situation where a case was never intended to be given? Who knows.

But, honestly, he was just the Junior Minister of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. He was only there at all because of the explosion, not to catalog evidence. It's not like he was an auror or anything.

**** The witnesses were muggles. They heard Peter's words. Obliviators are part of Fudge's department. If he ordered the memory wipes then he might be responsible for destroying the memories of witnesses that could have seen Peter transform. His department's job was to clear up the crime scene as quickly as possible and remove anything magic from the muggle area. They don't collect evidence but their job involves potentially destroying it.

That's a really good point.

I'm not arguing, anymore, because at this point I think you've adequately proven that, at least in Fudge's mind, Sirius being innocent would cause him personal problems.

But just to be clear, outside of Fudge's mind, that's a really shitty worry to have. Sirius would have been cleared within moments of his day in court, even with the evidence that Fudge could have destroyed. Veritaserum, explaining that Peter was an animagus, viewing his memories, etc.

We have very little via canon to show what kinds of evidences are admissible in court, but I imagine /one/ of them, at least, would have to be, and any of them would instantly clear him of wrongdoing.

*** I like Snape's character. I think people fail to see the nuance in it to properly appreciate it. I also think he was a lot less evil than people prefer to imagine him as. A good person? Perhaps not, but that doesn't make you evil.

However, I can't /disagree/ with you necessarily.

I could point to several instances where Snape assists Harry in his quest to end Voldemort. However, for every one of those instances that I could point to, you could turn around and say that Snape only had as much power as Dumbledore gave him and, honestly, that power probably should have been given to someone who was less of an asshole or, at the very least, more apt to actually help Harry for some reason other than the revenge of a life lost. Like McGonagall.

**** There is nothing wrong with liking his character. I mean one of my favourite character is Moriarty (from the Serlock universe) and he is an absolute bastard.

But if someone fail to see that Snape is an asshole, he should consult asap.

And I do think that Snape is evil. He joined a movement who want to erradicate all muggleborns. And the only think that make him changed his mind is his love for Lily. When the only thing that motivate you is revenge, you're not a good person. I'm not expressing myself correctly but what I mean is that Snape doesn't fight for a good cause and would have continued being evil if there was no Lily.

But again, as long as it's a fictional character, feel free to like who you want :p

So many ff writers are morons, and bash James because he's a "bully" and heap praise on Snape because he's a spy. Well, fuck, James being a bully at 15 is clearly a lot worse than the multiple murders Snape commits between 18 and 21. /s

****** I love James a hundred times more than Snape. But, I have to disagree here. I don't think Snape actually killed anyone at that time. Because when Dumbledore talks to him about Snape being the one to kill him, he's worried about the effect it might have on his soul. So, yes Snape was an asshole and a bully, but a murderer? I don't think so. Unless, you count killing Dumbledore. But we know why he did that.

I don't believe that the Death Eaters were having debates and discussions about how they could advance their cause by the time Snape joined. The prophecy was made sometime before July 1980, but probably at a time between September/October 1979 and June 1980 (under the assumption that Trelawney makes it after HP is conceived). By September or October 1979, Snape would have out of Hogwarts for nearly a year and a half.

One and a half years working under Voldemort as a Death Eater without killing anyone? That is very hard to believe. And after his supposed reformation, Snape still was a spy for Voldemort until the end of October 1981. That's at least another year and a half after Snape switches sides. In total, somewhere between 3 and 4 years. Voldemort would definitely have suspected Snape if Snape never killed anyone in all that time.

Here, Albus fears that Draco killing him will be tantamount to murder, while Snape doing it will be a favour to Albus because of their arrangement. He only makes allusions to further damage on their souls, not how damaged they already are.

***** Young Snape was definitely evil; however, I prefer to believe (and I think it's closer to Rowling's intentions considering how she talks about him in interviews) that the death of Lily by his fault was a cause of deeper moral realization for him, and that he was genuinely on the side of good, and not just on a personal vendetta, by the end of the war --- that he wanted to stop Voldemort because it was the right thing to do, regardless of Lily's legacy.

This is a fair way to look at Snape's character in 1981. He was absolutely still a vile and evil person who joined Dumbledore's fight against Voldemort for the wrong reasons. And his decision to switch had absolutely no impact on his moral character.

I don't believe that it's fair to say that people can't change, though. Roughly a decade and a half passed between his defection and his death. That's a /long/ time to get your priorities straight. There are a few examples in the series which show that he doesn't believe in the ideology anymore. Still /absolutely/ an asshole bully, and you can see that in his treatment of Harry and his friends (especially when he degrades Hermione after her teeth are affected by a curse).

But I don't think I believe him to be an /evil/ person at the end of the series. Personally.

I'm not saying you're /wrong/, necessarily, just that I disagree with the full understanding that I could be wrong and, honestly, it's just refreshing to talk to someone about it who doesn't froth at the mouth about it.

Oh, I don't, and I said as much in my original response. Arguing that Snape is a /good/ person is an exercise in futility. I just think it's disheartening when people don't give his character the credit he deserves. He was much more complex than just an evil school teacher. Not that I'm insinuating that's what you're arguing, just stating in general.

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality][Yes. And No]].

There are some universes that are set up so it is clear that other (interesting) things could have happened if the plot went a different directly. Where no matter what happened, it would be fun, where the characters are so strong there would have been an epic fight even if the details were different. The HP unverse is not one of these.

HP has more of the traditional "The only way we got here is if a series of events happened EXACTLY like they did". Not only that, but it creates tension by doing the "Everything was very very close, if someone blinked differently the heros would not have come out on top. Nothing wrong with this, but it does mean that you can put up pretty much any of the coincidences in the book and say if it changed, the entire plot would have to change.

Edit: I guess what I am trying to say is that the plot is clearly set up so that the hero's barely got a win, clearly messaging it could have gone either way. Thus removing even the slightest advantage from the Hero would have resulted in a loss while adding one would result in a cleaner win. But it is also clearly targeted to do that. So you could easily write a fanfic about how Crouch got a better nights sleep and everything worked out better because of it

Problem with balencing on a razors edge is it only takes a breath of wind to push you either way :)

** It would certainly make the Ministry look bad, no matter which Minister is responsible. It would result in further investigations, which might uncover all kinds of uncomfortable truths. It's far easier to bury the truth than to hope that you'd survive the public opinion looking for a convenient scapegoat.

** Snape is Dumbledore's spy - he's not doing anything that Dumbledore doesn't want him to do.. Snape's interference certainly helped, but I'm quite sure that Albus Dumbledore would never have allowed Sirius to get a trial. Think about it - he supposedly believes the trio's version of events, but instead of going with them to capture Pettigrew, he just says,"You mustn't be seen!" and "Three turns ought to do the trick," and walks off - knowing that a whole herd of Dementors attack Sirius and Harry in the forest.

Then again, it is canon. The plot has more holes in it than a slab of swiss cheese.
