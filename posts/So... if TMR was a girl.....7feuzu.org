If Tom Riddle was a girl what would her name be and what would she be known to the world as? (Plz feel free to recommend Fem!TMR or especially Fem!TMR/HP fics.)


** Gender-swap naming is a bit of a bug-bear for me. I feel like the new name should reflect the same associations and factors as the original name did.

So for fem!Harry, her name should be a) common in the Muggle world, b) relatively middle class, c) be a name used by British royalty. E.g. Elizabeth, Victoria, Anne, Alexandra, Isabelle, Catherine, Mary.

With fem!Tom Riddle, her name should be a) extremely common in the Muggle world, to the point of being considered dull, b) simple in form, ideally a single syllable, c) ideally a shortened form of another name d) existed in the early 1900s.

It's quite hard to hit all of these, but some ideas would be: Ann, Liz, Sue, Jo.

****** I wanted something simple, common, and that could be abbreviated. And I had to come up with a story that was believable enough for why she would have it.

I gave up on the anagram after a while because nothing that I came up with sounded boring or 1920s British enough for me.

The backstory probably wont come into the story itself but she's named Emily Mary Riddle.

The women at the orphanage when she was born assumed a sickly 'Merope' Riddle was 'Mary' Riddle. and the woman who helped deliver her was reading Wuthering Heights when she arrived and figured she'd name her after Emily Bronte. Seemed believable and simple enough to me.

*** Or, alternatively, you could just have a girl named Tom. After all, the guy did get named what his mother wished him to be named with pretty much her dying breath, so her not noticing that the kid is a girl and not a boy is a possibility, though certainly a sad one in its own way.

And it's not like it would matter much anyway, what with the state the guy is in in the series proper.

  I've never really understood that line of logic. There is literally nothing in canon to suggest Lily and James preferred common names over anything else or would want the name to be middle class or after British royalty.
#+end_quote

The point is that the character is a female version of Harry. The name should therefore also be a female version of Harry.

It's not about Lily and James' naming preferences generally. It's about the fact that they called /this particular child/ "Harry". Maybe they would have called their next child "Avocado". But that's not what they did with their first child.

******** Why wouldn't I be able to change the name in a published fic?

I was reading a Sherlock fic ft. fem!John, whose name was changed to Cecile. The author made it so that John's mother was also named Cecile, so I wasn't able to change the name to Joan (my pref) en masse without ruining the scenes with his mom. I would have had to do it manually, which, yeah, not happening. So yeah, having two characters with the same name really complicates things.

Also, I have to be able to download the fic to make changes, so fics on LiveJournal, Dreamwidth, tumblr, or other fic archives that don't allow you to view the entire story in one page are out of the question.

Or did you mean to ask why I'm unable to tolerate names that are vastly different from canon?

*** I actually went and looked up the most common names in the 1920's, as that was the decade that Tom Riddle was born, here: [[https://www.babiesonline.com/articles/babynames/most-popular-baby-names-of-the-1920s.asp]]. I found that 'Tom' was merely the 140th most common boy name. I feel that given this information, the author would have quite some leeway for choosing an equivalently popular female name. Some of my own personal favorites are Lena, Sylvia, and Violet, which were all more popular names than Tom in 1920. (To be fair, Thomas was a much more popular name, clocking in at 11th place, but Tom != Thomas, to me)

** Start with "I Am Lady Voldemort"

Take out Riddle, and you're left with:

A M L A Y V O M O T

Now, the first name should be at least a little muggle, so pull out something that works. I think Tammy should work, it's pretty muggle and actually pretty close to Tom.

That leaves us with L A V O O T

This is a mess, but Olvota sounds sort of sane and kind of wizardy. Make it Merope's middle name or something.

That leaves us with Tammy Olvota Riddle. You can play around with this to come up with something else obviously but I think it works the best.

What can you do with this? You can try Valmoot, but that doesn't really sound feminine. Tolomav is equally problematic.

The nice thing about Tammy is that it removes both the ms and the as well as the y, which is not common. Olvota sounds feminine and is a close corruption of Olivia.

I've literally downloaded fics just to change the new name into something suitable, and if I couldn't do that, chances are I'd drop the fic.

For me, the ideal altered name for fem!HP is Harriet, Harria, or Henrietta, with "Harry" being a nickname. I can tolerate most names starting with "H" though, and possibly even flower names, since it would make sense for Lily to follow tradition ("Holly" is also ideal).

As for fem!Tom...pretty much any common name starting with a T. Come to think of it, I quite like Tam, though neither are common. Then again, Voldy was only named Tom because of his muggle father, so there's some leeway there.

As long as the new name starts with the same letter the original name does, I'm satisfied, usually.
