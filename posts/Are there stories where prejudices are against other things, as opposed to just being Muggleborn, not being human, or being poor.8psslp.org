Canon in my opinion seems to depict wizarding society as only having prejudices against Muggleborns and non-human species. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I really can't see depictions of direct sexism, racism (skin-colour based), or even nationalism. So I was wondering if there are fics where being Muggleborn is fine, but being black or Asian isn't.


** I can remember some pseudo-nationalism in aunt Muriel, who expressed some displeasure in Fleur's frenchness.

Other than that, magic is a gopd equalizer. The real world -isms wouldn't have much effect there.

** There's one fanfic series that is based entirely off the concept that witches are socially better than wizards, but I can't remember what it's called. Wizards were forcefully bound to multiple witches to keep their power in check, and witches held all the political power.

As for canon, there's not really any overt discrimination other than the Muggle-born stuff and some occasional 'ooh, that French veela'. I think some of Rowling's own biases did end up seeping through though--not saying she's racist or sexist, just that there are two Asians in the entire series (Cho Chang and Su Lin) and both ended up in Ravenclaw, the house of smart people.

** Patron linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has muggleborn prejudice, but there is also significant discrimination against say non-humans such as Veelas and werewolves, far more than is depicted in canon at least.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a number of prejudices. Werewolves are far more prejudiced than canon here, though there is a good reason why (no spoilers). Additionally, Hagrid and similar half-breeds are prejudiced against for /very different reasons/ than in canon (hint: Lady Echidna).

The Firebird Trilogy also has a LOT of prejudices. Muggles are particularly disparate here, because magicals are so different they are actually a separate species (read to see what I mean). Additionally, races like the centaurs and goblins are theorized to be the by-products of ancient magic or experiments such as the work of the Zoroastrian magi during the Achaemanid Empire.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** To be precise, racism in "Patron" is different in each country. Veela are considered purebloods in France and don't face discrimination there while the British don't consider them purebloods. In Bulgaria, they are seen as "wizard stealing" creatures. Werewolves are shunned and feared (and worse) in Britain, but in Magical Scandinavia, they are respected and adored, and generally community leaders.
