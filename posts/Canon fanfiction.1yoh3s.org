Hello all,

I'm looking for fan-fiction that is or mostly is in lone with the canon. Any good ones out there?

Thanks in advance


** Virtually every fic by little0bird (its canon and epilogue compliant, and they exist in their own little verse)

**** I should probably note that each fic run on a separate timeline (posting wise), not as sequels to each other. Her earlier side-fics and oneshots aren't 100% canon in character names, but for the main ones they're fairly updated canon wise(Aside from Draco marrying Daphne instead of Astoria, and George Katie instead of Angelina off the top of my head). Out of the main series fics, only The First Day is finished. The rest are still WIP, although she updates fairly frequently.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is a prolific writer who trades only in canon fanfic. He's very talented and many of his stories exist in their own (canon-compliant) universe.

*** Up until the final battle. It derails off canon heavily with character deaths at that point. And the sequel is definitely not canon.

**** Yeah I ignored the sequel and I'd forgotten about the last battle scene.

** Protip: Once you find a canon-compliant writer, visit his or her Favorite Authors tab (especially on ff.net) and also reviewers who comment favorably. Chances are, those authors are like-minded and you can expand your own list.

*** THIS. I know that at least for me, all my favorite stories are canon-compliant.
