There's an old thought-experiment about "what would have happened if baby Superman had landed in the Soviet Union instead of the United States?" Well, in that spirit, I ask you this: how different would the HP universe look if "the brightest witch of her age" didn't oh so conveniently happen to be on the good guys' side? Show me the best fics with this theme that you can find, please.

Crackfics are OK too, since there is a certain morbid humor to be found in the idea of Hermione Granger being a Death Eater (or whatever the Muggleborn equivalent would be). For instance, imagine her saying: "Oh, for heaven's sake! You're all doing it wrong! It's CrUcio, not CruciO!"


** I posted this a week ago:

If Hermione were a Death Eater, this is [[https://i.redd.it/scttpy8q9ffy.jpg][what should have happened]].

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** Hermione isn't one of them, but Muggleborns persecute Purebloods in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/]]), Reverse.

I /think/ she was the equivalent of a Death Eater in Warrior's Heir (where purebloods are also persecuted). Maybe. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4343191/]])

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
