First things first, when I say well written I mean well written. I am looking for some serious quality if you can give it to me, I am looking for mature (as in actually mature not just rated M) stories with as realistic as possible depictions of romance. I am not interested in anything from before 4th year and would prefer 6th year or later, any time before that is just too young to be able to have what I'm looking for and not be ridiculously unrealistic. (To clarify, by realistic I mean that characters interact in a way that is recognizable as something that could happen in the real world). I am NOT interested in smut fics, they have their place in fanfiction but I am just not interested in that at the moment. If you have anything that involves someone who isn't regularly paired with harry (aka the Patils, Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Tracey Davis, Katie Bell, etc.) send it my way.

*Some specific things I am looking for:*

1: No Slash. Nothing wrong with it but I don't swing that way

2: Harry as the main character. Dude had a shit life, He deserves some good karma.

3: No Harry/Ginny as the main pairing. Nothing against it but if I wanted to read well written Hinny I'd just read the books

3.5: if you have a choice between recommending a Harry/Hermione fic or a Harry/Other Character fic, please pick the "Other Character". Got nothing against Harmony but variety is the spice of life and all that.

4: Little to no smut. I personally prefer my romance to focus more on the emotional side than the physical side.

5: Nothing that centers around angst. I just don't find it fun to read

6: Preferably something that has the romance as the main focus of the story.

7: lastly, please try to only rec fics over 20k words. I like oneshots and short stories as much as anyone else, but I am looking for something to sink my teeth into. No limit to how long it can be, but please don't rec something over 500k words without checking if it is abandoned.

*Here are some examples of the kind of romance I'm looking for.*

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12952598/1/What-We-Lost][What We Lost by JacobApples]]

I know I'm asking for a lot but I am pretty sure you can help me out here. Besides, this kind of romance is rather a rarity in fanfiction, now we have an excuse to collect a ton of it in one place.


** Following this. I'm also looking for a good, long romance.

In the current FF scene, I think it's safer to assume it won't be finished than to be certain it will be.

***** Yes, the first paragraph is a framing device that lines up with the final chapter. The while thing does play heavily into the whole "Lords and ladies" thing, but does it from a rather unique perspective. For one thing, they are all nearly or already adults. For another, the concept of "becoming the Lord of your house" is seen as something one must grow into. It is a legitimate adult thing, and as such the characters have to leave behind childishness in order to properly fulfill the role their ancestors left them. The author knows these are very young characters, and throughout the story he makes it a point to ensure that they aren't just all of a sudden super powerful and respected, nor do they always know what they're doing. If they want the respect of their peers they have to earn it. And order to earn it they have to grow up. And they do so. In this fic wizarding society is presented as an actual culture with history and rules and legitimately respected traditions and ways of doing things, not just a wish fulfillment tool.

The main character is Daphne Greengrass, this is probably the best way do this as it means that the characters perspective is one that is within the culture, and therefore doesn't have to constantly compare it to our culture to measure it's value. Instead this story asks you to look at this wizarding society of lords and ladies and deliberately imbalanced power structures, and judge it by its own merits rather than by how it compares to something else. It asks this, and then delivers the goods and shows the reader that this society does have value, both within the setting, and on a grander scale as something a serious story can be written about.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart.

There may be a bit of angst in some of them, but not the point, just phases in which the character has to go through. This happens mostly on What we Lost, To Be loved, A Beautiful lie and Stepping Back. Definitely not worth skipping just for a couple of chapters of less than mild angst.

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

  An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. Disclaimer: The usual bla3x..
