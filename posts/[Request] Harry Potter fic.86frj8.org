Here what I remember instead of going to the Dursley. Harry ends up on the door step up a dimension traveler witch shops. She take his scar (along with the horcux) as payment for giving him passage as well as a clay cat man guardian. Each year at his birthday they head to a new dimension. It including such places as pokemon Gotham city and he chronologies this in a journal with pictures and life tips etc in it from various characters. Any Idea what it is?
