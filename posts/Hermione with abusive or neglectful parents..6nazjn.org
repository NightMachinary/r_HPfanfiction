I have read one or these kinds of stories once before and i really enjoyed the premiss of our favorite book worm having abusive or neglectful parents, i dont know why...but can you guys recommend me some fics with this as either a subplot or major plot development? No Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione though please

(Posted from my phone sorry for grammar or spelling)


** Viewing things more clinically, when a fic has an Abused!Protagonist, writers seem to fall into three loose categories:

1. No consequences: the character isn't really affected by it. Canon basically does that with Harry being neglected by the Dursleys.
2. Woobiefication: the character emerges as reticent and unassertive, and spends the fic as the proverbial damsel in distress. If the character is male, they are often 'shipped with another male character. (I don't like that stereotype, personally, but enough people apparently do that it's done a lot.)
3. Badassification: the character emerges as a scrappy badass whose main area of angsty contemplation is about how badly he or she should destroy his or her enemies.

As one might expect, for Harry, most fics go with 1, and most of the remainder go with 3 (though I may be working from a biased sample here). With Hermione, her being abused or neglected at home isn't canon, so there aren't many 1s (because authors have to go out of their way to point out that she has been abused or neglected, but then do nothing with it), and most of the rest are 2s. 3s are rare, and appear to involve Slytherin-worship and Dumbledore-bashing far more than they should.

Does anyone know of Abused/Neglected!Hermione fics where she's a scrappy badass, /but/ there is no Manipulative!Dumbledore and other Dumbledore-bashing or Slytherins suddenly turning out to be nicer than Gryffindors?

I'm going to disagree with that: Harry does have a lot of emotional issues throughout the series, the most notable being OotP, and while it could partly be inherited from his parents, a lot of it tends to be bottled up, because he still thinks people will scorn him for it. He can also act aloof a lot, which kind of shows signs of emotional abuse. Obviously the fate hanging over his head doesn't help, but I think saying the neglect and emotional abuse at the hands of the Dursleys didn't affect him is a bit ridiculous.

It's also important to remember Rowling timeskipped a lot, so it's possible a lot of this stuff happened off-screen. It would get a bit old reading about Harry trying to come to terms with that shit, the reason OoTP includes that stuff is mainly because it happens around important plot points.

**** My sense is that there is nothing in Harry's attitude in OotP that couldn't be better explained by him being a moody teenager under a lot of stress. For it to be considered an effect of abuse, we have to ask how many /non-abused/ teenagers would behave this way in that situation; and my sense is that many would.

And, well, when Hagrid comes to pick him up, he is easygoing and smart-alecky. I am not an expect on psychology of abused children, but it doesn't strike me as symptomatic of a history of abuse.

***** I mean, I was heavily emotionally abused as a child and it only made me dig in my heels more, which made me a bigger target, etc. Harry is traumatized as HELL and the only reason he was able to cope is LITERAL compartmentalization; when he was in the Wizarding World, the Dursleys and his previous life didn't exist and it's all he thinks about when he's with them in the summers. One could say he has self-destructive tendencies and a disregard for his own life because he sees himself as expendable. I could go on.

****** I'm not going to argue with your experience, but I don't buy that characterization of Harry's behavior: what was he supposed to do, spend his time meditating on the dreariness of Dursleys? And, throughout canon, various characters had risked and even sacrificed their lives for others.

On a more Doylist level, I don't think that Rowling meant to portray Harry as having been traumatized by the abuse. The Dursleys, those Muggliest of Muggles, both fearing the unknown and profoundly unimaginative, those bumbling "evil step parents", were not meant to be taken seriously and neither were their actions meant to be meaningful or consequential. One might as well lambaste Bugs Bunny for dropping an anvil on Daffy Duck's head.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

**** It could have been amazing.

Consider: you have a brilliant and powerful (whatever that means), yet profoundly messed up student showing up at Hogwarts out of the Muggle world, and being sorted into Slytherin. Remind you of anyone? It would certainly remind Dumbledore of his second greatest failure.

What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Tom Riddle? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others --- that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally --- perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

Of course, what he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.

- Learning about the mind arts and Memory Charms makes her alternately giddy and paranoid.
- A few days after Draco turns them in during the Norberta escapade, he's found beaten to a bloody pulp, with "snitches get stitches" written on a note next to him. Naturally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron all have ironclad alibis.

**** I don't know. Is that your reading? I think it could go either way. Maybe she always had trans tendancies and the parents went overboard with the girliness to suppress it, or maybe she was just kind of a tomboy who would normally have grown into canon Hermione in a loving environment, but went full trans as a reaction to her parent's insistance she be a traditional female.

***** I mean, that's not how being trans works... Our medical understanding of people who are trans isn't that great, but from what we can tell, pre-natal hormone exposure plays a significant role. Basically, if someone is trans, they're that way from birth. People notice at different points in their life and dysphoria manifests itself in different ways (I personally experienced very minor things as a child, and then dysphoria grew exponentially as I went through puberty, and on the other side of the coin you have people who don't really understand that part of themselves until middle age), but basically my point is you can't just say something in his life caused him to become transgender. It's not like schizophrenia that way.

That said, I haven't actually read the story, so maybe it's written that way. If that's the case I think that's a pretty glaring flaw in the storytelling.

****** I'm no authority, but I think it varies. What you describe exists, naturally, but is it the case for all people who decide to become trans? I don't know. As a general firm believer in nurture versus nature, I'd tend to think that while natural /tendancies/ may exist, individuals always have free will on what gender they want to be.

******* I want to keep this polite that there's really no other way to say this besides you're just wrong. Literally since before I knew there were differences between boys and girls I've been unhappy (to the point of daydreaming about self mutilation) with my genitals simply because my brain is wired to expect the other parts. If trans people had a choice in this none of us would be making the choice to be trans. We risk losing all of our friends and family, if we have a spouse then almost certainly them, we're discriminated against in public, the work place, at home, the bathroom, the doctor. We can't escape it. The legal difficulties are very extreme for many trans people all over the world. Every time I mention im trans to someone I'm interested in romantically I get to watch all the interest suddenly leave them, and usually disgust replace it. When that doesn't happen they often end up fetishizing me and are only interested in sex, and sex that makes me viscerally want to mutilate my own body at that, but that never stops them from becoming creepy, because they and you objectivize trans people into people who do this by choice and invalidate their feelings. When people don't immediately lose interest then I get to play the fun game of figuring out whether they're genuine or just want to rape me, or sleep with me but have no interest in dating, or even murder me.

None of this is exaggerated. Go look at suicide rates for trans people who don't transition vs those who do. It saves tons of lives, because this isn't a choice we get to make, it's something decided for us long before we're able to make any choices at all.

It's not something we get to decide, and when you say that it is you disrespect all of us.

******** You know, I just realized this whole argument is somewhat unfounded either way because /Session Transcripts/'s Hermione is transvestite and transgender but not trans/sexual/. She just dresses and behaves like a boy, but there's no physical operation involved. And that level of commitment can easily be achieved by non-naturally-transgender people.

********* Most people who are assigned female at birth don't under go GCS/SRS primarily because of cost limitations. While phalloplasties are an option and you can achieve results that are undiscernable from people born with penises, they range from just extremely expensive all the way to completely unrealistically affordable for the non-rich. Also, lots of transgender people don't use the word transsexual. You see it used more commonly by older trans people, and they are typically the ones who also make a definition between those that have had GCS and those that haven't, but younger (think like 30 and down) tend to use the word transgender for everyone regardless of how much or little someone transitions.

I challenge you to find a local endo or gp that will prescribe estrogen and an anti androgen or testosterone for you (which in and of itself can be an extremely difficult task) and take it for 3 months and still be of the opinion that being trans is something you choose. There are documented cases of people who are not trans undergoing HRT either due to medical necessity or because of another diagnosis causing fixation on being the other gender while not actually being trans. To a one the all begin to experience gender dysphoria as their body adapts and starts to change. I expect that very quickly you will realize that this isn't something you can choose.

******* You think gender dysphoria is something people choose? It's a serious illness with a huge suicide rate, not a shirt you can take off.

*** I like the idea of her parents being emotionally abusive ie your not good enough etc or ignoring her after they find out shes a wich its adds a bit of conflict to stories where she is one of the protagonists without the whole "im a muggleborn" and "smartwst witch of her age" being the only forms of conflict to draw on. Its why even though i despise the dursleys treatment of harry i understand why authors ramp it up in their stories.
