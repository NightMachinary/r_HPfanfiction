And what are their pros/cons?

I'm reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5269970/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Key-Reloaded][*Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded*]]). It's /alright/.

Pros:

- It has an interesting plot, so far
- Some decent character interactions; has pairings but romance isn't in-your-face
- Dumbledore actually seems powerful and not trying to manipulate Harry
- Haven't noticed any spelling or grammar errors yet
- So far, seems like a nice change for an OOTP fic - it's not a canon rehash in the least

Cons: (subjective, obviously)

- Dramione (from what it seems like right now)
- Guilty, angsty, self-blaming Harry tends to grate on nerves
- Magi, though this might be a pro if this is why you're reading the fic
- Guilty, angsty, self-blaming Harry almost always means unintelligent Harry, which is the case here too
- Harry seems to be desperately trying to reveal his life secrets to the world while at the same time telling people he can't tell them his life secrets
- Everyone but the main cast is an NPC incapable of anything beyond basic thoughts or background ambiance, leading to an unrealistic plot device allowing the author to leverage "mob mentality" in unrealistic ways to advance the plot


** I recently finished Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106), and it was probably the funniest thing I've ever read. Some parts seemed just plain silly, but some of the humor was also very clever. The author mixed it well.

** Reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10150152/1/Through-the-Veil-Strangely]]). Recently updated, and I hadn't read on the last update so I have two chapters to run through. I remember liking what I'd seen in the first two chapters. It's a fun, weird, lighthearted fic and seems to be staying so from what I've read so far. It's a pseudo-crossover, so might not be for HP purists.

** Just finished /[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7149][Three Seasons to Closure]]/ by hummingbird, a slow-moving post-Hogwarts H/Hr romance that I really enjoyed. Lots of confused friendship, a nice sense that they're just getting to know each other again after some time isolated from everyone and everything, and just enough non-romance plot to show that time is passing and the characters have other things on their mind.

If you're not into romances that develop on a glacial timescale---"Boy, we spend a lot of wonderful Saturdays together and our other relationships never work but I /know/ we don't see each other that way" is the operating idea here, a sort of pre-fluff fluff---you won't get much out of it. But I loved the characterizations, the writing, and the little touches in the world (it begins at a Muggle street festival celebrating the end of the disturbances they believe to have been a gang war), and, well, pre-fluff fluff is why I'm here.

Hadn't noticed it before now because (as you'll notice from the absent of FanfictionBot) it appears to be only on FictionAlley and Portkey.

Hopefully featuring the secondary group of Broomstick Riders of the Apocalypse- No Alcohol Firewhiskey, S.P.E.W, Ministry Corruption, Muggles/Digusting Lesser Halfbreeds/Uppity Mudbloods/that guy who keeps changing their name.\\
^{edit:} finished, sadly no backup singers of the apocalypse, story petered out towards the end but there's a sequel that crosses over with Sandman's Lucifer, no Mazikeen as yet.

Also added a couple more humor/crack fics to my alerts list-

linkffn(A Draconic Circumstance by bleubirdsong), a Temeraire xover where Voldemort and Harry get conscripted into the aerial corps as partners.

linkffn(Warning: Past Soul Bind Performance Not Indicative of Future Prophets) featuring a dimension jumping MoD!Harry who treats each life as a game do-over and awards himself points.

** Well, since I saw it mentioned a while ago, I have been checking out Harry Potter and the Third Key as well. The writer is decent to be honest, but on the latter part of the story he seems to be getting lost in expositionary tangents quite frequently. And I don't really get it, cause he was doing really well in the beginning.

linkffn(11537837) /Path to Victory -- A Severus Snape Story/ by Sir Rabby. Especially enjoyable for /Worm/ fans. Comes across as a bit OP, but it's OP in a new way, and there are obstacles. I'm glad the author chose Snape for this story, it introduces a lot of interesting pureblood interactions, history, etc

  In Worm you might gain phenomenal powers on your worst day. Snape snapped after the werewolf incident and triggered with Path to Victory, the power that tells you the steps necessary to attain any goal. It's not very serious but I don't think I'll let this turn to crack. I'll keep at this until I'm bored or Snape becomes God-King of the Universe. Whichever happens first!

** I just finished reading and taking notes on the first two chapters of mia_ugly's WiP However I Fall linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3979873/chapters/8932390]]), a Snape/Harry fic that displays a beauty and compassion similar to Rapture linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]), the work she's best known for.

HIF is a story of diverging timelines, beginning with Snape's potential death in the Shrieking Shack (potential because in one timeline, he survives). There's a mystery developing that involves mutilated antiquarian books and the dangerous instructions they contain, and another mystery surrounding the confused feelings of the protagonists (one of whom, in one timeline, is a painting on a wall). One thread is from Snape's POV, the other from Harry's, and the perspectives switch back and forth.

In Mia's inimitable and heartfelt fashion, the fic humanizes Snape in ways I suspect Snape-haters would utterly reject. I usually prefer Snape to remain in the general vicinity of bastardliness, but I embrace Mia's Snape without reservation, because she writes about love in a way few other fic writers do, and I will follow her anywhere. I'm taking notes so I can leave a comment later, when I have more time, because I desperately want her to continue this.

ETA: Hmm, that's weird. The ffbot is picking up Rapture's chapter titles, not just the title of the fic itself.
