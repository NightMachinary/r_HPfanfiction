anyone here ever read fanfictions that bash or rip apart hp fanfiction cliches or show realistically what would happen in real life?

here's a few examples

1. harry tries to boss around people or tell adults what to do but he finds out that they will just ignore or punish him and he's not a gary stu realistically

2. the classic love potion idea with harry and hermione being given potions is torn apart, they show that sometimes people do fall in love like that and there's no potions or anything weird happening

3. Harry tries to disobey dumbledore or show he is better or whatever and dumbledore easily destroys him or tears him a new one because he is a man with several decades of experience and harry would have no real way to beat him after a bit of training or gaining skills

4. harry learns that he can't be emancipated if he is 11 or whatever underage age he is and that he would have to have a guardian look after him and no person would let harry live alone

5. harry does has money but he can't use it all because of his age, also he doesn't own hundreds of mansions or is head of different houses or that he even owns hogwarts because hogwarts was meant as a public school , not some place he could own or buy or tell who can enroll there and who can't

6. harry finds out that getting angry and yelling at people or ranting doesn't work in the real world and would anger people, also doing that in front of people and trying to do that to dumbledore won't work in reality because he could easily just silence and bind harry an make his body sit down and be quiet

you get the idea of the anti cliche fanfictions so anyone know fanfics that are like this?


** I have major beef with this:

Bad guys break out all kinds of nasty spells, fire off endless salvos of unforgivables, while good guys could only muster stupifies and protegos in return.

That's just pathetic. Please take a look at how our real life cops respond to violent criminals, and how the Allies beat up the Axis in WW2.

You can't beat evil by being a wimp.

*** Ironically, one of the truest quotes from HP is from Quirrel in Philosopher's Stone;

#+begin_quote
  There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
#+end_quote

You can't beat evil. There is no evil, nor any good. The Allies didn't defeat evil, they defeated their enemies.

#+end_quote

I usually use what I call a Mentor, or a guardian in the Muggle World to take care of things who wouldn't understand why they are Emancipated. Also, if I do Emancipate Harry at that age, he usually has house-elves or older friends (like Sirius) who are usually there with him. Emancipation doesn't simply mean one has to live alone. It gives him freedoms.

As I understand it, it gives you a specific legal status. But part of that status is that you don't have a legal guardian who has authority over you. I don't need to explain why an 11-year-old who can do magic and is not required to be supervised is a /very/ bad idea, do I?

** Reminds me of Alexandra Quick. She does a whole bunch of crazy shit, and she gets in massive trouble for it, averting a whole bunch of HP-canon cliches.
