Hey, it is me again, and I would like to see if Harold (instead of Harry Potter) has any good fics. I know this SubReddit really really does not like Harold. So do these fics exist? And can I get some links? Harold fics are Harry Potter fanfictions in which harry's name is changed. These are commonly harold Potter in slytherin, or Inheritance/Heir to the Founders concepts. /EDIT/ added definition of Harold Potter fics.


** Excuse my ignorance but, who is Harold Potter?

*** Harold is a name used in fics where the author thinks Harry is a commoner's name for some one who is Heir to the Potter, Black, Slytherin, Gryfindor, Ravenclaw, Grindelwald, Peverell, Merlin lines. He also is probably friends with the goblins has access to a few billions of galeons, is bethored to Hermione, Cho, the Greengrass Sisters, the Patil Twins, and half the female population of hogwarts (except Ginny, Ginny is a manupulative love potion lacing slut that works for Dumbledore) and has a cool trunk that is bigger on the inside than the outside

*** Harold Potter is considered a Harry Potter whos "Real name" is Harold, and identifies as such. Harold Potter is commonly applied to fics with Inheritance, the heir to four founders, and other such cliches. I want to see if any fics are good where the protagonist is named Harold instead of Harry.

** Check out linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin). Harry's full wizarding name is Hadrian though he really just goes by Harry in everyday settings. It has the Slytherin/Heir stuff I think you're looking for. Plus it updates twice weekly and the plot is intriguing!

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

** A crossover (whose sequel seems well and truly abandoned just before the epilogue to its version of /CoS/) with F/SN, so I gave it a bit more leeway than I typically would to most fanfics that weren't crossed with one of my favorites. Was more action and crack than well-written, but still a fun read.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
