In most crossover fics, Harry recites everything in happened in his life from Dursleys to Voldemort to every person asked him, and just before revealing his story he thinks about how much he need to keep his magic secret. Mostly how much he was abused/suffered sob story for sympathy/pity from the character.

​

And I hate this, what was the need to reveal all his secrets to every good guy? To paired character I can understand, that too after their relationship was developed somewhat not at the moment he meets them.

*** Harry in canon like majority abused children, hated sharing his time with Dursleys. He never shared extent of his treatment with even with Hermione and Ron. But in fics, he tells everything to a stranger. Even worst, he was mostly senior Auror or War veteran and a reincarnation of Moody. People who works in Law Enforcement rarely reveals their past to anyone.

**** I think it strongly depends on the context of the situation. Harry randomly opening up would be indeed weird, but if the preceeding conversation goes a certain way, it wouldn't be OOC (eg Harry telling someone that he knows how awful life can be, someone questioning why Harry is very on edge/expecting something bad to happen). From there on, the conversation can go to the Dursleys or Voldemort, but it isn't the easiest set-up. And the younger Harry is, the more likely he's to open up or let something slip.

***** I agree - there's definitely a way to work it in pretty easily, I think. But personally I'd lean towards having those be fairly short interactions - offhand mentions of his past that gets slightly built upon (eg - mentioning his relatives used to put him in a closet under the stairs, or that he's used to people looking at him, or that being targeted by a dark wizard is normal to him, etc). But just going off and rambling on about his past in an expositary manner seems to be more difficult (and imo best done a while later anyways - have 2-3 moments where he discusses some small part of his background, comes to trust whoever he's talking to, and then fade to black as he goes into explaining it)

** Yeah, it really irks me too. And it never happens naturally either. He doesn't slowly reveal his past whenever it's relevant. He just loads his whole backstory onto random people.

I once read a fanfic where Harry went back in time and met Ron on the train again. Cue Ron asking about the scar and Harry going off on him about how his parents died and he was abused and got no food and locked in a cupboard and how Ron should be happy he has a family. Hermione talking about how insensitive Ron was and the fic portraying Ron as a douche because he asked about the scar and Harry as this poor orphan. But when you think about it for more than 3 seconds you realise that an adult Harry shamed an 11 year old for asking a stupid question.

** Yeah, I really hat this too. Just read a time-travel story where Harry and Hermione fought against Emperor Voldemort for ten years or so (Voldy won). Hermione died and Harry managed to travel back in time.\\
Anyway, both Harry and Hermi ended up with the full knowledge of their previous life in their bodies of the third year. They talk about how big their secret is and that they have to plan everything in order to save people etc. - the typical stuff.\\
And what do they do...?! They keep blabbering to each other how many secrets they have and were overheard two times by Malfoy and some other random idiot. They suddenly start to kiss with each other and can't stop acting like in 50 shades of grey. Their sexual tensions radiate like the aura of a Veela. And ofc, they need to tell every good guy they know. Not a week passes and McGonnangal knows about, second week Remus, and shortly after that Sirius, Moody, Tonks, Andromeda, Weasly Twins.

Idk, but I think it is the best for everyone if a time-travel Harry keeps his secrets to himself and manipulates stuff without endangering people. In most stories, Harry is some kind of war-veteran, or an experienced one shortly after he killed Voldy. He can easily chill and prepare himself until the third task of the tri-w-tourney or manipulate the vanishing cabinet event in a way where all Deatheaters end up in a huge hole full of blast-ended skewts.

And telling someone like Hermione is also bad if she is like canon and ends up running to Dumbles. She will be too young to defend herself anyway, and Harry would only put her in a state of panic and danger. The pressure of the knowledge would make her restless and Harry will end up telling his secrets to more people at the end.

Best is to simply analyze the situation and manipulate stuff in a way where he slowly builds up multiple advantages he can use when the time for action comes. Like learning more magic, body-enhancing rituals, searching for more ways to handle Voldy. By telling the secret to anyone, Harry will only lose every advantage he has. Sure another ally might be useful, but only if its someone like Nevilles Grandma or another adult who can REALLY help Harry. Sirius is a good guy, but he is limited due to his situation. He can help Harry train, but that he will do anyway without knowing the secret - it would also help cover up his sudden gain of knowledge and combat experience.

*** Thank you for pointing out the third task part. For a time travelling Harry, especially one with battle experience, its the easiest damn plot to foil. You can oust crouch the day of the trial, have back up at the graveyard or just very simply beat wormtail in a duel.

**** IDK - depending on where in time he got brought back, the 3rd task sounds like an overly long amount of time. For instance, prior to 3rd year, you'd have to expect him to want to get Sirius out of prison ASAP and catch Pettigrew. Prior to 1st year, he knows that Voldemort is on the back of Quirrel's head and that the diary is in Malfoy's hands - so that seems like just as easy a point to try to trap voldemort than waiting.

There'd need to be a reason why he would decide not to interfere prior to that, IMO - the obvious one being if he got brought back to 4th year.

***** Ah sorry probably didn't explain myself properly. I'm not a fan of time travel fics where they do nothing but I've seen a lot of fics where the consequences of the final task happen exactly the same (Voldemort resurrected, someone probably dies) and it doesn't make sense to me.

If we're talking time travel war Harry then the only things that could beat him is quirrell, basilisk, dragon and adult Voldemort I believe

****** Ah, I see what you mean then. Yeah, those types of stories don't always make the most sense.

Though a time travel war Harry doesn't necessarily have to be /that/ strong - I could easily see him still being a bit below the better fighters (eg, Bellatrix and Snape) or roughly on par with them, instead of being as strong as Dumbledore/Voldemort. Another way is to up the difficulty against him - making the rank and file death eaters much better in cooperation, or using dark magic/rituals to be more of a threat, etc. More fun to up the difficulty than to handwave away the final task happening exactly the same way IMO!

Or they could use Canon War Vet Harry, who isn't exactly top tier. Just in case I'll put my arguement as a spoiler.

>! He didn't win on power levels, or massive skill. He won on luck, pure and simple. Other than the patronus we never actually see his "power" and skill wise just about everyone has him beat as the only times he appears to actually try and learn is for the first task and maybe for the DA. The DoM is mostly running from and using schoolboy magic on hardened criminals....!<

Ohh god please no. I hate this. It makes absolutely no sense. Unless Harry is an idiot and gives away all his secrets to the enemy, they would have absolutely no reason to do the rituals, or learn to work together better. They are all arrogant, and fully believe that they are superior to those "not of pure blood" even with ample evidence against the notion.

This kind of thing really puts me off a story... I'll use another fandom as an example. If you have a Naruto fic where he actually learns/time travels/can finally tie his shoes by himself, most authors then go down the "up the difficulty" route by making "I'm an unbeatable("no no, Itachi didn't beat me, i don't know what your talking abouty...Hanzo? I'm alive and thus he didn't beat me either...") immortal" Orochimaru, or "Call me God" Pein apparently decide a wet behind the ears genin is such a threat to them that they need to get stronger/take him seriously.

It's basically a cheap anti-OP tactic used by writers that can't adjust the story for a stronger MC with out it. The problem with HP is that the "bad guys" are so inept they couldn't win against a competent opponent. Sadly the "good guys" were thus made incapable.

******** For the first part, true - though I admit I think of the 'war veteran Harry's subgenre as one where the war - win or lose - lasted several years of heavy fighting. One where Harry would have seen significantly more fighting than in canon, at least.

For the making the enemy stronger, I mean more structurally - and likely in an AU sense. For instance, obviously it's already different from canon in the first timeline - and if we're making Harry comparatively overpowered, I don't mind upping the threat he faces.

Like you note, the bad guys are written in canon as incredibly inept. That makes it very easy to up the difficulty by making them /competent/ - which is very different from your Naruto example, where it's just BS powering up in a heavy handed way. I can see how the suggestion of rituals might strike you as leading to that, but I was meaning it more as a way to justify how magically weaker opponents might pose a threat on a different axis. There's certainly enough space in the dark arts to allow for such methods, imo.

(Basically, time travel AU makes the good guy competent - so if we want the bad guys to be a threat, they also need to be made competent, and so need to be powered up in some way imo. Plus I personally prefer reading about competent antagonists anyways!)

How else are all the guys supposed to feel shame for thinking anything negative about him and giving him over the top respect? How else are we supposed to identify the bad guys by the ones who ignore or mock his past...especially if they are the canon/fanon pairing that the author doesn't like?

** I actually have more of a pet peeve when this happens the other way around. Crossover fics have the other character always talking about their entire life story to the trio and it's annoying. Also, Hermione always manages to find just about everything from the library which is ridiculous for a lot of crossovers.

** I agree with this in general; that sort of emotional openness is entirely OOC for Harry, who wasn't even candid with Ron and Hermione. It's poor writing to use that sort of shortcut to ramp up intimacy/friendship among characters.

However, one thing should be considered: as an adult who has worked through his painful childhood, the facts of the abuse would hold less power over Harry. I speak from the experience of eight years of therapy; things I couldn't have discussed earlier no linger are painful to speak of now. It's just fact, and I don't feel victimized to speak of things done to me. But it's true I wouldn't be open with strangers or mere acquaintances, although if I were trying to counsel someone, I might.
