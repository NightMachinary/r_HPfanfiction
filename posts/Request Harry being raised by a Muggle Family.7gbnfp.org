Now note if it's the Granger's that he's raised by I do NOT want Harry and Hermione to end up together, never understood that. I know they aren't brother and sister but if they were raised together I'm sure that they wouldn't be together romantically, they'd think of each other as brother and sister.

And of course I'm not talking about the Dursley's, any Muggle family that isn't the Dursley's.

Can have any Muggle family raise him, not just the Grangers.

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Any rating, am fine with het/slash/femslash

No Character bashing

No Harry suddenly being super powerful or super smart, a little more powerful or smart then he was in canon is okay just don't make it unbelievable.


** Linkffn(12212363)

Harry is possibly smarter than he was in canon, but he also isn't quite as good at magic. And he's very much an eleven-year-old boy--the initial scenes when his family interacts with the Weasleys highlight this well.

There's a few of the fix!fic tropes present here, but they're relatively minor.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete, sequel coming soon.

Unless you know,... you're into that stuff.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
