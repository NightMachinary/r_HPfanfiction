Since I want to try my hand at writing, which will probably start as fanfiction and see what happens from there, I want to know what makes the Main Character stand out and get you interested. I.E; Personality? Traits? Quirks? Looks?

I just want to know on your opinions on what makes the main character likeable, if you want to go along and say his closest friends as well.

I just want some tips to look out for, as well as what to avoid when it comes to the main character, I would also like a nice description on why you chose what you did.

Since I am on the Spectrum (Aspergers, Autism, Pervasive Development Disorder) I would like to my character from that point of view, someone who isn't all that social and rather awkward and sometimes ignored due to how different he is.

*ALSO*

If any of you have a fic that has Harry as a Quidditch star rather than his Auror work, please link them to me. Pairings don't have to be necessary for the fic, although that is up to you.

No Yaoi or Male Slash stuff though, not that I am against it, just not a huge fan of it.


** I'd recommend Sanderson's lectures on writing, and in particular [[https://youtu.be/lpsR4Q57RME?t=943][this part on character is a good primer]].

Likeability / interesting is usually dependent on, in no particular order:

1. *Believability*- they seem like a real person, with flaws and goals and a real personality. They are well rounded, they fit the setting, they go somewhere, or at least attempt to.
2. *Competency* - typically if the main character is /good/ at something, they are more likeable. You have to be careful with this, though, as someone who is good at everything is boring to read. The opposite can be true, as well, if the character feels they are terrible at everything, which earns some sympathy points (like writing a Neville POV) -- but again, you can't take this too far -- everyone is "good" at something (even Neville!), or else why are we reading about them?
3. *Relatability* - are they like me? Do they have the same type of humor, or make similar jokes me or my friends would? Are they serious about things like I am, do they grandstand on issues they feel passionate about? This one is tricky, but basically you want to carve out a few character traits and make sure you stick with them; people who are often snarky don't just forget their snarkiness all the time, sometimes they lean into it at the worst possible moment. Some people get on soapboxes with no prompting. Work a customer service job sometime and you see all types; the funny, the insane, the pointlessly rhetorical. This is probably the main one, but is also the one that will hit or miss with most people, because you can alienate people
4. *Special-ness* - Harry has this in spades, but you can get away with a lot when a character is "destined" for something. The trope wears thin if you don't have enough of the other traits, but it counts.
5. *Secrets* - mysterious characters are interesting. It can be difficult to hide information from the audience, but it can pay off if you do it well. Drop lots of hints at a secret and reveal it if you want people to like a character better (read: Snape).
6. *Underdog* - everyone likes the underdog. Most MCs in most stories are underdogs for most of the story, so take that as you will.
7. *Proactivity* - protagonists DO things! The plot doesn't just happen to them all the time, they often instigate it, typically in the latter half of a story.
8. *Changes* - mixes into the others, but are they affected by their world, actions, and repercussions? Do they grow? Do they refuse to change, and that is a defining trait?

You can see there's a lot of overlap in many of these, but traits people like in characters are basically things we like in our friends, taken to an extreme, and dropped in the setting we are trying to tell.

Sanderson points out there are 3 main scales he uses for characters: Competency, Likability, and Proactivity: we like people who are competent, likable, and proactive, but maxing someone out on all those scales would be tiring.

** For me it's plain and simply a character who is entertaining to watch. A character who is boring to follow is a story that a reader can walk away from. How you make them interesting is up to you, easiest ways to do it I've found are making them comedy-based or cute, but mysterious characters can also be intriguing by having them reveal their true selves over the course of a story. A lot of FanFiction authors, screen writers and myself included can get so overwhelmed stitching together unique plots that they then forget to make their characters actually likeable to watch. It's actually a topic the film industry is suffering with quite a lot these days.

Having representation is good and all, but recently it's being used in Hollywood as an excuse to write disinteresting low-effort characters. Giving a character a different race/sexuality is seen as a personality trait, and I feel the term ‘representation' suffers from that. Not to mention the amount of boring blockbusters with stonefaced lead characters that, I don't know, we're meant to project into because they're badass? Or that's the intention, I believe, whereas in reality they're just boring.

I'm very much a substance over spectacle person, I much prefer the smaller character-driven stories over bigger, complex plots. The best ones, of course, are the ones to get the big between the two, like Harry Potter and Star Wars. They manage to have their characters stand on their own and fail at being boring; despite their fantasy and sci-fi themes, their characters feel real and like you really know them.

It seems to me that what this person is saying has very little to do with what you're claiming they are: their point is that a if character's . . . well, /character/ starts and ends with "gay," or "black," or "autistic" or anything along those lines, it'll result in uninteresting non-characters defined by stereotypes. It seems more like OP is arguing for more characters like, for instance, Captain Holt from B99: he's a gay black man whose character is very much informed by his being gay and black, but if you took away anything having to do with race and sexuality, you'd still have a fully fleshed out character with enough quirks and hangups to be a valuable addition to the show's ensemble.

** Characters who aren't pretentious or take themselves too seriously and can be silly sometimes. Characters who are consistent to their personalities.

Wittiness and charm and things like that will come with practice, but I think it's important to have a clear sight to your character's personality traits and motivations and circumstances, so that even if you change them, you can trace back from what they were originally like.

** I think that there are a few methods to do it. First, they (and their reactions) have to be relatable to me. That doesn't necessarily mean /realistic/, but it should be something that we can understand. That's already part of the charm of the main series, since Harry is really just a normal person.

Secondly, there should be something where I feel for the character. An easy way to do that is with some sort of hardship - using canon Harry as another example, he's very easy to look at in that light - the way the Dursleys treat him, his lack of knowledge about his history/parents, etc. It's all priming us to feel a bit sorry for him, and to be /happy/ when something good happens to him.

Then there's the things to avoid. For me, the big ones are viciousness/pettiness (in a /mean/ way), and excessive usage of angst. The first ones are fairly self-explanatory - it's hard to /like/ a character if they're constantly lashing out at everyone around them in a genuinely mean way. If you're making it more funny/less serious, that's different - for instance, compare the way that we view the Weasley twins (constantly pranking and making fun of everyone) compared to the reaction from the one flasback scene of James bullying Snape (and the petty viciousness/bullying there). If you make them a good person, it's also easier to root for them (just like making them not self-centered)

For excessive angst, I'd point towards the levels seen in OOTP. Personally, it's my least favorite HP book, simply because it's too full of Harry moping and feeling sorry for himself, and pushing his friends away. Including some amounts of that is perfectly fine, but making it stretch on too long is just... well, it's not for me.

Most everything else can be tweaked - but don't overdo some of the personality traits/quirks. Having some in there add greatly to the fun, but if a character becomes basically defined by a single quirk (or 1-3) it's hard to view them as a person. Like a Luna that only exists to spout nonsensical, quirky phrases is not a very interesting character - but a Luna that is written with that as a part of her character /is/.

Luna actually makes for a great example - she's an inherently likable character in my experience, which is why she's so commonly used in fanfics. She has a background that's sympathetic (her family history, her early bullying in Ravenclaw, lack of friends), she has a unique personality that usually feels strangely upbeat/positive, and she's usually /fun/ to see when she pops up. But at the same time, she can also be fairly easy to mess up - if instead of feeling like a person with a unique/quirky personality, she feels like just a walking quirk. It's the same thing with the Twins - injecting some humor here and there while also being actual people is a way to make them very likable characters, particularly if all their pranks are more for fun and not actually harmful/mean. But make that their entire personality, where they're walking pranks and nothing else, and suddenly they're flat and hard to /really/ like as characters.

** Any character that has proper development is interesting and good to read for me. They don't have to be "likable" so long as there is there are reasons for them to be the way they are. These reasons don't have to even be explicitly outlined. Just as a characters past should believably affect their actions in the narrative, their actions should believably imply their character and therefor what kind of life they must have lived. Finally, in a frustration contradiction of what i've said, it shouldn't be clean or standardized. Characters shouldn't be put into boxes, not even by a backstory.

But I don't know what I'm talking about for all my "shoulds" and "should nots."

** For the request - linkffn(Vitam Paramus) - very good story, the quidditch is really well written, and the world building is great.

For what I like in a main character:

I prefer it when a main character has both strengths an weaknesses, which balance each other out, and make up for/are countered by strength and weaknesses of the other people around them. I like to be able to imagine myself in the position of the character, but I also like to be able to imagine myself having a conversation with them. Main characters with godlike powers are uninteresting outside of parodies.

I don't mind how social a character is - provided that however social they are makes sense, and there's a valid reason behind it. I don't enjoy reading about broody characters though - constant brooding and angst just makes me bored of reading the same things over and over. Short periods of angst and broodiness make sense for certain, or even most, characters, but no one broods 100% of the time, and if you do, you more than likely have a problem.
