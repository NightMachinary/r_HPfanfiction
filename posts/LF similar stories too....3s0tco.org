linkffn(Dark Lord Potter Part 1)

Are there any fic's similar to this one, or did The Santi ever get round to writing follow ups?

I already know about The Santi's other masterpiece that is Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived.

Thanks in advance!

/EDIT/ Oh god, I've just noticed the title, i apologize profusely for the extra "O" on to.
