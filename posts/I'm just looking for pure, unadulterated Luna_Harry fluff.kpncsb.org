I don't even care if they're in a relationship so long as Luna is being Luna and Harry has no idea what the FUCK is happening but is still supportive. Thanks!


** Professor McGonagall asked Harry if he could give Luna a few tips about quidditch announcing. The whole school was aware at this point that Luna had little technical knowledge of the game, but she was certainly a fan favourite so McGonagall opted to keep her, provided she brush up on her quidditch terminology.

Harry met Luna in the quidditch stands a week before the upcoming match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. He thought it might be a good idea to bring his broom and provide real examples of quidditch moves so Luna could practice spotting them while in the announcer's box.

Half an hour into the training session:

Luna (into microphone): “It appears Harry Potter is attempting a Ronky pank”

Harry: /calls across the pitch to Luna/ “Luna! It's called a Wronski feint!”

Luna: “oh yes, I know Harry, but how do you expect to trick the other team if I say it properly?”

Harry was glad Luna couldn't see him roll his eyes across the pitch.

Luna: “On second thought, as you're against Ravenclaw maybe I should warn them”

Harry: “Oi!” *jokingly throws a practice quaffle in Luna's direction

***** I love it very much, but it's "Wronski Feint". Should still work with the joke. But it's very Luna, and the best fanfics don't change her personality too much, if at all.

** Their relationship in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] (the best HP x Firefly crossover ever) is adorable, even though Luna is dead and you really only experience it in flashbacks and when Harry tracks down her painting

#+begin_quote
  "Twelve years?" Luna repeated tapping her chin. "Are you seeing anyone?"

  Harry sighed and shook his head. "We were married for 115 years. I think I'm allowed to not move on if I don't want to."

  Luna whistled loudly. "That's a long time. So what made you finally kill me?"

  Harry rolled his eyes, having had this discussion before. "I didn't kill you. You'd been sick for a while and died comfortably in your sleep."

  ‘Hey, is everything..?' Harry began to form the question, but it dissipated into nothingness. Why was he finding this so hard? Luna had been there for him countless times, always with the right words, or lack thereof. He frowned at himself. Luna deserved a better friend. Luna deserved the kind of friend that she was to him.‘Hey, Luna,' he said, more determined this time. Luna looked up at him from where she was putting away the dishes. ‘Wanna go for a ride?'

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect.

  Harry knew Luna well...didn't he. This is a little oneshot, featuring what could have been on the night of Horace Slughorn's Christmas Party. There are no lemons, but there is a rather intense discussion of more mature themes. Just a little lighthearted snippet, with spades of fluff, along with a bit of humour (I hope?). Harry x Luna This is not stolen, read the Author's Note.
