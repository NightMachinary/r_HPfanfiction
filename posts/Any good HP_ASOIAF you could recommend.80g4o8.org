** Linkffn(A Song of Ice, Fire and Lightning by Zero Rewind)

Awesome battle scenes, interesting additions to the world of magic. You don't need to read the previous story you can hop right in.

Linkffn(The Road to Hell by seagate)

All of Hogwarts appears in the North. Good Worldbuilding, fic focuses on Harry setting up shop and becoming a power player in Westeros.

Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter)

One of the better crossovers I've read. Harry systematically dismantles Westeros by planting trees. Very good characterizations. Highly recommend.

Linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne by joen1801)

Harry discovers his magic in Westeros, he doesn't universe travel. Tywin Lannister tries to destroy the Reynes, but Harry as a baby apparates them out to safety. Harry/OC, which is well done. Not your average take over the world crossover, its solid.

Linkffn(11132113)

My personal favourite HP/GOT. Harry becomes king beyond the wall and establishes an empire. Literally the best world building I've read other than The Star Empire. This is a great read. Good establishment of a city and anticipating what problems occur with it.

Linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious)

Don't remember this one, but I know it was good. Sorry.

I would recommend my own but my own writing is far from great.

  When Tywin Lannister crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion everyone in the Kingdoms believed he ended two noble lines. But thanks to one unique infant, one Harrion Reyne called Harry by his parents, some survived.

**** I agree with you there. I really enjoyed the progression and detail of the city they built behind the wall and the usage of magic in mundane tasks. The way he was able to construct the city just really struck a chord with me I guess. Good world building is really hard to find.

My only issue with Last Lion of House Reyne is the pacing. In 140k words he really hasn't move the story along very far. Although I will admit I love the way he wrote Harry.

As for my fic?

That's because I haven't posted it to FFN yet. My Inheritance Cycle fic pushed back the publish date, it was just too much fun to write and felt like it was ready to go. This Saturday is when I'm aiming for launch. It's honestly coming together really well, I just can't get my first chapter to work right, it's driving me up the wall. I've got 20k words written and edited and the first big arc outlined. I'll PM you a link to what I have so far, feel free and read it (and roast me).

** Forgot about linkffn(The Last Hero's Heir by A Step into the Unknown)

Godric Gryffindor was contracted to stop the others the first time around. He did so, and in return the Children agreed to serve wizard for the next 1000 years. The children came to be known as house elves. At the end of the 1000 years, the house elves return to Westeros taking Harry with them. This takes place before Robert's Rebellion one of the few fics that takes place that far back. Great read.

** I would recommend "Legend of the Gryphon" just for one thing: The story shows what happens when a HP wizard with their wand appears on Planetos: They do whatever they want because the rest of the world is powerless to stop them.

"The Winter Witch" also shows that, but to a lesser degree. Many stories have the HP wizard(s) join some faction in Westeros and accept the feudal system without any explanation for why they don't simply take over.

** I feel like HP/GoT is severely lacking. I look pretty much every week for anything that's remotely interesting, and always come up empty. Like, I look at the list posted here and I can't say I like any of them, and a few of them are actively terrible. The best is probably "The Black Prince" but it's a super low bar, and I don't think I would even call it good. It got a rewrite, but all the reasons I didn't like the first version of the story are still there.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom, and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her.

*** Seconding Lion of the Rock. It was a very fun read and while Harry wasn't OP, magically speaking, he was able to whoop that ass.

** I like linkffn(11132113)

It has Harry landing beyond the wall and surviving there with the help of his magic. Eventually he meets Wildlings and gets cozy with them. He quickly becomes their leader and ends up building a thriving city with them and his magic to aid.

It drags a bit, I admit. It is by no means a quick read. But I found it to be entertaining for someone who likes to read Harry solve the little problems of a community coming together and the bigger political problems arising with their success.

*** My problem with this is that the city Harry builds is too dependent on him/his magic. Would have been much better if he had used magic to create a more sustainable awesome city.
