Hi guys! I'm looking for all fics featuring a militarized DA, with a command structure and actual training. I don't really care if it's slash, and I'd like fics longer than 50k if possible. Thanks a lot!

Edit: Fixed five lol


** Technically [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676][Divided and Entwined]] linkao3(11645676) features a group of Muggleborn students (led by Hermione) rather than the DA, but maybe it's close enough to what you're looking for?

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  "I'm going to make you immortal, Harry. The least you can do in exchange is to stay civil." - in which Voldemort learns the truth behind Harry's scar and the world changes greatly for it. AU from the Battle of Hogwarts. Powerful!Harry. Independent and at times mature, too.

****** So I started reading it, and...

1. 97th percentile at least

2. Good

3. Surprisingly good for a fic set inside Hogwarts. Not everybody can be The Wayland Smith.

I think your ideology has compromised your objectivity.

#+begin_quote
  Neville smiled gently at the boy who was only ten months younger than he himself, but still seemed so much a child. “Colin, I want to do something. There's a spell called the Fidelius Charm. It's pretty complicated, but I think it's our best hope. Trusting that none of us will tell that the D.A. has come back, where we're meeting, or who's in it is a lot to gamble on, but if I do this, you would be the Secret-Keeper, and that would mean that the only way You-Know-Who and his followers could find out about us is if you told willingly. It couldn't be broken by the Imperius Curse, Veritaserum, or anything like that, but if you told: even if you were under the Cruciatus Curse, even if they were going to kill Dennis ...”

  The rosy, freckled cheeks burned a brighter red as if in shame from the very thought of such a thing. “Even if!”

  Ritchie Coote, a fifth-year who had played Beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team the year before, jumped to his feet. “But that's what you just warned us about, the thing Peter Pettigrew broke!”

  “I know.” Neville did not allow himself to break eye contact with Colin.

  “And Colin knows, and I think that's exactly why we're safest. Would you betray us the way Harry's parents were betrayed?”

  There was not the faintest trace of hesitation. “I'd die first.”

  “Then---” He was cut off as Ginny seemed to appear out of thin air at his side and grabbed his arm, pulling him away from Colin with surprising force.

  “Neville, you can't! You're using him!” Her voice was both pleading and appalled.

  “Of course he is.” The words, spoken in a voice that was utterly calm and matter-of-fact, shocked them both, and they turned slowly, feeling every eye in the room join them in staring in disbelief at Colin.

  For the first time since Neville had known him, Colin looked his age. He had brushed the messy fringe back from his eyes, and he was standing at the front of the room remarkably casually, his hands in his pockets. He was not tall, nor strongly built, but it was suddenly apparent that his shoulders had broadened over the past year or so, cheekbones had emerged from the round face, and his voice held a depth that excitement usually erased as he met the looks from his audience without flinching. “He'd be a fool not to.”

  Colin took a few steps to his right and turned, now directly in front of the assembled group. “We're all going to be used. This is a war, and we're here because we're agreeing to be soldiers now. Soldiers are meant to be used. Harry's out there right now, fighting for our lives and our freedoms, and those of our families, and he's definitely being used. He's being used for his bravery, Hermione's being used for her brains, Ron's being used for his loyalty. They might die. They know that.

  “Neville's using me because Harry is every hero from every book I used to read as a child, and I had the privilege to know a real, breathing person who made those stories real and showed me that not only did magic exist, but that the people who had made magic worth dreaming about existed too. Betraying him would be betraying everything I have ever believed about what Good meant, and there would be no reason to keep living if I had to stop believing that Good will triumph in the end. Maybe that's stupid, maybe it's naïve, but Neville knows it's true, and I am proud to be used for that.” The soft blue of his eyes suddenly took on the vividness of a summer sky just after a storm. “Don't ask Neville why he's using me. Ask what you can be used for, or leave.”
