I'm looking for a fanfic I read YEARS ago. Never got to finish it and can't remember the name of it, hoping someone could help me. It was about after hogwarts harry and ron become aurors and are tracking down some new evil dark lord that rises in the wake of voldemort. I don't remember too much except there was some kind of mission they needed code names for and one of the weasleys got the code name "blaze". I don't know why this is the only thing I really remember, and I know it's not a lot to go off of, but if anyone has any idea I would appreciate any help. Thanks.
