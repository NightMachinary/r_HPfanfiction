** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936]] but beware that this is really dark dark series. Certainly there is no pretension that everything is OK, there is no Severitus, no happy end. No safe for anybody who can get triggered around suicide and certainly not safe for minors. Author dealt by writing this fics with some horrors in his own family, and it shows.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Canon does that too, seriously the abuse is canon! Yes, the Dursleys didn't beat him daily (at least Vernon and Petunia didn't, Duddley abused Harry every day - Harry-Hunting for example!), but they were violent (trying to hit a kid with a frying pan is quite violent IMHO!), they also were mentally abusive (telling him about his "useless drunk parents" - a lie of course etc.) and neglectful!

Why so many in the fandom ignore this or try to downplay it I will never understand! The Dursleys to me are subhuman beings who should be sent to Azkaban (with Dementors!)
