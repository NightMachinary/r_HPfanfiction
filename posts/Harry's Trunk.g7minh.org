After listening to the description of Harry's 10 room trunk that holds everything from a bedroom to an entire library, I have reached a conclusion. I hate expandable trunks. I think I hate everything that has an expanded interior. It feels like the ultimate way to cheat any limitations or struggle in a power fantasy fic. Put some limitations on your Harry every once in a while.

Just give him a normal trunk.

Why don't you give Harry a normal trunk?

Harry wants a normal trunk.

Harry likes a normal trunk.

I like a normal trunk.

I think other people would like a normal trunk too.


** [[https://www.dormco.com/College_Trunks_Rhino_Standard_Dorm_Size_p/dormco-ralrsl.htm][College Standard Dorm Size]] (googling):

32"L x 6"W x 16"H OR 81.26cm L x 40.64cm W x 40.64cm H

Okay, let's look at the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Shopping_List][first year equipment]]:

- Three sets of robes
- Hat
- gloves
- cloak
- eight books
- writing utensils (parchment, ink, quills. One metric ton of it)
- wand
- size 2 cauldron
- set of glass/crystal phials
- telescope
- brass scales
- Potions ingredients? (I think they bought those correct me if I'm wrong)

Now... How does all of this fit? Add in six standard book of spells books. And maybe six more DADA books. Lockhart... yeah, his books too. Oh, add another +3 for elective courses. And an invisibility cloak. Another Herbology book. Another potions book... BROOMSTICK!

Yeah, this isn't going to fit.

BROOMSTICK! How the hell does that fit?

I stand by my "Three compartment trunk". Closet for clothes, bookshelf for books, and the last one is slightly expanded for everything else.

Hedwigs cage? Quidditch uniform... Crap, those "regular standard" trunks must be hitting critical mass already.

​

Edit: This started off as a "Yeah, a regular trunk would work..." and then I looked up the shopping lists...

Edit x2: Apparently JKR thought of this after the series was done. I give you... [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms]["Hogwarts school trunks, like the majority of wizarding luggage, are issued with capacity enhancing or extension charms as standard."]]

Edit x3: Didn't Hermione fill her trunk up, and that's why she couldn't bring Hogwarts, a History? This is conflicting with the pottermore link. Ravenclaws would have that trunk filled up in no time.

**** When I first started thinking about the most "optimal" trunk, I was thinking about the ease of finding things. Sure, everything could fit inside of a "standard" trunk, but everything is piled on top of each other, and you have to unpack half of it to find something. Books/cauldron alone would be a nightmare. Tetris would forever be unplayable after playing it with your belongings all year for seven years.

***** Not only that, but a trunk that's /just/ bigger on the inside would be madness. Like, who wants a room full of garbage?

For me, the perfect trunk would be something like this:

Compartment one: Clothes. If you stand the trunk upright and open it, the closet is revealed. By default, you can see maybe five or six hooks, with a couple of drawers underneath. However, you can drag the wooden bar the hooks are attached to, and the entire line will move aside to be compressed or stored, revealing more hooks for clothing that you can comfortably peruse. The drawers at the bottom are very long, of course.

Compartment two: Books. If you put it down flat on one particular side, It takes the form of a bookshelf, arranged in such a way that they are sorted alphabetically and with their face up. You can push the current shelf down, causing an empty one to appear from the side, storing the books more efficiently and allowing new ones to be added. If you write a title, subject or author on a scrap of paper and drop it down the side into the depths of the bookshelf trunk, the current one will be stored and a new one will appear with all the books you asked for. You can also drag them to the side to reveal more "pages" of bookshelf.

Compartment three: General stuff. If put it down flat and open the other side that's not the bookshelf, you get a small rectangle that's maybe twice or thrice as deep. There, you can put all the other stuff.

I like this system much more than just "yeah my trunk has a room in it".

*** My hc is that the extension charm doesn't extend bag/trunk/car/etc infinitely and ‘the amount of extension' should be determined when the charm is cast and the object wouldn't stretch past that set limit. So a magical school trunk is 3 times the size of a regular muggle trunk but still has its limit. From Hermione's beaded handbag we also know the contents could be sorted and summoned. But that could be easily explained by the difference in how the charm was cast. For example a cheap trunk would have just one big compartment inside and more expensive ones would have several.

**** But we also have the problem of Newt Scamander and his bs briefcase that had an area big enough for rhinos to run and enough space for the birds to fly plus extra. And that's just an old fashioned briefcase with a bad lock made from what looked like leather. Oh and don't forget the juggle compartment.

** As it has been said, his trunk would have to be magical anyway to hold everything he needs for school(it's actually a lot of stuff, including a cauldron and a broomstick).

Of course, people exaggerate and go the route of Newt's Briefcase, I see no problem with a trunk to hold all his stuff and maybe a good number of books, when he can live in the damn thing then that's too much.

** But expanded trunks are canon! :( [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms]]

I do like them a lot yes I don't see the problem with them! Hermione expanded a tiny handbag! At least a trunk is a lot bigger and possibly more believable that way. :( Go after Hermione's even more worldbreaking tiny handbag holding a library and clothes in it!! That is canon too though. :)

*** Just a little side note, Harry didn't just accidentally lose the mirror in his trunk, he activity chose to not open the mirror from Sirius. He didn't open it because he didn't want to feel tempted to call on Sirius for help. He didn't even know it was a mirror until after Sirius died. Then he purposefully threw it in the bottom of his trunk because he was angry. He didn't want to see it again but he also couldn't throw Sirius's last gift to him in the garbage.

*** The issue is not that the trunk is enchanted, it is how many extras a lot of authors add to make it "more awesome". It's usually a bloated scene, showing off all kinds of great/useless features which are never mentioned again. Or it is used as an explanation for a powerwank where Harry has a training room outside of time.

** I don't know why you wouldn't want one, charms like that are extremely helpful and are also used at the Qudditch World Cup. Can't even imagine all the space they'd need for tents big enough for everyone. We complain about it in life about how we can't fit enough things into a bag and such, probably what a wizard thought when he invented the spell.
