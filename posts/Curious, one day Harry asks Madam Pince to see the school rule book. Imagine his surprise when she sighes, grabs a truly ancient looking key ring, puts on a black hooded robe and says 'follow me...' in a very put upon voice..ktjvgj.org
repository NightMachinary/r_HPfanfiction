It was a full three weeks before Harry was seen again. In retrospect, he should have just asked to see a copy of the rules instead. The rule book was truly a sight to behold. A massive ancient tome made out of giant skin. The rules themselves were ludicrous to behold. But then again, 1000 years is a very long time. When he returned he felt older, wiser then before. But he knew every rule by heart now. And he would comply... maliciously.


** O.o

One of my favorite fanfics centers around the concept of malicious compliance.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** The Resonance Trilogy by GreenGecko has an ancient tome left from the founding of Hogwarts, and the staff suddenly finds that Harry is the only one in centuries that the book has allowed to read it. It contains information about the construction of Hogwarts and forgotten spells about its protection and repair. I have my own copy of the story that I've made minor fixes to over the years:

**** Yeah, but I always encourage people to read it and tell them it was pretty much finished, with just one minor villain and some sports corruption to dispose of. It was very close to the end and didn't leave MUCH hanging, I thought. My version includes some draft chapters she only published on her website.
