No slash, and no children in love. Also preferably no Death Eater revisionism or Snape as Mentor.


** It's reasonably popular, so you may have already read linkffn(What You Leave Behind). It's a trio of Harry, Cedric, Cho, but Newcombe does a good job of making sure that they fill different roles and have a different dynamic than Harry, Ron, and Hermione did in canon. Side note - the last update was in 2015, but I believe that Newcombe has started to pick it up again, so you may see an update at some point.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/Strawberry-Fields][Strawberry Fields]], linkffn(4940094): A very different but very enjoyable 'Harry read the books' fic, and Ron is not portrayed positively, not at all.
