:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so I have been looking for this fan fiction forever and can not seem to find it. I have already read it, though it has been a while. It is a very dark fan fiction where Harry is in Slytherin being friends with Draco. At one point Voldemort is at Malfoy manor where he traps Draco and Harry and gets them to join him. Harry dates pansy for a bit and then moves on to Daphne. Whom together torture pansy. Harry and Daphne do this a lot with others. Draco loses his eyes in a suicide bombing where his father and other death eaters die. In the end Voldemort is Emperor or whatever with Harry as the head of his secret police or something like that. It is a very dark story. Also when I read it it was cut into several different stories which I think were year brackets. Same author. In this story from what I remember Harry does not start out as dark but slowly progresses until he is extremely dark. And that is most of what I can pinpoint from this story on the top of my head. If anyone can link or name me this story I will be extremely grateful!

EDIT: another thing about this story that popped into my head is that Voldemort very much wants Harry as a loyal follower because he provides eternal life with his Horcrux, and therefore Voldemort has Harry make his own Horcruxes. Daphne does the same.


** The author is bolshevikmuppet99 and it's the downward spiral series. The first one is Harry Potter and the Homecoming I think.

***** What did you think? I personally love it. It is such a realistic scenario without bashing. It's maybe too dark for some people but I love it. Easily one of my favorites.

****** I really did like it. So much that I read it all in one day. I thought it was a really good realistic dark harry story. The progression of his fall was really well done and made sense. It's been added to my will-read-again-list. Not many dark harry stories get added to that.

******* Yes. I think it is safe to say that it is one of the darkest, realistic, and most enjoyable dark harry fanfics out there. If not the. One of the reasons I wanted it was to reread it. Glad to be able to again

***** Yes sorry. It is a very big fan fic which has been a while since I read. Tried to list the pieces I remember best in chronological order. I think. Though the points I listed don't add up to much as it is. Again been a while since I read it.

****** Believe me, that was the weirdest google search I've made in quite some time. I tried to search some of the keywords, but the results are wildly varied. I'm sorry, but since it's not something I would normally read, the titles Google came up with don't tell me anything either. Good luck in your search, though. Maybe someone else has read it too and can pinpoint it better. Here's hoping.

******* Appreciate the effort. Can not tell you how many threads and searches I have gone through to try and find this story. It is like it has disappeared entirely somehow. I also swear that I had it in my notes and somehow those vanished too. It's driving me crazy. Hopefully someone else will have better luck.

******** Man, I know exactly how you feel. I have plenty of separate scenes in my head from fics I've read, but no matter how deep I search, I can't find them again. No mention to them whatsoever. Like some Men in Black shit, it's like they have been wiped of the face of the Earth.

It does happens sometimes that some fics are taken down permanently from their hosting sites, either by the staff, or by the authors themselves. This last one happens more often than I would like, let me tell you. They often find their own material cringy when they get older and take it down. It's a silly attitude, in my opinion. Embarrassing as it could be, it's part of their past, part of what made them what they are now. They shouldn't hide it away, but keep it as proof of their personal growth. But well, to each their own, I guess. Let's hope this is not the case here, and that you can still find your fic.
