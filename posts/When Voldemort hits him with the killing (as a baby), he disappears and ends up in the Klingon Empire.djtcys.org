** Trek dimension or do the Klingons exist in the Potterverse?

Adopted into the House of Mogh, the family lived on Khitomer until it was invaded by the Romulans. During the invasion Harry's magic awakened after seeing his Mother killed, shredding several Romulans soldiers with seeming kinetic force. Over the next few hours he has to kill several more times to keep himself and brothers alive before being rescued by the U.S.S. Intrepid.

You'd probably have to change his name, the Klingons wouldn't know it and it doesn't really go.

** I have a slightly different concept already in development:

Tonks wasn't killed at the Battle of Hogwarts - she merely went into a healing coma. Somehow her body was left that way until centuries later, she found herself waking in the hold of what she assumed was a hobgoblin submarine. It's actually the IKS Rotarran, a year before the Klingon invasion of Cardassia, and she's treated like a pet for the ship's (mad) science officer, seeing as he bought her stasis tube as a curiosity (the unrotting corpse) from some Orion traders.

  "Hey, Mr. Melty!"\\
  "Ms. Tonks, we've been over this. My name is Odo."\\
  "When I was young I had these action figures made of plastic, and my mates and I would put them through these imagined scenes, like, blowing up the Guns of Navarone, right?"\\
  "Miss Tonks..."\\
  "Well, they were just plastic, and confronted with a few ounces of lighter fluid set off by a firecracker--" She then mimicked the resultant melting, while groaning, "Blleeeaaaaugghhh."\\
  Odo scoffed.\\
  "That's you, in case you missed it."
