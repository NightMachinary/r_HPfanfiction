** Voice of the Nephilim is absolutely top notch. Strangely I have a habit of only reading one story by an author. I should change that.

** Because my other post gave away... you know... the /entire plot./

Personally I rate it at 9/10. Very fond of it. One of the better one-shots I've read.

** Interesting beginning, really would like to see where it goes, /if/ it goes anywhere!

*** Think it's just a one-shot with an exciting premise, unfortunately, as with this quality writing I would kill for a full novel in the aftermath.
