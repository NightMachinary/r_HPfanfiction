** No, Harry and Voldemort's relationship in PotDK in not a sexual or romantic one. It is an extremely intense one though. Also, holy crap that's a lot of typos in one title!

******* Exactly! If he were actively working against Voldemort or something it'd be good, even if he were fully on Voldemorts side it'd be good so long as he then had to fight the Order or something but there's none of that. The Order have all completely caved and Remus and Sirius are living under /Greyback/? Who had taken their wands for some reason and they don't give a damn and are happy serving a pedophilic monster. It's ridiculous.

*** I love Prince of the Dark Kingdom, my favorite part of it is the Ritual Magic, I love a good unique magic system. However I will say that Harry and Voldemort's relationship has sexual undertones to it. As much as I enjoy the Ritual Magic, the after effects squick me out.

Edit: Sexual was the wrong term. Intimate is what I was going for.

**** I totally agree. I too love a good magic system, but I think it is the (non-sexual/romantic) intimacy and the power dynamic in Harry and Voldemorts relationship that really makes this fic shine.

** No they aren't gay, though in book 1 there was this weird thing going on where a bunch of people came off as gay (the twins, Sirius and Remus (who are implied to be gay for a while only for it to be stated otherwise), etc) and they even made you think some people were gay only for it to sort of be shrugged off later and them not be. Either way, none of them were Harry.

Voldemort and Harry's relationship is incredibly unique. They aren't friends, lovers, or family but they confide in each other, challenge each other, teach each other, and are constantly on their toes around each other as if they (particularly Harry) were standing at the edge of a knife.

Harry was kind of in one relationship and sort of still has feelings for her and has had a crush on the Queen of France since he met her.

******* He gets with her for a bit, but everyone is against it, and there's this matter in the 5th book which causes a schism in the werewolves due to something involving Harry and Luna sides with the one who was "harming" him for certain reasons. It's hard to say when they really break up, but later on it's shown that he still has feelings for her and her for him it's just kind of awkward because of the situation.
