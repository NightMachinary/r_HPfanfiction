I want to put out a quick disclaimer : This post is in no way written to brag. Thanks.

​

We all know that there are many stories featuring Noble Houses. I find that a good chunk of those stories have some of the basis wrong. I therefore offer my help as a French member of the nobility.

Second disclaimer: My family is French and not English so there might be a few differences.

​

Some points that come to my mind:

- Marriage contracts did exist. Marriage contracts did exist but they were rarely done from birth (at least in the 20th century). My great-grandparents were married by contract but my great-grandmother was 20 and my great-grandfather 40. They hadn't met yet but the contract wasn't signed prior to their birth or when they were 2 y.o

​

- Manors/castles were indeed a thing. That's hardly a surprise I know but there are a few things I might need to clarify. Families would live together in those manors until the paterfamilias died. For example, my great-great-grandparents lived with their children and their grandchildren. But at the death of my great-great-grandfather, his eldest, my great-grandfather, inherited the estate and his siblings, nieces and nephews left. My great-great-grandmother, his mother, lived in a separate house built for the dowager. In many fics I find that 3 people live in a massive estate and that their cousins do not live with them. (It's not a great deal I know, but still).

​

- Links between Cadet branches were very strong. A part of this was the geographical proximity (The wizarding world doesn't have this problem though). Cadet branches did intermarry, that is true but rarely on first-degree.

​

- Most cadets went in the army where they were usually officers. They often hoped to make a name for themselves and become ennobled later.

​

- Small details such as family silver are always a nice touch. If you want a little more info on the subject, here it comes. Silver was often commissioned when a marriage was celebrated, as such, the cutlery had the arms of the two families that would marry. If there was only one crest, it most likely meant that it was commissioned before marriage or that the person (often males) had commissioned it single and died after.

​

- On the topic of marriage. It wasn't unusual (at least in my family) to have single people, it happened each generation in either the main branch or the cadet branch. Stuff owned by this person came back to the family. Now, if you keep the amount of wizards and witches quite low, it would be strange for someone to be single, especially when the noble-dating pool would be pretty small.

​

- Regarding inheritance (in France at the very least), until Napoleon, if the family wasn't incredibly rich, the eldest male would get everything. If the family was rich enough, it could be split in between the children. I think something can be done with family vaults in that they wouldn't only be for the Lord but also for the Cadet branches.

​

- Balls. Balls did exist, it was a source of pride to hold a reception/gathering/ball. To put things into perspective, they still exist today even for the youth. I was in what in French is called a /rallye./ Those were formal parties where parents would hold a reception (often in places they'd rent - if you want an example in Paris, you can google "Salons France-Amérique"). We learned to dance Rock for a year or two before having those formal parties. There was a buffet, almost always champagne. Boys were either in a suit or in a dinner suit (though when we (males) became older the latter was often advised ), females would wear a dress and as they grew older they would wear a long dress. Those /rallyes/ were composed of members of the nobility or rich families.

​

- On the topic of rich families. Nobles dislike new-money unless it is profitable for them i.e they are poor and marry to a rich industrial family.

​

- Signet rings are worn by members of the family, no matter if they are the Lord or not. Signet rings with a gem happened (I only have example in my family and it was lost) but it did happen at times.

​

- The Lord of the Family/House didn't have (at least during the Ancien Regime in France) authority over every member of his Family/House. He had a moral authority but could not dictate what to do (from what I was told). Please keep in mind that links were strong between branches of the family and that going against the paterfamilias might lead to being put apart.

​

That's all, do not hesitate to ask more, I'd be happy to help you if you have questions, please keep in mind that I am French and not English/Welsh/Scottish/Irish.

Happy easter to everyone celebrating it :)

**** I meant a city house as showcased in the show Downton Abbey. The family as their estate in Northern Yorkshire with the manor and they also have a city house in London which they use mainly for the ‘London season' which is when young aristocrats reach the age of 18 and are presented to the monarch by a more senior member of their family (e.g. Lady Grantham presents her niece, Lady Rose MaClare). It's more of a secondary residence than one with an estate. A bit like how someone could say the Black family would have a countryside manor which would have been where Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa would have been raised while 12 Grimmauld Place (where Sirius was raised) could have been the family's city house.

I hope I was more clear this time and apologise for the lack of clarity in my initial question. I also would like to thank you for offering us to ask you about nobility.

No. The 'London season' did not only happen when the children turned 18, the 'London season' happened every winter when the roads became too treacherous to travel, the husband was called to parliament and you didn't want to be trapped at the estate by yourself unable to socialise.

*** How it goes is that often noble families will have one manor or castle where they live their everyday life. This one often goes to the eldest. Some things are true in those fics in that it is not uncommon for a family to have a manor for their everyday life and a manor for their holidays. Then the bride might bring a house too like a villa in Italy as you can often see in fics.

​

So in a way, it is not wrong to say that Harry may have 3 houses, 4 in some rare cases. More would be overboard unless you say that the Potter family was a big one and as the last member he might have inherited much more than he could possibly need.

**** So what you're saying here is that if a fic went that route, it would be reasonable to expect an extended backstory featuring a rich (even for given status) family, with many members and multiple cadet branches, and 15 house inheritance would be unlikely even so?

Since even if family was 'close', cadet branches would still pave their own path to some extent, possibly even abroad, and Voldemort would need to do a fair bit of traveling to get them all for Harry to have that big an inheritance - or at least all not-estranged members.

And one more question: Could you expand on backward inheritance? (Properites returning to main line from distant cadet branches). What basis is needed (how close blood relation, what about detailed, long wills that are Trope etc.)? Basically, how distant is too distant, and your take on "Sirius will reading".

***** In the UK, the return of property to the main line would happen in the following way: Person dies with no child to inherit their property. Their lawyer looks for their closest blood relation, who would be the person with the strongest legal claim. That might be a cousin. But it could easily also require going back several generations and moving several sideways branches on the family tree to find someone. And eventually, if enough cadet lines die off, those properties find their way back to the main line. If a will was made which directed the property to someone other than their nearest blood relative, then it would generally need to be settled in court if the blood relative cared to dispute it.

In regards to how cadet branches would forge their own paths, there was very much a tradition in the UK that the first son would inherit, the second would join the military, and the third would join the church. More sons than that were unusual, but would generally take either military or church serve as well. Whilst their father would, by tradition, support their livelihoods they were expected to make something of themselves and not just be social dilettantes. After the death of the father, the first son would inherit the title and most of the wealth. The subsequent sons would all likely receive a financial inheritance, but would then no longer receive ongoing support from their brother.

Cadet branches going abroad to seek their fortune wasn't unknown. Sometimes they might get given their inheritance early to make it possible for them to set up elsewhere (there was a point in time, in the mid to late 1800s, when 2nd or 3rd sons shipping off to the US and buying up vast areas of land was very much a thing). It would certainly be a direction to take a fic, Harry discovering he has a 3rd cousin who lives in New Zealand or something like that.

***** I think it would certainly make an interesting world-building at the very least. Even more if some branches of the Potter family (that could live abroad) decided to follow Voldemort to try and seize power for themselves. Cadet branches could go against the values of the Lord, certainly.

My take on Sirius' will is that it is perfectly normal for Sirius to give Harry Grimmauld Place since he was on the opposite side of the war with two of the last Blacks left. He could have given it to Andromeda I guess. He was his godfather after all. Some cousins of mine have managed to get the family seat despite being from a Cadet branch and not normally in line for it since the Lord who died single was The Godfather of one of them.

Sirius would not have been able to give Harry his title. In France, titles normally go from male to male which is why sometimes a very distant relation ends up with the title, so there is not really a too distant (For example, Henri IV was a very distant relative of Henri III and still became King of France just because he was the closest catholic male in line). However in the past when there was a monarch, he could have granted patent letters to allow a daughter to pass on the title of her father if said title was about to go extinct. However it is not possible anymore.

I believe (though I am far from sure) that in England some titles can go down female lines. I am sure that was the case in the Holy Roman Empire though.

*** Its actually feasible to assume that a particularly wealthy and noble family would accumulate a number of homes over the years. You might have the main family home in the countryside, and the town house near to the Ministry and Diagon Alley.

But you might also have the old family home, which at some point the head of the family decided they didn't like any more.

And the dower house, for the mother of the new Lord after death of her husband so that she wasn't getting under the feet of the new Lord in the main house.

In a muggle family, you'd also potentially have things like a highland house in Scotland, a shooting lodge in northern England, a hunting lodge near a big forest, a seafront property somewhere nice on the coast, a fishing lodge near a lake or river etc.

Some of these could easily have magical variants, and so its reasonable to assume that just from inheriting the Potter property Harry might get Potter Manor, the old Potter Castle, Potter House in London, Potter Lodge near Hogsmeade, Potter Cottage in the remote countryside, and Potter Hall in Kent on the coast. If he also inherits the Black family property, then he gets their versions of all of those.

When Napoleon came, he created the Civil code, in this code there was an article stating that a certain percentage of what was owned had to be split equally between the children (there had to be at least 50% [for example] of what was owned that had to go equally to all the children, the other 50% could be distributed freely).

*** What you will find is that families "absorb" others. Everything they owned now becomes part of the family that absorbed the other. Their title will become a secondary title, that can be given to the heir of the main title, but for all purposes it is a lost title. In my opinion it is an excuse to give Harry more power. You see that in the House of Lords, if a title becomes extinct, it is extinct end of story, and the seat cannot be revived as far as I know. In France, there was an equivalent to the House of Lords but it didn't last long.

Legally you can take the name of one of your ancestor (up to 4 generations). It might "revive" the title of you will, but in France now that the monarchy is abolished, it would be a courtesy title.

**** In a very real sense, saying that "it is a lost title" is incorrect. In the UK, which is as far as my knowledge of the aristocracy goes, it is very common for hereditary nobility to have multiple titles. Take for example the Duke of Norfolk, he is also Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norfolk, Baron Beaumont, Maltravers, FitzAlan, Clun, Oswaldestre, and Howard of Glossop. Each of those titles is of relevance because certain parts of the family wealth will be attached or entailed to that title. And it can happen that a title (and any entailed property) will separate from the main if the inheritance criteria are different.

For the purposes of what [[/u/Ripper1337][u/Ripper1337]] asked, if the Wizengamot is based off of the UK House of Lords (which is a reasonable assumption to make) you can only have 1 seat it in regardless of the number of titles. As I mention above, property and wealth is sometimes entailed to a title and so can only be inherited by the inheritor of the title. However, often times that would only be property that was entailed and money would be divided up in the will as they saw fit.

This was very much true for both Maria-Theresia and her son Joseph II.

A special emphasis would be put on the education of the eldest son, but if there was a second son, he was always raised to the same standards as the eldest if possible, he was kind of the backup heir and needed to be well educated in case something happened to the eldest. The father would try to teach his sons as most as he could while doing his work (whether it is managing his family or a job such as lawyer). As far as I know I have never heard stories where there were designated hours to meet with your children.

Most often, mothers would teach practical skills especially to their daughters.

Though in some cases, all children would be raised equally to the same level in arts, mathematics and all in the hope of making a better marriage.

*** The nobility officially doesn't exist anymore but between nobles, we recognize "our own'" if you will. It's a tricky thing, during the Revolution all privileges were abolished including the privileges nobles enjoyed (such as paying less taxes than the Third Estate). However when Napoleon became Emperor, nobility was recognized again and he issued titles himself. After the first exile of Napoleon after the battle of Leipzig, Louis 18 (brother of Louis 16) came back to power, reinstating the monarchy. When Napoleon escaped and came back during the period that is known as the /Cent Jours/ (Hundred Days), Louis 18 fled. When Napoleon was ultimately defeated, Louis 18 came back until his death in 1824. His brother Charles X succeeded him. He tried to pass stupid laws censoring the press and dissolving the National Assembly that was beginning to oppose him. In French fashion, the people of Paris revolted and brought a new king to the throne, Louis-Philippe 1st, bringing the House of Orléans to the throne, ending the reign of the House of Bourbon.

Louis-Philippe was descended from the brother of Louis 14. Louis-Philippe's father known as Philippe Égalité (Equality) was a cousin of Louis 16 and had voted for the death of Louis 16. Louis-Philippe was outed in 1848, but left alive.

It's true that during the Revolution many nobles died. Some survived in France, others fled and came back when the monarchy was restored or when Napoleon came to power.

Nowadays, titles are allowed under the law but no one has to call a noble by his title. It is worth noting that usurpation of a title is a criminal offense.

Last thing if you are ever curious on the subject, because there were three Houses that came to rule France in the 19th century, there are three candidates for a possible restauration of the monarchy : the Prince Napoleon (descended from a brother of Napoleon I), the Count of Paris (descended from Louis-Philippe) and the Duke of Anjou (descended from the Spanish Bourbon)

** And how does one goes about and getting this Nobel title?

I expect by doing service for the country and getting one by the Monarch in recognition, but I could be wrong. Can someone else bestow Nobility? Like how in movies a knight can make someone else a knight?

Since almost every old family in Potterverse treat their own Monarch like 'Muggle Filth' I don't see how they can go around and get said Nobility bestowed upon them.

What about Heir bullshit? Can the current Head decide a non-blood relative to be the Heir even though there are blood relatives still existing who have a strong chance of ascending to the position?

Does the previous Head retain any power? For instance, the Head made the older son the new Head but said new Head is a cunt, so the previous Head wants to make his younger son the Head instead and kick the current Head out of said position. Does he retains the power to nullify his decision?

A title can be taken back if a member of the nobility did something unforgivable. In France, Louis 14, in order to fund his military campaigns would sell titles of nobility.

Titles are hereditary and cannot be bestowed by the holder of the title to someone outside the family. When the holder of the title dies, it goes to his eldest son and by default to the closest male relative (in France at the very least).

There is something called in French the /dégringolade/ (collapse) which basically allows a Cadet to bear the title but one rank lower (if your older brother is a Count you would be a Viscount), or you can call yourself Count X (First name) of Y.

**** So, If Lucius Malfoy ran away from France to Britain during the French Revolution instead of helping his country, then even if his Nobility isn't revoked(which it probably is) it still wouldn't mean anything in Britain, right?

And what exactly does buying nobility mean? Do they actually get something tangible for their money? Tax exemption perhaps? Or is this nothing more than a source of pride?

It's not about letting the son having a title. Um...here take this for an example.

Arcus Black the head of the Black family's main branch made his son Orion Black the next head of the Black family. But not only was Orion an idiot who would sink the fortunes collected throughout the centuries via poor investments he was also thinking about poisoning his sisters and cousins so that the power would stay in his line and not go to some cadet branch.

Arctus finds out about this and becomes horrified since nothing is more important than family to him. So he decides to revoke his decision and make his Grandson Sirius the new head instead.

Now, can this be done? Oh wait, I reread your comment,

#+begin_quote

***** Buying nobility was basically paying the king to be granted a title.

The case you talk about is pretty extreme, parents pay attention on how they educate their children and especially the future Head of House. If Arcturus noticed something like that going on, there might be a way for him to remove him from the line of succession (disownment is often used in fanfics), there might be a way to get a dispensation/exemption from the monarch, or he could try to place him under legal guardianship for adults (arguing that he is crazy).

It happens that heads of House make bad decisions, an ancestor of mine decided to invest most of his money in Russian debt at the end of the 19th century, with the communist revolution, things went pretty downhill.

As for your point for Lucius' title meaning nothing, I am guessing there is a way to have your title from a foreign state recognized in Britain as well (but keep in mind that at the time France was still the enemy to Britain).

***** If Lucius was the Viscomte de Malfoy in France, but fled to Britain he would be addressed as the Viscomte but it would come with no power or particular prestige. Foreign nobility do have a place in the Order of Precedence (which is the formal list of how important people are in the country, based on the jobs they have, titles they hold, or qualifications they possess), but its further down than domestic nobility of the same rank.

And yes, its very reasonable to assume that people were murdered over the centuries to centralise power within their family, or to prevent someone disastrous from inheriting. Or alternatively, murdered a short while after inheriting when he was definite that they were going to be a disaster.

There are historically legal ways to remove someone from the line of succession, they were rarely used however because it was generally seen as important for the eldest living son to inherit. Otherwise there was the risk of legal trouble, or violence. That was the reason for having such a set and clearly defined form of inheritance for every title, to prevent open warfare over the inheritance.

*** Noble titles sometimes come into existence through tradition, rather than being granted directly. In HP, I'd imagine they happened if a family became the traditional leader of an area of land, or a group of people. Over a long enough time, some sort of hereditary title may become attached to that position, and that title may mark them out as a "higher class".

Not sure what you mean about "previous head", in general the bearer of a title has to die for it to be passed on. The only real exception to that is King or Queen, who can abdicate and pass the title on that way. If they abdicate however, they are very much NOT the King or Queen anymore, and retain no power.

When the title was first granted it would have been because the family held large amounts of land in Liverpool and the surrounding area, but the land can be sold off without losing the title.

There are very specific exceptions to this. The English and Welsh title "Lord of the Manor", which is about as low a "noble" rank as you can get (it isn't even in the Order of Precedence), can be bought and sold as a commodity because it is attached the land. You buy the land, you get the title. The same holds true with Scottish Barons, which are similarly attached to the land, and are also below the rest of the ranks of the peerage.

For example, my great-great-grandparents lived with their children and their grandchildren. But at the death of my great-great-grandfather, his eldest, my great-grandfather, inherited the estate and his siblings, nieces and nephews left. My great-great-grandmother, his mother, lived in a separate house built for the dowager. In many fics I find that 3 people live in a massive estate and that their cousins do not live with them. (It's not a great deal I know, but still).

  - Regarding inheritance (in France at the very least), until Napoleon, if the family wasn't incredibly rich, the eldest male would get everything. If the family was rich enough, it could be split in between the children. I think something can be done with family vaults in that they wouldn't only be for the Lord but also for the Cadet branches.

​ And you didn't inherit something off your twenty-times ancestor. Those inheritances didn't lie fallow. All those generations inbetween the founders and you - they inherited too and then added wealth or lost it.

  - Balls. Balls did exist, it was a source of pride to hold a reception/gathering/ball. To put things into perspective, they still exist today even for the youth. I was in what in French is called a rallye. Those were formal parties where parents would hold a reception (often in places they'd rent - if you want an example in Paris, you can google "Salons France-Amérique"). We learned to dance Rock for a year or two before having those formal parties. There was a buffet, almost always champagne. Boys were either in a suit or in a dinner suit (though when we (males) became older the latter was often advised ), females would wear a dress and as they grew older they would wear a long dress. Those rallyes were composed of members of the nobility or rich families.

*** I had the same question in mind, when reading the post!

To add to the question - if you do memorise your ancestry, how far back do you need to know it?

And also, are there actual portrait galleries in those castles/manors?

**** As I answered, you do not need to learn all of it. There are in some manors portrait galleries, but it usually is in the biggest. In most you will have multiple portraits in one room but not necessarily a room specifically for that purpose. Only in big manors/castle from my experience.

******* My Lord is magnanimous

Actually no, Lux just comes from the word light in Latin, I looked into it and found that it was also the root of the surname Lucas which is a popular name so I designed an OC family for a fanfic I dropped. The founding member of this family was a general, so I picked it up.

Lol I hope your children find your diary someday

** I don't understand the point of this post. No one says balls didn't exist. That marriage contracts didn't exist. That nobility and inheritance were real things isn't the problem, it's the overuse, dumbing down of and boring deployment of these features in Harry Potter stories.

*** I guess my point on balls wasn't clear, thanks for pointing that out. The thing is I have seen stories where Harry (or another character) attends balls when he is 8. This is not the case, in my case, my parents' and grandparents' it happened when they were at least 15.

​

As for your other point, I am just trying to make some things clearer in the hope of having a "cleaner" trope ;)

****** So my french is not perfect, but most of the social meetings between the youth (from 13 onwards) are not balls but more like activities. Back then probably hunting and now laser tag and such? What kind of "social meetings" besides soirées still happen after one becomes 15?

******* Oh my bad, I assumed you were French lol.

It's exactly that until we are 15. We have formal parties after we are 15. I made some very good friends there so we still hang out outside of those events. There are no real events apart from those soirées. We have approximately once a month until it ends (which it did last year for me), but from time to time, people offer to organize a weekend at their place, but it's done outside of the official planned events

********* Oh true, my bad! I am sorry. There is one thing called "Le bal des débutantes" which is a private event (but if you have the right connections you could get an invite). It basically is a ball where nobility from all around Europe come to, I think you can find some pictures online if you want. I guess that is the more "open" of those high society events, and even then it's pretty private.

********** Edit:No need to apologise, thank you for answering.

Yeah, most old families aren't really public. My grandfather sold art, so i have a few second-hand stories, but the names don't really show up anywhere, unless you look for them. I think it's mostly new money(and royals, I guess) that generates news. But I don't read tabloids so I don't know about celebrities anyway.
