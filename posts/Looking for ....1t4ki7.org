The "LF Harry-raises-Harry" post the other day reminded me of a story which I can no longer find.

- James' "brother" ends up adopting/raising Harry.
- IIRC, the brother is really Harry who traveled back in time.
- The brother was sorted into Slytherin
- The brother lives and teaches in a school in Italy. Maybe the vatican

I thought it was in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/10zs9q/list_of_2500_top_completed_hp_fics_by_favs_from/][this]] spreadsheet, but I couldn't find it in there.

EDIT: ugh. What a terribly written story. I've down-voted myself its so bad.
