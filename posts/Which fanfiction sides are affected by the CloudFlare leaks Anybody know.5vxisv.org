*** It's a superset of affected sites.

A site can use cloudflare for DNS but not as a caching proxy, or for both DNS and as a caching proxy. In both cases, the site will appear on the list, but it's only the proxy usage that caused this problem.

Regardless, now is a good time to change any passwords you may have.

*** From what I've read so far (which is, admittedly, not much) is that Reddit used to be on Cloudflare but switched shortly before the bug appeared -- so that might be where that info is coming from. (Could change with more info in the future, though.)

It's good policy to change up passwords every once in a while anyway, though, so if anyone feels the need, I wouldn't blame them.

***** Just because we as writers aren't ethically willing to profit off of fanfics doesn't mean that someone else who is scummy enough can't find a way.

Its all the more easy in your case, since your stories have tens of thousands of people regularly reading. All they have to do is put a link to a money donating website with a good enough sob story at the end of each of your chapters, and they'd make more than enough with little to no effort.

****** They're unlikely to do something like that.

Instead they're going to use your e-mail and password to try to log into things like say, Amazon, or major banks or other websites with a purchase component to get credit card information or the like.

As an above poster says, a lot of people only use one e-mail and password for everything. They can do something as simple as see what the e-mail/password are on fanfiction.net and then try to say, log into the e-mail with the same password and look for information there. Or try to log into say, netflix, and pull credit card information and address information from there.

******* You say that, but I look at the dozens of writers who use Patreon and Gofundme links at the end of their stories to illegaly get a couple of hundred bucks off of people who read their stuff and I can't help but think what would happen if someone hacked in and changed those links or added one. Hackers have hacked shit for /way/ less than a 100 bucks before.
