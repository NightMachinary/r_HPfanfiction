He might be in his puberty or discover his own sexual orientation and is fixated on the possibility that he is Gay. He finds Harry or Ron or Draco attractive and fantasize about having fun with them. While he lifes by Harry, the latter might caught him in the act (without Teddy getting interupted), but is certain that this is just a temporary Crush (which it is).

But im curious about how Harry or Ron would react, if Harry tells Ron teasingly and in secret that his Godson has a Crush on the Redhead.


** At which point does a request become so specific that it stops being a request for story recommendations and become a writing prompt request?

**** I mean, it's mostly the presentation:

#+begin_quote
  LF Stories where Teddy is exploring his sexuality and has a crush on Harry, Ron or Malfoy.

  No actual relationship, just some teasing, maybe some humour.
#+end_quote

That's basically OP's request and still vague enough for a request.
