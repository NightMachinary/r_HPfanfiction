Are there any good self-insert stories not told in the self-inserts perspective?

I'm actually trying to hunt down the story that inspired me to write "From the Other's Eyes" on Space Battles. I can't remember if the story is a Naruto fanfic or a Harry Potter fanfic.

EDIT1:[1 February 2018]

I found it! I spent hours scouring the internet and I think this it! It has to be!

From Outside Eyes by Mysana...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12660656/1/From-Outside-Eyes]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12151641]])

As you can see, I wasn't subtle with my inspiration. /cough/ My title referenced it. /cough/

Mysana themselves was inspired by...

Like Pinwheels in the Wind by XxZuiliu/Yuesya

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10930529/1/Like-Pinwheels-in-the-Wind]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4662837]])

So yeah... These two people have started something... Three, if you count XxZuiliu/Yuesya's challenger, Zuinyun.

EDIT2:

I know none of the links above are HP stories but I'd still like to bring this up, because I want to read stories like that but in the Potterverse. Just imagine canon characters reacting to a HP SI. That's why I started writing my shorts. It's a work in progress though...

EDIT3:

Another good example of this concept is...

Leaves of Grass by CrownsofLaurels

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11210503/1/Leaves-of-Grass]])

CrownsofLaurels wanted her work to be distinguished from the other Naruto SI's. She set up some guidelines that she follows throughout the work itself. No word on whether she was inspired by XxZuiliu/Yuesya or not(e.i. it's not confirmed).

Anyways...

I think it's more accurate to say that XxZuiliu/Yuesya began this. Followed by CrownsofLaurels and then Mysana.

From Outside Eyes by Mysana [Published: Sep 21, 2017]

I can't wait to add a Potter story to this list.

*** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/from-the-others-eyes-harry-potter-fanfiction-semi-si-non-archived.587476/]] It's just a series of shorts which I have inaccurately dubbed as "chapters" because habits die hard...

It's nothing impressive really...

The work that inspired it is what I'm searching for because I want readers to see what I saw in it.
