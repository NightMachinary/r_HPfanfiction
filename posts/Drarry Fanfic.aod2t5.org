*** Can't agree more

I'm not even that big of a Drarry fan but the hate drives me up the wall

*** Sort by new and take a look. It's not likely that it's the slash people have an issue with maybe it's the other notable part of the pairing?

**** .>12th most controversial post in the entire month was a slash request without Drarry or Snarry

.>Most controversial post ever is just asking about Trans people in the wizarding world

#+begin_quote
  9th most controversial post in the last year was asking for a Harry/Ron fic
#+end_quote

.>20th or so most controversial fic asks for fics with trans characters

The general attitude in this sub is changing(I don't really care because this doesn't affect me)but at least for a while this sub seemed legit unbearable and was just the biggest circlejerk.I don't really like “poor victimized Alan Rickman” tropes,but it would be nice if we can utter the slytherin head of house's name without several people quoting the Geneva convention and calling you a Snape apologist(which is possibly comes from “rape apologist)I swear sometimes it looks like FF.net from ~2003 or DLP

***** Here's the thing I've only ever came across fics that either A) Make it up like they are not evil just misunderstood, B) Gloss over the fact that even within that AU those character's hated each other's guts right before that scene is supposed to take place, C) Neither but somehow that is A-OK with mr/ms Good.

****** I just wanted to add that theres plenty of range between evil and misunderstood. Draco is not a good man, but I wouldnt say he is evil.

It isn't even, at least not yet, a Dramonie fic yet right after the Battle of Hogwarts when Hermione decides to leave she give Draco a way of keeping track of her and gives him a letter to give to Harry. There was obviously no other way of giving something to Harry. And what was the genius idea of giving somebody you just fought against a way of tracking you?

I'm sorry but some author's seems to just skip the "Giving a reason" part of making such interactions seem plausible. And does it just because.

I know that based upon the summary it might sound like That class of fics, but it isn't.

  Hermione was disoriented after the war ended. She made the decision to go her own way, after all, now that Harry had defeated Voldemort, she was not needed for him anymore, or that was what she thought, but after her departure Harry Potter thought differently. Eleven years looking for her, she comes back to help him save London again. But, at what cost?
