  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** Legacy has this and is really good so far.

linkffn(13255912)

In it all the founders are going to be reborn, though so far it's just Salazar and Godric as Harry and Cedric. Cedric is currently a first year, but Harry left the Dursleys and is living at Hogwarts.

Unfortunately however, the author seems to have gone down the path for starting a bunch of new fics when they already had several in progress ones, so updates aren't too frequent, and in my experience that usually leads to most of an authors fics getting abandoned. I like their Pokemon fic To Be A Master a lot though, and another of their HP fics, Strange Visitors From Another Century.

  Salazar Slytherin did not have an easy life, and he finally died alone after an argument with his dearest friends. Then he was reborn. Somehow. But life as the Boy Who Lived might be too much even for him. At least he doesn't have to do it alone.
