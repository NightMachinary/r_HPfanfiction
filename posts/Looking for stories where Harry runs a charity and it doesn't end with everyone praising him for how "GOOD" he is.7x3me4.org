After dropping "The Lily Potter Foundation" because it felt like every other paragraph someone pointed out how good/noble/selfless/nice Harry was, I was wondering if there are any stories where Harry has his own charity or otherwise does good work and there is some actual conflict due to it. Like people wondering why anyone would waste their money on Squibs or if it really was necessary to build another orphanage. Perhaps someone in the Ministry working against him or the remaining Death Eaters targeting whatever Harry is doing. Please no Ron/Hermione or Hermione/"anyone from Slytherin" in the background and preferably no nice Goblins, but I can suffer through that if there's nothing else.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry set up the Evans-Lupin Foundation to help discriminated and underprivileged people in Magical Britain. One notable beneficiary was Lavender Brown, who was classified by the Ministry as a 'dark creature' due to her injuries from Greyback during the Battle of Hogwarts. She wanted money and permit for opening a fashion design/enchanting business, and received help from Harry's charity.

On one hand, the Trio lived and slept together; on the other hand, Goblins were spiteful and violent creatures, the only magical non-human specie despised by Harry.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** A nice blend is needed. It would be refreshing for an arc to cover cynicism and push back. But honestly? When you run a charity like that, most people do just parrot about how amazing and good you are at least to your face. Which makes sense, even if you don't care you are going to be nice to someone you care for and acknowledge them doing something selfless.

** Linkffn(Blindness) has Harry establish a foundation for werewolves that I remember being fairly controversial with the Ministry and most of the public. In part because werewolves and also because Harry is a fairly reclusive figure in the story and people are legitimately afraid of him.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I kind of like "The Lily Potter Foundation" but you are totally right. I don't think the problem is specific to the whole charity thing though: It's just that after the first quarter of the fic all conflict just - poof - disappears and it's just fluff and feel-good stuff afterwards.

I think people could praise him for how good he is with his charity while still having another source of strife/conflict in the conflict. It's just that this fic lacks any kind of dramatic tension.
