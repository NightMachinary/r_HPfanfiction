I'm in the very beginning stages of working on a fic and plan to include what the physical toll of Azkaban would be like, which I feel is somewhat handwaved in canon. I am generally drawn to hurt/comfort, angst or somewhat melodramatic fics, so I want to avoid getting too hung up on this and try to accurately capture without going overboard. I have Sirius in mind but could apply to anyone who has stayed for a lengthy sentence without losing their mind.

I'm thinking about a few things...

Medical care. Given that prisoners who go mad and stop eating eventually die, and aren't removed from the island or treated, I believe there must be no access to medical care. A prisoner who develops pneumonia from exposure to the elements of the North Sea would just have to hope for recovery and not expect antibiotics.

Food. It's implied Sirius was starving. I'm sure there are nutritional issues, and I would imagine some prisoners suffer from deficiency related illness like scurvy. Do you picture the prisoners eating gruel or actually getting some sort of sustenance so the dementors can prolong their “feeding” off the prisoners?

How is Azkaban physically set up? In the movies, it's implied it's a stone floor and nothing else; but I also don't rely on the movies for canon. Do you think prisoners slept on the floor? Is there sanitation? How exposed to the elements? The dementors of course produce an internal feeling of cold but beyond that, are the prisoners subjected to the rain and wind of the North Sea? I think no access to natural light is a given because of the way post-Azkaban Sirius is frequently described as white, drawn or gaunt.

Isolation. For this, you can read accounts of real life prisoners exposed to prolonged solitary confinement as proof that the impact eventually becomes physical as much as mental. For someone like Sirius who I read as a person who needs to physically connect (e.g. reflexively moving to touch Harry as he recounts the graveyard attack in GoF), I see this as being especially challenging.

Finally, prolonged exposure to the dementors - strictly in a physical sense. Harry is shaky following any encounter, they produce feelings of cold, etc. I saw a head canon type post that suggested Sirius went color blind, which struck me as such a sad take on what it would be like to be around creatures that drain all happiness.

As has been noted by [[/u/Iniga123]], wizards don't get pneumonia, and would most likely expect healing potions of some sort, not antibiotics. But otherwise, yes.

(Mind you, I have the headcanon that Azkaban is sterile because even bacteria can't live in the vicinity of Dementors for too long. So you might die of cancer or a magical equivalent, but not disease.)

  Food. It's implied Sirius was starving.
#+end_quote

He was starving after a year on the run, and, besides, I think if the prisoners starve it's because they're too depressed to eat more than their survival instincts compel them to.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, more likely on mattresses of some sort. The Dementor guards don't want the prisoners /too/ uncomfortable, or they'd be of no use to them as a food source.

#+begin_quote
  I think no access to natural light is a given
#+end_quote

Definitely not. Dementors clearly don't do well with sunlight, or, really, any kind of light --- and they don't need it, since their "sigh" is soul-based, not light-based. As for Ekrizdis, he was just the sort of lunatic who'd love the dark and would use torches/Lumos all the time just because it was cooler.

#+begin_quote
  Isolation.
#+end_quote

I don't think they're necessarily isolated. Some fics assue there must be showers, where whatever prisoners are still responsive enough to get up are herded once a month or something like that, and that's one example of how the prisoners could meet one another. Mind you, in the close presence of the Dementors, it's unlikely they'd be in the mood to socialize.

#+begin_quote
  The dementors of course produce an internal feeling of cold
#+end_quote

It's not just an "internal feeling of cold" --- their aura genuinely bring mist and occasionally frost wherever they go. Remember that the rebel Dementors patrolling the land on behalf of Voldemort was enough to noticeably alter the climate of Britain, in the later books.

Interesting idea, though I'm not really sure I'd take it in into my headcanon, personally --- it's a bit too... abstract... for my taste, if you know what I mean. Though again, interesting.

*** Thanks for this. I'm in the middle of my first re-read in over a decade, only on book five, and forgot that dementors physically alter the space. I had it in my head that the PoA adaptation, with the wilting flowers, was entirely artistic license.

Also interesting point about the showers. Given that Sirius' robes are described as filthy, his hair matted and teeth yellow, I always assumed there is little to no hygienic care in Azkaban. But considered from your point of view, and the fact that twelve years without some type of hygienic care would surely leave him even worse off, much of his appearance was probably because of the year spent on the run. I'm wondering if there was ready access to showers and dental care, but the prisoners are far too gone to care or use it. (I cannot imagine a dementor providing a haircut in any circumstance though haha...)

Agreed, I think it's pretty clear there is no medical care as evidenced by the situation with Mrs. Crouch. Though because wizards are less susceptible to most/all Muggle illness, I doubt pneumonia would be a common problem even for the tiny subset of prisoners who don't just stop eating and die early on before anything else could get to them.

#+end_quote

I definitely believe they get sufficient sustenance. I go back and forth on whether the food might have a decent taste (so the prisoner could have a brief burst of happiness that the dementor would delight in swallowing) or whether it's just gray tasteless slop to go along with the general gray monotony of Azkaban. I think Sirius' starvation was due at least in part to not being emotionally able to eat all the time, and by the time Harry sees him exacerbated by a year of living rough as a scavenger.

I see it as a stone tower. Ratty mattresses magically fixed to the floor (you don't want to give prisoners access to a bedframe they might use as a suicide weapon) but the prisoners are almost immediately too far gone to care. One bucket in which food magically appears; one bucket for sanitation purposes that is magically emptied on occasion. Both buckets magically set in the stone floor so they can't be moved.

Agreed. I also look at the exposes of 19th century mental institutions in which the journalists point out that the inability to move or get any kind of mental stimulation is worse than the beatings/hunger/cold. Puts Sirius' claim to have missed doing the crossword in a less-smartass light...

That head canon is so sad! Azakaban is certainly dimly lit and monochromatic. Dogs see in a blue-gray-yellow sort of scale. One of my (happier) headcanons is that in an alterverse where Sirius' name is cleared, he goes to Remus in Yorkshire and stands there dazzled by the sunlit green because he's been so deprived of /color/ in one way and another.

*** I agree with almost all your points, but I do think the prisoners are at least semi starved. I don't think Sirius' body would've had the time between his escape to the confrontation in the shrieking shack to become what was described as skeletal and emaciated. I also think that I remember the other former prisoners, like Bellatrix, being described similarly.

Why the weird bucket-teleportation setup? Whose magic is doing this? Because Hogwarts does that with House-Elves, and I don't think House-Elves would last very long in Azkaban.

Personally, I just assumed Dementors brought them their food. Which, being cooked by Dementors, is probably nothing too refined, but I like your suggestion that it might actually be tasty so the Dementors can get just that extra bit of happiness to consume.

**** Oh, absolutely not house elves. My thought is more that the objects are themselves enchanted and controlled remotely with wizard-magic.

With what we've been told about dementors, I can't picture them as being physically capable of cooking-- maybe not even transporting-- food that would sustain a human.

I also don't think they'd want to open the cell doors AT ALL because of dementors' inability to see. And I don't think they'd want to give the prisoners any kind of mobile container because the prisoners might use it for suicidal or homicidal purposes (like 18th century prisoners constantly murdering one another by hitting each other over the head with chamber pots). Perhaps most importantly, don't give the prisoners anything different or stimulating while they're being punished. Part of the torture is keeping everything in the cell the same at all times so there's nothing but the absolute worst memories.

They certainly couldn't bake anything, but even if the food is made in the mainland (or the basic ingredients are), they could transport it to the cells themselves without too much trouble, I think.

As for opening the doors, I don't see what the problem would be. Assuming one of the very few wizards with enough resolve to try and escape even when face-to-face with a Dementor exerting its aura, Dementor's soul-sight is perfectly good enough to see if a wizard's trying to escape or not. Remember, Sirius only got through because they didn't recognize his dog-self as human, not because they couldn't see him. They just thought "hey, a mutt just jumped into the sea... well who cares?... also in unrelated news, apparently Sirius Black is dead, I can't sense him anywhere anymore, oh well, plenty more prisoners left to feed on".

****** While the cell doors aren't needed after a prisoner starts to fade, I think there's also a psychological aspect to never opening the doors at all. (I also don't headcanon that they were allowed out for showers. Hosed down through the bars, more likely.) The dementors are enough to keep them imprisoned in their own minds, but there's no reason not to use the structure of the place to help that sensation along.

I was under the impression that Azkaban was a Gringotts-type deal --- there are some very strict treaties, which both sides want to break, that force the Dementors to guard the prisoners and guard them well, or there /will/ be war... but as long as they don't overstep their bounds the Dementors /are/ in charge of the Fortress, and guard the prisoners in whatever way they damn well please, so long as they don't escape or die too quickly.

**** Thanks so much for these points. Really interesting, especially that wizards aren't susceptible to muggle disease; I forgot that point entirely. I actually had some manner of head canon that Sirius is far too stubborn to have starved in Azkaban, like some immutable part of him would go on fighting and digging in his heels, even if he were mentally gone, but the one time it got close likely involved some type of sickness while incarcerated.

But the point I mentioned about implied starvation is from his line to Harry about being "thin, very thin" in order to slip through the bars as the dementors fed him. I always imagined that once he had the thought of Peter's proximity to Harry to cling to, if anything, he would be eating more than usual and he was still that emaciated.
