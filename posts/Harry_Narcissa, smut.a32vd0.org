No Relationships (unlike the sexual one), no obligations, no (romantic) feelings. Just Sex. They are like in a Friends-with-benefits business.

Doesnt have to be Harry, who is the male part. I would also accept Ron....and it doesnt have to be Narcissa, but any other Woman who fits her "age" (even Bellatrix, if it fits), even an OC.

Its fine if there is romantic feeling teasing, but it shouldnt get to anything serious.
