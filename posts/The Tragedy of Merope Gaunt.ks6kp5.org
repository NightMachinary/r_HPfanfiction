Hi All,

I was reading a bit of HBP today, which happened to be the section introducing the Gaunt family. I was struck by the life of Merope, and wondered if there was any fanfic which gives her a better ending. I realize she dies giving birth to Tom Riddle, but it struck me this might be a prime candidate for time travelers to attempt to change, among other possibilities.

I'm hoping for something uplifting tonight, if at all, possible. Did anyone write the story where she lived to a ripe old age somewhere or found love with someone she didn't have to drug with a. potion? Thanks all for any recommendations :)


** To be honest, she did rape Tom Riddle Sr. and leave him traumatised forever.

*** So an AU where she didn't rape anyone would be an improvement.

*** That's entirely reasonable. I admittedly hadn't considered it from that perspective.

**** Honestly, both of them had a tragic life and Wizarding society on a whole, doesn't think of muggles as anything more than inconsequential.

** linkffn(Skin Deep by ImageViewer) is a Harry/Merope time travel story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12954108][Link in case the bot is still struggling]]

linkffn(The First Time Harry Tried to Time Travel by HarryPotterFangirl85) is another Harry/Merope time travel story, but isn't as good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13572389][Link]]

linkffn(Butterfly Effect by GaleSynch) is about a self insert character born as Merope's younger sister. Merope is actually a pretty minor character in it, but her life does turn out better. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10115976][Link]]

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope? No romance

  Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope
