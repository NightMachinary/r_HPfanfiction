This shouldn't be hard to find if you read a lot of creature! Harry but I can't seem to find it.

It takes place 5th or 6th year and Harry is at the dursleys. He starts to develope horns and wings and such and aunt petunia kicks him out.

He heads to knockturn Ally under his invisibility cloak to get some clothes and a way to hide his wings and horns so that he can go to Hogwarts.

The man at the clothes store recommends an inn where he learns that non-humans at called people and that he is called a switch for obvious reasons.

A lady who was supposed to be his soulmate shows up, gives him a baby and dies giving him two hooped earrings.

He finds out that he is royalty and is on the run from the woman's parents, king and queen.

So yeah, He eventually goes to Hogwarts and it has a second book.

If you don't know it I would also like if you had any creature! Harry suggestions that don't permanently evolve around sex and mates.

Thanks! üòã


** Can't help with the fic you search. As to your request for suggestions: "Cold Blood" doesn't focus on sex and mates. Harry doesn't get horns, but he does get wings.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
