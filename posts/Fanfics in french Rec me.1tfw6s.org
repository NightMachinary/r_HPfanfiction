So I'm trying to immerse myself in french during the vacations - does anybody have any good french fanfics? I normally read from the DLP library (nonjon, kwan li, more AU stuff generally, time travel, cross-overs..)

I know it's a long shot since we're not exactly a huge community, but I saw the way you guys answered my last question (Read HP: A Magnificent Bastard if you haven't already!) Thanks in advance!


** Holy shit holy shit, I've been waiting for a while to recommend the following fics. They're in french, and I've pretty much read everything worthwhile in french and english, but I swear those ones are the BEST in any freaking language. Please please take the time to read them. They will just blow your mind. So, here they are :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2211674/1/Les-Secrets-d-Hermione][Les Secrets d'Hermione]] :

Shitty title? Yes. This is not a Hermione centric fic. It's more around Harry, it starts at the 6th year (after the publication of the fifth book). There is two volume, and together they have more words than the whole HP saga. The author has the same age than JKR, and her maturity shows in her work. It's very well written, and it takes every details from the previous books into account, and you'll be amazed by how she managed to give a very logical plot to follow the cannon. This is my all-time fave, and I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I read it 4 times.

Next, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1278287/1/Les-Portes][Les Portes]] :

There is no way you haven't heard of this Time-Travel masterpiece if you are in the frenchspeaking part of Fanfiction. It's a classic, and a beautiful use of Time-Travel. It follows Harry and Drago, who, in their fifth year, find themselves in Hogwarts circa marauders. It's not a slash, they're not besties : everything is believable and, here again, well written.

Bref camarade francophone, je te conseille très vivement de lire ces deux histoires, et si jamais (pour des raisons vraiment occultes) tu as du mal après les premiers chapitres, CONTINUE!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/983391/Tinn-Tam][Tinn Tam]] has a story written in French, her native tongue, though if you follow DLP stuff you've probably come across her work.

[[http://frenchsession.fanficauthors.net/][FrenchSession]] on Fanficauthors.net has several translations of the site's stories along with a few original stories. The translations in particular I've found useful for gaining familiarity with the language (open the English chapter in a browser tabs next to the French and flip back as needed when encountering a passage one can't parse).

** I don't speak French, but I did some profile hopping and I found this guy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/714560/benebu][benebu]]

He seems relatively popular for a foreign author and I have faith in the opinions of the authors whose fics that I've favourited.
