This is as much of a question as it is a story prompt. What if Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, world-famous child and heir to a considerable fortune and cosmetic patent/royalties was raised under the watch of affluent, wealthy and knowledgeable Professor Horace Slughorn following his quitting of his position as Hogwarts' Potions Master?


** It's wild how under-utilized Slughorn is given the types of stories the fandom enjoys. True, he really isn't needed career wise for BWL Harry, but he can do much of what Snape can albeit to a less impressive degree and he's actually a well connected pureblood and a, canonically speaking, old, and probably wealthy, family.

** If anything Slughorn is a really good careers advisor who is able to set student up well when he sees talent.

I think he would ensure Harry would have great instructors for the things he enjoys. Maybe convince a EX quiditch champion to give harry lessons or get Flitwic to give harry Dueling lessons.

I think he could have also helped Ron find his niche and maybe even propelled SPEW to new heights.

Even in the real world connections are everything. This could be a cool fic.

** *I'll take a craic at it. Here goes. Feel free to critique and add on as you see fit.*

"Horace."

"Albus." They nodded to each other, and the wizened old man in strange robes turned around with a flourish and disapparated with a crack. Horace Slughorn, esteemed potions master, looked over at the bundle that began to cry at being awakened by the noises. He ran his hand over his face, walking over to the table and picking the child up.

"We're going to work on your poker face, Harry." Inquisitive green eyes, not unlike the ones he had seen from Lily Potter, bore right into his soul and he wondered idly what he had just gotten into.

--------------

"It's all about networking!" Horace gesticulated wildly to the board behind it. On it was the magicked names of how the ministry worked and the people in charge of it. Eight year old Harry Potter nodded seriously, and Horace grinned at his protégé. He checked his watch, jumping when he realised the time.

"It's packing time, Harry!" He bustled into the kitchen of the house they were currently inhabiting. The month was almost up, and it was time for them to move. He gathered their trunks, shrinking them down to fit into a bigger one, and then carefully placing cushioning charms around the ones that contained his potion stores.

"G--g-grandpa Horace?" He sighed, restraining himself from reprimanding Harry for continuing to stutter. The child was brilliant with his tutelage, but he needed to learn to exude the confidence of a Slytherin. Grandpa Horace was his unfortunate moniker, and he had crinkled his nose when he had realised that it made him seem old.

"Yes, Harry?" He answered back, pondering on whether it was too risky to grab some crystalized pineapple out in public as he summoned their belongings and used the extra clothing and knick-knacks to pad the trunk.

"Where are we going this time?" Harry had always loved the game of packing up. He never understood why they couldn't just stay in one house all the time. He was only ever able to make friends once- with a girl named Hermione. Grandpa Horace had given him a knowing smile and ushered them away from his ingredients after delivering a lecture about why it was prudent to have anti-venom for every creature possible on hand at all times.

"I believe we haven't been to Surrey for a while." Slughorn checked the baggage, closing the trunk shut carefully and removing all traces they were ever there. Harry beamed, used to the song and dance of side-apparation. He was suddenly squeezed through a tube and they popped out on a darkened street filled with overly manicured houses.

Harry examined everything around him, just as he had been taught to do, while Horace laid charm after charm and spell after spell to make sure that no one heard them and no one saw them.

"Privet drive." He reported back to his grandfather. Horace nodded, clearly on high alert, his eyes darting around for threats. His cedarwood wand was at the ready, and Harry scoped out the nearby houses. They all looked the same from the outside- the same yellow stucco walls and brown roofs. They all had perfected lawns. It was honestly like he had been dropped into a doll's world. The only difference he could see were the curtains blocking the windows and the fancy cars in the drives. The fanciness increased with each house, as if they were all trying to upstage each other. Harry frowned, unfocused on his grandfather who was gesturing at him that he had found a house. Harry sprinted back over, sure he was going to get a lecture soon.

They entered the vacant house- namely, number four, Privet drive, Surrey.

--------------

"Wonderful!" Slughorn exuded happiness as he tested Harry's latest potion- the draught of living death, which was a NEWT level potion. "With my tutelage, Harry, you're going to be the star of Hogwarts. You remind me more of your mother every day." Harry grinned at his surrogate grandfather.

An tawny owl flew through the open window, hooting contentedly as Harry absentmindedly stroked its head and looked at the letter. It was addressed in green ink, a wax seal with the seal of Hogwarts on it.

/Harry Potter/

/Kitchen/

/14 Milbank road/

/Hartlepool, England./

Harry tore open the letter eagerly, Horace looking over his shoulder and commenting on which books were the most useful. They owned most of them already, so it was just the robes they needed. Harry and Horace had gone into Diagon alley under disguises to get Harry a wand, a holly wood with phoenix . Now that his magical core was stabilized, Horace was going to take him for his second wand.

"You're going to take Hogwarts by storm. A slytherin, through and through. Remember, Harry, connections can take you far, and subtlety-" Harry joined in on the last part, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the mantra that his grandfather had been stating since he was younger. He was eleven now and he was going to Hogwarts!

"Subtlety is key."

"Exactly." Horace sat down next to him, placing a mug of tea in front of his ward. "Allies can help you greatly in the Slytherin house. Or whatever house you're sorted into. Your parents were both Gryffindors, in fact." Harry brightened at the mention of his parents. Slughorn wondered if he ought to contact Snape for some photos for Harry's christmas present. He had realised that Harry might not be sorted into Slytherin. Nature vs Nurture, after all. Both of his parents were Gryffs, through and through.

--------------

Harry grinned as they arrived at King's cross. Horace quickly adjusted his and Harry's clothing, ruffling the boy's hair in a caring gesture. Harry was not wearing a disguise this time, but he still was. He knew that the reason that he was still alive was because of his paranoia and need to survive. A group of loud redheads blocked the entrance to the platform, loudly chatting about Hogwarts, and he resisted the urge to curl his lip, telling himself that he was over the prejudices of his past.

Finally, the plump redhead lady made her way through, and Harry turned those large green eyes on him.

"Can we go together, grandpa Horace?" Horace smiled kindly, placing his large hand on his ward's shoulder, and they ran through the barrier.

--------------

*Year 1* "/Slytherin!/" The hat called out to the now silent hall. Harry excitedly took off the sorting hat, resisting the urge to run and write a letter at that very moment. There was minimal applause from the Slytherin house, only shock from the other three, as the boy who lived made his way to the house of Snakes, and sat down next to Draco Malfoy. Mcgonnagall shakily called out the next name.

"My grandpa Horace told me that I was most likely going to be in Slytherin." Harry said aimlessly to the boy next to him, the same snot from the seamstress.

"Your grandfather?" Draco looked confused.

"Yes," Harry said, proud that he was leading the conversation for once. "He's not my biological grandpa. He used to be the potions professor and head of Slytherin. Horace Slughorn."

"Horace Slughorn!" The darn skinned boy next to Draco Malfoy nearly spit out his pumpkin juice. Harry grinned inside, and easily chatted with his housemates.

"Say, Malfoy, who's the turban?" The darker boy, who had just discovered was Blaise Zabini, asked.

"Oh, that's professor Quirrel." Draco sneered. "He's the defense teacher this year, but he used to be the muggle studies. Stupid mudblood." Harry carefully took a sip of his pumpkin juice, his knuckles strained white on his goblet, as he resisted the urge to deck Draco. He set it down, deciding to examine Quirrel further, but was attacked by a ghastly pain in his head. He quickly looked away, massaging his temples and decided to look into that later.

"What about the man next to him?" Harry asked carefully.

"That's Professor Severus Snape, potions master and head of Slytherin." Draco revealed. "He's my godfather."

Harry let out a simple noise of acknowledgement, pondering on how he could get the man on his side. Connections were everything, after all. It wouldn't hurt to have his back. It also wouldn't hurt to look into Quirrel and why the man was staring at with such vitrol.

** Slughorn would likely impress that knowing someone is almost as important as knowing something and sometimes more important. Harry perhaps being more proactive, not being abused or hated, would see connections as tools to better himself ways to learning new skills or better already existing ones. The phrase "I know a Guy" never far from his lips. Harry would be awesome.

Slughorn like in Canon would see his new baby boy as his crown jewel, Harry would never need of anything while he quietly pushes Harry to grow strong and powerful. Harry is the perfect hook for new contacts, his ability to be a powerbroker Almost doubled over night, but for Harry to be of use he must actually be good at and knowledgeable in things Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, Sports, Defense if Albus's warnings come true.

** I wonder if i could write something like Horace shows up to Godric Hollows because he noticed on his desk his fish die and it would be a delayed time release port key incase lily ever died. Horace shows up just as voldemort casts the killing curse on harry.
