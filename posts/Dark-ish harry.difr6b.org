I just recently read harry potter and the boy who lived by the Santi And I loved the concept of a dark harry. That isn't just "Oh I hate the universe so let me flaunt my super strong magic on children" If anyone knows any fics like it that arent abandoned it would be greatly appreciated!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I don't know if you've been to fanfics.me version of it but it's like 10 chapters longer than the one on FanFiction.net You can just google Harry Potter and the boy who lived fanfics.me to get to it.

*** I did this but it would seem those chapters have been removed at some points. I found a wayback machine time for the main page but there were no screenshots of the chapters themselves
