I've read 2 fics(cant remember the name of the other one) recently where Harry goes awol with Bill and becomes a cursebreaker's assistant and leaves Dumbles in the dust. They aren't particularly dark or angsty, just more 'indiana jones' adventure type feel with Harry learning things that will help him to defeat Voldie along the way.\\
I'm interested in more fics of a similar feel. I'm cool with most pairings, or none at all, enjoy bashing dumbles, weasleys/order and hermione in some ways or not. I prefer the realistic slow build of skills as opposed to those where he suddenly become super powered through some silly plot device. Bonus points if Harry is a smart ass(actually any story where harry is a smart ass is good). I'm into longer fics if that makes a difference!


** I've just recently started writing a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11254380/1/The-many-adventures-of-Harry-Potter][fanfiction]] myself that is going to go in that direction. It will be a while before it gets there though. So far I've got 20000 words published that are mostly character building.

** I don't think I've read it, but maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer][HP and the Cursed Summer]] will fit the bill?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10901705/1/Out-of-the-Dark-and-into-the-Green][Out of the Dark and into the Green]] Didn't read Bungle in the Jungle, but in this fic Harry learns how to defend himself away from civilization. No Dumbledore or Weasley bashing though (which I'm glad for).
