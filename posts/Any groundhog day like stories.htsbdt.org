But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

** linkao3(Prelude and Fugue by she_s gone).

linkffn(Ground Hog Day by Rorschach's Blot). Harry's repeating the same day. Luna isn't, but she's aware that he is.

linkffn(Geminio by Portus).

linkffn(All Our Yesterdays by SallyJAvery).

linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT).

linkffn(Looped by Rumour of an Alchemist). Lily keeps looping back to her sorting. Not repeating the same day, but repeating her life from the sorting to Voldemort's attack.

linkffn(Right Moments by Judah). This is a Ranma 1/2 fanfiction. Happosai uses the Nanban Mirror to put Ranma into a repeating day scenario.

Personally, I don't differentiate between one-shots and longer stories as necessarily different types (short stories, novellas, and novels are, to some extent, arbitrary distinctions), and I don't run across poems and songfics often enough in fanfiction for me to think of them, normally.

** Linkao3(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Harry gets sent back random lengths of time whenever he is killed. Voldemort and the Death Eaters are considerably more dangerous than they were in canon so it happens quite often.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
