I see it as a missing scene from the books. Shame we never saw if Neville found out or not, I'd love to have seen his reaction.


** :o Yes! I've never read any fics where Neville gets to confront Barty Jr! Everyone always focuses on Bellatrix, but he was there too!!!

*** Rabastan and Rodolphus were also involved, but yeah, people heavily focus on Bellatrix.

It'd be a interesting read up, for Neville to find out the truth about fake Moody, especially since fake Moody took time to talk to Neville (If my memory serves, he talked to him about Herbology and asked to have tea with him?).

**** Was Barty Jr being fake Moody even a part of Neville's reasons to join the DA? Or was it just Bellatrix breaking out of Azkaban in fifth year? Because it should've been fake Moody FIRST! If not then even CANON ignores him and focuses on Bellatrix for some weird reason!

***** Mhm... there's nothing for or against Barty Jr being fake Moody was a part of Neville's joining the DA, so you could potentially write it either way, since we aren't inside Neville's head.

** Honestly this makes me want to change some of the earlier Moody Neville interactions so that when the reader reads it they have another meaning behind what Moody says IE:

"Longbottom! What are you bawling about?"

"I-it's Professor Snape sir he threatened to poison my toad,"

"Listen to me Longbottom, I knew your parents, we both fought in the war, never once did they cry when they were attacked, and here you sit crying about your toad."

"B-but sir,"

"Come up to my office we'll have a cup of tea, I have another book for you,"

That would be really interesting to see a couple chapters of Neville's perspective. I imagine it would be very conflicting for him since he thought Moody was genuinely trying to help him, when actually Moody was just using him to get to Harry.

Add some more conflict in the battle of Hogwarts scene by making Barty survive til then, Neville vs Barty. They're fighting, Neville gets the upper hand, Barty brings up that he was Moody and he wasn't all bad he helped Neville grow stronger, I would probably make it so Neville dies GRRM style by making him do the "honorable" thing of sparring Barty because of that perceived help earlier on.

Maybe it wasn't JKRowling's intention, or perhaps it was, but I could also see Barty Crouch Jr hanging out with Neville just to mess with his emotions. Being a supportive male adult role model that Neville is lacking, would push him hard, if/when Neville learned that Fake Moody had been Barty Crouch Jr all along.
