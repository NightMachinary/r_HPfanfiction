I recently read Clean and Marked by Olivie Blake and I loved the Dudley relationship with Harry and how he was so enamored but the wizard if world.

Looking for fics where he and Harry rekindle a friendship, and maybe even one where Petunia actually looks after Harry.

I read a Dudley fic where his daughter turns out to be a witch and I loved it.

Or!!!!

I'm looking for fics where Narcissa takes Hermione under her wing. It could be Dramione, I don't mind. Or even Lucius being somewhat kind to Hermione.

I'm open to anything and everything :)


** Dudley Dursley fics that I personally like -

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he discovers some wonderful wizarding adult beverages and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons for drinking heavily at Harry Potter's wedding. In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world and change his life forever.

- “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]” by Forrest_of_Holly series. It is very different from your normal Dudley-has-magical-daughter stories and very very good.

Dudley and Harry's relationship isn't the main plot but it does play a good role.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
