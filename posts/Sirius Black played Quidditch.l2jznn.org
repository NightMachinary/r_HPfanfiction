I just found out that Sirius Black was a Keeper. I always thought that he was a Beater, if he played at all. Did anyone else think that or just me?


** I think that is mostly a fannon thing (not sure about cannon tho but as it has not bearing on the story directly its free to be used however in cannon)

** I think it's fanon because the books don't specify whether her played or not. The books only specify Regulus was the Slytherin's team seeker.

** Where did you find out? I didn't think there was any information on whether Sirius played Quidditch

**** You're on [[https://the-new-au.fandom.com/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_Team][the wrong wiki]]. On [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team][the correct wiki]], it correctly does not mention Sirius playing at all.

It is common fanon that he played Beater, but canonically, we don't know whether or not he played at all.
