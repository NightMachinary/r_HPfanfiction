If there already is one, let me know but for now, what would you want in a site like that?

I would think it would first of all have to be a browser addon so there's a button on your taskbar. Like a fic you're reading, click the button and then click through the toggles about what you enjoy or hashtags.

Or the fic is slash but no mention of it in the blurb. you tag it as slash, making it searchable or avoidable.

And when on the actual site, you can then decide what you want to read. Want a story where Harry and Hermione are Dominants while Luna is their sub, click sub!Luna_Lovegood and Domme!Hermione_Granger and Dom!Harry_Potter. Oh hey, there's Domme+Dom'r: A Lust Story.

So, thoughts?


** Definitely tags. Tag the shit out of it.

**** You can add tags if you bookmark it, but I'm not sure if they are in the search results when looking for all fics. Maybe if you search under "bookmarks", then your tags will be in the results.

***** ahh, yeah, like that. BUT community moderated, not author moderated. SO rather unlikely to see some of the drivel people have put--sadly, including myself. I should go edit.

** lol, I thought you meant someone reading through a fic and giving a review of it.

"The grammar was quite good, and the concept of Harry going independently of the Order is a nostalgic treat. While the massive Death Eater orgy (complete with a detailed description of Voldemort's Voldie-bits) came completely out of left field, Hermione's transformation into a divine shadow phoenix more than made up for it. The Author's description of House Elf Coitus is thoughtful and vivid; he obviously spent quite a bit of time on it. My only problem with the fic is that Ron and the Nimbus 2001 never got past third base."

*** Yes. but alongside the review, a star rating, hashtags to show elements of the story.

And ron, you bastard, nimbuses are highly susceptible to blue twigs!

**** It could work, I'm personally sick of reading really good fics only for it to devolve into some kind of gay threeway magical BDSM.

And why blame Ron? The Giant Squid was totally cockblocking him.

Literally.
