I've stuck to reading only on FanFiction.Net so far, simply because of the fact that the app exists. Now I feel like I have read most of the top tier fics on there so I have decided to see what AO3 has to offer. My two questions are:

1. What is the best way to read from AO3 on iOS? Is there an app or should I just use the browser? (And does it have a dark mode?) Any tips on how to search for stories would also be appreciated.
2. What stories should I start with? Give me the best of the best that I have been missing out on.

I appreciate any help. Thanks!


** There's no official AO3 app, and I've never bothered to look into unofficial ones, as the site's quite functional through a browser.

The biggest difference between reading of FFN and AO3 is that there are extensive filter options on AO3. In addition to the rating, language, and character options on FFN, AO3 also lets you filter by major warnings, category (ie, het, gen, slash, femslash), ships, and addition tags. And you can also chose to /exclude/ fics that have any of those tags.

The additional tags section is, I think, where people are most likely to get overwhelmed, because there are a lot of them. The most common additional tags are genre ones, like "Romance," "Angst," and "Fluff," but as you get into narrower subsections of fic, you'll find much more specific ones - "Ron Weasley is a Good Friend," "Professor Harry Potter," etc. It might seem like a lot at first, but they really do make it easier to search through fics.

Without knowing your tastes in fanfic I'm not really sure what to rec, but I did really enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] linkao3(6701647), which is a canon-compliant, trio-centric fic set several decades after the epilogue.

** When you search, it defaults to most recently updated, so the top results will probably only have 1 chapter or be poorly written. You should click on "filter" then change the "sort by" to kudos or bookmarks. It won't necessarily show the /best/, and you'll still have to do some digging, but it's better and at least it's more than a chapter.

I've read ao3 on a browser instead of an app. I don't think there's an app for ao3. For dark mode, I think there's skins? But I haven't used them and don't know how to. You might also need to create an account (which takes a few weeks to get approved) to use the skins, but I'm not sure. But anyway, I think the easiest way to read in dark mode is if your browser has dark mode. Kiwi browser has night mode and is very similar to chrome, if it's on ios. Otherwise I imagine there'll probably be some browser on ios that has dark mode.

I don't really use ao3 much for harry potter fanfic, so I don't know many fics on there. But two of the fics I've liked and seen exclusively on ao3 are The Very Secret Diary (which technically is a repost from another site because the original was deleted for some reason) and The Two Body Problem.

#+end_quote

You should only sort by kudos if you want to read kink or smut fics, otherwise it's better to sort by bookmarks.

In practice, people on Ao3 use kudos like a quick 'thumbs up' button to show the author that they enjoyed reading a fic but not enough to want to read it again. Bookmarks, on the other hand, show that the reader liked the fic so much that they want to add it to a personal list that they can come back to later. For whatever reason, kink fics tend to accumulate a large number of kudos whereas actual high quality fics tend to pull ahead in number of bookmarks.

**** oh really? That makes sense though. I usually sort by bookmarks, so I've never really noticed, but I thought they would be they would be sort of similar except that chaptered fics might get more bookmarks. In fact, I thought they would only be some amount better than sorting by hits. It would be cool if we had a way of sorting by percentage of bookmarks over hits for fics with at least 1000 hits or something.
