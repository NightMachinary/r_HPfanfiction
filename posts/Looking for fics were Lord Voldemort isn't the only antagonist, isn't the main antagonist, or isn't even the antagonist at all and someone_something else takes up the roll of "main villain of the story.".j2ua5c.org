Basically, I'm looking for any fic where Harry & co. are facing against some threat that /isn't/ Voldemort, or Voldemort is a secondary threat. Hell, are there any fics where there's an enemy-of-my-enemy situation where Harry & Voldemort /team up/ to deal with a greater threat?

I'd prefer fics where romance is nonexistant or a tertiary element at most. Bashing is fine as long as the rest of the story is interesting.


** If you don't mind the series not being complete, what about A Second Chance at Life linkffn(2488754) and sequels by Miranda Flairgold? The main antagonists are demons from another plane, and Voldie's just a big inconvenience.

** The Quiet Place, linkffn(8410168). 500 years later, a new group of terrorists arises.

Mud, Blood, and the Sound of Guns, linkffn(8410168). The Ministry sides with Voldemort against the muggles.

Time Again, linkffn(8410168). Harry/Hermione redo story. Voldemort is dealt with quickly. Likely more romance than you're looking for.

Mirror, Mirror, linkffn(13375810). Voldemort is still kinda the main baddy, but Harry's not involved.

Diabolic, linkffn(13375810). Harry, et. al., are transported into the game Diablo. Not my favorite, but YMMV.

Elizium for the Sleepless Souls, linkffn(7713063). Harry has to escape from a collapsing Azkaban.

Don't Ask Questions, linkffn(8285215). Voldemort is just the tip of the iceberg.
