Not in Tom's head as a second mind, but in Tom's body, as Tom themselves.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

***** Yeah it may seem a bit weird but I think the author used it in a fun and interesting enough way that it can be excused

*** That's the fic that inspired the request. It's still ongoing, but I'm up to date with it. I didn't want anyone to link Evil Overlord List, so I specified “not as a second mind”.

  Tom Riddle had unlimited potential, only tempered and twisted by his crippling fear of death. Luckily this wasn't his story anymore and subsequently the future writes itself anew. After all in this life where strength equaled survival, and weakness equaled death -- failure was no option. Antagonistic!SI, SI as Tom Riddle
