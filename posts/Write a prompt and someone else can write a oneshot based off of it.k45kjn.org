** "Mr. Potter, how about you dance with me?"

Snickers echoed around the room, but Harry just stood up, grinning from ear to ear.

"I had no idea you were into children, but I can fully assure you I am not interested!" he cried joviantly, saluting her before sitting down. Mcgonagall was flustered.

"I'm sorry? Mr. Potter, I just need you to demonstrate the dancing technique."

Harry stood up yet again.

"Yes, I gathered that. But, you see, anyone that dances with me is bound to fall in love with me!"

Shrugging, Harry walked forward, took Mcgongalls hands and proceeded to...

sweep her off her feet! He looked utterly bored, and when the music ended, he stepped away from a brightly blushing Mcgonagall.

"Well, I-I,"

Harry took up a perfect poker face and walked away calmly. The next day saw him being asked by every single girl from all 3 schools.
