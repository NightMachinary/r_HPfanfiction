Let's assume that Voldemort was killed by Harry and James and Lily survived. If James and Severus had a Wizarding Duel who would win? Who would have a larger magical core? Who would have better tactics?

And please remember, some may consider Severus a bad person, some may not. But the point to remember is that he was an accomplished wizard nonetheless.

(not that it matters, but the duel takes place in Harry's fifth year. )


** Idk if I'm mixing up fanon and canon but it seems like James was presented as the more talented wizard overall.

** First, I want to point out that the "magical core" is a fanon concept, and one that doesn't mix very well with the Magical System we learn about in canon. It's just a cheap way to make a character (usually Harry) more powerful than the rest. If it existed in Canon, it would also change the Blood Purism ideology from a bunch of nonsense to something that kinda made sense (powerfull family could marry people with large "Magical Core" to create stronger wizards over time, and it's not "totally" impossible that some people managed to "steal" cores, explaining Muggleborn and Squibbs).

​

Now that this is said, in the case of a duel between Severus and James (an all out one, without any rule or help), I would probably bet on Snape. Not because I think he is the more powerful one, but because it feels like his favoured school of Magic (the Dark Arts) are more dangerous than James' (Transfiguration). If something like a conjured beast manage to get you, you still have a chance to get up, heal the injury and continue the fight; but if you are hit by something like the "/Sectumsempra/", you are on the ground, bleeding to death.

You think it would be easier to deal with a bear that's on top of you actively mauling you to death?

** I'm not sure. 20yo James would have greater speed and reflexes than 20yo Snape, so I think he would win, unless he would underestimate Snape.

** I'm going to say Snape, especially by 1995/96 in a world where Voldemort died in 81'. I could picture James mellowing with his family and losing his edge, while Snape would probably continue to hone his skills.

If we ignore outside influence and fanon theories, James' specialty is shown to be Transfiguration, while Snape was creating offensive spells of his own at 16/17 years of age, and according to Sirius, he knew more of Dark Arts at 11 than most 7th years. That isn't to say Transfiguration couldn't be utilized in dueling, only that Snape's knowledge (outside of potions) is shown to be concentrated more in dueling abilities. By 95', that knowledge and ability would--theoretically--be greatly expanded.

It's impossible to say who would have better "tactics," as both were intelligent, creative wizards. Imo, I believe Snape would have the upper hand, as his character seems more likely to attack with a higher degree of violence than James would. Then again, Snape in canon is shown to have a volatile temper, which could lead to him making mistakes.

*** I think Snape is most likely to use Occlumency in a duel to keep his temper in check. I would expect James to be a little more volatile because he didn't have as much control over Occlumency as far as we know (Snape being a master) and he was most likely to lose his temper if someone mocked or insulted him or his family.

**** Snape has never been able to keep his emotions in check in canon. Oh he talks a good tale but I'm going to take his words with a bucketful of salt coz we've seen his become very emotionally unstable multiple times.

***** Hmm.... Yeah that also makes sense. Perhaps he uses it in front of Voldemort only, or when he Suspects somebody might try to break in into his mind. And he has too much self esteem to consider that a few children could break into his mind, or that his enemies James or Sirius could do so to him.

** Magical cores don't exist. They're something made up by bad fanfic writers as an extremely lazy and unimaginative way of comparing various characters' relative abilities, and so that they can show off how powerful their favorite characters' is.

Better tactics- probably Snape, but to be fair, if anything could provoke him to a reckless mistake, it would be fighting James.

As to who would win- impossible to say. We never see enough of James in action to know just how good he is. If we assume he's roughly on par with Sirius, I think Snape, but then Sirius's abilities likely declined due to his time in Azkaban.

** I'd say James was more powerful when they were younger. But I don't believe in magical cores - I think it's like athletic ability, where you may start with a certain level of innate talent, but how much you hone it with study and practice also matters a lot. For instance, Harry might have as much natural talent as Hermione, if not more, but she's better at most spells than he is because she works harder and studies more.

So then the question is, what's James like as an adult in this scenario? If he spent the intervening years as an Auror, tracking down dark wizards and honing his abilities, then he's probably still better than Snape. If he was off playing professional Quidditch or living an easy life while Snape was challenging himself magically, then Snape might be better as an adult.

** The fanon of ‘magical cores aside'... Snape is said to know more Dark Arts as a first year than many knew as seventh year. Both are talented and had experimented with magic in school (the map, animagi; sectumspemra, altercations to potions), but the direction of Snape's creations seems to be more useful in a fight. Snape was a Death Eater who probably had run ins with aurors and hit wizards. James being an Auror is a popular fanon but we don't know that for sure, though he was an Order member and most likely fought Death Eaters too. Overall, I would say Snape would win, if only he's more likely to know some nasty obscure spells and use underhand tactics.

** whoever got the surprise round on the other, but the thing is we don't know how they fight that well.\\
The other question is what counts as winning? The other unable to cast spells, unable to fight at all, dead?\\
Because James seems unwilling to use deadly force from the little we know about him.\\
Then there is the question if they fight with the same role in mind.\\
I personally think that someone who is good in transfiguration would be great as a battlefield controller, as in deciding how someone has to move, who has to fight who, hazards in their ways, isolating targets, preventing others from fighting, conjuring creatures to fight, pulling up walls, turning the floor into larva. Those things can be insanely powerful with a strategic and creative mind of you fight bigger groups of enemies, but less so in a one-on-one, especially against someone whose sole target is to hurt you. This is, I think, where James would shine, but he doesn't have those spells that could one-shot kill you, like Snape. But he could fight off a huge group of enemies even outnumbered.

I hope I made it understandable

*** The issue with transfiguration in a fight is that the opponent can transfigure the object you did into something harmless, or harmful to you.

Transfiguration is a more of a distraction or an ambush tool.
