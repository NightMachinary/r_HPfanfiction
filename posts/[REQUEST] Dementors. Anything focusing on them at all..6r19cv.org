I'll take just about anything other than slashfics, stories with graphic sexual content or slashfics with graphic sexual content, because I'm not in the mood for those.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** Not 100% Dementor-centric, but I rather liked linkffn(10182397), which has Dementors still playing a surprisingly big part I'd say (if my memory serves me right). Also, there is a still ongoing sequel (well, actually prequel), which also focusses on them a little.

A little warning though, it's extremely gory. No sexual themes, as far as I remember, but definitely some ugly fighting going on.

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.

  To the rest of the Galaxy, they were ruthless, cold and the ultimate warriors. Though in reality, they were scientists and poets who shared a love for fighting. Now they needed to escape this galaxy, and find another place they could call home. Expect the unexpected, and a whole new look out.

** I'm pretty sure HPMOR focuses quite a lot on Dementors, though it's certainly not the primary focus of the story.
