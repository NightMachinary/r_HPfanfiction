So I'm planning to make a dark lord Harry fic set during his years at Hogwarts and then after the war.

What sort of tropes should I avoid and what should I add in it?


** First off - it is your story, write what sounds fun & right to you. All other input should be secondary.

However, there would be few points I'd suggest to think about:

- don't make him overly powerful without reason. Show him having ambition & desire, and have him learn, practice and study magic over time. Do rituals, research magical artefacts, etc. Too many stories give him too much power too quickly for all the wrong reasons.
- give him actual reason to be "dark". it can be that he likes control over others, or thinks wizarding world needs reform and he is just the guy to do it, perhaps he was abused and lashes out now that he can. But do try and give a reasonable cause for his motives.
- Avoid senseless bashing, evil Dumbledore, overly abusive Dursleys, Weasleys who steal his gold, Goblins who are social justice warriors and help him reclaim hundred mansions, etc. Would be interesting to see a good dark Harry, where it is for some other reason, or maybe because that's the person he truly is underneath.
- Try and avoid making him Voldemort 2.0
- no matter how intelligent or dark, 11yo won't be a political mastermind, 13yo won't be able to take on grown witch or wizard in fair duel, 17yo, no matter how prodigiously talented won't beat Dumbledore/Voldemort in a fair duel either.
- Try and avoid the usual "Dark, but not evil" trope where he is super loving, cuddly and gentle to his girlfriend/boyfriend & friends he loves, while torturing and murdering everyone else by the hundreds. Murdering psychopaths don't do loving and fluffy.
- Considering it is Hogwarts years, I would advise to keep his Dark Lord domain contained in Hogwarts, more a Dark Lord in training. While perhaps possible, it is highly unlikely a pubescent boy would strike fear or inspire much control over grown witches and wizards.

These are few points that spring to mind. Good luck with your story!

** Well, if you want him to become sorta insane, show DEVELOPMENT. Show him battling with maybe and addiction to the Dark Arts.

Try to avoid him just being evil. I've seen this hundreds of times. What you need to do is show WHY he is evil, in like a prequel or something.

He also needs a PLAN. Why is he a dark lord? Is he fighting to change something? If so, what and why?

EMOTIONS! He has emotions, maybe not remorse, but you don't want a Dark Harry who is just emotionless, even if he appears that way.

His followers, what was their BACKSTORY? Why do they want to follow him? Or are they forced?

DWPEB- Be warned I have just made this up...

Development- Where is this Harry going to go? What pushes him over the edge?

Why- Why is he evil? Why is he a ruthless Dark Lord?

Plan- You don't want a stupid Harry who always fails, but you don't want a Gary/Mary Sue.

Emotions- What was he feeling the first time he killed/torture someone?

Backstory- His followers need a backstory. Saying, “oh they were abused as a child” isn't going to cut it. --------------------------- But do try to avoid long titles for Harry such as Lord Slytherin-Gryffindor-Perevell, etc.

I said it once I'll say it again. NO MARY/GARY SUES PLEASE.

** Ehm, the “Dark Lord Potter” one? Sorry, cannot resist (and I personally really don't like the idea, but that's not your problem).
