My phone is usually in batterysave mode, and i have to "sync" to download updates to fics, or just download a new one to trigger it. Last 2 weeks nothing works, even without batterysaver on it just doesnt download, i have to manually enter fics for it to update that fic ONLY. Wth is going on?


** Some buggy interactions but stuff updates for me just fine. Sometimes chapters are blank and I have to download to read. Sometimes I have to restart the app before the app makes contact with my WiFi. But beyond that no issues.

*** The blank chapters usually go away if you change chapters back and forth (swipe left or right a few times).

** My only current pet peeve with the app is that it labels "Chapter 1" as the page with the summary and reviews, and then you swipe left to go "Chapter 2" which is the real Chapter 1 of the fic

Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app? Or perhaps seeing if there's a difference in the app connectivity between WiFi and cellular data?

** Is this [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]'s official app? Because the one I use, Michael Chen Tejada's Fanfiction Reader has been giving me issues with updates for a while, mainly that I have to tell a story to update, back out and delete it while it's updating to get it to do the update properly instead of just syncing the thing and having everything download and set up. I think it's saving the story metadata to include any new chapters that's the issue in the version I've got.

** Other than resetting chapter ?? of a 700K story back to the title card with no warning nor indication of where I was before resetting, it works fine for me.
