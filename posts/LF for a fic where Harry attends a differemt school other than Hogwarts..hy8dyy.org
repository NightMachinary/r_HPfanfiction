A few requirements: 100k+ or with sequels Preferably- Harry attends a different school from the start instead of transfering from Hogwarts to a different school. Complete or not abandoned


** Both of these are older fics and abandoned, but they're still good in their own ways

linkffn(3570937) was the fist that came to mind. It was fave of mind when it came out. Inspired a lot of ideas for me too with my own writings. I don't remember all the fine details, but it is one of those Mentor!Severus and Dumbledore!Bashing fics. (idr how hard it went with that, but it is an older fic) OC's too, but it has interesting world building and character developments. Also intriguing concept to the idea of Snape not joining the Death Eaters, but also not joining the Order.

linkffn(5353809) I don't remember really anything about this fic tbbh. It was so long ago that I read it, but I faved it so I liked it enough at some point. I think I liked the different take on the WBWL/BWL trope. I can remember it was pretty dark and odd in some spots, but with the premise it was trying to build it makes sense.

*edit*: noticed the word count req, /The Better Man/ is only 80k and the Twin fic is 150k\\
*edit 2*: I just re-skimmed the BWL fic, and I just realised it doesn't fit the reqs since he does start at Hogwarts then transfers. It really has been a while since I read it. Sorry about that.

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** Well, word count is reasonable for 1st and as long as the fic is good, its fine if it doesnt meet every requirement. Also, I think I mentioned 'Preferably' so its not too much of a problem. Thanks for the recommendation though, really appreciate it.

** Linkffn(The ilvemorny champion) Alive Lily, Harry has a younger sister and Ilvermorny attends the TWT instead of Durmstrang. I guess it doesn't really fit your requirements as it begins just as Harry and the rest of Ilvermorny arrive at Hogwarts. However, the story is quite good.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
