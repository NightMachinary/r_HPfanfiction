Harry uses high powered punches and kicks to kill Voldemort.


** So basically, Harry Potter as a Shonen Battle Manga.

**** You know what, that would finally make Magical Cores make SENSE. Like, Voldemort's not worried about Harry because of some bullshit prophecy, but because he's got this INSANE Magical Core and Voldemort knows that Harry's going to unlock his hidden potential or whatever. All you'd have to do is re-write each book as a "season" with who ever the foe of the book is at the end as a fight.

1. Alchemist's Stone: Students are actually ENCOURAGED to face the ultra dangerous hallway, with those who make it through being given access to training with Nicolas Flamel or the Alchemists Stone. Harry, Hermione, and Ron of course make it through, but Luna, [Love Interest], and Draco do as well. [Love Interest] is whoever you decide is best girl, for now I'll just assume it's Ginny (if I were writing this, she'd be Ron's twin and be a total Tsundere because Anime). Draco is basically Vegita/Bakugo/Rival. Ron is Krillian. Sorry Ron. Hermione is Bulma, which is cool, but means she'll probably end up with Draco. Luna is the Comic Relief, because every Anime needs one. Also she and Ron end up because of the Cosmic Law of Shipping.
2. Chamber of Secrets: This time, everyone is racing to find and then enter the Chamber of Secrets. The Diary is something that [Love Interest] intentionally steals from Draco to prove how much better she is than Harry. Draco fights, and loses gloriously to, the Basilisk. Harry unlocks the "Sword of Gryffindor" technique through anime bullshit. But that doesn't mean Ginny loves him now or something, baka. Harry can now shoot venom out of his eyes or something.
3. Prisoner of Azkaban: The five heroes, and Draco, are taken off to some remote location to train with Lupin. Instead of a pasty sad sack, Lupin is a ripped Werewolf. Someone, (probably Ron) gets to become a werewolf, because instead of being a curse being a werewolf is seriously cool (because Anime). They then have to INTENTIONALLY enter into Azkaban and rescue Sirus. There's a whole bunch of fights, the final one is against a super scary black dog. Which is of course, actually Sirius. Maybe he's trapped in a nightmare by dementors, maybe he's testing Harry. Doesn't matter. Super cool fight.
4. Goblet of Fire: TOURNAMENT ARCH. Throw out everything else. Throw in a BUNCH more characters. Krum and Fleur are just important people Harry has to fight, and so is Cedric. The final opponent though? Majin Draco, powered up and cursed by Voldemort or something. Oh, and Luna learns to be an animagus but is beaten half to death by Draco, just to show how evil he is now. He's so evil, seriously. Until Harry beats him up enough, anyway.
5. Order of the Phoenix: Harry and friends join an elite military unit named after the arc. They learn new techniques (Expeliarmus is basically the Kamehameha), Draco joins the Death Eaters and learns new techniques. They fight, Draco learns that being Evil is bad, and goes back to team Good. He's still an asshole though, and his primary goal in life is to beat up Harry.
6. Half Blood Prince: Dumbledore teaches Harry the Dangerous Forbidden Technique. Voldemort shows up (he could have been alive the whole time or something, doesn't really matter). He and Dumbledore fight. Harry gets the tar kicked out of him. Dumbledore uses the Dangerous Forbidden Technique to save Harry, at the cost of his life. Sad! Voldemort is beaten, for now.
7. Deathly Hallows: To master the Dangerous Forbidden Technique, Harry has to collect all the Deathly Hallows. Then he fights Voldemort. Oh no! Deathly Hallows get destroyed! Harry uses the Dangerous Forbidden Technique anyway. He's dead! Except he unlocks SSJ3 or whatever, comes back from the dead (due to the power of love or some other Anime Bullshit device) and proceeds to curb stop Voldemort. Everyone hooks up, happy ending, yada yada, AND THEN THE ANDROIDS SHOW UP! Or whatever. It's a shonen, they never really end.

***** Actually, we've kinda gone full circle. Power levels in Dragon Ball are about Toriyama poking fun at an existing trope, trying to say that you can't just "rank" character strength with a single number. That's why they're so meaningless/misleading in-universe, even when the 'recorded' power level is accurate.

****** "Wait, now Ron is fighting Voldemort. In his second form!'

"Yes, obviously. Your point, Draco?"

"Well either I got hit on the head harder than I thought or...."

"Or...?"

"Magical cores are bollocks!"
