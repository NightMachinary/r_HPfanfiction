** The real question is does it interest you? You are after all the one who has to write it.

If you want to write it, then write it. But don't just do it because you think people will be interested, the quality will suffer for it.

*** I am interested. It's been a very enjoyable read after somewhat forgetting about it. I mostly ask since I typically spend my time writing original fiction. This is my first foray into writing fan fiction in fact, and I'm curious if the premise appeals to the community. I will continue working on it, but if there is interest, I intend to set aside more time for it than I would otherwise.

** I would be very interested in this. Please link me if you post it! I honestly love the story of Ilvermorny and the school itself quite a bit more than Hogwarts, despite knowing a lot less about it.

** If you're in, go for it. Isolt's story has so much potential: from survival in the New World to the founding of the school. And Gormlaith Gaunt could potentially make such a good villain.

** Yes Please! I would be very interested in a novelization of Isolt Sayre's story.

I would prefer such a story to be Canon-Compliant, but of course since it is your story you should write it the way you want it.

Please provide a link if/when you post it any place.
