*** There's actually a half vampire in book six though. Eh. It fits anywhere magic fueled. Might as well throw in the Vampire Diaries while you're at it.

  AU OOC Futa Femslash Hermione Granger is destined for greatness. Since the day she was born her lineage promised her power. She was meant to fight against the darkness and was chosen by Artemis herself. As Hermione grows stronger, so does the darkness. Even with all of her power and strength, she will need allies, she will need her Soul Mates to get her through. HG/MM/FD/BL/NM/AT
