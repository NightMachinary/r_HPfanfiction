I recently finished a re-read and she wasn't mentioned once but I've seen her mentioned a lot in fics ( never as the lead though )


** According to the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Felicity_Eastchurch][wiki page.]], she was only part of the Nintendo DS game to Half-Blood Prince. And also, apparently, the PS2 game to Prisoner of Azkaban.

However, the NDS game was also released for PSP. You can see the quest in which she is featured in [[https://youtu.be/bsvyKUsBocU?list=PLyyt5io0ZuEdriY49XCbadzy-Hccr2DrV&t=593][this video]]. If you watch the whole video, you can also get names of other students and one other bully named [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Sheringham][Kim Sheringham]].

I didn't look for videos of Felicity in the PoA game. But both her and Kim are only featured in the console adaption of Prisoner of Azkaban and all games to Half-Blood Prince, which were developed by the same studio ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Bright_Light][EA Bright Light]])

So there's your answer. But now I am curious what FFs you have read in which she was featured, since I can't recall ever stumbling over her name in the fics I have read.

*** She's honestly just a passing name in the background in almost of the fics that ever acknowledge her existence
