This can be anything from the students wanting the staff to actually protect them from the ministry or the Slytherins being stopped from bullying three houses with Snape backing them up.

** Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper linkffn(13218646). The Hufflepuffs (including Harry) are a force to be reckoned with.

Warning: in the first chapter, James, Lily, and Sirius are very unpleasant people. If you want to skip it, all you really have to know is that the childless and fame-hungry Potters decided to make themselves famous with a ritual that will destroy Voldemort. Sirius helps them "acquire" a baby by killing the family of Sirius's ex-girlfriend, which they of course blame on Death Eaters. Then you can skip to chapter 2, where things do not go /quite/ as planned.

ETA: Story is in progress, but active.

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
