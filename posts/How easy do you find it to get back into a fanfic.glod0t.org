I have a tendency to stop reading fanfic once the plot dries up or pacing gets weird, etc.

With all this time on my hands, I've noticed that unless I read a fic within a day, or a couple of days for some I can't find get into the right mindset for getting back into it. This could be when I've opened up some new fics for later, spent some time on my switch or even because I've had a couple of days break.

Unfortunately, this is causing me a bit of an issue because my supply of new, well written fic that interests me is drying up!

How do you find sticking with fics? Has it changed over time or with lockdown?

*** How long I last with a fic depends on my mood and the quality of writing. Some fics I can tell I won't like from the first few paragraphs - especially if it's clash of formatting style. I usually skip ahead a bit to see if it keeps happening.

If I'm bored enough I push through and poor plot or style that doesn't suit me, I also tend to stick with for 5-10 chapters.

Sometimes I take on the task of being more open minded, but I do have some firm favourites that I seem to get into on a cycle that I've just about exhausted. I think when I'm stressed I'm less open to new fic - it's why I'm no longer read fiction books. Bad taste, my wife says!

** I say this as a writer. I understand I'm the worst person

I only read completed works. And I only read if it's interesting within the first... 5000 words?

For me personally I don't lose it through a story. I absolutely hate it when I'm reading things chapter by chapter. I forget why I care that Harry can't fly on a broom anymore. And then when something weird happens I just assume it's poor writing because I forget it was skillfully forshadowed 4 chapters ago because it was a freaking month ago!

So if the issue is it just gets bad. Fine. It's bad. It's okay for you not to like it. Harry Crow ff:8186017 is the 4th highest favorited fic of all time in the Harry Potter universe. I hate it. It's cringey and contrived and predicitible. My friend finds it satisfying. Edgey. Wish fulfilling. It just depends.

I say identify things you will always want. No matter how niche, then learn what sucks you in about those stories and move outwards from there.

Dark horse.... Hmmm.... I really really liked that one fic. I'm going to have to make a post about it. There's a really great one where Hermione is infected with Veela genetics somehow and ends up bonded to Draco. If she doesn't spend time around him she gets sick. I read it years ago but I'll get back to you if I find it.

Second dark horse I could actually find.

Brilliant magic- LJ summers - a fantastic Wesley twinsx Hermione fix that actually feels well written and human. It's super smutth but so good in between it feels natural.

Ooooh, I wanted to give Rebuilding a go, but a couple reviews mentioned Draco being v OOC which made me hesitant.

Is that the Veela story where Hermione is a different kind of Veela that doesn't come with the normal amazing looks/allure? I vaguely remember something like that... She was this second type of Veela that couldn't live without her mate from memory!

Have you read Paradox by Olivieblake? I think that's my favourite Dramione that's not, like, Isolation/Bex-Chan-popular

I'm going to look up that Brilliant Magic story! I don't mind some smut, haha. I dunno if you've ever been a fan of teenage Tom Riddle stuff, but there's a hella underrated story by Cybrid called A Dangerous Game.

******** So I dont think Draco is too OOC honestly. It's hard because you have sect of people who are deeply loyal to the books but there are some big problems when writing for HP. The first is that 1. The OG books take place with children to teenagers. I am NOT the same person I was at 17. Let alone 15. 2. Wars changes people. Drastically. Noone is coming out of that the same. Which is what the story is focused on. A BIT to heavy handed in the end but eh.

Yes. It. Freaking. Is!!!!! I did not dream it up!

Oooo hoooo hoo. New thing to read once I finish up Running on air tonight.

********* Very true. I'm glad he isn't too OOC then! I definitely understand a Draco who's matured believably, it's just those fics where it's like a completely different person with Draco's name (and not far enough in the future for enough time to rationalise a huge shift). I might give this story a go though!

No you didn't üòÜ but I also forget the name!

Yessssssss, let me know how you find Paradox! So good.

A Dangerous Game was definitely like a gateway story for me, hahaha. I was generally only mainly into reading Draco/Hermione or Harry/Hermione stuff, but I just loved the somewhat dark vibe/humour/general writing of this that I ended up liking Tom Riddle, haha. REALLY hard to find another Tom written like this though, sadly. Again, I hate when he's too soft (or too morbid) üòÇ

*** 5000 words? You're way more generous than I am.

I drop probably 70% of the stories I read in the first 500 words. I have a strict "three strikes" policy on spelling, grammar, and diction mistakes, as well as anything that sounds fanfic-y.

EDIT: Harry Crow is /objectively bad/. People are allowed to like bad shit, I guess, but it's still hot fucking garbage and if someone says it's a great story you know you can basically ignore their opinion on anything.

  Harry Crow is /objectively bad/
#+end_quote

If I can ask, what make you decide that a fic is good or bad?

Because, while it's been years since I tried to read "Harry Crow", from what I remember, the writing was pretty good.\\
I mean, I hated the plot, which was full of tropes I hate (from "Perfect Hermione" to "Manipulative Dumbledore" with some "Harry can decide the fate of a country at 11"), and I found the whole "Kids talk like Victorian adults" very cringy.

But while I found the substance of the fic terrible, the firm seemed of pretty good quality. Granted, English is not my first language so I may have missed mistakes, but I don't remember any major error with the Grammar, the Spelling or the Diction. In fact, outside of maybe some Purple Prose (and I'm not even sure about that), the writing, or the form seemed done skillfully. The author did a good job when pulling the reader into his world (or rather his vision of Rowling's world), I just happened to hate it.

So, while I would never recommand Harry Crow to anyone (or any RobSt story since they all seemed to have the same tropes/ cliches of "Perfect Harmony"), I'm not sure I would call them "Objectively Bad". All the parts we can /objectively/ judge, and even if I hate the plot, my tastes are subjectives and the fact that some people love this fic show that it has its public, so is it really bad?

*** Sometimes I prefer unfinished fics if they finish on a high, rather than taking the risk that the story will peter out. I used to have far better memory for the storylines when waiting for updates, though - pretty much the same as you.

The issue I was posting about was more... I'm halfway through an interesting chapter, but now I have to make dinner, entertain the other half since we're staying inside for a long while yet. Etc, etc. When I come back to the fic, my brain just goes 'eh'.

I also can't get behind Harry Crow. There's definitely something out there for everyone.

I'll take onboard your advice for those fics that do keep me going, though. Especially compared to ones I get bored of while reading with no gap.

** It isn't a question of quality for me, but of how unique a fic is. There are a lot of fics I remember enjoying and I see getting a lot of praise on here that I could never continue reading because despite all the praise, it was just one of the hundred fics following Harry during his Hogwarts year I read. I can't easily differentiate between them so I don't bother continuing.

But I still vividly remember an SI fic where the main charachter was a seer that I read a few years ago, or that fic where AU Potters end up in the canon world after the war, or that fic where Field Operative Unspeakable Harry accidentally went back in time. I ca easily jump back in a uncompleted unique fic, even if it isn't that good.

It takes a lot to get my to put something I'm reading down, it would have to be something morally reprehensible or a /truly/ never ending story. There was this one fic that was like 400,000 words, and I read half of it and I /despised/ the story from about 10,000 words. It lacked any plot, and was basically 400,000 words of the pairing going on dates in Hogsmeade. At one point there was a magic carpet ride and I had to stop and question whether I was reading an Aladdin crossover.

If it's an ongoing fic and hasn't grabbed my attention by the last update, I'm unlikely to return.

** You think it's bad when it's just that something dried up? Imagine when you loved the story, but something in it came out of left field and freaked you out, and then you learned that the problem was only temporary and wanted to go back to it, but dreaded rereading that one part!

I freaked when I was reading HPMOR and reached spring break (if you've read it, you should be able to guess why, if you haven't, I won't spoil more than absolutely necessary) and then spent a few years randomly shuddering and agonizing until finally the last chapter was released; I then peeked to confirm that the particular plot point ultimately got reversed... and I haven't managed to get even to Azkaban in a reread since then (I've tried at least 3 times). Urgh I need to figure out how to force myself to reread it...

I'm also facing similar with the reread I started a while ago of the Young Wizards series by Diane Duane (an actual book series, not a fanfic). All I'll say is that she's a glorious bastard who Kali-ma's your heart out, plops it in a blender set to frappe, and leaves you begging for more, but then when you go to reread, the anticipation of what you know is going to happen is viscerally painful. Somehow I've reached the 4th book, where everything slows drastically (seriously that entire book comes outta left field, nothing like the first 3, and seems more like a buffer for 5 or intro of chars to be used later than anything else; still fun, but damn it she's just stretching out my dread of later books).

** I can't follow things week-to-week because my memory is so bad and I go through stories so fast. Honestly, I read something last week, left a highly positive review which I hardly ever do so I must have loved it, and then I look at the new chapter today and I have no idea what was happening.

My general process is to wait a few years, check back and reread the whole thing up to the newest chapter, and repeat. But I'm also relatively new to the fandom, been reading/writing for less than five years, so I've a lot of awesome still untouched. I imagine it'll be very different for anyone who's been around the block a few times.

** If I find it hard continuing a fic I would usully leave it and start or cobtinue with other fics in my list. Then later when I am in a mood for a different fic than the one I aam currently reading I might go back to one of my old ones. Of course usually I just start reading a new one and so now I have hundreds of fics that I have either barely started, half way through or a few chapters from finishing and I just did not have the will to finish completely (either too emotionally draining, or it was a fic that I only read because of the interesting idea).
