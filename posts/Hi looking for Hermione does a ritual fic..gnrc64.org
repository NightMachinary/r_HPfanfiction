:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The one I'm looking for specifically is, Hermione decodes an ancient ritual none has been able to recreate using the periodic table. It opens up a portal to a different dimension. She gets to wear silver bracelets and summon creatures from that dimension and also uses it to heal Dumbledore's arm. This is what I remember. Please help, I thought this concept was really interesting.


** Is it linkffn(A Champion's New Hope)?

Edit: if that's not how you call the bot, a Champion's New Hope by rocag

  Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

** Oh, I remember reading something like this. Hermione basically became the guardian of the portal between two worlds, in exchange for a "favor" that she could cash later. Dang, can't remember which fic it was, though.

**** Yeah, after skimming over some pages, I'm convinced that it's A Champion's New Hope, as someone else said before. Hermione basically becomes the "Gate Keeper", and has to serve as such for a thousand years in exchange for the assistance of the purple woman. The hand healing scene takes place in chapter 46.
