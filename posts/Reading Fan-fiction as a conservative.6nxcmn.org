  I never really expected to see real-life politics bleeding into stories about a fictional world with fiction characters and magical beings, unfortunately however, it does.
#+end_quote

Actually, there's a good deal of political commentary in the original series. If Rowling had intended for the series to be apolitical, the Ministry of Magic wouldn't have been mentioned as extensively as it was. If fic writers are getting political, with a leftist view of politics in particular, it's only because they're following JKR's lead.

(/HP/ is still a fairly centrist fantasy series compared to, say, /His Dark Materials/. But it's certainly to the left of /Narnia/ or /LotR/.)

** I'm struggling to see what the passage about 'conservative goblins' being disapproving of a female goblin working at Gringotts (I think? Pretty short on context from your link) has to do with your point. In fact, using it to justify your point has somewhat undermined it, makes me feel like you're a bit sensitive and ready to find fault with the simple usage of the word 'conservative', regardless of context.

Conservative goblin society, in the writer's view, may view employment at Gringotts as unbefitting a female. Conservative seems to be acting as a descriptor for being based in traditional moral values of a society. We don't see any female goblins working at Gringotts in the books, so it doesn't seem strange to me that a fan fiction author would see this as a facet of traditional goblin society, and a female goblin in the workplace would be looked down upon by more traditionally minded, conservative value holding goblins. It's conservative because it's based in tradition, not because it's 'bad'.

I feel a bit as though you view 'conservative' and 'liberal' as words with very specific connotations, when in fact they do describe certain characteristics apart from their strictly political (and currently quite emotionally fraught) usage. A conservative estimate. A liberal pour. You seem to be assuming that the use of 'conservative' must necessarily come paired with some kind of judgment. Sometimes it's just a descriptor.

**** Well, the traditional wizarding society IS bigoted. It's the whole point - that pure blood preferences are held by many in wizarding society, and tolerated by many more. It's codified in the Ministry's treatment of centaurs, house elves, werewolves and other magical non-human beings/creatures.

Their traditional values are bigoted and discriminatory and Death Eaters are trying to hold them up. So yeah, people are going to call Death Eaters conservative because they're trying to uphold traditional wizarding values. Those values are just fucked.

He uses conservative as interchangeable with Republican. Today's political climate may make it seem so but they're not the same thing.

A Democrat can be a conservative and a Republican can be a progressive.

In my experience the conservatives on either side of that spectrum hold the majority of the sexists, homophobes and racists but it isnt an exclusively conservative thing.

We had the Democrats, and as far as most Americans knew, that was what the Left looked like. But they're pretty darn conservative compared to, say, Scandinavia.

Unfortunately, while I think we're starting to get a more European-style Left, I think we're also starting to get a more European-style Right. It used to be that I simply disagreed with people on the other side, but I had kind of an "oh-well-that's-just-life" attitude about it. Now, however, there's people on the other side I'm actually /afraid/ of - like Steve Bannon. /There's/ a real-life Death Eater (or at least a sympathizer) if ever I saw one.

******** Well, I don't want to get too far off topic here (even though we've taken a bit of a digression already), since this subreddit is themed around fanfiction first and foremost. However, to summarize:

- Breitbart News, the website he edits and was a co-founder of, frequently posts material that is xenophobic or otherwise racist (including anti-Semitic) in tone. While he hasn't outright advocated for violence against non-white people (as far as I know), some of the items he publishes have led to him earning the support of the white supremacist crowd (Richard Spencer et al.), and a status among them as an intellectual (or, some might say, pseudo-intellectual) influence.

- He has a very negative attitude toward immigration - and not just the "illegal" kind. He has this apocalyptic view that immigrants (especially non-white ones) will bring about the end of Western civilization by bringing different ideas from different cultures and somehow "ruining" what's already here. I know a lot of old-school conservatives from the Reagan era like using the metaphor of America as the "shining city on a hill" where people can come to escape oppression. Where Bannon differs is that he wants the people already /in/ America to not let other people inside that city.

- And finally, in case you think this is only something that leftists would get concerned about, there's people on the Right who want to keep him from having too much political influence, too. Glenn Beck went so far as to compare him to Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of Propaganda. Given that you started this thread off by wanting to dispel the idea that conservatism = racism, I'm assuming you might like to join the anti-Bannon wing as well.

My apologies for not being more specific or including citations, but I did want to keep this concise. You could probably find a more detailed response on the [[/r/politics]] subreddit; I'm sure he's been discussed there. And for the record, I think this thread brought up some good points about fanfics, so thank you for posting it.

****** It's really a shame that US political language has been so extremely poluted and made borderline useless. Saying "I'm a left leaning liberal" in US jargon means just "I'm a lefty from the left". Instead they kinda invented another word (libertarian), but which also now has additional connotations that I as a (classical) liberal wouldn't agree with.

I'm not surprised that political discourse has degenerated so much in the US since the underlying language doesn't even allow for subtle connotations but is all about bipartisanship (are you with /them/ or with /us/?).

I also don't believe you can truly equate US parties such as the Republican and Democrats to the UK (and AUS) Liberals and Labor. Sure there are similarities but they just aren't the same.

** Simple points:

To be fair, its silly to use terms like conservative and liberal anymore anyway. Its too general a term within politics when there are so many shades of each, and the variance from one side of the shades to the other is so extreme. These days its more of a media click bait term than anything aimed at stupid people.

There are a whole lot of really stupid people out there who vote based upon a party tag and word definition rather than what the person wearing that tag represents personally (THEIR views and goals) and who they are as a human being. And the DNC and RNC only make it worse as they are more about money and power than actually representing what their supporters want.

Now, that aside, I think the OP is reading too much into the politics within fan fiction itself. Are there writers who weave real life political leanings into their work? Probably. But its still fan fiction, and in the Harry Potter universe its not even American politics most of the time. I also think that the poll is highly unscientific when it comes to readership base. Its a reddit poll for shits sake, and one with a TINY response amount. Its hardly representative of much of anything.

** I've been tossing around an idea about what Harry would want to change in a near-canon post-war story. Much of the concern he might have is in the treatment of his friends, so we assume he would be supportive of creature rights. Yet, it's difficult sometimes to fairly represent the contrary opinion without making some sort of straw man argument.

For the major issues of this unrealistic world, where do you see the breakpoints? Many folks from the US are used to a binary system where you accept the bulk of a set of policies if you strongly agree with a few of them, but in other nations,notably the UK, different factions tend to collect supporters on particular issues. What would be the polarizing but reasonable arguments, and over which issues?

Best I can come up with:\\
* goblins want wands\\
* some werewolves want jobs and access to wolvesbane potions\\
* Hags and vampires need access to their food supply

After that, we have to conjecture wildly about the more subtle and less obvious issues, like\\
* how much interference with muggles is too much or too little?\\
* is there a filter on access to the best jobs, based on family connections, or bribery, or on merit?\\
* with power to solve most of the day-to-day needs, what do most non-scholarly wizards and witches do with their talents? Is that satisfying?

Where does the conservative view land on these issues?

** The Pureblood's agenda is fairly traditional/conservative in their society, or that is how it is portrayed.

More over I think you are over inflating the definition of conservative to aggregate yourself into it as well, it would be better to use a term such as ultra conservative to assign to them. However no one really says something like this. Even in US politics, despite being a de facto 2 party system, you have a lot of conservative parties beyond just the Republicans. Basically this is like saying the Westboro Baptist Church is a conservative Christian church. It's true, but it really isn't indicative of the standard conservative ideology.

Mrs. Longbottom is typically portrayed as conservative in most fics where she has a role at all, and she is clearly against Voldemort and the DEs. Also if you're reading fics that have heavy politics and goblins take a major role, its probably terrible anyway.

There really is only one female Deatheater in the aforementioned Bellatrix, who probably was the most dangerous of the whole bunch and even she was more or less used as brood mare for Voldo´s hellspawn, because I don´t believe that he ever had something close to affection for her, though we don´t have many details. The blood purists very much are a boy´s club. In comparison the light side has women as equals in many different roles. It was never spoken out loud in the books, but the hints are very much there. About it making sense is another story, but how many traditional viewpoints make no sense and we still follow them, the blood purism doesn´t make sense either, if Voldemort had won, they would die of incest, heck JKR herself said that muggleborn tend to be slightly stronger because, incest already took their toll on the most fanatic families.

- Both parties ended up on the wrong side of civil rights. (Most famously Strom Thurmond in the US, but remember Thatcher's Tories labelled the ANC terrorists.)

- The right believes the left to be dumb or naive, the left believes the right to be evil.

- Restrictions on dark magic could be considered 'nanny state' policy of the left.

- Voldemort would be analogous to radical Conservatives in the US (Tea Party or Libertarians)

To be sure, the comparison isn't perfect. (It's not the radical right that has a history of terrorising Britain.) But I don't at all mind fics playing up the comparison (without getting explicitly political), just to inject a bit of realpolitick into things.

This is extremely true, to the point where I never understood where the silly connotation that racism and conservatism have anything to do with each other comes from. Just a week ago, a prominent democrat, Shia Lebouf told a black police officer some racist remarks, if that's not a perfect example of how much Democrats and Social Liberals project, I don't know what is.

I see this a lot especially in this community. Many writers with no nuance and no objectivety come through the wood works with Social Justice and create these imperfect worlds that SJW!Hermione is going to fix. How? Why talking of course! Why has no one ever thought of that? OMG SO SMART/s

We also have to remember that the ministry of Magic is a perfect example of an Authoritarian Leftist government that borderlines on communism socially and capitalism economically. Rowling was clearly trying to send a message with the whole House-Elf Rights thing, but she shot herself in the foot when she showed that Hermione got to her conclusions with no real evidence. It's almost as if she was accidentally telling the truth, which is coincidentally something she doesn't believe in.

Yet affirmative action, something that creates a disadvantage between White and Asian children to the rest of their contemporaries simply based on race, was a Liberal run platform.

There's also the fact that communism, an authoritarian leftist ideology, decided that a single class of people would be discriminated against for the simple reason that they're the ones that profit in Capitalist societies. I would rather more authors be libertarian than either conservative or leftist, as slanting to any side is just cheap writing and pandering. Like all the Pureblood law bs that attempts to make Purebloods seem like Fascists when in reality a person who's good at writing would make there be a social conflict where you could see the argument from both sides.

The alternative is to work on your own and build your own life. You either succeed or you don't, not placed on the backs of tax payers.

  The KKK was started by southern racists. The South fought for slavery, which pretty much condemns them as evil. Only the liars from the "Lost Cause" try to claim that the ACW wasn't about slavery but "states rigths" - with lies and misdirection.

Yes, it was clearly about slavery. But at the time slaves were property, America was set on many rules and one of those being small government and when the government overreaches their hand and takes their private property, they get pissed. It was most definitely about states rights and American rights. I'm not saying it was good, but would you rather society be built on your own people like Britain, with a monarchy and no sense of direction? The KKK may have been started by southern racists, but those southern racists weren't conservative, I can tell you that.

*********** The KKK were trying to preserve white supremacy and "teach blacks their place". That's pretty conservative.

If "Small Government" and "states right" means that basic human rights are violated, as the idea that humans are property clearly does, then those two things are obviously not working.

I'd rather not live in a society where people are dying on the streets. If your society has people dying on the streets, it's not working, period.

You haven't provided any evidence how that is so, and seeing as how there are plenty of democratic and liberal racists, I think you don't know what you're talking about and just generalising a whole group of people (hint: that's what racists do).

They weren't human at the time, they were slaves. That's the thing.

Opposing change and progressive policies is conservative.

If you actually think that slaves were not human, then you are even worse than slavers.

************** *Ku Klux Klan*

The Ku Klux Klan , commonly called the KKK or simply the Klan, is the name of three distinct movements in the United States that have advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white supremacy, white nationalism, anti-immigration and---especially in later iterations---Nordicism, anti-Catholicism and antisemitism. Historically, the KKK used terrorism---both physical assault and murder---against groups or individuals whom they opposed. All three movements have called for the "purification" of American society and all are considered right-wing extremist organizations.

The first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s.

************** Firstly, KKK isn't solely Conservative, it was started by Democrats to run opposition to the civil rights movement.

Secondly, opposing to change or 'progressive policies' can be any side of the political spectrum. Especially since what's 'progressive' is not entirely the same to what other's view as progressive.
