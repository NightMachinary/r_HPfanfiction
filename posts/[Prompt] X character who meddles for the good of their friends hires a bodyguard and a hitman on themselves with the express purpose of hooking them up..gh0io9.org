As seen [[https://i.imgur.com/DshcJVv.jpg][here]]. It's up to you to determine the best character combinations or how serious you take it - you could probably get some pretty good crack and serious romance in equal measure. Bonus points for well written fights.


** Well, we already have Voldemort trying to kill Harry, so someone could write Harry hiring a bodyguard and that bodyguard falling for Voldemort. I vote Dumbledore.
