*** Perhaps this was during the time of the attacks. Like someone accidentally set off a seriously bad chain reaction, but it hit right in the middle of the basilisk being set loose. Suddenly causing people to be petrified anywhere it tried to go until it had to give up and go back underground.

** But if the basilisk's gaze is weakened due to being reflected by a mirror, wouldn't it grow progressively weaker as it was reflected through more and more mirrors?

****** But what would being half petrified or a quarter petrified actually mean? Are only their limbs petrified or they suddenly become paralysed from the leg down or something? Maybe their brain is petrified and they act like victims of the dementor's kiss? If it's the last one, then definitely being partially petrified is much worse than being wholly paralysed.

***** Eh. Mirrors green-shift when data is lost because it's really hard (and usually not worth the effort) to create perfect mirrors.

I imagine magic would create perfect mirrors which, theoretically, would mean no data is lost.
