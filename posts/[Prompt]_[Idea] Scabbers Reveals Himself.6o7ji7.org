Due to the sad fact that very few writers like to write Ron, this story probably doesn't exist, but I have had an idea for a premise: without revealing himself to the wider world, Pettigrew lets Ron in on his ability to take human form (though he probably doesn't give his real name), becoming a sort of secret friend for him at Hogwarts, resurrecting the old ways of the Marauders by pulling pranks on his behalf. Pettigrew redemptions in general are rare, and I think this could really work very well. Unfortunately, I don't feel up to writing it myself --- even barring the fact that I have two stories going already, I'm not very good at writing normal-sounding kids.


** I'm really not a talented writer, but I love this idea and I'd love to try and develop into a story.

** Would this include Peter being innocent of wilfully betraying the Potters/spying against the Order/killing 12 muggles as well, ala my earlier idea, do you think?

...Although it'd also be funny to have "What? Yes, I did, but that was a long time ago. I'm retired now. Screw Voldy."

*** I think it's much more interesting to either have an actually self-centred opportunist/evil, or genuinely /weak/ Peter. Yes, betrayal isn't noble, but it's /human/. Voldemort is in some ways wizarding Hitler. If the actual Hitler with a cadre of SS came to your door and said "spy for me, or I'll torture you until you are dead", would you be a hero or a betrayer? I know what I'd /hope/ to be, but...

**** Fair enough. Voldemort himself points out that Peter's only serving him in Goblet of Fire and later books because he doesn't have anywhere else to go.

Kind of twisted, when you think about it. At the end of book 3, Peter's options were basically:

a) die,

b) go to Azkaban/get kissed by a Dementor,

c) find somewhere abroad to live under a cover identity,

or d) go find and work for Voldemort.

...And depending on whether or not Peter has any marketable muggle skills, and depending on how obsessed wizards in other countries are with pure blood and identity checks, c) might not be viable.

It was probably sheer luck for Peter that the Weasleys would adopt a mangy rat found in their garden in the first place. Although I suppose he could just confound some Muggles into keeping him as a pet.

Do you think that Peter would have fled at the end of Book 3 if the wizarding prison he was sure to be sent to was nicer? As in, not Azkaban with the cold and the depressing and the dementors?

Definitely. Being locked in a non-Dementor-infested, sturdy wizarding prison is a billion times safer than being on the run with Voldemort. And if Voldemort comes back anyway and comes after you, you can just say you couldn't escape.

*** I agree with wonderworkingwords: I think Pettigrew did all this but that doesn't make him unredeemably /evil/. He never wanted to betray them, never agreed with Voldemort's ideals, but he was just /weak/ and cowardly. Hence the spying. The killing of the 12 muggles was likely unintentional, too --- he tried to cause an explosion to fake his death but miscalculated the scope.
