** It would really help to lift him up as a believable threat, if he could acctually channel the killing curse through the wand, casting it despite the wand being fake. Overpowering the mechanism in an a moment, turning the punchline of a joke into a gutpunching moment with consequences. Most fanfics usually fail to set up Voldy as a real threat, and this might do it.

*** I really can't see that, after all these trick wands probably aren't much like actual wands and if Voldemort could work such incredibly powerful magic wandlessly then the whole brother wands thing wouldn't matter.

I also just really don't like it when wandless magic is that strong, there should be a good reason people use wands beyond being a bit easier

**** I can see why it wouldn't work In a setting with low power wandless magic.

However, one possible way for it to work, for example, those fake wands being the equivalent of really really terrible 1 shot wands (Like in the arithmancer) usually it's supposed to channel 1 spell, then it burns out, however voldy overpowers the "wand" and manages an actual AK instead of a fake one (With the wand subsequently dying, potentially explosively).

Adressing One way to explain the popularity of wands is that it acts less as enabler, and more as something to make magic more efficent, and quicker, and the specific wand giving a boost to a certain type of spells (ie: James wand is good for transfiguration, Lily's for charms work) which is backed up at least a bit by canon, and is often ignored by fanfics, barring ones that change his wand to fit the type of spell he's going to manipulate to the extremes later in the story.

Let's say voldy's wand is extremely good for curses and compulsions, while he might be able to magicly convince animals and those with abysmal levels of mental fortitude to his servitude long term with a fair bit of effort wandlessly, provided he has about 20 or 30 minutes set aside in his schedule. With a nobody's wand, he could do the same to joe average in about 10-15 perhaps for the same amount of effort, with his wand, he could do it in 5 with about the same amount of energy, with the compulsion working for substantially longer, with the elder wand, he could break down the sheilds of all but the strongest of wills, like physical refusing to die due to stubbornness levels of willpower.

** Taking this as a launching point - I would love to read a post-GoF where Forge learns about the graveyard scene, and they decide to investigate brother wands. Maybe they had 2nd hand wands, and with Triwizard money they decided to try pairs of Ollivander wands until they got a best-match.

Arming Harry with home-grown wand lore would be a really cool way to even the playing field, even though we already know that Voldemort is doing what he can to uneven it by getting the Elder wand.
