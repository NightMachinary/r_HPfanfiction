:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while ago but forgot to bookmark. In the story Harry dies and finds himself becoming an agent of death. He is taught how he never was himself or free and always a chess piece. He is trained by death and Ignotus to become better after which he is sent back to the time his parents died. Despite his crying and other attempts Sirius still ends up giving him to Hagrid and ends up at the Dursley's again. I don't know what he did or had done to him but at age 5 or 7 he uses ageing and polyjuice potions to age himself for taking an inheritance ritual at gringotts where he finds the Peverell office in shambles which is a way for the goblins to insult him but he decides to change the clan which operates his accounts on Peverell to a rival clan and takes up the headship to cause chaos in the British ministry.i believe after that he tries to create some potions using hand of God and a few other things while also going around buying property and doing investment in the mundane side. I think the final chapters involved him making an alliance with house black by saving arcturus black from being poisoned off by Malfoy using his imperioused house black house elf.

Thanks to user Starlightsunsets we found it although it seems to have been a dropped fic.

** The story doesn't sound remotely familiar. Looked for Ignotus Peverell, Harry Potter, and Arcturus Black on AO3 didn't net any similar results, and random googling of FFN for Ignotus Peverell, specifically Harry trained by him netted nothing but what seems like a Ignotus reincarnation fic and what seemed like a Darkest Arts wank fic. Let me know if you find it though, since it does seem somewhat interesting.

on a side note, try to see if you can remember what trope you were reading during the time you stumbled upon this fic. I've found that to help me when I try to look for a fic but cannot remember much about it either. Takes some luck but it shows some success in helping re-find fics :)

so far what i found that has both ignotus and death (in the form of Thanatos tho) has no form of training given to harry...just sends him back in time to when he lives with the Dursleys :/

i+m praying so hard that the fic u mentioned has not been deleted in reality fam cuz it sounds too interesting to be deleted :(+

on a bright side, i've stumbled upon many interesting hp fics that have death in them due to searching for this fic so thanks by the way for that ahahahaha :)

******* holy macaronis fam

the " Kronos willing to send Harry back because of how he destroyed the time turners" you mentioned, is that part of this fic you are searching for?? because I found a fic with that. Ignotus is also involved but im confused with the whole training aspect that u mentioned (but then again i skimmed thru the fic so i may have missed that bit...)

And in this fic there is Harry being sent back to when his parent are killed and there is the whole crying for Sirius part but Sirius still leaves him bit. The goblins bt with the insult is also there, with the threat Harry gives to shift his banking to the dwarfs (who are the goblins' rivals acc to this fic)

I've skimmed thru the last few chapters and Arcturus Black is also involved but i honestly wasn't following the plot...

You know what imma just leave the link of that fic below. If it turns out to be what you are searching for, hurrah! If not, well, oops, got to simply go back to searching more ahahaha
