  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

******** I couldn't get through this story, so I never saw it. Did some looking and found this:

*Chapter 53:*

#+begin_quote
  It seems I failed to anticipate one possible reaction to the previous chapter, and the reaction is sufficiently stupid and common that I feel the need to address it here.

  Harry is now 'suddenly racist' apparently.

  Have you dumb twats even been paying attention? Like, at all? He has never been a shining example of tolerance, to put it mildly. Literally the only thing that's happened is that you got to see his unfiltered thoughts for the first time instead of catching glimpses through actions and conversation.

  Next up, he doesn't give a shit about race and never has, it's intelligence and reasoning ability that he judges by. You can wail about it all you want, but places like Africa and the Middle East are not exactly beacons of enlightenment these days. The backstories don't matter. Even if we humor the delusions some of you have and say that it's all the fault of the evil Europeans and USA and that those places would be utopias otherwise, Harry just doesn't care. He would sneer at a slave for not casting off their own chains or die trying.

  Furthermore, you may recall that he's taken 'the only good is knowledge, the only evil is ignorance' as his personal creed. Do you daft cunts think he only said that because it sounds cool? As far as he is concerned, all religions are inherently and irredeemably evil because they peddle not just ignorance, but also false knowledge. He has no respect for religious people whatsoever and I don't mean the kind of lack of respect you or I would feel for a person we don't like. I mean the type of lack of respect one feels for a fly buzzing in your face just before you squash it.

  By Slaanesh's dribbling futa-cock, I can't believe this actually has to be pointed out to you congealed wankstains, fifty-fucking-two chapters into the story no less.

  Yes, I obviously hold some variation of these beliefs myself. Congratulations, you've discovered the concept of author bias. What an earth-shattering revelation. The very fabric of reality echoes with shock at the thought of an author whose writing is influenced by his personal opinions, especially on a hobby website.

  That being said, you have never received a 100% accurate representation of my own views through my writing. All you got was characters that I find amusing to write. You wouldn't expect a Muslim to write about his vaunted prophet eating ass on a street corner for shekels, would you? Why would you expect me to write a protagonist that likes or tolerates things I hold in contempt? If I tried that, Harry would have died in his first year. That was the entire fucking point of altering his backstory at an early stage of development -- so that I could fuck him up however I pleased, because the original is goddamn annoying.

  Finally, do remember that this is a piece of fiction based on another piece of fiction and that you can chill the fuck out anytime now. It really has nothing to do with you or the sad state of real life.

  I could say that I hope that this will at the very least make you briefly think before you start REEEE-ing all over your keyboard, but in my heart I know that you're nothing more than emotionally-driven animals and that the hostile tone of this AN was enough to classify me as an enemy in your minds -- and therefore wrong about everything by default. The sky is green, by the way.

  So I suppose that my final word on this is that you should go fuck yourselves, because I'm not writing for you, I'm writing for me.

  And yes this was kind of petty, thank you for noticing. I was overdue for one of these pointless rants and just about blew my load when I was presented with such magnificent stupidity.

  GUEST REVIEW SECTION

  Curious -- because that would be a lot of work and I'm lazy.

  B. Netanyahu -- hate to break it to you, but Harry only despises Jews less than Muslims because they don't make as much noise.

  And as always, much appreciation goes to Joe Lawyer for his help in polishing these things up. The story wouldn't be as good without him.

  A little credit also goes towards my friend Milennial for providing some advice on the Czech Republic and the city of Ostrava.
#+end_quote

And then there's a followup on

*Chapter 54:*

#+begin_quote
  AmusedGuest -- You clearly have a reading deficiency so I'll deign to repeat myself. The rant wasn't for the people that didn't like what I wrote. It was for the people that were so damn shocked at Harry's beliefs at this point in the story. They came up several times already and weren't subtle. Only an idiot could miss them.

  Go ahead, report me. Be the whiny little cupcake that you know you are. You call me a simpering child, yet here you are, making silly threats instead of doing the mature thing and just leaving for sections of the internet that make you less uncomfortable. Try Tumblr.

  I won't say anything about your use of a guest account since there exists an off chance that you are that one guy I actually blocked. If you are...well, sorry, but you were wearing out my patience with your willful blindness to what kind of absolute cunts Muslims in Europe have been these past few years and I didn't want to put up with you anymore. There's a hint for you in there if you're smart enough to notice it.

  Echo chamber? Right, it's an echo chamber if people agree with me. What is it when people agree with you then? Common sense? A confluence of opinion? It's the same situation, but even if it's an echo chamber in my case surely it couldn't be in yours as well because that would undermine your condescending sense of moral superiority.

  Fanfiction is all about wish fulfillment in case you hadn't noticed. All of us fanfiction authors wish to change the original story for one reason or another. Most readers of fanfiction come to this site not for super high quality and original writing, but because we wish to see different, often power fantasy-esque, takes on the same core story. What a blow you just dealt us by pointing this out. I'm not sure any of us will ever recover.

  I'm fine with the reviews bitching about shit they should know damn well I'm not going to change or stop doing. I feast on the outrage. Outright stupidity though? That's precious enough to deserve a response, such as this one.

  I'm a hypocrite for liking characters not restrained by morals or societal norms and thus /GASP/ choosing to write them that way? If you say so, but I'm pretty sure that's not what being a hypocrite means. Strange that you would make this mistake since you seem to have a firm grasp of the concept if that echo chamber comment is any indication.

  I curse left and right because profanity amuses me and I find it to be an excellent medium to convey my thoughts through.

  Bitch.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
