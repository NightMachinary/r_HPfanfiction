#+begin_quote
  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry Potter dislikes Severus Snape. Severus Snape loathes Harry Potter. No one is more shocked than the Hogwarts Potion Master when Harry takes a potentially fatal spell to save the Death Eater turned Phoenix spy. Harry's sole hope of survival lies with Severus Snape, Hermione Granger, and, of all people, Neville Longbottom.

**** Almost everyone would. This is a problem in the community that everyone thinks that if they could learn magic they'd all be Dumbledores because they'd do nothing but study. Except in reality magic would become mundane in time and it'd just be like everything else we procrastinate with. Except that it would allow us to be even more lazy.

***** Even if we could all ride brooms, I think most people would still prefer cars - you can carry more stuff, it's more comfortable (less wind/rain/cold) and it's less dangerous. The HP universe looks cool from a distance, but up close it often looks oversold. I guess the disconnect between 'awesome magic, cool world' and 'struggles and difficulties' is what makes it so great for writing fanfiction for.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
