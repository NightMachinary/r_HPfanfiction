#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] likes writing mentor!Dumbledore who was not afraid to get his hands dirty.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), Dumbledore first waited until Ginny (the last of the next generation) graduated from Beauxbaton before commencing his final plan to defeat both Lucius Malfoy and Voldemort. He also trained Harry throughout the years and accompanied him on horcrux hunt. [[/spoiler][Then he used Hermione's inside track to assassinate the Malfoys and took control of magical Britain, and eventually launched a combined force to destroy Voldemort.]]

In "Patron", linkffn(11080542), Dumbledore mentored Hermione more, and [[/spoiler][they developed a very dark ritual to destroy Voldemort and ALL Death Eaters exploiting a vulnerability in the Dark Mark]].

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
