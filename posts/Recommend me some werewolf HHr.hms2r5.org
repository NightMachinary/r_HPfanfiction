Either, or both of them should be one, and the pairing is Harry x Hermione. For mods, sorry, I canÂ´t find seeking recommendations flair. Hopefully you guys can change this flair to the appropriate one.


** Flair comment:\\
The correct Flair for this would be "REQUEST".

Request is where you ask others to offer up any stories they know that fit your topic/criteria.

Recommendation is for after you finish an awesome story and you want to recommend it to others to enjoy.

  "I do wonder how the magicals of Britain will react when they discover that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is now the 'Wolf-That-Loves'." Hermione and Harry become werewolves with some surprising results. So surprising, in fact, that their world turns on its head. Takes place sixth year. Harry/Hermione, AU. I find this story hard to give a summary for...
