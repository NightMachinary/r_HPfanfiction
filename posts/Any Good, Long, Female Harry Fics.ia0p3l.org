I'm bored outta my mind and I'm yearning for some good, long, Femharry fics. Does anyone have any suggestions?


** Story: Victoria Potter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828]]

Excellently written, great characterisation, and relatively good update rate. Probably the best in fanfiction.

** This is the first in a three story series that focuses on female Harry and in my opinion is absolutely fantastic. It is very lesbian and has mature content so be warned before going in. It dives into interesting magic, is very feminist, and does one of my favorite takes on a female Harry so I cannot recommend this enough.

** Linkffn(effects and side effects) it's pretty good. Has some,imo, weird uses of magic but all in all a good read. Still waiting for it to be finished though.

*** From a quick read of the first chapter, writing is pretty bad, dialogue is wooden, characterization is all over the place. I would not recommend.

**** Yeah, I've seen this recommended a bunch and I keep trying it cause why would it be recommended do much if it's terrible but I can never get past the first couple chapters. Someone who's read it does it get a lot better later on cause I'm really lost.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (deviation from canon is exponential, but slow to start). See first chapter for preface discussion of background/differences from canon. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. PM for pdf.

** I posted this yesterday for a long fic recommendation!

A good long read that I enjoy is linkao3(536450) at 550k. Has a sequel in progress. It's written by someone formally trained in writing, and it shows. Quality of prose is incredible. Just as a note, the main ‘pairing' doesn't happen in this fic or even the sequel yet, it's tagged for future purposes but the fics been going since 2012 and it hasn't happened so far, so it's pretty much genfic. (Fem!harry/Snape. )

The opening paragraph is what hooked me and pretty much sets the standard of prose and heavy imagery for the whole series:

“Summer lay thick across Hogwarts, the sunlight like butter. Hagrid was reporting a record number of bowtruckle births; Sprout had gone to holiday in Egypt; Minerva was up to her whiskers in preparations for the upcoming term. Dumbledore spent the time being inscrutable and mysterious, but that was so typical of him it was hardly worth remarking.”

I love it. It focuses on genuine friendships between Harriet and others, and also very convincingly follows her growing up, including the psychological development of teenagers, like learning to manage anger, emotions, connecting with others, opening up to others and encouraging others to do the same. No bashing. Nobody is OP. Nobody is OOC. As an aside, I often don't like Lupin/Sirius Black fics because it's over the top but this fic presented it in a really age sensitive and background sort of way that I appreciated. Thoughtful, wholesome, carefully thought out and idk, rich characters written in genuinely convincing ways. I hope you like it. I sure did.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)

*** That's a good series to recommend, but needs more detail :). The summary is correct but doesn't really sell it; it sounds like something ordinary and straightforward, just retelling canon with a girl in the boys' dorm, when actually it's clever and complex and goes far off the rails. It felt like the more I read, the more layers of the story unfolded. New and creative dangers to face each year, with much higher stakes than canon (the gauntlet protecting the Stone has nothing on /this/ first year). Deeper exploration of branches of magic, especially potions. Bringing the back alleys behind Knockturn to life. A more cunning and less sociopathic antagonist who is both more and less of a threat; he's not aiming for mass murder, but he's not Mr Nice Guy either, and he already has a body (he never lost it) and extensive political influence.

Even the basic "Alanna the Lioness" premise is further complicated by the fact that they have to return home every summer and switch back for months. Which leads to all sorts of tangles, especially when they don't just keep their heads down and put life on pause during that time. It was a really gripping read and I'm looking forward to the next chapter of book 4.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.
