**** But what would she do if she met Xenophilius?

When is this set relative to Drake's adventures? I want Cassie to go to Hogwarts and make friends with Luna and they can explore all the secret areas of Hogwarts together.

** The entire group dies during the retrieval and delivery due to being Muggles. Dumbledore is content as it's one horcrux down, he just needs another bunch of Muggles to deal with the defenses of subsequent horcruxes. Also, he doesn't have to pay them - win-win scenario for the good guys.
