While I'm not by any means a reader of Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Snape, etc, the few I have given a chance at never realistically portray the fall out from Hermione dating a "bad" character. Usually they make Ron out to be 1)totally abusive to Hermione, thus justifying her cheating or leaving Ron for Draco (or others) and 2) have Harry, Ginny and everyone else take Hermione's side, either because Ron is so awful or because suddenly they are all friends with Draco (or other Slytherins).

What I want to read is a fic where Hermione gets with the bad character, but the people around her do not support her decision. She loses everything, her friendship with Ron, Harry, Ginny and the Weasleys, the relationship with Draco crashes and burns, and she gets vilified in the press for cheating on/leaving her fellow war hero for a Death Eater. I want a fic with a realistic fallout.


** That's an interesting question, although, I doubt that there is such a story.

Even though I'd never read such contrived stuff, it would be interesting to know if there is a story with a realistic approach to this unrealistic couple. Just the thought that Hermione would ever fall for Malfoy is so irrational that I assume all the other characters also need to be completely OOC to make it work.

*** Yeah, the pairing itself requires a suspension of disbelief, so I can see why we wind up getting OOC reactions too.

But writers clearly don't understand how betrayed Ron would feel if not only did Hermione cheat or leave him (which I also believe to be completely out of character), but she did it with Draco, his school bully and mortal enemy. And Harry's reaction would also be interesting as he would have to choose between Ron and Hermione; I could not see him remaining good friends with both separately, and with his connection to the Weasleys, I can't see him remaining friends with Hermione. And then you have Ginny, who is good friends with Hermione but I think realistically would go nuclear on her.

*** Thanks for the rec. While it technically was what I requested, I took major issue with the characterization of Harry, Ginny and Ron, to say nothing of the whitewashing of the Slytherins. And the big plot twist I figured was coming but still not quite what I was looking for. I was more looking for Hermione with a "bad" guy, and that's what causes the realistic consequences; this one still came across as Hermione and the Slytherin characters acting like the good guys. But thanks for the rec anyway.
