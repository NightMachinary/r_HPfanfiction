I have a good feeling about this. I feel like this would make a great crackfic but I haven't seen it executed yet.


** Sirius Black, escapee from Azkaban and godfather to Harry Potter, sighed deeply. It had been a long night and day--Arthur Weasley had been hurt badly by Voldemort's serpent, and was currently in St. Mungo's. Arthur's children, as well as Sirius's own godson, were staying with him for the Christmas holidays.

Sirius was happy for the company though. Grateful, even. It had been a very, very long time since he had been able to spend Christmas with anyone. Things were tense, but he was determined to make sure that the children had a nice holiday.

Sirius mused. He'd never been very good at small-talk. Moony and Tonks were good at it, and he would bounce off them. But going it alone was not exactly a skill he possessed. But there was something he'd been very keen to hear about.

"So, tell me. How has term been? You started a group to teach yourselves proper defense techniques, yes?"

"It's brilliant," Ron Weasley, the second youngest of the Weasleys and Harry's best friend, blurted. "We're learning all sorts of hexes and jinxes."

"I'm trying to teach them things that can save their lives." Harry scratched his head. "Distractions mostly, but if it's enough to run away. We haven't gotten far in incapacitating hexes yet. I don't want us to hurt each other."

"Well, who else is in the group?"

"We call it Dumbledore's Army," Ginny, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasleys smiled. "All of the Gryffindor Quidditch team is in, and so's some of Ron and Hermione's dormitory mates, oh, and the Creepy brothers and Lee Jordan."

"Anyone from another House?"

"Mostly from our year, a couple from the year above." Harry nodded. "A few blokes from Ravenclaw, Parvati's sister Padma, Cho and her friend." Sirius noted Harry's blush when he said Cho's name. Just like James, that one. "And some Hufflepuffs, Ernie MacMillian and Justin Finch-Fletchy and that Smith bloke and Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones."

Abbott--there was a family in Godric's Hallow with that name. Maybe in another time, Harry and Hannah would have grown up together as neighbors.

"And Luna," Ginny said, and Sirius noted an edge in her voice. "Don't leave her out."

"Ughhhh, what is it with you and Loony Lovegood?" Ron rolled his eyes.

"Don't call her that!" Ginny's ears went pink.

"She doesn't mind!" Ron argued. "Loony probably doesn't even notice."

"Just because she doesn't mind doesn't make it right!" Ginny snapped. "She's my friend!"

"Really, Ginny." Hermione looked up from a very thick book. "You could do far better than her."

"She's the nicest girl in her year in Ravenclaw!" Ginny's face was past pink and nearing red. Her hair was beginning to frizz too.

Sirius contemplated whether he could cast silent Disarming Charms.

"If it's help with your homework you need, I can lend you my notes." Hermione smiled--it reminded Sirius a bit of his favorite cousin Andromeda, who could be a bit of a mother hen. And a pain in the arse. "I can't imagine Luna's much help at all. Going on about the Quibbler, it's actually a wonder she's in Ravenclaw at all."

"She's one of the best in our year!"

"I think that says more about your year, if I'm honest." Hermione patted Ginny's hand. "You're better than her, Ginny. I know it."

Ginny's eyes were bulging and Sirius began thinking a Full-Body Bind might be more appropriate.

"Do you have any idea what she goes through? People steal her things. Mess up her homework. They even steal her shoes and she has to go barefoot. Flitwick doesn't seem to mind much, but she had to miss Potions because she knew Snape wouldn't let her in anyway. And last week, they chanted this horrible song. /Jingle Bells, Loony Smells./"

Sirius began to feel very uncomfortable. A long time ago, he and James had been...well, arrogant toerags is what Lily called them and it was as good a name as any. They had cast jinxes on unexpecting students. Most of them deserved it, but that was because they were bullies too.

Lovegood....Lovegood...oh, the girl must be Xeno's daughter. And Pandora. Sirius felt a prickle in his chest. Pandora had been a few years above them, but she took Lily under her wing right away. Always experimenting in Charms and Potions...the time Lily and Pandora had poisoned themselves trying to figure out a cure for Moony's lycanthropy.

"That's enough! Both of you calm down, or I'll suspend you from the ceiling by your toes!"

Sirius turned his attention towards his godson. "Harry, what do you think of Luna?"

"She's...alright I guess. She's strange," Harry scratched his head again. "But she doesn't seem to be a bad sort. She doesn't like it when people insult the Quibbler and she doesn't think Hagrid's a good teacher--"

"She apologized for that," Ginny interrupted. "I kinda yelled at her about it and Hagrid's been really good this year. He took us to see the Thestrals and Luna liked it so much, she actually cried because she felt so guilty about how she judged Hagrid."

"There was this one story in the Quibbler, she let me read." Harry added. "I think Kingsley or Mr. Weasley might have mentioned it to you. Said you were in a band."

/Oh shit/

"And you were called Stubby Boardman."

"Uh...." Sirius spluttered. "No comment!"

"What? Sirius, it's all a load of rubbish, but it was pretty funny."

"I said no comment!"

"C'mon, don't be such a tosser."

"That's it! I'm grounding you! You are grounded!"

"What?!"

"For the rest of holiday, er...no fire whiskey."

"I don't drink fire whiskey."

"Then no...no...no...Quidditch."

"Umbridge confiscated my broom!"

"And it's winter!" Hermione nodded. "Quidditch is silly enough as it is, but to play it in winter?"

"Er...er...No glasses!"

"Hey, give those back!"

"Merlin, Harry--how do you see out of these?!"

"You really were in a band?" Ron asked eagerly.

"I....I...what part about no comment don't you get?"

"Oh Merlin," drawled Phineas Nigelius, the portrait of his great-great-grandfather. "You are not going to show these impressionable children the follies of your youth, are you Grandson?"

"Gah! What are you doing here?"

"I come bearing a message from Headmaster Dumbledore."

"Oy! Old guy!" Ron asked. "What was Sirius like in that band?"

"It was dreadful. He called himself Stubby, and tried to grow a beard and tried to sing limericks in Celtic. I have tried to spend the last fifteen years trying to forget it."

"How did you even know about it? I thought Sirius ran away from home."

"They gave a performance at Hogwarts one year. Most memorable, it was. I must say, the song /Minerva, My Magnificence/ was unlike anything I ever heard."

"AAAAAAAGGGGH!"

**** Hermione was in fifth year, at least in regards to Luna.

I no longer have physical copies of the books, but I distinctly remember how Hermione treated Luna.

When Harry and the other fifth years are walking to Herbology, they pass Ginny, who says "Hi", and Luna (why the fourth-year Gryffindors take class with the Ravenclaws instead of the Hufflepuffs, I'm not sure).

Luna darts to Harry and says in a loud, matter-of-fact tone that she fully believes that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named returned, and that Harry fought him, and escaped from him.

Luna's wearing her radish earrings (or Dirigible Plums, as it were), and when she sees Parvati and Lavender laughing, she thinks it's because of what she said, rather than what she's wearing.

When Luna retorts that they can laugh, but n

Hermione interrupts and says those people were right--that there aren't any such things as Blibbering Humdingers or Crumple-Horned Snoracks.

Luna storms away and the narration says that several others are now "hooting with laughter."

Harry calls out Hermione for insulting Luna as she's one of the "only people who believes me."

Hermione retorts that Harry can do better than Luna. She says Ginny's told her all about her, and that Luna only believes things if there's no proof at all, and that she wouldn't expect anything else from someone whose father runs /The Quibbler./

--------------

It isn't the only time either. Hermione insults the Quibbler as a load of rubbish, and then gives an unconvincing apology when Luna says that her father is the editor.

She rudely cuts Luna off about the existence of heliopaths during the meeting in the Hog's Head.

Every single time Hermione and Luna argue, Hermione starts it. Luna gives as good as she gets--she could be quite rude to Hermione--but Hermione is the one who starts it.

** I read one forever ago, can't for the life of me find it, but Sirius and Stubby were the same person, but that knowledge was mega top secret for some reason, and the reason Luna was kinda spacy/off was because she figured it out as a little kid and was obliviated, which had side effects.

*** Why, he's Sirius Black, of course!

In the books, The Quibbler says that Sirius was Stubby (false), that he was the lead singer of a band called the Hobgoblins (also false), and that he was framed (somehow true).
