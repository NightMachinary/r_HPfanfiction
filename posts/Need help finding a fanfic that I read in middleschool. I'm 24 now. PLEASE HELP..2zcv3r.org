I know this is a long shot. But I really want to read that HP fanfic again. It was such a fond memory. I remember parts of it SO well like how I was just starting to use a computer, so I didn't know much about it, so I used to copy the entire text and paste it to a word file to read it. Also, to find where I left off, I would make one word font size 200 or something and make it bright red so that I would notice it while scrolling!

What I remember of the story: It was their 5th year I suppose. It was an alternate story. This time, Hagrid continues to be their Care of Magical Creatures teacher and he gives each student a dragon egg to hatch and raise. They all get to raise their dragons and then there is a huge dragon-fighting challenge where they all compete among themselves.

Unfortunately thats all I remember. Please Help! I also remember that it was quite a long book.


** No help from me here, but I just wanted to say that you're bringing me back to the days when I first started reading fic pre-HBP...no fancy-ass ff.net to ePub conversions so I can read on my phone at work in the bathroom...damn things have come a long way since even DH came out.
