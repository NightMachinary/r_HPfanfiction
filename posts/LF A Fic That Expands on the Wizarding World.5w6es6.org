#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

**** The author is a linguistics and cultural politics nerd who likes to portray the magical world as culturally enormously distinct from the muggle world (magical Britain is closer to feudal political structures dominated by family heads). The fic stars Charissa Potter, heir of the Potter family, as she goes to Hogwarts, she's been raised by both her parents and Voldemort didn't exist. The overarching plot revolves around Charissa building her network of friends and learning dark magic from her world-renowned sorceress of a mother (muggleborn Lily) and how her friends and family are slowly changing the world politically; Charissa has also unknowingly been singled out by one of the High Fantasy Magical Aliens to be an agent of chaos on earth for undisclosed reasons. Also culture clashes with Hermione, who is Charissa's best friend/eventual girlfriend.

Magic is different in this story, basically. Tons of side characters have their own interweaving plots. It's not the best in terms of pacing (the author will randomly nerd out on obscure linguistics and info dump on other magical beings and foreign cultures) but a lot of the ideas are new.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty][*Call Me Moriarty*]] linkffn(11602420) does an...interesting level of world building. Definitely incorporates areas of the wizarding world that are rarely touched upon in building up it's background. Unfortunately many of these aspects are dropped as the story goes on. Still an interesting read that is also being actively updated.

  Jasmine Potter comes out of her abusive childhood somewhat changed, showing a few sociopathic tendencies. When she lays eyes upon the wizarding world she sees oppurtunity, and decides to take up the mantle of her favourite villain. AU,OOC, Fem!HarryxHermione pairing. Jasmine as Moriarty/Irene A, Hermione as Sherlock, Longbottom as John.
