Are they other instances and facets of magic in Harry Potter that follow the principle of balances similar or identical to Merlin BBC Old Religion and the balance between life and death of the universe.


** Not particularly, the magic generally laughs at the concept of balance, you can conjure practically anything from nothing, rituals (well the horcrux making and Riddle reviving ones, which are all we get canonically) don't seem to have any balance to them either.

All it takes to bring Voldemort back from just about as close to death as it gets is a few drops of blood, some long forgotten bone and a hand.\\
Horcruxes seem closer, murder for immortality is a classic right, but the murder is just how you split souls, the horcrux stuff is all about binding them to objects.

** HP magic doesn't work that way. I think Lily's sacrifice comes closest, but it's more of a case of Voldemort unwittingly entering into a magic contract and that backfiring on him.

** The only thing even remotely close is the sea water cave entrance that requires blood to open. You have to give up a bit of something to proceed. Other than that bit nothing else springs to mind.

** Hedge magic in Percy Takes The Wheel is kinda similar, especially in the case of his familiar

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
