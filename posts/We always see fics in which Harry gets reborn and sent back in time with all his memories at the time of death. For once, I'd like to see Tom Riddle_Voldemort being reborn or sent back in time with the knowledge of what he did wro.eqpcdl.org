#+TITLE: We always see fics in which Harry gets reborn and sent back in time with all his memories at the time of death. For once, I'd like to see Tom Riddle/Voldemort being reborn or sent back in time with the knowledge of what he did wrong or how horcruxes are bad, or an SI.

He may also know how he had been manipulated by dumbles for fame etc.

Alternatively, I'd love if you could recommend some good length Tom Riddle/Voldemort SI :)

Something like [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/9456/harry-potter-book-1-arrival-to-the-harry-potter][this]] fic I found on Royal Road would be nice too!


** Ive only seen one ever, I think it was called carpe nocturne or something. Not a bad fic, but it was real short and incomplete Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem]]

** This fic has Tom communicate with a genre savvy voice in his head. It gets much better after the first few chapters and actually has one of the better Tom portrayals imo.
