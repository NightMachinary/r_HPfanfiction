** linkffn(11160991) is a popular dimensional travel Harry fic, where he becomes the divination professor and learns it /properly/ from a portrait to keep up the charade, has some pretty cool scenes. People in your other thread already kinda talked about why portraits shouldn't be treated as an easy magical powerup, though, and how some fics/Pottermore explicitly call attention to the idea.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

*** I always try to read that and give up before the tenth chapter for some reason but I might keep going if what you said happens.

I just hate how authors always make Harry a pushover in this "Summoned" situations. I have yet to find a serious story where Harry flips them off and leaves.

**** meh it's a shame the author went to ask money for us to get an update. It's more likely that we'll never see an end to it.

****** Well if I remember the details he set a Patreon and said he would update if the money goal of 50$ was reached.

That alone is pretty lame but I read (I've not verified it myself but it wouldn't surprise me) that it reached the goal once and despite this, no update was made.

In any case readers got quite (and righteously so) pissed at the guy.

If you go on the author's page I think the Patreon link may still be there or his message about updating if getting money (which in afterthought would make it illegal as he hasn't the rights ? ), If not it's in the story and you can still look for his patreon.

The "thief" part of his name is more accurate than you would hope

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.
