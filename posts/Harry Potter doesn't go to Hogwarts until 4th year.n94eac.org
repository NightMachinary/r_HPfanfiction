Whether he doesn't go to magic school AT ALL until 4th year when the cup spits out his name or he goes to a different magic school (doesn't matter whitch one just not Hogwarts)


** Blindness is a good one that includes Hermione. It discusses some magical theory and Harry is a bit OP but it's still a fun ride.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** There's one that I was thinking of the other day, I thought it was pretty great in that Hermione got smashed up really bad by the troll and had to miss the rest of first year because of that and becomes best friends with Luna. I can't remember what it was called though...I'll see if I can find it again...

**** Ok I think it was this one. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12833921/1/]] ) The Harry storyline has its strengths and weaknesses. it's been a while since I read it, but I do remember finding it an enjoyable read, and seeing how his absence changed things, as well as how a Harry who didn't grow up in such a shitty situation affects things once he gets called by the goblet of fire

  James Potter trusted Sirius like a brother. Lily trusted Remus even more. How far will a friend go to honour this trust and to protect her son? What is Dumbledore's backup plan after losing the one and only boy-who-lived? And how will the public react when they learn about the truth? It is time for the tri wizard tournament. It is time for the truth to be reveiled.

** Here are a few I remember:

- linkffn( id: 11610805) :\\
  The Dursleys refuse to let Harry go to Hogwarts, which means he doesn't receive any magical education until his name comes out of the Goblet. The story has a sequel that is currently udpdated.
- linkffn(12305808)\\
  I can't remember the details (or plot) but Sirius took Harry in 1981 and left Britain. Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts until the start of his 5th year (so no Tournament but I thought it could still fit).
- linkffn(12305808)\\
  Harry is found by Mrs Zabini that leave the country with their son. Harry and Blaise grew up as brother and doesn't go to Hogwarts until Harry's name come out of the Goblet (which seem to happen in 6th year, not 4th but whatever).
- linkffn(12048619)\\
  Lily survive the attack and leave to the USA with Remus and Sirius. Years later, Harry goes to Hogwarts as a part of the Ivermorny delegation and I guess (couldn't read this one past 2 chapters) that he is later selected as a Champion.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
