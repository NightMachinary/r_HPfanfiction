I've spent the last 2 weeks reading as much hp fanfiction as I can, but for the life of me I can't find a single decently long harmony fic where Harry and Hermione actually have sex. I love Vox Corporis, but 58 chapters in, there hasn't been any real sex described. It's driving me bonkers that fanfiction.net doesn't have a sex tag, which means there no way of knowing how sexual a story in the mature tag will get without reading hundreds of thousands of words. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating it is. I read a 180k word 'mature' fanfic where in the 3rd to last chapter the author stops just before the actual sex(I beat my floor with a hammer).

Rant over. Can anyone recommend a harmony fic that is decently long, preferably complete, and has actual sex, or lemons or whatever you call it here? I only need one, it has to exist right?

P.S I don't mind one or two extra girls in the ship, but nothing too huge.


** The problem is, FF.net frowns upon (read: prohibits in community guidelines and ToS, but does not police) explicit content. A few years back, many of those types of stories were purged through the actions of a few zealous communities such as Critics United. Try other sites like adultfanfiction, ao3, or if you are willing to wade through crap, storiesonline or asstr.org.

** Okay sure, here are some. There's varying degrees of explicit-ness of course... not sure what you're aiming for:

[[http://keiramarcos.com/blank-space/]]

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]]

Both of these have some great smut.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185/1]]

This one starts out really smutty, but is a really long and sometimes very angsty story.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor]]) - Erotic comedy, lots of sex.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420434/1/Moments-in-Love]]) - lots of sex. There's a more explicit version on [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5204972/chapters/11997152][ao3]]

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243818/1/Sooner-Or-Later]]) - They become friends with benefits. Not very explicit.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]]) - another crack!fic... lots of buildup, but there will be sex. not very explicit.

After looking over my favs I come to the conclusion that most stories are really very tame.

** hmm, looking at my favs on ff.net. i can give you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2358572/1/Kissing-Lessons-for-the-Beginner]] like the title suggests, the sex i coming very late, nearly the end of the fic and its in a shortened version of FF.net. The full version is on the authors livejournal.

And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]] by chemprof. I didnt read the whole thing yet, but there are 3 sexual encounters. The most explicit one (but not to smutty/dirty, but rather in a nice romance way) is the last one in the final chapter. The first happens in "Year 6" of that fiction.

** Also, from what I remember Vox Corporis actually had two sex scenes, but which were removed from the ffnet version. I can't remember where you might find it, but (I think) it was available in some yahoo group, back when those things were all the rage...
