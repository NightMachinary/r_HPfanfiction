I just reread harry crow for the first time in a year. So heres a little backstory. I've read fanfic for a little under 3 years and I started with the writer redhal. After reading his books I found robst and I was hooked. I thought he was the best writer ever! Now re-reading it, I'm cringing just oh the first does chapters. The moment that made me cringe the most was when they were talking about guns in chapter 11 and harry said that goblins like to look their enemy in the eye when they kill them. Hermione then ran away crying and Hermione and Padma treated it like some huge betrayal. I just can't read robst's fics anymore.


** Everyone holds those first few fics they read up on a pedastal. It's why stories like this and MoR are so popular (since they're easy to find).

*** I disagree on that being the reason for MoR's popularity. I think it's simply divisive, with a lot of people genuinely liking it and continuing to like it, while others hate it.

For me, it has more re-read value than most.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

**** It was popular at a time when tropes were new and HP fanfic was looking for /any/ long self-consistant fics of reasonable quality, people lapped it up at the time because its all there was.

These days it wouldn't have been nearly as popular. Its dry, repetitive, overly long, cringy and has a whole host of other problems which become apparent once you are no longer starved for good fanfics.

I unfortunately found it a bit late into my initial foray into HP fanfic, and /really/ couldnt get into it no matter how much I tried at the time.

Its just boring.

** I was big fan of robst work when I first started reading fanfic, but I never liked Harry Crow. It was combination of all tropes and cliches he/she was for. But I admire him for trying to complete most of his work unlike hundreds of other fic writers.

** I have kind of similar experience with “Different Halloween”. I actually really like the setup. Yes, it is sickly sweet and fluffy, but it was kind like having sweet pastry --- once in a while, it is good to eat it. However, he fixed all problems too soon (NO SPOILERS!), so suddenly he had no plot to follow, no dramatic conflict to resolve. I think it would be possible to finish whole story somewhere after the scene when Voldemort missed the fine print, and it would be just setup, but it would make some sense. Except he didn't and tried to continue with no plot whatsoever and the rest of the story is really bad. It's a pity.

*** you don't NEED dramatic conflict in a story, it's just that most stories HAVE dramatic conflict so it usually feels weird when it isn't there, and some stories have MULTIPLE dramatic conflicts, but yeah, robst's work is basicly a sweet pastry, good once in awhile but too much makes you sick

** I liked the premise of Harry Crow, but not the execution. It was a variant on the Super!Harry type of fic and I really hated that he was all powerful and got everything he wanted. There was never any real conflict that Harry Crow couldn't overcome. The only major 'cringe' for me was the presentation on the steps of Gringotts and the singing of "Blowin' in the Wind". Yeek.
