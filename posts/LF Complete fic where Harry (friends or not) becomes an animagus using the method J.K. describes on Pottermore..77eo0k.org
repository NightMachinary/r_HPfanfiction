** to be fair, a little bit of magic would make this relatively easy.

Sticking charm for sticking the leaf to the roof of your mouth--doesn't get in the way when you eat or sleep and won't be accidentally ingested.

For the dew, literally just get up before dawn and go outside and collect some dew.

go buy a chrysallis.

quiet dark place? easy. Silence a container, that is airtight, put it inside, and lock it up.

large and secure place? Room of requirement, shrieking shack, etc.

Cheers! All done. We forget sometimes, esp with the way cannon and fannon are, that wizards can literally use magic for everything.

*** If potion ingredients are volatile to magic, wouldn't the ingredients for animagus procedure be volatile too?

**** I think potions are only volatile because there are multiple ingredients reacting with one another, and magic essentially acts as an introduced variable; like chemistry/chemical reactions, with multiple reactants, and adding in heat or something. Mandrake leaf, in your mouth, is literally just hanging out in your mouth. A sticking charm would just stick it to your mouth/palate/cheek/etc.

And I doubt silencing the area around a container would affect the vial of mandrake+spit+dew+chrysallis

*** "The process is extremely difficult and can result in disaster (such as permanent half-human, half-animal mutations) if done incorrectly. A witch or wizard must keep a single mandrake leaf in their mouth for an entire month (from full moon to full moon). If the leaf is removed or swallowed, the witch or wizard will have to start over again. At the next visible full moon (if the night happens to be cloudy one will have to start over), the wizard must spit the leaf in a phial within range of the moon's pure rays. To the moon-struck phial, the wizard or witch must add one of their own hairs, a silver teaspoon of dew that has not seen sunlight or been touched by human feet for seven days, and the chrysalis of a Death's-head Hawk Moth. The mixture must be put in a quiet, dark place and be in any way disturbed. The next thing that must happen is for the wizard to wait for an electrical storm, whenever that might be. During this waiting period the wizard must, at sunrise and sundown without fail, chant the incantation Amato Animo Animato Animagus with the tip of their wand placed over the heart. When, at last, there is a lightening storm, the wizard ought to move immediately to a large and secure place, recite the incantation one final time, and then drink the potion."

It's found in one of the short books she recently released.

******* Say you read this and you decide you want to do it. Doing it right takes a month.

So you need a Deaths Head Moth chrysalis ready at the right time. Step one is either finding a supplier for what may well be a very niche ingredient, or setting up a hatchery.

You also need a place where stuff can sit completely undisturbed.

Leaf in mouth between two clear moons in the UK? That's a nuisance, because the weather is often cloudy.

Then you need an electrical storm at the right time, so, really, you need to finish in August. Then you might only have to wait a few weeks for there to have been two clear moons.

Sunset times move, and sunrise times move, and people have jobs and whatnot. Chanting without fail every day might not be that easy.

It's not that you can't do it within a month. It's that getting all the preparation done might take years. Or you might accidentally slip a day or get a cold, or have to stay in work late... It might take a long time to realise when lightning storms are frequent. And I say August, but that's not guaranteed. Weather changes a lot.

Reading about it is easy, but if I, personally, had to do it, I'd have to really, really want to, and, even assuming that there's a Deaths Head Moth Chrysalis supplier already available to me, the rest is going to take a lot of working out.

None of this should take long, unless you're incredibly unlucky.

That's not what it means. You just have to hold it in your mouth for a full moon cycle. The moon doesn't have to be clear at the beginning and end. That's silly.

Why? August isn't the only month it storms. It can storm plenty in both Autumn and Spring.

#+end_quote

Sure it can. If you don't have ten seconds to spare every sunrise and sunset, you're doing something wrong with your life. It's as simple as pointing your wand at yourself and saying a few words, not setting up a ten minute long ritual.

No, it's really not. You're exaggerating /heavily./

Okay, but this isn't going to happen to the majority of people if you're careful. And wizards don't catch the common cold. It's highly unlikely that the majority of people will have this problem.

It might take some years, sure, but that's if they're incredibly unlucky. There's just no way the process is so difficult that it takes so many people years that the general consensus is that the process takes years for most. If you start in the summer, you could /easily/ get it done by next summer if you're careful.

********* Wizards do catch the common cold. It's right there in canon - pepper-up potion is specifically mentioned as a cure for it. The book describes steam coming out of ears and whatnot.

The clear moon is because you need to see the moon, in the description given above. If you can't see the moon, then you have to start over. If it's cloudy, you can't see the moon. The UK is often cloudy at night. And some nights moonrise is at a very silly time of night/morning, but it's only one night so I suppose you'd make time for it.

August, in the UK, is the only month where you can easily plan things around seeing a lightning storm. Spring storms are not easy to plan around. August, it's likely you can get one that month. March? Maybe, maybe not, probably not. April? Could be like summer, could be drizzle, could be snow. :ate July is also likely, I suppose.

And the chant sounds simple, but speaking from experience, trying to do anything 'sunset and sunrise' is actually a pain in the arse. Obviously I haven't been trying to become an animagus, but I have tried to time stuff for sunrise and sunset. Give it a go, it's surprising how much of a nuisance it is to get the exact time. Admittedly, I don't have a tempus charm.

Also, Deaths Head Moths are rare in the UK. They don't come up as potion ingredients in canon in any other context, so I am dubious about them being easy to buy, but I don't say that has to be a major nuisance, just that it might be. It's conceivable, rather than ridiculous, to imagine it taking time to arrange.

I didn't say it /had/ to take years, just that I can see how it /could/. It isn't ridiculous for it to take years between 'this sounds cool' and 'yay, I did it'. It could be done in a month, and I say that too. I think there's room for a large range of finishing times, from less than thirty days to several years.
