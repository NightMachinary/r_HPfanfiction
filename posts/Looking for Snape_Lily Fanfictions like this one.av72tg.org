I've been searching all over for fanfictions that explore lily and snape's relationship in depth while mostly sticking to the canon that JK Rowling has set out and not sugarcoating Snape's character, Something like this one:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5411384/1/Lily-and-the-HalfBlood-Prince]]

The longer, the better, thank you again in advance!


** I don't know if this counts as "mostly sticking to the canon" given it's a canon-divergent AU, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306][Puzzle]] linkao3(11622306) has the best depiction of Snape I've ever seen in fic, hands down.

#+begin_quote
  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
