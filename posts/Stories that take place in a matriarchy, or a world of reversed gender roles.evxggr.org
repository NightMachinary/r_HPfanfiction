I've read The Distaff Side, and it was an intriguing concept. I've seen a few other works of fiction (like the book, A Brother's Price) that take place in a world where women have the sort of societal power that men arguably normally would, and I'd love to see if anyone has written anything in the Harry Potter universe. It feels a bit awkward trying to describe it without making it all sound political, so sorry if I'm clumsy here. Just imagine the expectations that men and women have (or had in the past) and flip them around; that's what I'm talking about. It's all exaggerated and simplified for the sake of entertainment, of course, but that's what makes it fun to read.

Apart from The Distaff Side, does anyone know any other fanfiction that takes place in a matriarchy, or where men are the "fairer sex"? Any shove in the right direction would be very much appreciated.

edit: And apart from the Firebird trilogy, too. I'm reading it as we speak.


** linkao3(Holly Potter and the Witching World by D_M_Nealey) - an intriguing version of the Potterverse wherein most of the magical world is witches. The author has been seen lurking about and deserves encouragement to continue her story.

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
