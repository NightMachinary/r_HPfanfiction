Not bothered about what house the characters are in, but would prefer that the story is set in Harry's generation.


** I always recommend linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) and its sequel linkffn(Shade to Shade). That author, Slide, has written some of my favorite fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.

** Don't take this personally, but your flair is wrong. Switch it to requests.

Second, Harry's generation has 40 something characters who don't get a single line. Finding lots of Hogwarts OCs is a bit unnecessary, but if you don't mind, I could recommend fics with more development to the minor characters of Hogwarts?

*** I don't mind that at all. I agree that's pretty much the same thing since 90% of the Hogwarts students mentioned in the books are all just blank slates. Just switched the flair, thanks.

**** RemindMe! 3 hours

I need to get to a PC to do this right. I've seen good OCs done before, but it generally deals with an adult setting. Hogwarts OCs end up either being Mary-Sues, Gary-Stus, or Self-inserts.
