** A few quotes that I like and remembered off the top of my head:

#+begin_quote
  "Changing history to suit your purposes has a long and successful history"
#+end_quote

I'm fond of this Rorschach's Blot quote, though the story it comes from is pretty bad. Speaking of cool quotes from less good stories:

#+begin_quote
  "Red Leader standing by," said Seamus Finnigan, who had no idea what it meant.

  "Red Five standing by," said Dean Thomas, who'd waited his entire life to say it.
#+end_quote

HPMOR had some damn good moments.

#+begin_quote
  "I think you call him Daddy there too."
#+end_quote

linkffn(A Black Comedy) has a few very funny moments and the discovery of the Tonks-Lupin situation still makes me giggle.

"Where is the fire and brimstone McGonagall? In your youth you were full of passion and ready to change the system. Now you couldn't be more part of the establishment if you were mortared in the castle's bricks!"

There's a bit where the ministry is trying to get a blood sample from everyone, and Harry's response to the request was “The last time someone took my blood, it was used to resurrect Voldemort.” Madame Pomfrey gave up.

There's also a time when Harry and Hermione are being vocally suspicious of aurors, causing drama, until Harry cracks a smile and says “I want to make sure I have the option to put ‘maintained constant vigilance' on my super application.”

** [Professor McGonagall groaned, her head in her hands. "Harry, you are not allowed to beg Slytherins to curse your food anymore."

Harry was showing annoyance at the general situation. "Meh."

She looked up at the boy. "Stop pouting."

Harry was most certainly not pouting.

She stabbed her wand at the glass dome holding back the purple and black salad that seemed to be trying to escape. "Mr. Potter, your food does unusual things BEFORE it gets cursed by 7 years of students."

Harry could have handled it.

Apparently she could read his expression, because she looked even more exasperated. "Mr. Potter... Harry." She leaned down to his level. "Please, as a favor to me, stop adding curses when your food gains sentience."

Harry didn't know that word.

She sighed. "When it tries to talk. Or eat other students. Or move at all, really."

His frown was epic. "Well excuse me. I was unaware deliciousness was against the rules."

In all honesty, Ravenclaw would have probably lost a ton of points if Professor Flitwick had not been so gleefully examining what had once been Harry's leftover onions, which had began negotiations with the pickle capital of the east.]

#+begin_quote
  "Shut up Malfoy, why don't you just -- oh my Merlin -- what the hell happened to your face? Did someone push you down the stairs?" Ron ogled the shiner on Malfoy's cheek. Harry and Hermione exchanged a glance.

  "No Weasley, I tripped over your ineptitude," Malfoy snapped back.

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.

** "No," said Harry casually, while still staring at the door, "but I do have six days. God made the World in six days. Surely, I can come up with a plan for dealing with Little Lord Bad-Faith in that amount of time. And on the seventh day, we'll rest. And Draco Malfoy will never trouble us again."

Blaise and Theo both looked wide-eyed at Harry for a second and then turned to look at each other somewhat nervously. Neither of them spoke, as they were both afraid to broach the topic of whether or not it was a good thing for Harry Potter to compare himself to God.

** It's not exactly a quote per se but more of a line. In the story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4420759/4/What-The][What The?]] by Madam Dee, Hermione goes back in time to 1944 as a six-year-old. She goes to Wool's Orphanage and has a fellow fourteen-year-old name Christy show her around and look after her. One morning at breakfast, Hermione leads Christy over to a table but she's hesitant about sitting down. Christy explains this is Tom Riddle's table and tries to take Hermione away before he comes in and sees her. Hermione, being stubborn and all, doesn't want to leave as she considers this only a seat, one in which she doesn't believe belongs to Tom Riddle. Eventually, Tom comes in and sees her and confronts both Christy and Hermione. Here is my favorite line:

​

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was trying with all of her might not to stand up and slap them both in the face. Tom for being a pain and a bully, Christy for trying to pass some of the blame on her and not having a backbone. Hermione leaned back in her chair with her arms folded, watching the pair.
#+end_quote

​

It doesn't sound funny just posting it here but in the context of the story, I laughed out loud, one of the few times a Harry Potter fanfiction has actually made me. The story in itself is nowhere near a masterpiece but it's certainly one of the more funny Tom/Hermione stories I have come across.

  "There," Lily said again, pointing at the hill and what was behind it. "We're almost there!"

  And so they are.

  They are cresting the hill, their hearts straining in their chests, their eyes straining to be the first to see.

  It will not be real until they behold it, will remain an idle hope like all hope is idle, in the end, a necessary lie that only earns its mantle of verity when we can cast our eyes on it.

  In their minds they see it already, the valley stretching out below the hill, frosted blades of grass glittering in the sunlight, and four bundles of clothing and flesh and bone, four unconscious travellers they've been conjuring in their dreams a thousand times.

  But it is not yet truth.

  In a moment it might be.

  Let us leave them here, then, in the cold of a January forest, with the figments of their hopes about to take form. We deal not in realities, but in maybes.

  Let us leave them.

  Both worlds are safe, and this story is told.

  It is time for our Chosen Ones to be at peace.

Also, from chapter 6 of linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) (can't use the formatting for that one, sorry):

Hermione swallowed hard. "Both my parents are dentists," she said casually.

Daphne narrowed her eyes. "Dentists? What are dentists?"

"They fix people's teeth."

Daphne blanched. "Your parents are muggles?"

"Yes."

"You're muggleborn?"

** Quotes from Chaos Theory fanfic that I loved: "Why do we pretend to have secrets when everyone knows everything?"

"And sometimes it's easy to forget all the good things that come with living because the bad things seem so overwhelming. But the bad things don't diminish the good things. The good things are still worth fighting for."

"'I'm wonderful,' he says, and he is. He is part of a grand, chaotic, impossible design. He is despairing and hopeful and shattered and whole all at once. He is the universe experiencing itself."

From Running on Air: "What's the point in that? Sitting in a box, only going where someone else takes you." - Draco says this many years later after the war, when asked why he would bother getting a muggle drivers license, when a chauffeur could drive him.

"He's trying, Harry thinks. And he's getting better. And that's the opposite of failure."

** “Many hold the belief that the ultimate goal in life is to be in a state of complete contentment, free of struggle and suffering. However, one must take into consideration that all things are relative. Without salt, there is no sweet; without dark, there is no light; without suffering, happiness cannot exist. A life consisting only of happiness would quickly lose its beauty. It would be living life in a straight line; every day, happiness would deteriorate further into normalcy, until finally one would be caught in a state of boredom. Happiness would become like a drug -- more and more would be needed to lift the spirits until, finally, stagnation would be the only sensation remaining, there being no further levels of happiness to be achieved. The smallest hitch in a plan would feel like ultimate devastation. The ultimate goal in life, then, is to experience the fullest range of emotions possible, and to always be struggling towards some end.” linkffn(Eggplant and Caviar)

  In a way, Tom, but only in a way, there is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to withstand it. You can get drunk on power like a man can get drunk on firewhiskey, to the point where the whiskey controls him, drains him and eventually ruins him. That is what happens when we give in to the pull of the darkness. But harness your own desires, and it becomes a tool that you control instead of it controlling you, and you can do great things -- great, and magnificent.

Garrick Ollivander to Tom Riddle. Story is “Last Chance” by Laume. I like this one because it contrasts very well with what Ollivander told Harry in canon, that Voldemort did “great things---terrible, yes, but great”, and considering that in the story we do see Tom get tempted by his own dark nature but trying to fight it, well ...

  "Let's give her a love potion and send her to Voldemort!" Ron said ecstatically. "Nothing could possibly go wrong with that plan. Either Voldemort would fuck her -- an she'd survive that -- or he'd kill her. Or Bellatrix would do it for him!" "RON!" Ginny shouted, while Harry roared with laughter. Neville actually sank down onto the floor he was laughing so hard. Sirius pounded the arm of his chair with h Harry thought he even might have heard a chuckle from Snape. "THAT -- IS -- DISGUSTING!" "It fits," Ron insisted. "It's perfect!" "You know," Harry was suddenly struck by a thought that filled him with horror. "I reckon I'm glad Voldemort is a cold son of a bitch... what if I felt him having sex wit witch?" Ron sprayed out his firewhiskey. "No wonder why Voldemort's so cranky! He's a virgin!"

** Oh, I wish I had gotten here yesterday, but alas.

My favorite quote of all HP fanfiction comes from /Faith and Understanding,/ which chronicled Ginny's friendship with Luna, and Ginny's musings therein.

It's actually a very sweet, tender story. The best lines come from the closing paragraphs:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.
