Does anyone have news on the author of the infamous full circle fic? They haven't updated their fics/social media for more than an entire year when before it seems they were going full steam ahead...

I don't care about the fics being abandoned/dead in the end but I definitely worry when one of my favourite authors drop off the face of the earth! hope they're doing alright
