** I don't use reviews except for here, on hpfanfiction. I otherwise don't use the number of reviews to judge a fic or read the reviews to see what they say. 99% of reviews are junk saying:

- OMG I love this!
- Wow that scene where Draco and Hermione lost their virginities to each other was so hot!
- When are you going to update? I know it says it's on hiatus, but soon, right? This is my favorite story so you have to.

[[/u/englishhedgehog13]] made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ry2z4/be_honest_do_you_judge_a_fic_by_its_number_of/][topic]] three days ago that asks this question. You should check it out!

*** And obviously you've got the trolls who don't even have a FF account but who rant and rave. There was one a few days ago on linkffn(11567591) who basically moaned about how Hermione was gay (s/he was a Christian extremist)...

** Reviews are for the author for me. I'd only "review" in the sense of recommending to other people if I like it, and it's in no way as detailed as the former. I try to review everything I've read and liked if the author seems active, and in those cases, it's praise. I leave critique if they mention they're looking for feedback or some gentle suggestions otherwise - the kind of stuff that can help them without too much investment. Critique or praise, I love when people mention specific things from the story in reviews, so I try to add something like that.
