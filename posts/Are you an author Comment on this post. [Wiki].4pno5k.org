***** I was just thinking if there was some sort of quota. More than two stories, more than x ammount of follows or something. Like I said, just curious.

****** I've seen some authors with only one story published, but that single story is absolutely amazing. Traffic on fanfiction.net doesn't really mean anything because some of the best fics have very few views compared to the popular ones.

******* I agree.

One of my favorite fanfics was linkffn(A Difference in Families: the Snape Chronicles), which has relatively little reviews and views while being ^{^{imho}} completely amazing.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

Oh, and word of warning -- I have my three little one-shots on Ao3 (same name there) but forgot to upload two of them to FFN until just a few minutes ago, so they're not showing up properly right now.
