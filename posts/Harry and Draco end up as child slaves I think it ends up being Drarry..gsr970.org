:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember most of the details, but basically Harry is sold as a slave to this pedo and kept in a closet. Then he either escapes and is captured or is sold again to this child slave ring that operates on a boat. Draco is kidnapped (I think) and ends up there as well. They bond and become very important to each other. Eventually they escape the ship and end up staying in this apartment above a nightclub, before the owner is killed. I can't remember entirely how but I think that later on there was this lesbian couple involved who helped them out? I don't remember most of the details outside of that.

Does anyone know the name? It was on ff.net.


** Just a heads up to anyone knows the name of it, just post the name of it, and do /not/ link to it. That sort of content does break reddit's rules

**** Discussing it and asking for the name of the fic isn't against the rules, but this is the relevant one:

****** I think a frank discussion of factual accounts without explicit details is acceptable to reddit policy, but it's probably better to err on the side of caution. Saying pederasty was common in ancient Greece is probably fine, but I'd imagine a story about Socrates in the bathhouse would probably be a violation.
