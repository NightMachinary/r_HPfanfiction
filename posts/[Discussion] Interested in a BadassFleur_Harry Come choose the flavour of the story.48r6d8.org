I began reading HP fics wanting to see what the fandom had made of Fleur Delacour considering how Badass she seems based on the little we know of her, and this quote from "Moody" in the GoF: "She's as much a fairy princess as I am."

Disappointed by the lack of Badass!Fleur, I finally got around to writing my own but I have two relatively similar plots that have radically different focuses, and I just can't seem to settle the matter on my own. Hence, I ask for your help, fellow readers and writers, to decide which road my story should take.

Plot A (for adventure!) focuses on a Fleur trained early on to become a curse-breaker by her mother, and who searches for someone to accompany her on her own adventures, exploring ancient ruined and traveling the world.

Plot R (for Revolution!) will focus on a Fleur that has been trained by her mother to protect herself from harm as a half-blood and a "half-breed", and who is intellectually and politically taught by her other parent who is a muggle writer. This fix will also focus on the ties between the muggle and the wizarding world, and will also delve into political and sociological theories.

So? Which one should I write? Which one should forever lie abandoned in the deepest reaches of my mind? You decide! (Not really, but your opinion certainly matters.)

EDIT: Since the opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of the Plot A, it's the direction i'll take for now. Don't worry, as soon as I've written and published the first chapter, I'll post the link here. Thanks for your help!

*** It wouldn't exactly be cursebreaking, but close enough that it shouldn't matter much. If you're looking for old ruins exploration, avoiding old traps, and finding old pieces of magic in faraway countries in remote locations, you'll find what you're looking for, don't worry.

***** I just hope I can go through the 4th year and get to the good stuff quickly enough that I don't end up getting bored of what I'm writing. That's why I think I'll make them have a friendly relationship until it becomes more when they go have fun in the wilderness.

******* It would be valid IF this Fleur was canon, which she absolutely isn't. Her character will be very different. I just noticed that my plot summary didn't mention that. So no, Harry and Fleur will get closer directly during fourth year. But for their interactions to be believable after the 4th, I need show how they interact during the year. It's a pain, but it's needed.

*** I understand your plight, fellow reader. Here's a small unusal rec for you, free of charge. I find it to be refreshingly well written, but this fic's biggest flaw is... That it will probably never get finished. The author writes awesome One-shots though, so If you like it, be sure to check him out.

She'll certainly not have a "prim and proper" attitude, and she will violently shake things up at dear old Hogwarts, in a way I have never seen before (then again my own opinions aren't exactly what you'd call a common occurence).

****** just something to think about but she could easily be evil in plot A, and AFAIK no one's written an evil cursebreaker story (using indegnious peoples as guinea pigs to see if any undetected traps, torturing local holymen/village elders for rumors of locations of forgotten temples, betraying comrades at end of an expedtion to avoid splitting the loot etc)

and if you go plot R please consider turning her into a fallen hero, someone who starts of idealistic but the realities of war/political situation eventually forces her to comprise her ideals and by the end shes as big a tyrant as she once fought against (or not its your story, I just love evil characters!)

******* Unfortunately, I don't do evil. I just don't. Among all the antagonists I've written about, I don't think any of them could be considered straight up evil. I think it comes from the fact that I must have the soul of a reincarnated care bear. I don't see evil people, I just see other ideologies and structures that enforce behaviours. So, my deepest apologies, but if you came to read about people being and becoming evil, I'm afraid that you came to the wrong place. My characters aren't good or evil, they're just human. And that's already a lot to deal with. Besides, placing Fleur's actions on a moral compass will be pretty hard. I'm not God. But I'll do my best nonetheless.
