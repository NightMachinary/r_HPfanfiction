I can't get over the number of abandoned or incomplete fics that are recommended on this site. It kills me to read a fic that I get emotionally invested in and then...nothing. I'm left up in the air with no resolution.

How do you do it? What's your motivation to read these fics?


** I don't mind because I usually set them down and then imagine the ending myself. It's like inspiration for new stories I can tell in my head.

** Some of the best fics I've read happen to be unfinished. As the other commenter said, I even re-read them periodically. Part of that is to enjoy the writing that captivated me the first time. Life is a journey, not a destination. Yes, it's disheartening and frustrating when the story ends abruptly, even the ones that end at a good stopping point.

But I am also an optimist. At least two of the unfinished fics in my collection have started having new chapters after literally years. Never say never.

That said, if a fic is clearly labeled as abandoned, I will not start reading it. What I hate the most are authors who abandon their work but, instead of saying so, mark it complete. There's a special hell reserved for them.

** I enjoy good writing, whether it's complete or not. Witty banter and exciting duels are enjoyable for their own sake, and don't have to be part of a whole.

Fics with really interesting overall plots that seem to need completion, I just consider as extended prompts. They're interesting setups I can continue with my own imagination.

And of course, there's nothing quite like the thrill of subscribing to something that seems abandoned, then getting a surprise update years later. That's way more fun than just getting the whole story at once. Although sometimes when I get the writer's version of the ending, I'm a little disappointed since it doesn't seem as good as the one I was imagining.

** It depends on the fic of course. There are lots of way to abandon a fic, and I hold up linkffn(Three Black Birds) as my favorite abandoned fic, not only for the quality of the fic itself but also because the author posted the outline when they abandoned it, so it helps with the whole ‚Äúunresolved ending‚Äù thing.

I'll also echo other responders on both sometimes there are truly amazing fics that are abandoned, and if you read enough fanfic, at some point I'd rather read unfinished fics I love than completed works that are barely worth the time. And some of them might get finished eventually, who knows?

My favorite author did this for his fanfic series too, for Kingdom Hearts.

While I wish he could have finished it, I am still quite satisfied by what he envisioned.

** As everyone else who has commented so far has pretty much said, good writing is good writing, whether or not the story is complete, and I can always have fun trying to imagine where the story is going next.

One reason I don't avoid stories that aren't marked complete is that I've also found that the "complete" tag or its lack is not always a reliable indicator. Some authors mark a story as complete when they decide they're not going to write any more of this story, whether it's at a logical stopping point for a story arc or not. That's frustrating, because an abrupt stop makes it feel like they've lied to me, or cheated me out of something. (I know, free ice cream, but ...)

Other authors don't mark as complete stories that they /do/ stop at the logical end of an arc. Even if the author originally intended there to be more to the story, it feels satisfyingly complete to me.

The only incomplete/abandoned stories that really bother me are the ones that can barely be described as a start. It's a matter of effort required on my part compared to the return, really. Sort of like if the first book had ended when Hagrid said, "Harry, yer a wizard." At that point, you don't have a story, and you don't have a plot, and I don't have a reason to want to continue unless it's a new story. If it hasn't been updated in several years, I'll be sorry I wasted the time reading that much. Given that I enjoy one-shots and stories that are complete in less than epic length, sometimes I end up wasting the time.

That said, one thing I've seen done (/very/ rarely) that I like is a final chapter in which the author says, "I'm never going to finish this story because reasons. Here's where I was planning to go with it ..."

** The one nice thing about the quarantine was that a handful of fics that I considered in "abandoned territory" (more than 2 years since last updated) were updated by the author. So there always is a sliver of hope that the story will eventually be updated.

Does it drive me a little crazy that the story "stops" before it hits the end absolutely. But I still enjoyed what I read until that point. And like some other readers I can imagine where I want the story to go.

** For me it's about new ideas. The search for something a little bit different over-weighs the frustration of incomplete stories. Also, sometimes even when the full story isn't finished, a key aspect of it is resolved and that can be satisfaction enough to override the disappointment (e.g. Sirius being proven innocent or that moment when characters get together after a slow burn build up).

I do have some criteria, to make sure there is enough content to be worth it. Not just a word count but the word/chapter ratio. I wont ready anything that is under 1000 words per chapter but for something WIP I look for a minimum 20,000 words posted with approx 3,000 words per chapter. I also only start WIP stories that were updated within the last 12 months (gotta have some hope that it'll continue) and if it's older and abandoned I want at least 80,000 words, though over 100k is better.

** I very rarely am reading a fanfic for the /plot/, whether the fic is complete or incomplete. Even complete fics rarely have satisfying endings, because endings are probably the hardest thing to write well. To be blunt, fanfic writers aren't great at plot/conflict. If I want that, I'll go read Brandon Sanderson.

I read fanfic for the sandbox element. So long as a fic contains something of /substance/, it rarely matters to me that the story it is telling is incomplete. That substance can be worldbuilding, interesting character interactions, "fixing" canon, etc. It doesn't have to be plot.

** It's like death. I always remember that God's question from ‚ÄúJoan of Arcadia‚Äù: ‚ÄúWould you rather [boy's name] was never born? Aren't you thankful for all those moments you could spent with him, even when you couldn't spend more of them?‚Äù. It is the same.

And when the pain is too big, I write a sequel. ;)

** It's frustrating. A lot of times with fanfiction we put up with mediocre writing and terrible editing to get at a good story, and having that story just stop mid-telling makes it not worth putting up with the rest.

** Most fics are bad - that's a general rule. Not reading wip and abandoned works would turn 'most' into 'almost all of them'. I would probably took longer to find a fic than acually read it.
