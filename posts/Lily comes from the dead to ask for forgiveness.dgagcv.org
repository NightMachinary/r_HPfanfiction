So Harry gets to somehow visit his parents in the underworld and they are disappointed about gis choices in life. Lily even slaps him. Later his mom risks her soul to come to the living world to make sure Harry forgives her. Switching for this fiction.


** I would read this, despite asking myself what Lily has done that needs to be forgiven?

Seriously, you could maybe (if you are a dick!) argue that she should have forced James to leave Britain as soon as she was pregnant (to protect Harry from the madness that was the first blood war!)...but otherwise? No, there's nothing!
