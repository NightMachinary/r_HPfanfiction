pretty much the opposite of a mugglewank, I want the magical world to be better in every way and wizards to be stronger than muggles.

*** I wouldn't say better, but definitely not inferior, just very different maybe?

**** Nah, the author makes it very clear that Muggles are inferior beings that occasionally come up with inventions that the Wizarding world will make use of and claim as their own. Like canon, but more blatant.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/][*/Victoria Potter/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][/Taure/]]

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987 has this to a significant degree as you get further into the story, and its complete. Though it does take a while before it really gets into it and the story ends with the wizards wiping out all of the remaining muggles and making the whole world a magical haven.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
