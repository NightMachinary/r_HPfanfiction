It's clear that in the third book, Rowling wanted Harry to become a really powerful wizard(learning Patronus and all that). And after that she just abandons that for "little above average, great at DADA but nothing exceptional" Harry.

I'm wondering how would you imagine Harry's development. You can keep the general plot points of the later books.

I think first and foremost, Harry needs to be a legit Hogwarts Champion in the Triwizard tournament. He should be able to complete the tasks with minimal outside help.

I think he should be at least be the best in Charms and Transfiguration in practical. Taking days(weeks?) to learn Accio?! Nah, he does that in a few attempts.

Non-verbal magic? Super easy.

Wandless magic? Barely an inconvenience.

The fight with Draco in sixth year shouldn't even be a fight.

We can throw in some awesome feats in seventh year like fighting half a dozen werewolves or a giant on his own single handedly.

How would /you/ do it?


** If we're keeping him in character, the only way this truly happens is if he has someone to encourage him to do it.

So maybe Flitwick sees Harry's patronus and takes him under his wing, Dumbledore acts on the 2nd prophecy, or Sirius/Remus...invite him to Grimmauld Place and he develops from there.

Wandless magic isn't really realistic, especially for a kid that didn't go out of his way to read theory before the divergence. Non verbal magic should wait until OotP or HBP.

*** Maybe having Voldemort kill the Dursley's before Harry gets there after the tournament? This is bond to make Dumbledore more intent on making sure he can defend himself now that he doesn't have the blood wards as protection anymore.

** ‚ÄúSuper easy! Barely an inconvenient‚Äù it is always nice to meet a fellow ‚ÄúPitch meeting‚Äù fan ‚úåÔ∏èüëçüòÅ.

About the power scale... honestly, the best way to do it starting during GOF would be to either have Pettigrew be caught so that Voldemort takes longer to return, this would push cannon back a fairly amount of time leaving Harry with time to grow in power and skill without a threat of death consuming his very thought but still looming close enough for him to be motivated into growing his power. and can we take a moment to just appreciate how competent and fast Pettigrew is? In a single summer he tracked down and helped Voldemort get the baby-body thingie, found and kidnapped Bertha (getting information about Barty) made contact with Barty and helped plan the whole tournament with what must have been just days if not hours before term started to find out who would be the DADA professor that year and get Barty to impersonate him... in. A. Single. Summer.

Other than that, if you are open to some non-cannon compliant interpretation of magic and made-up rituals then you can have Harry be far more afraid of death considering the history of the tournament and be willing to take drastic steps to stack the odds in his favor. I am actually musing about a potential ritual that cannon-Harry could have arguably come up with by studying a bit on the threats he faces every year coupled by the whole somewhat widely accepted idea that magic has belief as a /big/ component and some bits of conjecture plus a completely made up (but not out of the realm of possibilities considering what they have in cannon) if you are interested.

** Once Harry found out that his dad and his friends completed the animagus transformation while in school, he would want to try too. Ron and Hermione would 100% be right there with him, and they would be writing Snuffles for tips/advice. It seems natural that Harry would keep in touch with Sirius/Remus, and after they hear about the numerous assassination attempts on Harry by Voldemort they would want to help Harry learn to defend himself.

Also, Harry lit his wand without touching it during the dementor attack, but it's never addressed or developed.

I'm also devastated that Harry regrowing his hair as a child didn't turn into some metamorphic talent. Introducing Tonks is a natural segue into mentioning the event to others.

** Keeping him in character, I'd say that Flitwick offers to mentor him the summer after his third year, teaching him how to duel. McGonagall may help as well, but overall, I think Flitwick would help him learn more, while Dumbledore teaches him a few things, like how he discovered Riddle, his duel with Grindelwald, and things like that

** I completely agree that JKR abandoned making Harry an actual hero by the end of book 5. But then, considering how terrible she was at writing any sort of combat (wizards stand around and shoot 'stupefy' like a 17th century army? Really?), maybe we're better off being spared whatever garbage she would have spewed.

As to your point, Voldemort has years of experience and knowledge over Harry, so his power would have to actually be 'what the Dark Lord knows not', to paraphrase. Therefore, I would have like to see something esoteric, unexpected.

Dumbledore, one of two alchemists we're ever told about in the world, could have taught Harry alchemy after 5th year, rather than just giving history lessons.

There could have been something that happened in the DoM fight that 'super-charged' Harry, or have the brains get him instead of Ron and pass on some sort of arcane knowledge.

I could go on all day. There are innumerable ways that the HP series could have actually followed a standard hero's journey, but the best JKR could come up with was Harry using 2nd year spells during a war against murdering terrorists that killed his family and friends, and lucking into a one-in-a-million chance that allowed him to survive.

The final battle was honestly the equivalent of setting the groundwork for an immense battle between hero and villain, except just as the fight begins the villain trips over his shoelaces and falls to his death. That's basically how Harry vs Voldemort played out. Pathetic.

*** I'd actually argue some of this, a bit. (Though I definitely agree with how pathetic the final battle was.) Experience in fighting is an issue, but Voldemort's breadth of knowledge isn't to nearly as much of a degree as some people like to think.

It doesn't matter how many various deadly spells you have, you only need one or two in each niche. There's really no difference if you're hit with fanon-ish Blood Boiling or Organ Expelling or whatever Curses. You die either way.

What Harry needs is combat awareness, skill in specific curses, and the ability to dodge, shield, and use the environment.

It doesn't matter if Voldemort knows a hundred curses designed to kill, if Harry can dodge or block them. You don't give a soldier a hundred weapons, you give him a few weapons designed for the situations he'll be in.

A highly trained combative Harry who knows a good amount of combat magic is more deadly than one who tries to know everything, basically.

I'd say the power he knows not would be a good thing to add to the above, though. Remember, he's Voldemort's EQUAL, allegedly. So he should be as powerful magically as Voldemort. Toss on something else.

Hell, you want to be funny, the Power He Knows Not is a freaking psychiatrist who gets Harry over the obvious issues holding him back from growing up in the Dursley home.

** I would have kept Harry relatively the same power-wise. Although I admit it would have been cool to see canon Harry progress into a magical juggernaut, I think there would have been several problems with it:

- It would have cheapened the moral of the series, since in canon, one of the major points of the books was that power, intelligence, and traits like those were less important than bravery, loyalty, and similar traits.
- It would have made readers confused on why certain people are magically stronger than others. In canon, we know that magical ability primarily depends on one's understanding of magic, so the most powerful people are all extremely intelligent and hard-working. For example, Hermione masters spells on her first few tries and masters nonverbal casting in mere minutes because of her intelligence and her studious nature. If Harry suddenly could do that (and more) without any explanation, people would wonder why.
- It would have made other characters useless, since Harry could solve everything with a wave of his wand.

*** I agree with this. The point of the entire story is that it is love is the power that Voldemort knows not. The story is compelling precisely because of the fact that Harry is a normal boy who defeated the Dark Lord by loving others and being so loved. To make him powerful /actively detracts/ from the story.

I like Harry's power levels being where there are and greatly dislike smart!motivated!Harry fics for precisely this reason. The author had deviated from the ethos of the books.

** Let his scar merge him and give him a power boost:

- You can make him more active, more cunning, more ruthless, and more strategic that way
- However, he should still maintain much of Harry's original personality. It's up to you to decide which ones to keep
- This Harry should still be much weaker than Voldemort Prime, but he will have no problem dispatching rank and file Death Eaters, including Bellatrix
- To give him more support, have Ginny absorbing Diary's power and joining him in his quest
- Merging with the Scarcrux removes him from one of Voldemort's soul anchors, so he doesn't need to die anymore. And he becomes "Dark Lord's Equal" in a literal sense

As for how to write this dark!Harry well without dipping into those garbage fanon tropes, I highly recommend using the Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and the Gryffindor Tom Riddle in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] as examples.

** I'd have sent Harry and his closest friends, maybe a group of 4-5, (Maybe add Fleur and her sister to the group? Or the patil twins?) to a parelell world for a year. Have that world be the source of Earth's magic or something, and have Ablus with a weary heart dump the children there with only a few useful items. (tent, a few books, maybe a sword) They basically end up in a wild, untamed magical world where they have to learn to hunt, fight, and kill if they want to surrvive. I'd have taken the oppertunity to either upgrade familiars (Hedwig becomes the world's most terrifying owl after hunting and consuming the heart of a pheonix/thunderbird) or get new ones, and have Harry and friends learn to take the forms of magical creature(s) after saving a dragon/gryphon/thunderbird/very, very, lost pokemon from predators or something. Basically, it's the school of hard knocks, the kids come back with new scars, new magical critters, maybe new companions, self-made magical weapons, and warrior attitudes ready to wipe out Voldemort and reform the government.

*Harry requests a meeting with Fudge, the Minister is led into the tent/portable fortress where Harry is sitting on a throne looking like conan the barbarian with Fleur/a kitsune he met on the other side/an anthromorphic magical creature of some sort on his lap/arm of his chair and Harry tells Fudge he's going to announce Voldemort is back, announce Sirius never got a trial and the Ministry has zero actual evidence against him and is therefore calling off the manhunt or Fudge is going to go the way of the evil creature/sorcerer whose skull Harry is currently drinking out of and Harry will negotiate with his successor.*

*Harry Potter and the Forge of Heroes* would either take a year in normal time or happen all at once, and maybe dump HP and group in the middle the great hall during Umbridge's speech.
