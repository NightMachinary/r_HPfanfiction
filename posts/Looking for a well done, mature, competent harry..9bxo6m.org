Hey there, i was hoping someone could recommend a good fic with a competent, mature harry. A fic with the following traits:

- powerful/ will get there eventually harry who doesn't really buy into the whole dark magic and light magic spiel. If you come at him with organ crushing hex, he will pay you in kind with a disembowlment curse fired up your nose.

- no slash or fem harry please.

- no harems as well, it was fun while it lasted but people have brained that genre to death and now it just makes me nauseous.

- selfish and independent Harry, one without his hero complex and is more interested in doing things for himself, learning magic for his own satisfaction.

- now i don't hate hermoine or Ron ( well not entirely), but i like a harry who isn't so reliant on his friends like that, sure he can be nice to them and all on occasion but that whole golden trio stuff just isn't my cup of coffee.

- no draco or nott and balise friendships.

- preferably no romamce, if there is then i would like an OC.

- A gold star if harry is into enchanting, cause i swear that's one really overlooked area of magic in hp world.

- Eh..that's all i guess, picky i know but i just like what i like.

Ps: a good example of a story like this is harry potter and the boy who lived by santi.


** The dark war epic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), seems like a good fit.

**** DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS

There are many OCs in this fic and some are extremely important:

- Elicia Eisenheim: Harry's high school girlfriend and later wife, Muggle, and personality wise quite similar to Hermione. Made several key magical-technological breakthroughs. Became estranged from Harry after the “Disaster of Brussel” and sought to actively undermine him. Supported by Neville, Sirius, James, and Lily.
- Albert Hughes: Harry's buddy from the Sandhurst Military Academy, fought in several wars at his side, and was Harry's most trusted advisor. He represented the ‘dark faction' at Harry's court and would achieve their goals with any means. He was mainly responsible for the “Disaster of Brussel”, but was reactivated by Harry to counter Elicia's maneuvering.
- Josefina: Harry and Hughes saved her from being gang raped by rogue British soldiers, became a fanatical follower and later a super spy. Responsible for hundreds of assassinations, including the hit on Draco Malfoy. Critically wounded during the “Disaster of Brussel” while protecting Elicia. Her background story was a key reason for Elicia's estrangement from Harry.
- Astoria Greengrass: Although her name is canon, her characterization is completely different from other fanfictions, including the Cursed Child. Here, she was the head of Harry's imperial guard, and another one of his fanatic followers. After the collapse of the SoS in 2009, Harry began actively recruiting Wizards for his purpose. Astoria was among the first to join him, fought many battles along side Harry, often with decisive results. Feared even by Harry's own family members.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

***** The chapters are actually pretty dense. It's a bit of a heavier read, but the traits you're looking for are definitely all there.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
