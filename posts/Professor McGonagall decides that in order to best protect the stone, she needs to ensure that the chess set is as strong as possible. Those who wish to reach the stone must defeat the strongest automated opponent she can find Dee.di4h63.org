It was very unfortunate that Professor Quirrell was unwilling to move over from Muggle Studies to DADA. Perhaps this new Professor Kasparov might last the year?


** Unfortunately for Professor McGonagall, it was in fact 1991 and DeepBlue was in early alpha and wouldn't be feature complete for 6 more years. Thus it came as no surprise to the beleaguered programmers that a first year with a vague enthusiasm for chess, managed to trounce it.

Much to Professor McGonagall's chargrin, Professor Kasparov refused to attempt to beat the challenge, saying "/that there is real chess and women's chess/." He did not return for a second year.

**** Just use [[https://www.chessprogramming.org/The_King][The King]]. It was fairly good in 1991, Quirrell would need to be around grandmaster level to take it down.

**** "Well, shit," opined Albus, taking a drag on his hand-rolled cigarillo. "Seems like you got it figured."

There was a moment's lull in the conversation, interrupted only by the Headmaster's rough coughs.

"That was... one of my /special/ ones," he hacked, looking down at the offending item. "You know, *I* made a perfect mirror prison that Voldemort would never be able to break without the aid of one who would never use the Stone for their own gain. Not to flex, or anything. Your House Elf idea is cute, too."

***** Minerva pondered this for a second. Dumbledore had a point, truly - the mirror by itself was enough of a defence. Her enchantments and the other professors were closer to theatre than to logic. Regardless, she looked him in the eye and asked, "If you're so smart, how come your crazy ex killed your sister?"

****** Dumbledore peered over the top of his moon-shaped, shuttered spectacles. His smile showed off the twinkles in his eye and his gold rims.

"He was a gay Nazi, Minerva," said Albus. "The poor guy was awfully confused."
