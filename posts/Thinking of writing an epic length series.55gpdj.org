** It's certainly not too stupid, but I wish you luck with the "epic length" part. And I mean that sincerely, I wish you luck with writing a metric shit tonne of words. It's not something I can see myself doing, for all that I like to read it.

For the subject, I think this kind of thing - comedy duo playing it straight - is generally more suited for a shorter story. It will be interesting to see how you make it work, though.
