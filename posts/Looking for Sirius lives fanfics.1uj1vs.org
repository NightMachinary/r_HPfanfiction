I'm looking for fanfics that Sirius survived during OOTP or never had been happened. It could be someone else being killed. More specifically Sirius gets involved with Harry's life more than canon.

Please no slash pairing with Harry but I don't mind slash on other/background characters like Remus/Sirius. It just not my cup of coffee.

Can be powerful, smart, darker (but not evil), sorted in other house, or whatever Harry as long it is not cliche or messy format/grammar (forgive my grammar, it is not my first language). Could be either AU or canon. At least more than 40,000 letters (perfectly 100,000 letters)

*EDIT*: I don't mind fanfics about Harry being raised by someone else/family. Harry being rescued from Dursleys or from Holloween night when old snake-face tried to kill Harry. Please not too much on hurt/comfort - I don't mind at beginning (which makes sense if rescued from Dursleys).

Many thanks!


** Harry potter and the nightmares of futures past comes to mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]

** I've got an AU rec; Innocent, by MarauderLover7. It's a WIP, but it's updated weekly. Essentially, Sirius gets out of Azkaban early, and goes to find Harry. It's very slow paced, but there's no slash and no evil and it's well written. Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

*** Just a warning: by slow-paced, he means REALLY slow-paced!! As in, they are now at chapter 75 and they haven't entered Hogwarts yet.

**** Agree. I was reading it and kept huffing and my husband asks, "you don't like the story?" I said "it is moving slower than molasses uphill in winter!" He suggests I pick a different one but...I kind of want to see where it goes...but yes, SO. FREAKING. SLOW. And agree, really wish the author would just time skip to Hogwarts. It's a pet peeve the "every single detail of pre-hogwarts au life" along with "let me describe Harry's amazing mind castle for 10,000 words"

*** I already read it, I like its story but I was forced to stop reading since it was too slow paced and I don't partially like pre-hogwarts.

Thanks though :)

** If you don't mind time-travel fics, in my Bonds of Time stories, Sirius gets released from Azkaban pretty early on, and after that has a big part in the story.

*** It is actually one of my favourite fanfics - I should read first story and its sequel again.

Thanks

** There is also the popular Dangerverse series. 4 novel-length completed fics, and one more that is a WIP and fairly long already. Sirius is out of Azkaban early, and has a very big part throughout the whole story. Mix of AU and Canon, with some important OCs.

First is here:

*** This fic is very well written and I'd recommend it to everyone, though I confess not reading the full story, as I'm not really a fan of pre-Hogwarts material.

**** The sequels which can be found on her author page are all Hogwarts stories, however, the first story I linked is pretty much essential to read, of course.

** Check out Granger Enchanted. Tons of Sirius stories (all Hermione-centric though) and the very large majority are very, very good.

#+begin_quote
  A unique visitor during the summer rewrites Harry's world and sets him on the path to Voldemort's ultimate destruction. Takes place during Order of the Phoenix.
#+end_quote

It starts in summer before 5th year and the confrontation at the DoM comes pretty much at the end, though it's way more awesome than cannon battle. IMO.

** This isn't a sirius lives fic per se, because the story turns AU after POA. Check it out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][here]] it's called A Marauder's Plan.
