Whether it is the last cookie, or a pizza, he keeps using the phrase in a trivial manner.

Feel free to post fics too.


** The war was over, but I could not settle down. Finally, I understood what Dumbledore meant all those years ago.

Of course, my new understanding didn't mean I ignored my friends - nay, I did my best to enlighten then when I could, but sadly -

"HARRY! You ate the last treacle tart again!"

-they couldn't quite grasp my meaning. Nonetheless, I had to try: for my friends, and (most importantly) for the Greater Good.

"It's... for the... Greater Good, Hermione!" I let out between bites, savoring the taste.

Around me, my friends at the table were starting at me again. No matter. With the skills of a seeker, I marked where Ginny was pouring the last bit of wine... and at the last moment, snatched the glass, quickly downing it.

Ah, a 1923 Italian red! Both Great, and Good.

Ginny moved to hex me, but I quickly adopted my most severe expression, and motioned her to hold.

"My friends - /hic/ - I have an announcementer to make," I proclaimed, gazing at them with eyes of fathomless wisdom, "this cake.... Is mine!"

With that, I quickly magicked the last bit of Teramisu to float behind me, and made for the door!

I could hear shouts behind me, but it was of no consequence.

"For the Greater Good! Yodeleleleleeee!"

Cackling, I swept through the door and into the Burrow garden, avoided the gnomes, and vaulted over the fence.

Or rather I tried to. Sadly, I tripped over a loose bit of paint, and with my quidditch reflexes, fell face first to the ground. Shortly after, the cake splattered besides me.

The pain of the fall I could take, but the loss of my most important objective.... I felt tears come to my eyes, as I realized just what I had done.

"For the greater good..." I whispered, looking at the cake. Once glorious and whole, it was now crumbled, and desecrated.

A lone tear made its way down my face, meeting the mud beneath. I felt the weight of all my years, and suddenly understood how Dumbledore must have felt.

Such is the price of the Greater Good.... For this, I must atone.

Scraping myself off the ground, i wiped my years away, and tore my gaze away from that which I had destroyed in my pursuit of Greater Good.

/From now on, I will live to atone for my mistakes!/ I mentally shouted, looking towards the heavens.

"Should we get him to St. Mungo's?" I heard a worried voice behind me. Sounded like Ron...

Poor things. They will never understand.

I must bear this burden alone;

For the Greater Good.
