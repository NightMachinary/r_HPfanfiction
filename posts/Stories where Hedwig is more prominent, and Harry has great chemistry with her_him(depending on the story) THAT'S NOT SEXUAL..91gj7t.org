Basically stories where Hedwig, and Harry act like friends, because in most stories they make it a bond, make her a Phoenix, or a number of other things. After all that though she's barely mentioned again. I want Hedwig fussing over Harry a bit, and/or Harry talking to Hedwig as if she's a person.

Also bonus points for the more character Hedwig has. Like usual the more words, the better, and completed is great.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

*** Well there are obviously those where Hedwig is either actually a human that was turned into an owl, or where Hedwig is an owl that can for some reason turn into a human. But I have seen mentions around here of the more disturbing Harry/Hedwig that you were thinking about. I don't really want to find out if they actually exist...

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.
