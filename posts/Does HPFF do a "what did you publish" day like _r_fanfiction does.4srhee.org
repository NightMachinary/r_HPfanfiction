if not, I think it'd be a good idea for those who want to promote themselves but feel spammy about submitting a new post or three.


** I so rarely upload, I probably wouldn't defile those threads with my drivel often.

But I would like to see those threads be a thing, actually. I wanna know what the community writes. Making single promotion threads for your own story seems so like spam, so making one of those could be a good thing.
