Post-Hogwarts preferrably

HarryxGinny pairing please! The setting can be anywhere, but I would love it if it were in the miniistry, or at an office or workplace of some sort.

Possessive Ginny, not Harry. Thank you!

**** Saaame !! If you generally like contrast stories with a more possessive female character vs Harry who is a bit softer I would also highly recommend

Rude to Stare Harry has always been used to staring, but recently a certain person's stare has an unusual emotion behind it. Now, if only he could figure out who it belongs to. ONESHOT
