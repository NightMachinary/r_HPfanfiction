Got this idea from 22 short Films About Springfield, from The Simpsons. (Doesn't have to be 22 short ideas, can be any amount).

They don't have to connect, they can be completed unrelated stories and have no connection.

So many characters are at Diagon Alley, owning shops and visiting the place, but they don't get talked about, could provide interesting interactions and new dynamics.

I see these as oneshots and/or drabble ideas, though if people want to go longer for some stories, that's cool too!


** The Leaky Cauldron is perfectly visible to Muggles (after all it would be odd for someone to just vanish in a crowded street) but is usually disregarded as a dingy pub. Sometimes drunk Muggles go in there and they pee on the wall that leads to the Diagon Alley and that's why the street constantly smells like urine.

Ollivander's was established by Herpo the Foul's daughter (after all Greeks were the first to mention Britain's existence in a written record in the 4th century BC, around the time of Ollivander's shop creation). The guy was not evil by nature but he liked experimenting with magic and realized that if you inserted a piece of basilisk fang in an olive branch, you could direct magic better than through your body. His daughter married a Gaul called Ollivander an decided to explore the idea. She is also responsible for introducing manticores and chimeras in the British Isles, when her farm (where she was raising them for wand cores) was set on fire by a rival and several of them escaped.

Madam Malkin is a Muggleborn who once worked for Thomas Burberry but he fired her for her unconventional ideas and she decided to start a fashion house on Diagon Alley.

Gringotts was created by a bunch of Goblins who came over a gold mine in the area before any humans inhabited the region we know as London nowadays. They took it all for themselves but agreed to lend it to Romans for an interest as they started building London. As the Roman general lead some campaigns in stealing their wealth, the Goblins added a series of protections around it.

Flourish and Blotts was started out by a drunk Muggle writer who used to be a regular at the Leaky Cauldron and one night accidentally realized that most wizards were illiterate peasants/lower class members who transferred their practice through word of mouth but often times the information would be retained incorrectly causing massive devastation. He agreed to teach wizards how to read and write and would even record their knowledge in writing which he'd make it publicly available for anyone. He was the inspiration for the Four Founders to start out a place where young witches and wizards could be taught their practices in a standardized and non-dangerous manner.

Eeyloop Owl Emporium was founded by a Roman centurion and spy who discovered that certain native owls could be trained to deliver messages to other Roman camps during their Britannia campaign. The project was cancelled after the end of the Roman campaign in Britannia but the retired centurion made a fortune by selling his trained birds to common people which at the time were faster than sending a messenger with a letter to the desired party.

Broomstix was founded by a witch who decided that brooms were ugly and uncomfortable for whoever did chores around the house. She made it a mission to develop the most comfortable brooms that would get rid of the dust with one swipe while not leaving blisters on your fingers. Later on, people discovered other practices of brooms while developing cleaning spells so the business gradually turned from a place selling brooms for sweeping to a place selling brooms for cleaning.

That's all I have for now.
