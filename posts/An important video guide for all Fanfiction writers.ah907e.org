*** It was a sarcastic exaggeration, but you have to admit you've read more about it in Fanfiction ANs than you have any tech support website.

Make backups? I can't fathom working on any kind of project on the computer that includes more than a few hours of work without any kind of backup strategy.

*** I've always thought Git would literally be the perfect tool for fanfiction writers. Especially those with Betas.

**** Sure, literally anything will work. You don't really need the versioning support of Git, but I guess it won't hurt.

***** Sure, the versioning support isn't really what I meant, though. To be completely honest, it's literally never been useful for me.

I was more talking about being able to see what changes your Betas have made without accidentally slipping formatting changes they use to /show you/ the changes they've made into the final version, or being able to comment on every change individually, and other features like that.

To be fair, though, those are entirely up to the wrappers for Git, like GitHub or GitLab or something. But for writers.

I've just perfectly described Google Docs, haven't I? Whoops. =/

*** Deathcrow I have a whole backup system for my fanfics! :) Every night I copy my whole fanfics folder onto a flash drive, then onto my sister's computer, so that I always have three up to date copies of all my stuff: flash drive, my sister's computer, and my original version on MY computer.

That way if I lose my computer somehow I'll only lose a day's worth of updated words in any situation. :)

**** 3 backups is good, but one of those copies should be in a different geographical location (aka on the internet)... just in case your house gets flooded.

****** Sure, for stuff that's really important. Like my final thesis or something like that.

Less important stuff just gets backed up locally.

******** It really depends on how much time you invest and how valuable your time is. It's not really that difficult to set up a synced dropbox folder or a remote git repository.
