  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  “Just-" He cuts himself off and takes a deep breath. “Just tell me who my father is.”“Well, technically, James Potter is still your father-"“My other father, then.”“Alright, alright, no need to get snippy.” The man shuffles through the papers in his folder before pulling one out with a beaming grin. “Here we are. Let's see. Harry James Potter, son of Lily J. and James F. Potter and... one Tom M. Riddle.” In which Harry discovers he's had another father all along (thanks to an obscure ritual his mother performed before his birth), and he isn't handling it very well.
