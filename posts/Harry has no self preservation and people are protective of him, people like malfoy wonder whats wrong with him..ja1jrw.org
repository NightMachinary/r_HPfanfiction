** Is this not canon Harry Potter

Edit: a lot of slytherin Harry fics have this though, where Harry acts too gryffindor-ish for his own good, and Draco tried to get him to be more discreet.

Not entirely sure whether these align with what you want, but some notable slytherin!harry fics I've read are: Evitative by Vichan, They Shook Hands by Dethryl

*** The only reason Harry gets to Gryffindor is because the Sorting Hat already sorted Hermione there, so there's at least a Gryffindor with an ounce of self-preservation instinct (still Gryffindor thought, so her first response to a three headed dogs is to notice what it's guarding, not turning back and run)
