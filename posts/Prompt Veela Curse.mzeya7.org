This prompt is based on ActualLyns's fic "Past an Hour, the Prospect's Black." It doesn't appear to me as if the fic will be updated anytime soon, if at all, and I loved the idea, so I wanted to put it out to see if any of you wonderful people could write a story around it.

The prompt is quite simple --- To knowingly and willing save the life of a Veela is to become one yourself. Of course, Harry doesn't know this and triggers the curse when he rescues Gabrielle during the second task. Ideally, Harry would be transformed into a girl and would still retain all of his memories from before the transformation.

Happy writing, should you choose to give this a try!

  Veela Curse played straight. To knowingly and willingly save the life of a Veela, is to become one yourself. Harry Potter saves a girl's life, and in so doing, saves the world. Starts GoF, No Bashing, Eventual Fem!Harry/Daphne Femslash
