Obviously doesn't have to be the focus, but something that makes it seem more of a wizarding /world/ instead of a community. Stuff like more magic schools in Britain, larger Houses at Hogwarts, etc.

Mainly just because it seems a little overdone to have the magical population being a few thousand, I've even read a fic where it said the global pop is 100k and it just doesn't ring right.


** linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): there are like four schools in Britain alone.

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): big enough to have not only there own secret police but multiple cities and an entire army.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

One of the main criticisms of the fic is that it does /too much/ worldbuilding.

You'll see Magical Australia, Magical Asia, and lots of mentions of wizarding history and the origins of magic itself.

** linkffn(The Harem War by Radaslab)

That one has a population that is quite large and most of them in the story seem to be related to Harry in some form or fashion. As is usual in Radaslab's stories, the population just keeps getting bigger and bigger each time he describes it. Kind of a crack fic and definitely a harem story.

** I'd say anything by Starfox5. Linkffn(The Aurors) comes to mind as well. I'll have to think of some more.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** Nepotism warning.

In my story linkffn(The Coven of Albion) the magical population is much larger, so they needed to technically integrated into the Muggle world (mostly by existing in Muggle records).
