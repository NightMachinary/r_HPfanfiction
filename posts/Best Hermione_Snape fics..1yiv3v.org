What it says on the tin - I'm looking for the best. Be it gut wrenching, dark, sad, romantic, dramatic, intellectual, or even fluffy! Just give me in character and good writing!

Edit: thanks for all the recs guys, this is awesome! I forgot to rec one myself, so if you like long, well written characters and thought out plots, then go read snarkyroxy's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2267793/1/Before-the-Dawn][Before the Dawn]] - it's fantastic.


** When you decide to take a break from the drama and angst and yearn for some kink, check out just about anything by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1317626/Ms-Figg][Ms-Figg]] - for her it's all about the consummation.

*** Oh, the uncontested smut-queen of HP fanfiction. She really has a knack for (what Jean-Jaques Russo dubbed) one-handed reading material. She actually does have some stories with actual plots that are pretty good, but seriously, she does smut far better than most others.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3814832/1/Care-of-Magical-Creatures][Care of Magical Creatures]] is a really good Marriage Law fic. It is one of my favorites, very interesting, well written, and long. 67 chapters.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]] - How do ordinary people cope with their extraordinary circumstances? A SS/HG romance that strives for realism.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2230284/1/][Unfinished Business]] - Hermione Granger dies in a potions accident during her final year at Hogwarts. She's not thrilled when she comes back as a ghost, and really not happy at the idea of spending eternity haunting Severus Snape's classroom.

** This is my ship!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6578435/1/Post-Tenebras-Lux][Post Tenebras Lux]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] both by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1807393/Loten][Loten]] are amazing. PTL is 10 years post-DH and is a very believable Snape/Hermione more mature relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374460/Aurette][Aurette]] has some good ones, especially [Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time]. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7948797/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Crystal-of-Time]])

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=89884][Teddy Radiator]] especially her story, Lay Me Low.

The Phoenix Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1760628/grangerous][Grangerous]]. This series starts with the Half-Blood Prince and follows the canon story closely until the end of DH where she branches off with her own story.

Other favorite authors:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=216][Subversa]] especially her stories This Time, and For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=4896][Little Beloved]] especially her story, Denial.

[[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=31031][Proulxes]] especially her story, Anima Mea.

There are tons more, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head! Also check out [[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][The Petulant Poetess]] and [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]] for more HG/SS stories.

Weekend with the Professor - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9160]]

Vanity - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541]]

Everything listed above is COMPLETE! Some are funny, some are serious, most all are smutty. Yet Everything Stays the Same is amazing. I'm not ashamed to say I may have cried at the end. Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if anyone is interested. I know most prefer to find completed fics, I know I do!! =)

I will add more and links when I get to work!! All of these can be found on Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com.

** On the phone so hard to link but they are on fan fiction. My latest favorite is the phoenix trilogy by grangerous. They cover the sixth, seventh, and next year in a very close to canon way (Snape lives) and are almost tortuously slow paced but very well written and believable.
