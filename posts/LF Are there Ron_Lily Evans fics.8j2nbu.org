i finished "Helping to Forget" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11175976/1/Helping-to-Forget]] its a good lemon Fic, but doesnt come to what i imagined. Well, the idea about this Pair came with me thinking about Harrys Parents (or atleast Lily) live and Voldemort dont happen, atleast not in the danger like in Canon. So Harry and Friends grow up like normal teens and students. While Ron has a Crush on Lily at some point of the Years, she gets interested (and attracted) to him when he gets to come of age, also because of his physics for Quidditch. Both are attracted to each other, she seduces him and they eventually have fun with each other. But Ron is torn apart between his Lust for Lily and the Guilt about Harry. Lily takes it more easier and tries to seduce him, whenever she gets the chance (he would also anytime give in, but is reluctant at first).

Yeah, Lily seems to be a Cougar here (havent thought about that), but it would be interesting and hot. So, does something exist out there?

It doesnt have to contain smut or Lemon scenes. I would be fine with innuendos.
