The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]], a noir-ish crime/mystery fic.

What did everyone think of RuneMaster?


** There were a lot of grammatical and spelling errors for the first few chapters, and gets a little bit better by the end.

As for the plot, Harry becomes too powerful too quickly, and the author suffers the same problem several fanfiction writers have which basically means that Harry becomes too OOC in the first 3 chapters, and the character development is completely useless. I personally don't mind OOC Harry, as long as it is justified, and I didn't see it justified here.

I like that he explored Runes in a different way and I think that it was quite fun reading that. I had many laughs while reading it because of how clich√© this fanfiction is.

The end made me cringe. That's all I have to say.

** To be honest, I never made it past the first chapter. I couldn't get into it. Too many spelling/grammatical errors, Harry seemed way OOC, Americanisms (Canadianisms?), etc.

*** I definitely agree about Harry being OOC. Harry suddenly quitting Divinations and joining runes was excusable (even though it could be handled much better) but his interaction with Fred and George was just plain ridiculous.

What made me drop this fic was the bland and uninspired writing rather than spelling/grammatical errors though. Sentences like the following annoy me to no end:

  Harry got back to Luna that evening. He was agitated. She was concerned about him.

**** The interaction with Fred and George is what made me give up on it completely.

** It was pretty bad. Cliches galore and overpowered Harry (it's fine if he's too strong - everyone likes that. The problem is the lack of a cogent explanation for it (he's good at runes, so suddenly he's a master of potions and dueling to boot?).

I say "pretty bad" in the sense that it was sub par for the top tier of fanfictions. In general, decent enough story with comprehensible structure that's not not worth a read.

Damning with faint praise, heh.

** It was ok. the bit with the goblins was the worst. The approach to runes was cool.

** Yeah, I didn't like it either. I'd tried it before and dropped it, but this time I think I got in later... and still dropped it. Not well written, Godlike Harry, just.. bad.

** I gave this fanfic a second chance, because the last time I tried to read it I didnt finish the second chapter.

From there, I was quite surprised. It didn't become my favourite fanfiction, but I enjoyed quite a bit. I like a lot the character of Daphne, not only in this fanfiction, but also the "non-canon" knowledge that the "Ice Queen" from Slytherin has become.

I've read better fanfiction, but I have also read a lot worse.

** I absolutely hated the way Runemaster was written, but I did enjoy some of the ideas in it. I liked the idea of using the pure essences, and the fact that Harry was able to do potions with them. I thought the scythe was way over the top, but ignoring the writing style and grammar, it was at least a fun 'I have nothing better to do' read. I did enjoy the ridiculousness of the epilogue, though!

I'd love to find more stories where runes play an important role.

** Runemaster was pretty fun to me. I always liked powerful/op Harry, so this was right up my alley. Too bad he never had anything he had to struggle against, but overall, just another fun fic for me.
