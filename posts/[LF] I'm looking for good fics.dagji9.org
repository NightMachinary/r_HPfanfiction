Hey everyone, I've read a bunch of HP fanfics lately and I want more but I find finding the right ones hard.

There are a few things I would like to see in the fics:\\
Ritual Based Magic, Necromancer Harry, Blood Mage Harry, Creature Harry, Demon Harry (Or maybe a contract with a demon...? Idk)

Not everything needs to be in the fic of course and things that may be similar or have different ways of magic and such are also welcomed.

What I do not want to see is Fem!Harry, I can't get myself to read such fics for some reason. Just don't like them.

I would prefer it if the fic were complete, but if it isn't I'd prefer it to have at least 70k+ words.

Thanks in Advance to the people who comment.


** Not Harry-centric but linkffn(The Arithmancer) series has a lot of ritual-based magic in the later portions. linkao3(11800899) has demons in the Harry Potter universe as well. Sorry if this isn't what you're looking for!

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

** Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) has blood magic, demons, necromancy, and animagus Harry. Very AU. There's a completed sequel and the third one in the series is unfortunately not complete. But I've reread this series several times and always like to come back to it.
