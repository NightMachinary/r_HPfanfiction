I had this idea...

We know what happened to Scar!Crux; it became/manifested as the shrivelled infant in Limbo!King's Cross. But what about the fragments of Soul from the other Horcruxes? Wouldn't they too be stuck in Limb, since Tom (the main bit) was doomed to an eternity of nothingness due to his crimes against nature?

I really want to read something like this because it would be quite humorous and ironic. Especially if Death was actually there (as a character - how many fics portray him as) and wanted to have...a few words with Ol' Tommy-Boy.

For a more serious take, perhaps something similar to how the Horcruxes appeared at the beginning of linkffn(The Darkening Of Your Soul by MaeglinYedi)

I headcanon each Horcrux to have a specific personality trait of the Main Tom. (Your Soul is literally who you are/your essence, so it would make sense for each “piece” to retain a certain aspect of Main Tom.)

-Diary would be the angsty teen with both mummy and daddy issues and an ongoing identity crisis. His Charmer-Facade would be at its prime.

-Ring represents heritage. He would be a lost child in denial about his family. He'd also be the sorrowful/morose one due to the Resurrection Stone's influence.

-Locket, like in DH, would be the seductive and manipulative young adult.

-Cup would most likely be the patient, organised adult...He'd also have a sweet-tooth.

-Diadem would be the witty, sarcastic yet logical schemer who would often claim superiority over the others due to his immense knowledge/memory.

-Nagini would be the obedient one with unfortunate yet severe Separation Anxiety. It's definitely twisted due to her nature as a Maledictus.

-Scar would be the voice of reason. Taking on the form of Harry James Potter himself, he'd constantly have the “I told you so” look plastered on his face.

-And Voldy-Central? THE Tom Marvolo Riddle? ...Well...He'd be a confused mess.

Yeah...It would be VERY interesting to see how they all interact with each other.

So, anyone willing to write this/know of any other fics?


** This is very interesting and I also head canon that each piece of soul has a personality trait from main Tom! I see each piece of Tom's soul as a quality he deliberately rejected, a trait he chose to separate himself from. That is part of what makes Horcruxes so terrible- you have to give up some of your personality and humanity to make it- but Tom might have seen that as a bonus because he could strip himself of the qualities he sees as ‘weak'. The ring could hold his longing for a family, the cup could represent his want for material desires. As he keeps making the Horcuxes they each hold more and more of the things that makes him human: the need to sleep, the need for warmth, companionship, touch.

Maybe the very first thing he stripped away from himself was his capacity to love. He always said that love is a weakness so it makes sense he would strive to rid himself of that weakness. I think the Diary would hold that.

*** YES. I totally agree. This is something I wish was explored more in the series - how a Horcrux can strip away one's humanity. It definitely seems to be the reason why Voldemort turned out as the insane, psychotic, megalomaniac. It's also very unnerving when you think about it...The lengths he would go to.

I think the Diary represents youth, so it also barring Tom's compassion/love would make sense. When you think about it, the Diary worked by possessing someone who poured their Heart and Soul into it. I guess It's symbolic of how a Horcrux can twist even the most purest of things-Love.

  Harry is betrayed. Harry gets a second chance to do it all over again. There is just one catch. If Harry gets to keep his memories from his previous life, so does Voldemort. Harry Potter/Tom Riddle.

** I find this idea really intriguing, that the scarcrux is a baby because it was shot at a baby, and the other magical objects would effect the horcrux is so interesting!

*** Well first of all. Harry wasn't a baby. He was a toddler. The scarcrux is meant to symbolize Voldemort's impotence. He is a flayed baby throughout GoF as well. It merely indicates that he is no more than a chunk, a conscious piece of meat ripped out from the original.
