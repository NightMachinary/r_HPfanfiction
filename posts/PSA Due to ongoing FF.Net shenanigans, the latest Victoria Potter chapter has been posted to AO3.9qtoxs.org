** I think more than any other story this one captures the feeling I had when I first read Harry Potter and wanted to live in that world. I know there's been some criticism that the beginning is a little slow and that it's too much the author's headcanon document as a story but to be honest the world-building is top-notch and that's all it really needs so far.

Great work Taure and I hope to see many more chapters of this awesome story!

** Will you upload the chapter back on FF.net after the shenanigans are over?

*** Probably before they are over, as I expect they will continue for months. But I'll wait a few days to see if FF.Net surprise us all and fix it.

Edit: uploaded to FF.Net. Reading up on the problem, it seems that it is okay to be logged in, so long as you don't visit any user profiles.

** Thanks for the update. I haven't touched FFN since yesterday. Waiting for this crap to be settled. What's with the downvotes though?
