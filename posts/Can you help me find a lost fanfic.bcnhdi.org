The basics: Harry is adopted by Lucius Malfoy via magical contract.

Scene that was definitely in it: Harry fucks up and Lucius needs to punish him but doesn't want to so he sits and reads the entire contract looking for the minimum punishment before settling on spanking harry. afterwards harry cries. not because of the spanking god knows he's use to abuse but because he couldn't process it.

Scene that I'm pretty sure was in it.: Lucius Draco and harry all go out to pick strawberries in a field and they have a good time. then harry makes crapes with them and tries to short himself so they have more.

this one i'm less sure about: harry and a few friends go out to a sports bar that's like a fusion of muggle and magic.

not that much to go on I know, but that's all I got.

  Harry finally gets tired of being mistreated by the Dursley's and his complaints ignored or dismissed by the faculty of Hogwarts so he runs away. He learns a lot on the streets and in the world he falls into.

**** Haha yeah, I know for a fact it's what you're looking for. You may have had more luck finding it sooner if you had asked via [[/r/Hpslashfic][r/Hpslashfic]] just for future ref
