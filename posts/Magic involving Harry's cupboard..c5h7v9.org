Harry's cupboard and magic. Could be anything, it takes him somewhere, transforms into something. Is really a tardis... anything really.


** Or it could be like a portal into an otherworld like the Poltergeist film. Omg can someone write a fic where the Dursleys are terrorised by a poltergist during Harry's Hogwarts years or maybe one moves in after the Duraleys return back after the war. hahaha.

*** That would be fantastic. Especially if it was serious and written with no humor.

**** I will probs write it near the year's end when I have more time on my hands. I'll pm you. So premise will take place 5 years after the battle, but the Dursleys noticed something bizaare in the cupboard on return to their house and boarded it up. 5 years on, something happens, and Dudley is stuck in a trance and possesed. Harry, an Auror is involved along with somone from the magical beings department, and in the end a few Unspeakables would have to get involved to solve the horror within.

  All Harry Potter, age five, wanted was to be part of a loving family. Can one desperate wish, a little wild magic, and one Ash Ketchum give him what he wants? Story is AU, No pairings, Evil!Dumbledore. Story Edited 12/14/12 w/ minor changes & new omake. Story is still COMPLETE.

** I remember reading a fanfic a while ago where it was normal for powerful wizarding children to create via accidental magic expanded spaces in their wardrobe. Therefore Dumbledore saw Harry living in the cupboard under the stairs as normal even though the dursleys did not put him there it out love.

** Core threads has Harry expanding his cupboard on accident but I think thats about it as far as the cupboard is concerned.

It might not be for everyone as it is a massively OP!Harry fic, but I love it for it's riddikulusness.

I recommend giving it a shot. :D

  Complete. AU. Post-GoF. During his cleaning chores for Aunt Petunia, Harry is sent to clean out the cupboard under the stairs and after Dudley locks him in, he discovers something very odd in the wall that vaults him into another dimension.
