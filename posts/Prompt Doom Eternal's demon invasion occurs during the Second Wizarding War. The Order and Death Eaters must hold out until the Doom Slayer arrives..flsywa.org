Title.


** This would depend on exactly when the invasion takes place, how long they have to keep the demons at bay, how large of an area they have to protect and how easily the Order, the Death Eaters and the Ministry can get along. It also depends on exactly what demons they have to take on as well as muggle intervention.

Let us say the demons are only after the wizards and therefore muggles are not going to intervene. Let us also set the stage in OotP just before the OWL's takes place. That will give all the factions access to most of their strongest fighters. The wizarding world decides to make their stand at Hogwarts. It is said that the population of British Wizarding World is 3000 (too low I know) and they can certainly fit into the school.

After that Flitwick would likely put up Protego Horribis or Protego Maxima, Repello Inimicum and Fianto Duri. Presumably Dumbledore, Voldemort and others will also put up their protections as well. This will make Hogwarts even more fortified than it was during the Battle of Hogwarts. Now we have to decide how Hell energy interacts with some of the strongest shields and charms in place. I think they can break the barrier but it should take days of constant bombardment to down it. Any demon that tries to cross the would disintegrate.

Now that they are not immediately going to get swarmed they will start likely start mass producing statues or golems. Many students should be able to help on this task as inanimate transfiguration is relatively low level. This will give Hogwarts a large army to mobilize when the barrier is breached.

The thing that would also help the wizards by setting the invasion in this period is that they would have a stable Magical Law Enforcement without any recent deaths that would weaken the chain of command. The aurors who are not in fighting shape or retired would start training the civilians and kids so they could defend themselves when the time comes.

The St Mungos members would start brewing up potions to help with healing and start training volunteers. House Elves would be good way to keep the supply of ingredients and food steady.

With access to the room of requirements as the secret passages would likely be blocked to keep the demons out (if not extra ways to get out) a team can leave Hogwarts without alerting the demons. The team with brooms and invisibility cloaks or disillusionment charms would allow them to wreck havoc on the demons.

Now arises the question of how combat would work. The killing curse should work on all demons. And most of the demons are too slow to dodge the spells as well. This will make it easier for the strike team to rain down hell (oh the irony) on Hell Razers, Summoners, Revenants and Mancubus who are essentially the only danger to the barrier. Wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort would take out dozens of them at once.

The demons would not be able to counter them properly as even though theyhave access to revenant they usually use the jet packs for mobility instead of sustained flight and it will be really difficult to shoot someone down who is flying in the cover of the night with invisibility.

Most of the standard spells should work well enough on demons. It would be interesting to see if the expelliarmus would rip the Mancubus arms off.

So if the wizards play all their cards right they should be able to hold off an invasion from hell.

**** Exactly when during the battle? Before the start of the fighting or in the reprieve of 1 hour that Voldemort gave them?
