** The cursed taboo that allows the Snatchers to find the Golden Trio in the woods is not placed into effect until much after Dumbledore's death, so, no, he was not trying to get people secretly killed.

Then why did individuals fear the name before that?

**** I think it's simple. Voldemort killed indiscriminately, often, and always left his mark. It's like what Mr. Weasley (I think?) said: you never knew if you were going to come home to the mark being over your house. The government couldn't stop him and was in fact, already in his pocket. Wizard and witches were under the imperious and it wasn't as easy to notice as so many fan fics try to make it seem with people's "blank stare". So you never knew if you were talking to an imperioused individual, a death eater, or just your normal friend.

I think it's important to realize Death Eaters thought that very few were worthy to speak the Dark Lords name and it was offensive to them when Harry used it. I think this furthered the issue before the taboo since a person was likely killed or had their family killed for disrespecting the Death Eaters.

**** In one of the life of Snape fics, I forget which, Death Eaters themselves spread the fear because saying the name made their Mark twinge.

I could see that being the case. Since I don't think he was in charge of the Ministry during the first war, there wasn't a taboo, it's more like a combination of Death Eater fear-mongering, superstitions, hysteria, and paranoia. It's quite possible people spread rumors of some kind of taboo.

Why did he encourage people to say it? Well, Voldemort had been vanquished. To stay afraid, even when most believed him dead, was silly. To stay so afraid, crippled the Wizarding world once he did return.

What I want to know is, what is the Taboo usually used for? What is Taboo'd? Ignoring that it's basically taboo ex machina, I would think that the unforgivables would be taboos. If that were really the case, it wouldn't be long before the incantations became less widely known, since you couldn't talk about Avada Kedavra or Crucio without Aurors turning up.

**** Because he had the taboo in effect before his defeat. His death eaters would kill anyone who spoke his name without fear

So if Voldemort was defeated a day before Dumbledore made the statement, and Dumbledore said that he has been telling people to call him by his proper name for a while. Doesn't that mean he was doing so with full consciousness of the fact that it was Taboo'd?

****** Depends, when did he say it?

Also, the taboo spell/machine may have been thought up after that statement was made

I think this is the more likely statement considering he said it in the first chapter of Philosopher's Stone.

** Is a play on the non-magical idea that fear of a thing gives it power. If nobody feared saying it, the taboo would have no power.
