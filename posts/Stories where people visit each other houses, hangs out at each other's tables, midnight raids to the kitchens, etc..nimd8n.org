** Linkao3(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) Gets into this. Maintains an entertaining distance from the Trio. Focuses instead on the castle and characters from across houses. Lots of exploration, fan clubs, sleepover dares, petty conflicts and other highlights of boarding school life.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.
