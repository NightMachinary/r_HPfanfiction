Where he does not passively take her bossiness. Essentially how Dumbledore describes her in Rise of the Wizards. Bonus points if her questionably unethical actions from canon are questioned. No slash and nothing extreme. Bonus points for McGonagall being called out as a bad administrator.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]]

It's a complete series that starts the summer after 1st year. Harry prays to Loki who shows up and gives him the motivation to stand up for himself. Hermione and others take a while to realize they can't just steamroll over Harry any more so it leads to some bashing, but eventually people get used to Harry. The slash tag is for minor characters (I think Seamus).

**** It's just a popular piece (make of that what you will). Since the OP didn't specify they were looking for a particular fic, general suggestions seemed to be welcome. And I did specify that it only fulfilled the bonus points

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
