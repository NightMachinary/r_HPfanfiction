***** It's a series, though, the first two stories in it are complete. That author has been writing it since 2004 and they published a chapter... last year... I wouldn't count out their getting a burst of inspiration and finishing it someday.

****** I know the story fairly well, along with the author, I don't see them giving up. I am certain that aspen will finish it, but when is another matter.

** If it's not AYLNO then it might be Walk the Shadows by jharad17 on FFN. I haven't read it in a few years but it sounds about right. MUCH darker though.
