I am 23 years old. From the time I entered 3rd grade I was bullied maliciously and made to feel like an outsider. I was completely isolated and overwhelmingly alone; Harry Potter was my one light in the dark. I read the books until the pages fell from the spine, until the covers of the book struggled to hold its contents. I pored over the books relentlessly, diving into the only world where I felt like an outsider could be understood.

When the series was completed, I turned to HPFF. I sought more comfort in these new, brazen outcasts that could show me that there was some alternate, not completely unreachable world where those who were tormented could be strong. I sifted through thousands of stories. Some were great and some were akin to My Immortal, but each one offered me comfort.

I've read an extensive amount of incredible fan fictions that were still in progress at the time of the shutdown. As the difficulty of my college courses had increased, I wasn't able to read all of the stories I had wanted to. I wasn't able to re-read my favorites or stash them away for a rainy day.

I know HPFF was not the only fan fiction site but it was the first I encountered; it was my favorite and it granted me refuge. It saved my life. I saw something once that said that it's okay if your reason to not die is something small that makes you happy. Harry Potter and HPFF gave me a reason when I didn't have any. It gave me an escape, it gave me a community, but most importantly, it gave me hope. Though the stories are fiction, their messages of hope gave me something to hold onto.

R.I.P. to my favorite refuge and the one place I really need right now.

I apologize for the long, sappy post. I wanted to read one of my favorites tonight to help me through a struggle and I found that my favorite escape finally shut down. If anyone has any archives or has a recommendation for another site, please post them here.


** If you were a part of HPFF, you will be welcomed with open arms at HPFanFicTalk.com

The majority of the community there is made up of people who left HPFF around the time the site forums were shut down. You might even find a few old friends.

All the best to you. I hope you continue to find that light that helps you go on.

*** Thank you!!! Happy that parts of the community and some of the stories remained. Only sad that some of the ones that I was interested in are left unfinished.

** I use [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works][An Archive of Our Own]]. A lot of authors are there, so you might find some of those favorite gems. Don't forget about the classic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/][FanFiction.Net]]. If you're a Snape/Hermione shipper like me (it's my OTP), there's [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php][Ashwinder]]. They are hosted by [[http://sycophanthex.com][Sycophant Hex]] which is another fan fiction archive.

I completely, completely get how you feel. These sites have a lot of great stories that keep me going. I swear if I read "real books" instead of fan fiction I would have completed so many of my to-read books, but I just can't stop.

** I'll miss the old, fragmented internet. HPFF was the first place I read Gabilian's two Year 7 fics (A Serpent's Sacrifice and The Bottom of the Lake), which got me back into fanfic after the end of the series. Lots of fond memories there.

** You say that it was a small thing? A little reason? There is no such thing as a small, little reason. You say that the world of harry potter and its fanfiction is comforting, but nonetheless not real? It is not so. Here is why, and (hopefully) it will help inspire in others the hope that the work of JK Rowling inspired in you.

The world of fiction is no less real than ours, in this the real world where our senses can be confused, altered, or even taken away, where the laws of reason and science are as ever changing as if they were water in a stream, it is the life if emotion that defines what is real and what is false. The feeling, the emotion, the LIFE, that can be found in these communities, in these books, in these stories. That is real, as real as you and I reading this now. There is no such such thing as a reason too little a hope too small. The struggles, the dreams, the things concieved and concealed within our minds, they are all real. As real as the physical world. Everything from movies, to books, to videogames, to our little daydream fantasies of a better world. All of this is real. "For in dreams we enter a world entirely our own" and if our world is defined as real by the feelings it creates, then who is to say that these stories are not real too?

We mourn the passing of a great repository of fanfiction yes, but that does not mean it is gone. While there are many who have preserved and archived the stories that is not what I mean. These fictions and their authors have painted a world entirely their own, and shown us a glimpse of what that world is like through the written word. Which has in turned created new worlds, new stories, new possibilities in our own minds. Some of these worlds may be very similar, some may share only their roots. But one thing connects them all, they are all real. And they will live on to inspire others to make their own worlds for as long as they are remembered. Now we need only remember, and the world of HarryPotterFanFiction.com will continue still more.

As Dumbledore said (paraphrase); "Death is not the end, it just the next great adventure"
