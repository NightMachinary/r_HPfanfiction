***** Pinhead Percy the Pencil-Pusher is slower than a Horclump and clumsy to boot. He trips over his own feet and breaks his nose and his glasses and knocks out his two front teeth.

Charlie hurts himself laughing so hard.

*** Isn't Percy a really talented wizard though? Percy probably has more of a chance of beating up Charlie than the other way around.

**** Charlie's a /Dragon Handler,/ so that's got to be plenty tough. And we never actually see Percy fight until the Battle of Hogwarts, where to be fair, he does jinx the Minister of Magic.

Eh...I'd say it's a toss-up.

** Percy gets lost and bumps into Charlie who gives him a piece of his mind about what he did to their family. He is scared Charlie's going to hit him but his brother just lets him go and grunts in the direction he needs to go to get back.

Percy regains his composure and struts away, feeling good about he handled the situation. Until he walks through the door Charlie pointed to. Where a family of Hungarian Horntails are kept.
