Thanks!


** Chained.

I'm obsessed with this fic. Basically, Harry and Teddy are thrown back into the late 70s, where they're captured by Voldemort. Harry has to hide his identity, but he's forced by Voldemort to become a Death Eater to save Teddy's life. Really great writing, good worldbuilding into what life at the Death Eater compound must have been like at the height of Voldemort's power. Teddy is written like a normal child. It has some stupid tropy things like Potter Manor, but otherwise I love it

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he is immediately captured by Voldemort. After many months of posing as a loyal Death Eater, he is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue. (Post-Canon, ignores epilogue)

** There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680][into the arena with your head held high]], in a dystopian future, Harry and Teddy is thrown back in time to the resurrection of Voldemort during GoF. I've only read the first chapter, it has a great action scene. The characterization is good so far, and if you look at LullabyKneel's other fanfiction then I don't think it will be a problem.

Edit: I think Teddy was 11 in this fic, so you don't really found cute!Teddy. Harry-Teddy interaction is good, but I won't call it cute.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

** JacobApples has a few stories that would qualify. I reread The Disorder of the Phoenix recently linkffn(12813755). It is enjoyable and hits those notes with a seven year old Teddy (though fair warning neither Remus nor Albus come out looking particularly rosy by the end of the piece.

 

Laughing All The Way to London is in progress and also has interesting plot hooks (and a younger Teddy). Though it is not a story for those hoping for a redemption of Peter Pettigrew linkffn(13173587)
