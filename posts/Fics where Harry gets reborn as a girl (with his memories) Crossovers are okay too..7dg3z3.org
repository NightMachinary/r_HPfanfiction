  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

*** He got all pissy when FF.net made him change the title, but honestly he should have just used that "fate's chewtoy" bit from the summary in the first place.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Being reborn in the past was something, however, being reborn as his late professor's elder sister, well, that's just asking for trouble, you know, being Harry bloody Potter and his dumb luck. Fem!Harry Potter, Time-travel.
