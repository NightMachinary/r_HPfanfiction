Honestly never been more devastated. I was loving it, it's an excellent read and the story and plot are superb. That said it's incomplete and I just realised now. I am truly devastated and would welcome any recommendations to fics like it. Preferably fem Harry in slytherin. Something to replace it.


** Rather than recommend fics which are superficially similar in content (e.g. fem!Harry in Slytherin) which hopefully other people can recommend, I thought it might be interesting to recommend the various inspirations behind VP.

This story is a great example (probably /the/ primary example) of a fic which tracks the magical development of someone who has a lot of magical talent. Very "slice of life".

Newcomb and I used to have long, long discussions on IRC, ranging from magical theory to bouncing fic ideas off each other. Our thinking on HP is 95% aligned.

Of all the stories in the fandom, WYLB will be the closest thing you can find to VP in terms of its depiction of magic. It also features a magically talented Harry and depicts his progression towards greatness.

Probably my favourite fic in the fandom, notwithstanding its flaws. The depiction of Knockturn Alley is so vivid, and the way the fic expands on Dark magic is fascinating (albeit in need of balancing).

This fic inspires VP in 3 main ways: in its loving attention to the detail in depicting the life of a location and all the people who use it; in its "little magic" (which is the tonal inspiration behind a lot of Victoria's wandless magic); and in its depiction of dark magic, which partially inspired deep magic in VP.

There is a specific scene in this fic which has stuck with me: the image of Harry navigating Hogwarts' rooftops, which lead to his secret room. It had never occured to me to even think about what was going on on top of the roof before.

For many years that scene has inspired my approach to depicting Hogwarts - firstly, to think outside the box; secondly, to always be adding more areas, unique in character but grounded in the functional reality of the castle.

And finally...

*** WYLB is also one of my all-time favorite fanfics. I was very disappointed that it was discontinued.
