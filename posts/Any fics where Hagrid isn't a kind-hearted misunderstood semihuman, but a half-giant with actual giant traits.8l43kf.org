Besides the obvious size, there is nothing about Hagrid that could point to him having a non-human parent. If there was a person who was half-lemur, they'd have some obvious differences besides looks. Same deal with half-giant Hagrid.


** Giants aren't animals, though. The ragtag tribe of Giants who survive in the present-day may be at caveman levels, but they are fully sapient hominids on par with /Homo Sapiens/, and, indeed, were likely /evolved/ from wizards in the first place.

*** I wonder why Giants didn't thrive. I doubt even Homo sapiens would fight themselves to extinction. I know humans fight amongst themselves but they tend to band together when faced with an enemy, right? I wonder why Giants didn't band together.

**** They were inbred as Guants, which diminished their self-preservation instincts which were not very strong to begin with.

** Is nothing sacred? :p whenever I come across Mean!Hagrid in fics (usually bashing ones) I'm always a little distraught XD

*** Mean Hagrid is always weird to see. I'm looking for something like 10,000 BC Hagrid, or Quick to Anger Hagrid, or Hagrid With Strange Customs.

But Mean Hagrid? It's weird. TBH he's my favorite character, and meanness isn't really becoming on him.

**** Hagger & Grawpy would be a great double act to see more of!

What sort of Strange Customs? I'm curious :)

***** For example, in respect for his people's culinary traditions, Hagrid would never use flour but only ground bones to make his bread. Or maybe he only speaks in rhymes and nonsense words, like "fee fi fo fum" or something.

I don't know. If I knew, I'd probably write this.

** Half-giant...a human but also a giant...I feel like there's an innuendo to be made here, possibly including a codpiece with an Undetectable Extension Charm.
