Is there really a physical personification of Death in the Harry Potter world or were the Peverell Brothers just /really/ good magical artificers?


** Interpretation is dependent on the nature of the fic. I only like the Hallows as gifts from Death if that is a major factor in the plot of the fic. Like, in canon, it really doesn't matter much either way, so it's better for them to just be artifacts.

I do like the idea of the Hallows being cursed though, regardless of their origin, and there is an interpretation I like that I don't think I've seen much of before. The idea that "Death" was a powerful Dark Lord/Enchanter that was defeated by the Peverell brothers. After his defeat they either took the Hallows as spoils, or demanded that the Dark Lord create them powerful artifacts as recompense for sparing his life. Each of them came with it's own curse though, through which the enchanter had his revenge.

*** I like this idea with the caveat that the being they "met" was actually their own father. A powerful immortal sorcerer who made the Hallows and was the inspiration for the grim reaper. They stole his artifacts of power, thus rendering him mortal, and slew him. The curses on the artifacts were tied to how much of a part each brother played in the treachery.

Antioch actually dealt the killing blow, so the Wand always seeks to get its master killed in combat. Cadmus talked him into lowering his guard that he might be killed, so the Stone seeks to make its master vulnerable to the whispers of the dead and be easily convinced to take their own life. Ignotus was the one who slipped in and took the artifacts, so the owner of the Cloak will always be killed by the treachery of a loved one. Only uniting the Hallows can break the curses on them (and their power), and finally allow all the previous victims peace.

*** Reminds me of Stepping Back. The Peverell's summoned Death for help against a Dark Lord. They made a deal, and didn't honor all of it. Death was ticked.

** The best interpretation I've ever read was that they were both, and also neither.

  'So they were not made by Death or the Peverells?' Harry inquired.

  'I doubt they were made by the Peverells,' Dumbledore agreed mildly, 'the family came from Rome, likely bringing them with them, and later adopted the mark, but they are far older. I believe they are aspects of death, created as the oldest spells once were by simple emotion, and understanding. Since their creation they have been explained away by many stories, claimed by wizard after wizard, until the truth has become indistinguishable from death.'

  'I do not understand,' Harry admitted.

  'The cloak, invisible, intangible, undetectable and unstoppable,' Dumbledore began, 'just as death is. The stone, the lingering sorrow and regret that it imparts upon those who have lost loved ones to it. The wand, the ability to strike down any with impunity, just as death does.'

  'So they are death.'

The idea being that the Hallows are not simply artifacts made by mind and hand, nor are they gifts from some all powerful entity, but rather they are a physical manifestation of the /idea/ of death, shaped and brought into being by the thoughts, powers, and emotions of wizards. Refined into their three roles as the different aspects of death over the course of millennia by the thougts of those that feared death.

They were not crafted nor were they given, rather they were brought into being by the very ones who feared them.

** If Death was a being, it's hard to imagine that he would care so much about the Peverell Brothers avoiding their deaths in such a bland way. Surely tons of people avoid potentially deadly situations every day. Did everyone who was petrified by the basilisk get a "prize" from Death? Does he come to tempt everyone who looks both ways before crossing the street?

Now obviously the actual story could have been corrupted and simplified over the years. But I think it is much more likely that the brothers made the Hallows themselves, or possibly got them from another skilled artificer, and the stoey was made up to add to their own legend.

But I do enjoy when Death makes an appearance in a fanfic, so I am happy to believe that the story was completely true.

** Of course they were artifacts, very powerful ones though.

The Tales of Beedle the Bard is just their version of Grimm's Fairytale.

*** Not for canon. More for story-writing I suppose. Some fanfics portray the Hallows as literal gifts from Death that bestow immortality, whereas other fics do treat them as artifacts.

** Dumbledore says Peverells in DH. Also the existence of an anthropomorphic Death (or any other kind of deity) would clash horribly with the HP magic system which is extremely unspiritual in nature.

** I suppose you could say there is but there isn't.

We know that the afterlife does exist in canon. We also know that the Hallows were almost god-given in their magical power. We also know there's a famous children's story about the Brothers and Death. There's a nugget of truth in every story.

The Elder Wand is so powerful, yet cursed with Death. The Resurrection Stone is so enticing with the promise of seeing our loved one's again, yet the price is Insanity and, later, Death. The Cloak, however, isn't cursed. Not really, at least. You always end up dying, but this Hallow has it on your own terms. So I guess you could say that they all seem cursed with Death, something I doubt they would've--could've--done on their own. This leads me to believe in the story, the existence of a personified Death. Thanatos on Earth, if you will.

Yet one could also claim this is preposterous, completely ridiculous. Imposible. This person's atheistic view, always fascinates me. How could one be so...how many red pills did this person take?

But either way, the story stays the same. Three brothers came into the possession of incredible artifacts which sealed their ow fate, for better or worse. One died from greed, one from love, and the other greeted Death as an old friend; I suppose you could say these represent other characters such as Snape, Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, even James Potter. But that's a story for another time.

** I like to think of them as artifacts with a mysterious past. When no one knows where something comes from, the stories they create are often quite interesting. And, it seems very unlikely there's a physical personification of Death in the Wizarding World.

** I prefer the theory they were incredibly powerful wizards who each created their artifact for their own reasons. First brother made the wand to dominate his peers. Second brother made the stone to resurrect a lost love. Third brother made the cloak to spy on people or maybe to escape debts, could be multitude of reasons for the last one. The story with Death is very obviously just a children's tale to teach right from wrong.

** My personal favorite idea is that the peverall brothers sacrificed many many many people to make the artifacts so they are sort of “gifts from death”
