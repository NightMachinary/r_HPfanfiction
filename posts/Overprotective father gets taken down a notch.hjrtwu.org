I find this "overprotective father" character type highly annoying and maybe even a bit creepy, being devoted to the protection of their daughter's virginity to an almost incesteous degree and reminding me of the attitude of an honor killer.

The +droids+ story I'm looking for should contain one or more of the following plot elements:

- His wife and/or daughter shuts him down. Hard.
- Harry scoffs in his mind at a guy threatening him when he killed a Dark Lord and other dark wizards.
- Harry scoffs at him to his face.
- Harry threatens him with retaliation.
- Harry uses violence as a reaction to the threat.


** While I do think that the "overprotective father" trope is misogynistic and tired, I don't particularly think that Harry peacocking about his own accomplishments, making threats, or being violent about it is a subversion of the trope. That really just reinforces the ideas that men should be territorial of women's bodies and must -- like animals -- fight each other for the "right" to have her, and that a woman is unable to make her own choices in a romantic/sexual context without the approval of the men in her life.

A father threatening his daughters potential lover is a father being protective of his daughter, Moms do it too just not as often as far as i've seen. This isn't about "you have the right to my daughter" or not this is saying "you treat her with the respect she fucking deserves or you answer to me." both parents tend to do it but a Fathers are shown in media doing it because the role of protector is what Fathers and Men are stereo typically shown as having though that is changing as time goes on. My mom fuckin threatened one of my girlfriends once saying something along the lines of "you break his heart and I will destroy you" ignoring the fact that the girl she was threatening was 5'2 and I at the time was 5'10 and weighed like 100 pounds more than said girl. She didn't do it because she was worried for my safety she did it because I'm her baby boy and she didn't want to see me hurt.

Same reasoning applies to Dads and their daughters, except with your daughter if they are dating a male their is a very VERY real possibility that the wrong person will cause physical harm to your daughter, their is that fear there that your daughter might come home with a black eye or worse from the wrong lover, so as a father you cut out the possibility and lay down the law letting whoever dates your daughter know that anything they might even think of doing to her will be answered back 100 times over on them. It isn't Misogynistic it is a show of love for your child and a show of force to anyone who dares to THINK about laying a hand on them. Yes your daughter might be able to care for herself, Yes you may have taken her out to buy that pistol so she could protect herself, but she is still your child, your daughter and your little girl and you would rather take the harm yourself than see anything befall her, that isn't "impeding" on her rights, that's you protecting your child from harm like a good parent should.

**** Do you actually want an answer to your question about how this is misogynistic? If so, here's an answer.

It's unfortunately common for parents to be overprotective of their daughters: locking them inside, controlling what they wear because certain clothes mean they're ‚Äúasking for it,‚Äù threatening anyone they might be interested in dating, etc.

At the same time, these parents tend to give their sons free rein, not locking them inside etc to prevent them from harming other parents' daughters. When they do cause harm to someone else's daughter, they'll claim it's because the girl was ‚Äúasking for it,‚Äù by wearing that or daring to set foot outside, and what did she expect, anyway? Boys will be boys. They've raised their boys to consider girls to be prey, property that has to be protected or it will be stolen by some other man the moment it's left unattended. Do you see the problem?

See theirs a difference between that, and taking five minutes to tell the daughters boyfriend "Treat My Daughter with the respect she deserves"

And people who don't do the same for their sons are idiots

So i agree with you that shit is dumb.

As a male I'm going to disagree here but I also know that different cultures and different families raise their sons differently. My mother and father made sure to teach me how to treat a lady (or in my brothers case since he's about as straight as a roundabout) Significant other, You aren't supposed to treat your boyfriend or girlfriend like property you treat them like an Equal partner, and you treat them like you yourself want to be treated, if not better. People who raise their sons to believe that they are the owners of their girlfriends are the kind of people that I would be sitting down and giving the "hurt my daughter" speech too.

**** Their concern for their child is not misogynistic, but rather the extraneous reasons they go about it. After all, this all assumes that daughters are fragile & unable to think critically about who they choose to date. It assumes every daughter is naive & cannot sense danger. And in fact, every overbearing parent denies the agency of their children. "Concern" is justified, but to be labeled "overbearing" goes beyond reasonable levels of concern.

To be overbearing is to exhibit controlling, aggressive behavior, and rarely is this trope portrayed with a mother as the aggressor. You barely see any parent threaten their son's /girlfriends/. Men can also be abused by women, but the trope isn't about that. The problem is it assumes that sons are naturally stronger than daughters. That they will realize the situation on their own, and save themselves from an abusive relationship, but a daughter is seen as weak & foolish, and must be shielded from her own silly choices. That basically, she needs another man to intervene in her personal romantic relationships without her consent.

So yeah. It's pretty misogynistic.

** Is this trope an American thing? I'm a Brit and I've never heard of it outside of the internet.

Granted like the stereotypical Redditor my romantic/sexual history is erring on the side of non existent, but I've had female friends with boyfriends, friends with sisters, and male friends with girlfriends and I've never heard any of them giving or receiving the "shovel talk", or whatever this is called.

** So...if a father tells his child's bf/gf "Hurt her/him and I break your hands" The proper response is for the bf/gf to physically harm the father? The father is acting overprotective to enforce on his kids potential lover that the person they are dating isn't just some person to fuck and leave, or someone to mess with, that is their child and you will treat their child with respect that is due to them or you will be removed from the picture.

I don't get what the issue is. If anything the Wife should be supporting her husband in wanting to make sure the boyfriend/girlfriend understands the boundaries set in place by the parents, and the Child should get that her parents aren't doing this to ruin his/her fun but to fucking protect them because GASP their parents have lived through that shit before.

Harry scoffing, threatening or even going through with an act of violence is Harry showing that he is A. Proving the Parents (Or father in this case) Right about him not being a suitable person for his daughter/son and B. Illegal you don't just deck someone for saying "Hey you fuckin hurt my daughter and I will hurt you." The Correct response is to prove the parents wrong through your actions not your fists and to just nod and say "Yes sir" and take your bf/gf out on a date and have a good time not antagonize your HOPEFULLY FUTURE IN LAWS.

Jesus Christ

Edit: ALSO it's not just Dads that can be overprotective I've seen plenty of overprotective moms as well (My Girlfriends mom is one) and they can be just as threatening if not more threatening than Dads. Molly "I Killed Bellatrix Lestrange" Weasley is an overprotective mom and she's a fucking sweetheart no matter what the character bashing people like to do to her says.

**** Like straight up I already told my girlfriend that the moment we have a kid i'm threatening their potential lover and if they make it to the second date i'll treat them like family, they just have to get past the first date and not piss me off first XD. most parents do the whole "hurt my child" thing as a bit of a joke, but it is still done to make sure that the person (especially teenagers because teenagers are fucking stupid) knows that you will lay down the LAW if you have to.

Once your an adult that's a different story, but as a teenager you are still a child, your parents are still going to look out for you.

** You definitely don't have children. Fathers want to protect their daughters (more than sons) from everything in the world. The "overprotective father" trope is one based in reality. If you are talking only virginity and not dating in general then it is creepy. But I find overprotective fathers extremely believable.

If this breaks any rules let me know and I will take it down. I know this IS not a discussion thread.

My mom straight up told me after showing my brother and i a video of a woman beating her boyfriend on a train, he was just sitting their taking it and when the cops finally took her away he stood up bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth and just mumbled "I didn't hit her."

My mom's response to that was "If i ever find out you let a girl do that to you without you even trying to get her off you, I'm going to kick HER ass and then Ima kick YOUR ass."

**** It is not that. From my personal experience I was treated different from my sister's. When I cut my knee I got a rub dirt on it, they got a bandage. The patern repeated until adulthood and for relashinship. I was often consoled after breakups but not before. This is most likely due too my lack of telling them. I dont think it is a matter of one being able to find romantic partners. To some of the people I dated my dad told me she was a very bad choice for me (he was right) but didnt tell her that. It comes down to my sister "needed" to be protected but I needed to learn, because the world is less forgiving for a guy. As an engineer this is true.
