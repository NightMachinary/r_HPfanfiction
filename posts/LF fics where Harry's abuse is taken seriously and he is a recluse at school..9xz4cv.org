** Probably already know this one since it's popular but linkffn(Better Be Slytherin!) gets pretty deep into it. He's not really a recluse but does appear to be more anxious than canon. I should probably note I haven't read the whole thing because whenever he started making progress something else would come up and he'd take two steps back and it just starting to annoy me and felt like the "Adventure" part of the story was never going to start so it wasn't really my thing.

** Two that come to mind:

â€‹

The first, which I don't think is that popular anymore, which is a shame because it is literally THE BEST abused Harry fic I've EVER come across, touches so many issues and squeezes your insides, is "Tears falling in Darkness: year one" by Evil_minded. I have a problem linking it here but it can be found on [[https://fanfics.me][fanfics.me]] .Harry is severely abused by the Dursleys, he reaches Hogwarts traumatized, fearful, submissive and totally helpless. He is sorted into Slytherin and Snape, the other adults and his friends have to get used to a mute, frightened boy-who-lived who's completely different from what they've imagined. This story is realistic severitus, and so incredibly sad one HAS to at least be familiar with it.

â€‹

The second one is "Through a glass, darkly." What I love about it is that it touches a point no-one ever touches. When writing an "abused harry fic", one has to decide if he takes it to the next level, since the actual physical abuse wasn't mentioned in the books or movies, but one thing that WAS mentioned was that the Dursleys punished Harry with starvation. In the first movie Vernon threatened Harry with "no meals for a week" in case anything 'freakish' happened, and other hints, like Harry being small-sized, did give away the sense that keeping food away from Harry was something he was more than familiar with on a regular basis. And Any child that goes through passive or abusive starvation will have issues with food. eating too much or not eating enough, smuggling food or getting sick; food issue has the potential of being destructive to a child, and "Through a glass, darkly" really touches that issue of eating disorder due to traumatic starvation. It can be found on potionsandsnitches, as well.

** Linkffn(Session Transcripts; 13053868) come to mind.

Session Transcripts features Harry being a recluse from the rest of the school (except for Slytherin), but not of his own accord -- it's because Vernon took the abuse too far. Multiple times. It's also a Severitus and has a /very/ interesting take on Hermione's character, as well as very good writing. My only complaint is that it hasn't been updated in a long time, but the author has gone a long time without updating their stories before.

Just Bearable begins in GoF, where Harry is already a recluse thanks to the entire school hating him for the Triwizard Tournament. In this, Harry reveals the abuse at the Dursleys because he has the rare ability to become pregnant...and I think you know where I'm going with this. This fic is /so/ good, not just because of how accurately the author portrays everyone (Snape especially), but also because it reads /a lot/ like the books. The author updates this story every two weeks, and has not failed updating since the story was posted.

** this is an au where harry is raised in an orphanage so it might not interest you, but Building Bridges by Melethril features an abused Harry and one of the main conflicts is that he struggles a lot at Hogwarts socialising with normal kids and a lot of ppl treat him like he's dangerous so he's a bit reclusive and quiet. I'm probably mostly fond of it bc I've been reading it for like 7 years (it started in 2010 and had a 6-year hiatus only to be updated this summer, which completely threw me lmao) but it's a solid fic ! one of those ones where you can see the author progress as they write (harry in this does begin sort of Mary-Sue and angsty, but by now he's very developed and a great character) linkffn(6427995)
