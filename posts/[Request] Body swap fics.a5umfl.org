So I don't care if its polyjuice, I'm just looking for fics where Harry swaps bodies with a girl (doesn't matter which one)

​

Or maybe a fic where Harry ends up in Lily's body (so including time travel) when Harry and Lily are the same age.

​

Thanks a lot!

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

** Luna/Harry linkffn(7452425) . It also has Ron/Hermione. I also recall a second Luna/Harry swap where in the end they eventually swapped back (or the author wrote both endings, where they swap back and they don't). Can't find it.

There was one (very incomplete, kinda got off the rails) incomplete one where Harry and Hermione went back in time and ended up in each other's 11 year old bodies. They called each other sky and Leia, as I recall. ... Found it linkffn(6685668)

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

  In which Hermione attempts a time-travelling ritual without due preparation and Harry happily goes along for the ride, and both have to cope with living their best friend's life.
