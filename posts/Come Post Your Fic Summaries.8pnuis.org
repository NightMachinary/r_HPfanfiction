Come post the summaries to your new/unpublished fics! Get criticism, see if anyone's interested, brag about how epic your summary is, whatever. For an extra challenge, don't explain past the summary what the fic is about! Here's mine:

------

A chance encounter on the train in 1938 taught Tom Riddle there were far better minions than purebloods. A "chance" encounter in Madam Malkin's in 1991 taught Harry Potter there were far better friends than Gryffindors.


** Maybe the insanity of the wizarding world isn't best countered with logic and rationality but by a more resilient sort of insanity. Alt Upbringing in which Harry ends up in the hands of the Wyrd Sisters and is excited to become the very best witch he can be.

*** Perhaps I'm a bit stuffy about this sort of thing, but reading terms like "Alt" in a sentence make me want to stop reading. It seems somewhat lazy. If you wanted me to read this and be excited about reading how the Wyrd Sisters will raise Harry, it should be closer to something like "Harry, under the guidance of the Wyrd Sisters, is excited to be the best witch he can be!"

** (Ranked from closest to farthest from being ready for publication. Those that don't have titles attached to them, I haven't yet /thought/ what they might be titled.)

------

*/Voldemort in Neverland/*

It's 1953, Tom Riddle is a young man with great plans, and he won't have any of that broomstick nonsense. He wants to /fly/, unhindered. His quest takes him to a forgotten magical realm home to secrets and creatures... and damn it all, he /will/ find that Peter Pan and wring the secret out of him!

(/A one-shot Peter Pan crossover./)

------

*/Violet Baudelaire and the Mysterious Magicians/*

"Hello, hello, hello, Hogwarts." Count Olaf has become the Defence Professor, just in time for Klaus, Violet and Sunny Baudelaire to wash up in the Great Lake. How did he survive? Where is the Sugar Bowl? Just what does V.F.D. know about that conspiracy of witchcraft? And most importantly, who, /who/ in Snicket's name is this Harry Potter bloke everyone keeps talking about?

(/Crossover with the television series of “A Series of Unfortunate Events”. Not that book fans will be disappointed.../)

------

*/Dalek Invasion of Hogwarts/*

A Second-Year crossover. The Founders put enchantments on the Castle Hogwarts to protect it from all known perils. But the unknown lurks in every corner of the universe, and its name is the Daleks. Harry Potter, Dr Who /and/ a certain time-hopping Gallifreyan must rise to the challenge while the Voldemort in the Diary struggles to take advantage of a situation he barely understands...

(/A fast-and-loose Doctor Who crossover./)

------

The Dark Lord's plan seemed so simple. He had broken into the Department of Mysteries once. Breaking into it again wasn't the hard part. Stealing the Time-Turner wasn't the hard part. Even shattering the timeline that had created the Boy Who Lived wasn't the hard part. No, the hard part was putting Time back together before all of creation unraveled. Will the help of Salazar Slytherin and that infernal Lovegood girl be enough?

------

An incident in Time has the Trio all wash up in the River Styx. Relying on half-remembered bits of mythology to get by, they soon discover that in this day and age, they are Gods... and King Zeus is as much of a Dark Lord as Voldemort ever was. Must our heroes, soon joined by mysterious Ariadne, let the evils of history take their course? Or have the Fates brought them here for a reason?

** For the longest fics in my folder, thus the nearest to being published. I'm not the /best/ with story names, admittedly...I'll figure it out.

--------------

- *Harry Potter and the Changeling Queen:* While wandering the castle late at night, a familiar young girl pulls Harry Potter through a mirror into the beautiful nightmare world of Faerie. Trapped and with no easy way home, Harry must adapt to this vicious new world and the discovery that his mother wasn't quite human, all while looking for a way to get out -- but can he escape in time to help his friends defeat the monster his abduction unleashed into Hogwarts?

- *Untitled Death Eater!Lily fic:* There's more than one way to give your life for your son. As the Dark Lord's newest unwilling recruit, Lily Potter must decide how far - and how dark - she is willing to go to ensure Harry's future safety, and whether Lord Voldemort's protection is worth the cost of her soul.

- *Untitled Dark!Harry fic:* When Lisa Turpin invited him to join her unsanctioned night flying club in 4th year, Harry didn't expect to find himself tangled up with a budding coven of young dark wizards engaged in a covert takeover of the Hogwarts grounds - but he's not complaining. After all, he's not exactly a light wizard anymore, himself...

- *Untitled Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover:* Pursued by swarms of Ministry Dementors and monsters more mythological, permanently grounded and with only Hedwig by his side, Harry Potter isn't having the greatest summer - but at least his dad's alive, right? That is, if you consider the Lord of the Underworld alive.

*** I think you should probably trim that run-on sentence a bit. I was getting pretty lost and I don't think that you really explained any story points in your summary. It also goes far too in-depth regarding fem!Harry's personality. There's nothing here that draws me in. If you want readers, you have to bait them. It's like feeding an animal. You have to draw them in. Make them want to come to you!

I disagree. Iris is the best thing about his story, so I don't think a single line is too much. But yeah, the rest needs to be shortened to allow room for something else.

**** I thought he needed to. :)

It struck me as frankly weird that we knew so little about Lily. Aside from Snape, we don't have names for any of her friends, even though the way she's described makes it sound like she was probably widely liked. We don't know her interests. We don't know what music she liked, what books she liked...we don't get much on James either, but the little we get on him is still a lot more detailed than we got for Lily.

My own mother died when I was very young too, and I'd give my kidney to have something like I'm giving him. Harry's practically starving for a family. He deserves a chance to see a person rather than an ideal.

I published the first two chapters a few days ago on ff.net, under the same name I use here.

** "The murder of an old classmate brings Auror Harry Potter face to face with his own demons. He will have to solve the case of '/Who killed Draco Malfoy?'/ without losing his family or his soul along the way."

Currently, I'm writing a noir-style story that I think will turn out pretty damn good. It's going to be pretty far in the future though, like at least a couple of months.

** I have a couple of potential ideas I'm brainstorming:

*Potterworld*: Welcome to Potterworld! It's Westworld meets Ready Player One set in a Harry Potter theme-park, where guests can find themselves thrust into a setting at any point in the books and play out the story-lines the way they want them to be played. But when the hosts start malfunctioning, the stakes feel more alive than ever. Can three protagonists put their differences aside and figure out a way to escape this new nightmare alive?

*Never Tell Me The Odds*: There are these fics about what would happen if Harry watched Star Wars and ends up becoming a Jedi. But what if rather than becoming a Jedi, he modeled his look after Han Solo and decided to run away from the Dursleys to make a life for himself on his own? How will Hogwarts handle a Harry Potter who grew up on the streets and knows every trick in the book?

*We All Float Down Here*: Crossover with Stephen King's IT. James Potter is returning to Hogwarts for his third year with his best friend Sirius Black. But something is different about this year at Hogwarts. There is a monster lurking beneath the Castle, a monster named Pennywise the Dancing Clown, that has awoken from a deep slumber, and has a whole host of school-children to feed on.

*No Man's Land*: DC Comics Crossover. Not knowing who he is or how he got there, a young man with a lightning bolt scar awakens on the streets of Gotham City with a simple wooden stick. It's a city under quarantine, with no available access to the outside world. And all kinds of horrors are about to come closing in on him.
