Looking for stories where Sirius actually did betray the Potters, either willingly or by spell/potion.

Any rating is fine.

*** Yessish. [spoiler]Sirius was the traitor, and Peter was a Metamorphmagus rather than an Animagus. During their confrontation, Sirius Confunded Pettigrew into taking his form, getting him arrested in his place (he couldn't change back in a Dementor-riddled place like Azkaban).[/spoiler] But none of this is central to the plot.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
