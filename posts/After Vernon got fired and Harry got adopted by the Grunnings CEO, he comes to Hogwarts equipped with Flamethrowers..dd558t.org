The company turns out a lot less boring than initially assumed.


** I could have sworn grunnings made drills. How do you get flamethrowers out of that, and why wouldn't you rather equip Harry with a drill that can pierce the heavens?

*** The Dursleys are boring, Grunnings makes tools for boring, there's a tunneling company called the boring company that uses the same joke, and they sell flamethrowers.

**** Oh so there actually was a connection. I now like this thread much better.

I still favour the drill tho, flamethrowers feel pretty meh in the face of all the fire spells in the setting.

*** Flamethrowers are a lot easier to make than drills. You can have entirely mechanical ones which require no electrical components.

Edit: For everyone disagreeing, [[https://live.staticflickr.com/7228/7253204458_ed60c3c0d4_b.jpg][here are the schematics for a Soviet Flamethrower]]. This is not a complex device in any shape or form and if you have the tools to make a drill, you can make flamethrowers easily.
