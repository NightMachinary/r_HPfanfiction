I'm pretty sure this is on AO3. I don't remember how, but TR/Voldemort discovers Harry has a part of his soul, rescues (or has someone rescue) him from the Dursley's, takes him to the Malfoys. Lucius is happy V is returned, has a thought that if Narcissa would h e let him, he would have offed himself due to how bereft he felt (due to his oath to V) after V disappeared. It's definitely a WIP.

Thanks!
