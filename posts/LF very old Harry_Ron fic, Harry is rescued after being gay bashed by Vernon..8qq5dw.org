** Hmm...do you remember which site it was on? Fanfiction.net, Archive Of Our Own, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8fxsis/complete_backup_of_harrypotterfanfictioncom/][HarryPotterFanfiction]]...?

How about the number of chapters? Around 10 chapters, 30 or 40, was there over a hundred...?

Or, any specific phrases? Chapter titles? Unusual words used?
