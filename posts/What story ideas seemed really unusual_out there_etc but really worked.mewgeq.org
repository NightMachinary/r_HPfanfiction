** Harry's soul is eaten by a Dementor and he somehow ends up in 1978, gets hypothermia and briefly experiments with being a pirate - The Second String

A painting comes to life to fuck shit up and also here's a list of every wizard that has every existed since 1940 and their family tree. - Of a Linear Circle.

Hey, what about Harry Potter but he's sad and dying and also everyone else is sad and dying and nothing is good and everything dies? Does that sound fun? Because it is. - Antithesis

What if you were to read a Wolfstar story but it is very focussed on ice hockey with a lot of ice hockey references and rules of ice hockey and the structure of the NHL and just generally the ice hockey culture and also you know absolutely nothing about ice hockey - Sweater Weather (nsfw)

** There was this author who predicted that Harry was a Horcrux (pre-DH fic) and they had Harry kill Voldemort and create a Horcrux but instead of using a piece of his own soul, he used Voldemort's piece of soul and put it in the Golden Snitch. Then he threw it beyond the veil. The fic was a bit annoying because the author added Ginny to the story and it became a sappy romance but the final showdown was really well written and it's like the author almost predicted how JK intended to end up the story.
