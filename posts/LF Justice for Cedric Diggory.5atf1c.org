Okay, so, you know how in canon, Cedric Diggory is killed at the graveyard, under Voldemort's orders?

And subsequently, most of the fifth book is about revealing that Voldemort exists, and so on and so forth?

Does anyone know any fics where the impetus for exposing Voldemort or bringing him down or even opposing the Ministry when they refuse to acknowledge Voldemort's return, is avenging Cedric?

Not Harry's parents, not everyone else killed in Voldemort's reign 15 years ago, but the boy he had killed because he could, just a few months ago?

** Well, I mean... you would think destroying the mans soul would be justice enough. Poor Voldy, never gets any love.

** I know there's at least one fic like this but I have no idea what its name is. Remember Cedric, or some sappy shit like that.

** if cedric was really noble he would have jumped on harry to protect him from the bad spell. diggory was planning his next move assuming the evil guy would aim at harry first. what a dick.

*** I think he was just in shock rather than plan to let Harry be killed to actually believe that this was happening to them and got killed, unless the book specifically stated Diggory waited for the spell to land on Harry and I've forgotten because my memory is corroding
