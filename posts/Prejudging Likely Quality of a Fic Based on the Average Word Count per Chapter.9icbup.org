For a long time now I've been prejudging a story's likely quality by looking at the average word count per chapter. So if I see a fic that has 30 chapters but a word count of only 15,000 or so, I automatically think it's not worth my time.\\
It just seems that good fics tend to have fuller, longer, more developed chapters, while more juvenile ones subscribe to the idea that one scene = one chapter.\\
I generally want a fic to have chapters that are /at least/ 3,500 or so words. Such chapters are still considerably shorter than JKR's (e.g., /Philosopher's Stone/ chapters have an average of 4500 words per chapter).

I have two questions.\\
1. How common is prejudging fics based on average chapter word counts? Do you do it?\\
2. Can you think of a fic (doesn't matter the type/pairing, but I'm looking for well-developed plots with short chapters, so no pure smut) that has really short chapters but is worth reading anyway? What am I missing out on?


** To be honest, I also weed out stories based on word count. If a fic has less than 2k words per chapter then I don't bother clicking the link. This method is so reliable that I wish ffn would include it as a filter option. That and a more versatile "Time Range" option so I can weed out stories that were posted before the completion of the novels.

Why? There's quite a few good ones. And I find it refreshing once in a while to read fics from before things like Horcruxes were firmly established, trying to make their own answers in earnest for canon's long-standing mysteries. Not to mention most of them are from before the most annoying tropes' rise; you mostly won't find any Indy-Harry nonsense before /Half-Blood Prince/.

**** I mainly enjoy stories that focus on Voldemort/Tom Riddle, so I usually dislike fics that don't take into account his backstory established in HBP. I'm ok with AU fics in which something intervened to give Riddle a different history, but the fic should at least acknowledge that events are changed from the way they were in canon for a believable reason. Otherwise the version of Riddle/Voldemort in the fic ends up missing a lot of the defining personality traits that make him interesting to me.

Also, I'm generally not interested in fics that tried to make up a conclusion to the series during the several year long breaks before the final books were published. I believe you that there are some great ones out there, but I've never seen one with a plot that appealed to me.

** Less than 1000 words per chapter only really works on one scene one shots, or collections of one shots, I agree with you on that.

My personal preference is for longer chapters, and my favourite long stories clock around 5-10k words per chapter, even short stories and one shots clock 4-8k.

That said excluding every fic with less than 3500 w/c cuts off like 95% of fics, and you're gonna miss out big time. I generally only skip a fic if it clocks less than 1500 w/c.

** I do prejudge fics based on chapter length, though not often enough to not read them at all. My sweet spot is definitely in the 5k-7k range, similar to canon. I would put the minimum at more like 2k, though. That /is/ on the short side, but there are good fics with shorter chapters. (Going outside the fandom, 2k-3k seems to be almost standard for /Worm/ fanfics, so it can definitely work.) On the other hand, I start to lose interest if a fic is longer than 10k per chapter. It drags too much, whereas the same length fic with shorter chapters flows better.

That said, there are absolutely gems outside that range. For example, /Just a Random Tuesday.../, linkffn(3124159), with average chapter length nearly 20k on the long end, and /Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary/, linkffn(12407442), with an average chapter length of 700 on the short end. Both of them are /brilliant/ and definitely worth reading.

Although, /Dark Lord's Diary/ is admittedly the most "amateurish" of the great recent fanfiction --- it has a lot of charm but it's clear the author is just having fun and stumbling through it with little forward-planning, and not only are the chapters short, they vary wildly between updates.

Again, this is coming from a big fan of it, but I do think it's fair to say that there's an argument to be made that it works /in spite/ of its short chapters-length rather than thanks to them.

And I think that's a very common problem for new authors: there's this desire to describe everything, when in fact, "brevity is the soul of wit." So I'll take a short, concise, and well-written chapter anytime over those long and meandering behemoths that are impossible to parse without skimming.

So maybe they have this sterling silver chapter about Harry fighting Dobby to the death in his room but then after that they don't know where to go, and you get bloated chapters about things that are easy to describe (like shopping for trunks or getting a shit ton of money).

It could be mitigated by authors plotting out their entire story before hand, but that's honestly too much work to ask someone to do for a hobby in my opinion.

In my view, it's not that I think less is always more, but that writers who don't hit a sweet spot make it almost impossible to make the chapter good. Less than 2K chapters (outside of few-shots) will in virtue of the word count entail a scene or two at best and even then with only the bare minimum. That makes it very very easy to do it poorly since each of your sentences matter far more, giving you a greater chance at messing the whole thing up.

What I can agree with -- and I think this is what irks many people -- is that there /are/ low-quality fics which will frequently update with 1-2k word chapters in order to get more views.

Extreme examples of this are all the 1K or less stories you see that are pretty much never worth reading. Even ignoring those, think about it. If your chapters are 2K-ish, you pretty much have to nail everything. If part of its boring or poorly done, that's going to be a substantial part of the chapter due to the size. Setting up scenes is already gonna be, if they're decent, a good 500 words minimum, and dialogue that isn't stilted will raised that higher. So it will be maybe 3 scenes for a 2K per chapter story.

Not saying it can't be done decently (I'm doing a 2K-ish per chapter short series right now and it works for me) but I tend to think a 3 - 5K is where chapters need to be for stories of decent overall length.

****** Ok, we agree on the existence of the abhorrent 1K-type fics, but I can't follow the rest of your argument.

As I understand it, you're stating that a longer chapter will "hide" the imperfections of a bad scene, while in a shorter chapter the bad scene will stand out more readily.

And, to me, that makes very little sense.

First of all, because I don't really equate an FF update with a "chapter". It's just a convenient point to pause a story. But, even ignoring that...

Look at it this way: you're reading a fic. Now, either that fic is written well (and so there are relatively few bad scenes) or it is not written well, and then there are many bad scenes. The length of the chapters had nothing to do with either of these cases, because we are judging the fic as a whole and not its separate parts.

As you're reading a fic, you're going to be seeing it through character development, plot arcs and such, and why does it matter on which specific page that's located? A 300k word fic with 300 updates will have the same amount of words as a 300k word fic with 50 updates, the only difference is the amount of updates which doesn't matter, because I'm reading a story, not a chapter.

******* It's not that longer chapters hide it, but that since the chapter is longer, people are less demanding that every bit of it be excellent. Everything is going to have high and low points of quality. But the less there is to a chapter, the more the low parts take up. If a 500 word section of your 2K chapter is boring, that's 25% of the chapter! But if the chapter is 4K, and the remaining 3500 words are engaging, the parts that aren't as good are more tolerable.

This is a general thing people do. Just look at how much emphasis people, for example, who watch anime put on the first three episodes of short series (24-27 episode series). Because those series are short, it's a rule of thumb by avid anime viewers that the initial few episodes need to hook the viewer faster since those three episodes constitute a larger portion when the series is smaller. Longer series generally have a bit more leeway in getting their hooks in.

Basically, my argument is that people don't want to waste their time if the bulk is bad, and the less there is the more the bad takes up. In my (limited, admittedly) experience, many shorter chapter stories (<2K) have this issue because they aren't planned out (or not well enough). It's not that I'm judging them in the moment by word count, but my experience generally inclines me to be skeptical of even starting stories with such small chapters. It's like pre-check I do.

******** There's certainly an argument for perception to be made, but...

Honestly, it feels like we're talking about different things here.

The hypothetical I'm using is a completed (or mostly completed) fic. And so in this case, you wouldn't see a 500 bad-word segment as a 25% of a 2k 'chapter' but 0.5% of a 100k word fic. And so the 'chapters' wouldn't really matter, since the next part of the story is just a mouse click away.

And even if you're joining a currently updating fic, then how far are you in when you discover this bad segment? And how much more is there to go? Because my perception is on what's currently written, and I'll judge the ratio of good to bad based on the amount of words, not chapters.

Anyways...maybe there are many terrible stories with short chapters, I haven't trawled FF lately...but I usually post 2-4k word chapters and I know I obsess over every word, so hey, give us a chance, eh?

*** To be fair though, "brevity is the soul of wit" refers to, well, wit. At face value, it's mostly supposed to be about wordplay, witty retorts, satirical letters, that sort of thing. It says that if you want to be funny and witty, you ought to be brief.

But novels are another beast entirely; unless they are also comedies, they primarily aim to tell a compelling story, not just to appear clever and funny. There's an argument to be made that they too benefit from avoiding too much "padding and bloating", but it's not, /per se/, an example of the old saying.

**** Alright, let me offer a slightly different quote that highlights the crux of my argument: "Brevity is the sister to talent." (A. Chekhov)

He's one of my favorite authors; another one is O. Henry. Both excelled in setting up short stories that offered so little in terms of character history, and yet created immensely moving narratives. In O. Henry's "The Last Leaf", for example, there are only three sentences devoted to describing the main characters and how they came together. That's it. And yet the work is a masterpiece.

Now, obviously, you don't need to approach writing in such a minimalistic way, but when you decide to drown your reader in descriptions and dialogue, writing out /every little thing in the scene/, then you're inhibiting your own work.

Some authors, also, do this because they want to show how well they can write, how colorfully they can stitch sentences together, and often that's nothing more than an exercise in ego.

And that's what I mean by "bloat". Using too many words (for whatever reason) where few would suffice.

Which is why, in my opinion, tying quality to short chapter length is a mistake.

** I, too, usually don't bother with stories with very short (under 2K words) chapters. That's because in my experience, a decent scene usually takes 500 to 1000 words, and a chapter should have more than one or two scenes. (I wrote a story with shorter daily updates - 1500 words at least, though - for a challenge, but when posting it to FFNet, I compiled the updates into larger chapters.)

Another thing I do is look at the time frames of the first and last chapters.

If the story is 120k words, 1st chapter is in 1st year, last chapter is in 3rd year, and the story isn't marked as complete I don't bother reading. That just means the story is long winded and going nowhere.

I'm rather puzzled by the "not marked complete" clause. Obviously a /completed/, series-length seventh-year AU, even if it is absolutely going to be completed, will be marked "updating" for a significant time of its lifespan. Some of my favorite stories are such large, years-spanning tales, and I'm writing one myself (202k, Fourth Year, at the moment; moving at a steady clip; got a definite plan of where I'm going for the three remaining years).

** As a reader, I tend to like longer or complete stories. One shots of less than 2k rarely interest me, and stories with chapters that are less than 500 words are also not very interesting, especially on ffn where AN's inflate the word count. Having said that, I don't like excessive dialogue so I don't particularly go looking for long chapter length. In a fic that's still incomplete, long chapters usually mean less frequent updates.

As a writer, I do short chapters (less than 1k) for daily posting challenges (only had one such project ever), but usually try to reach a minimum of 2k per chapter on other work (I only have three works, so that's not saying much). I also tend to go back once I finish a project to merge chapters and erase unnecessary AN's, though I get worried that it may pop up as an update. When I started to post on AO3, I posted my only complete fic at the time as a long one shot out of laziness.
