Imma just throw something out there. When the Snatchers tell Harry that there aren't many Mudblood Slytherins out there, that doesn't make sense, does it? Because the Sorting Hat says /multiple times/, that Slytherin wanted his house to have only those of Purest Blood, didn't it? That's why he walked away from Hogwarts. And, before anybody blows up, /yes,/ I /know/ that Slytherin is for the cunning and ambitious, and I am 25% Slytherin, but doesn't that create a sort of plot-hole? Since when does Slytherin accept muggleborns?


** By that logic, half-bloods should also not be accepted into Slytherin, since they don't have the purest of blood, but Umbridge, Snape and Riddle still got sorted there. Also, don't say you're 25% Slytherin, it's really awkward.

**** Idk, I wanted to say cringe without saying 'cringe' because it would have ruined the vibe of my comment.

** Slytherin wanted it that way, then left because it wasn't that way. Maybe he came to that conclusion after creating the hat, so the hat still operated on the 'cunning and ambitious' criteria and not the Pureblood one.

** since it's the hat that is sorting them, and not Salazar himself. and the hat sorts by traits, not blood.

** It could just be sarcastic understatement i.e. he really means it's impossible for Harry/Vernon to be a muggleborn if he's in Slytherin.

In the next sentence the Snatcher asks who his father is, which implies he believes Harry is at least a Half-blood.

** "Mudblood" refers both to muggle-born and half-bloods --- anybody who is not a pureblood. So even if there haven't been any muggleborns in Slytherin, there would still be "not many" mudbloods in Slytherin.
