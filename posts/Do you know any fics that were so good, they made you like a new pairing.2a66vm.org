Something you clicked on as a whim, or because it was recommended, and walked out dazed and interested and willing to explore a whole new pairing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] is a story I clicked on because I liked other stories by the same author. A side pairing is Ginny/Blaise, which I'd never read before but liked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6029161/1/White-Lies][White Lies]] is the story that made Snape/Lupin and Blaise/Neville quite appealing. I'm not sure how I came across it - I think it was in someone else's favorites list. Normally I'm not really into Snape paired with - well, anyone - but I found this to be written rather well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2708248/1/Background-Secrets][Background Secrets]] made Fred/George/Lee a guilty pleasure, and opened me to the idea of Harry/Cedric.

And finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]] is the fic that hooked me into Hermione/Luna.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4814128/1/For-the-Potions-Master-s-Amusement][For the Potions Master's Amusement]] got me to admit that HGSS has potential. I was not searching for HGSS specifically, but rather a BDSM themed story. Was surprised beyond words at how well this story works.

** Somebody on here recommended a Harry/Pansy fic that I found great. I'm usually a Harry/Hermione person only (with a Snape/Hermione guilty pleasure) so I was quite surprised when I took a liking to them. I can't remember what it was called for the life of me though. Sorry.

*** I'd be interested to read it too. The only Harry/Pansy fic I've ever read was [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] by Jeconais. It's incredibly entertaining, but pretty formulaic if you've read a lot of his writing before.

** That's how I managed to get myself hooked on WolfStar years and years ago. I clicked out of curiosity. Same for Hermione/Sirius. Someone was talking about it, I was intrigued, I buried myself in that part of the Fandom.

**** The Shoebox Project is a decent Remus/Sirius, has some really funny scenes, but it's a little overhyped.

Reason for Life is my current favorite Sirius/Hermione I think (though I waver). Time travel, Hermione feels she has to go back in time to give Sirius something to live for.

One hundred sixty nine is another really good Sirius/Hermione time travel fic, but it takes place after Hogwarts. Interesting use of magic, interesting characterization...

The last Marauder is my current remus/Hermione recommendation. It's definitely sad in some parts, but I think it redeems itself. I reread this one every few months when I'm on a fanfic binge.

I think I liked 26x brighter than the sun (wolfstar). The Stealing Harry series is often recommended for WolfStar shippers, though I didn't like some of the characterizations, and I don't think the series was actually finished. Worth a read though, even if just for a different take on the universe.

That's it for what I'm currently seeing in my kindle, but in about 18 hours I can go through my bookmarks and edit this :) I don't generally recommend stories shorter than a novel, sorry!

** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]], and it's an incredibly good story. The premise is that the Dursleys gave Harry back to the wizarding world after Dumbledore left him on their doorstep. Vernon took Harry to Gringotts and was raised a Goblin, trained to fight Voldylocks from an early age. This was the first time a pairing between Harry and Hermione was executed to the point where I actually fully supported it.

*** Dont bother with any of robst's other stuff. Harry Crow works because he didnt grow up like canon, his others all follow the format of, something happens that makes harry fall in love with hermione in seconds and her love him back. And he becomes a sweet talker and a major gentlemen and will kill people to defend his friends, all with his canon upbringing. So basically it turns Harry Potter into Harry crow with no backstory

** Credit to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][HP and the Girl Who Lived]] by Agnostics Puppet for piquing my interest in Girl!Harry, whether she was paired with crosstime Harry or not.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends...]] by Vera Rozalsky opened my eyes to Hermione/Neville, Hermione/Draco/Neville, and other funky fun.

There's a lost story (the author took her stuff down) called Sanitarium that portrayed the first gay or bi Harry that I could find believable. It also sparked my interest in writing train wrecks and I will never think of Theodore Nott as a background character ever again.

Spoiler: (for a story you can't read?) - in the story he corners Hermione into pulling out most of her memories of her magical education to put in his pensieve, later consuming the whole batch like soup. For months afterward, Hermione was unfocused and useless, like Luna without the whimsy, and she could never quite tell the others why her brain was missing.

Much later the trio finds Theo and makes him draw out the memories to give back to Hermione. Unfortunately, his own personality had adjusted to having all Hermione's extra knowledge, so taking it out again didn't leave him too much brain power. Talk about 'dazed and interested'...

** I don't remember the title, but I read a fic a long, long time ago that was LMHG. Someone else here has probably read it as well. Lucius kidnapped Hermione and while she stays in his dungeon cell place they slowly fall in love and it has a bittersweet ending that I won't give away.

And I wish I could remember what particular fic got me into HPTR, because I can kind of sort of remember a time in which I would not have thought it a good pairing. :3
