I bet Trelawney was bullied and teased as much as Luna was, and retreated into hiding behind her ancestry as much as Luna retreated into believing her father's crackpot theories. Luna eventually grew up a little and admitted that some of the animals were madeup, but Trelawney instead turned to alcohol. Her broken marriage probably didn't help. I wouldn't mind a fiction that went a little more into her life. I know in the movies she was younger than McGonagall, but I wouldn't mind a fic that had her and Minerva at school together, and were basically Hermione and Luna. Especially if Trelawney insulted Tom or something, since Minerva had a crush on him.


** Eh, I don't really see any similarities between the two - there's so little known about Trelawney's time at Hogwarts that I couldn't say for sure they both had similar experiences. What I do know is that Minerva's dislike for Sybill isn't that much to do with personal differences, as it is a lack of respect for Trelawney as a person and a professional - she drinks all the time, worries students by predicting their deaths (the scene in PoA in Transfiguration after Harry's first Divination lesson illustrates a certain resigned irritation on McGonagall's part), and in general McGonagall just doesn't appear to think that Divination is any good (she's a lot like Hermione in that respect).

Also, I prefer not to draw parallels between Luna and Trelawney, because people use that for the irritating seer!Luna trope, whereas I prefer to think that she's just weird for the sake of being weird, rather than any clear reason.

But, you do you, and feel free to read as much as you want into it.

*** Yeah, there's a lot of fanon going on here. There's very little in-universe explanation for Luna's eccentricity. The standard explanations of her father's break with reality after her mother's death or her being a seer are not exactly canon.

Trelawney? Yeah, we know even less. If OP want to write or read a story that draws parallels, or just wants to point out similarities in portrayal in fanfiction, that's fair enough, but it's ill-supported from the text alone.
