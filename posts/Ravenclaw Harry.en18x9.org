:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember really ANYTHING about this fic except for one scene where Harry is in Ravenclaw instead Griffindor and he doesn't intend the feast on Halloween. Dumbledore orders Flitwick to bring Harry down to the feast. Flitwick wakes up Harry; who is sleeping in his dorm, and tells him Dumbledore wants him down at the feast. Harry gets mad and proceeds to storm down to the Great Hall and rips Dumbledore a new one for forcing him to celebrate the anniversary of his parents' murder. I know it's wasn't a oneshot. It's not much, but please help. It's driving me crazy not remembering it.


** Angry Harry and the Seven. The scene you mentioned is in chapter 24. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/24/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven]]
