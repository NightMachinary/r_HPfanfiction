** There's Wormtail. Maybe he'd listen in when Dumbledore tells James and Lily about the prophesy about Harry defeating Voldemort. He would then go to Voldemort with the information.

One thing to consider is that Voldemort HAS to know about the prophesy, otherwise just him scarring Harry coincidentally won't work. He has to know Harry would be able to defeat him one day(an equal), and seek him out and attack him knowing so, thereby "marking him an equal". If he doesn't know about the prophesy he'd just see Harry is beneath him like most everybody else.

*** I think if Voldemort attack Harry without the prophecy, Lily sacrifices herself, Harry lives with Horcrux and Voldemort is defeated, then Harry is 'marked'. Voldemort will go after him, because he was defeated by him, he does not know why and he will consider Harry a danger. Not to mention if year 1 will repeat as in canon - Voldemort cannot touch Harry.

**** It works. Though it doesn't really address the "equal" part. He might consider Harry dangerous, sure, but not an equal. And that's discounting the big possibility that he'd assume it was a trap set by Lily instead.

The prophesy specifically stated that Harry would be powerful enough to defeat Voldemort(or atleast that's how it would sound like to him). /"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... "/ As conceited as Voldemort is, I just find it unlikely for him to ever believe Harry(or anyone bar Dumbledore for that matter) is as powerful as him without him knowing the this.

For fanfiction purposes though, your way works well enough. Just doesn't square in my head personally.

******** The best one is Potter Who And the Wossname's Thingummy, but I've seen it in one of the Harry-Refuses-The-Goblet fics as well - he becomes a squib briefly and everyone assumes it's permanent and decides that marked-as-an-equal means the same thing has happened to Voldemort. Buggered if I can remember the title of that one, though.

** Who else but Snape would work? Harry's survival and being "marked" is based on Lily's choice to die for him, a choice that was made possible because of Snape's request. So unless there's another Death Eater miraculously in love with Lily Potter, Voldemort disposes of her as quickly as he did James and kills Harry with no problem.

*** Maybe would work if Wormtail hears the prophecy and tells it to Voldemort, then, realizing it's Harry, begs Voldemort to spare James, and then James makes a sacrifice for Harry. But it would require slightly more noble Peter I guess, who somehow wants James to live despite changing sides (since he had no problem betraying Potters' location to Voldemort in the first place).

Huh?! Of course he has the dark mark or he wouldn't be a DE at all. Junior = of lowest rank. He joined very recently. He's not part of the inner circle.

** Lily discovers Ravenclaw's Diadem at Hogwarts.

Somehow this winds up with the horcrux possessing Harry.

Lily manages to bind the soul-fragment into seal over Harry's heart before it can fully consume Harry.

While inside Harry the horcrux manages to mentally contact Voldemort.

Having a piece of his soul bound to Harry makes the Fidelius charm treat Voldemort as Harry.

Voldemort arrives, kills Harry's parents, sees this tattoo on Harry's chest that wasn't there when his horcrux contacted him. He touches the seal and has his soul ripped out and sealed as well. People mistake this as surviving the killing curse.

Ravenclaw's Diadem survives intact

** I would take the prophecy out of picture. Just make James a target (he is a strong opponent, has an invisibility cloak, maybe can suspect Pettigrew is a spy..).. Voldemort comes to get rid of James and to make a clean job, he will want to kill Lily and Harry as well..

** Well. the prophecy hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines of it, but not the rest -- and that only happens if Snape listens in. If anyone else hears the prophecy, it won't have the same effect since only Snape would plead for Lily's life, and Lily's sacrifice would not have worked if Voldemort had not initially intended to spare here.

So, if Snape isn't there to hear the prophecy, it has no chance of coming true. And since a prophecy needs at least a chance of coming true, Trelawny ends up not making the prophecy at all. So her job interview goes poorly, Dumbledore politely rejects her job application and discontinues the subject of Divination at Hogwarts.

So I, as Fate, decide that the Potter boy was probably not that vital anyway and forget the whole thing.

Instead I arrange for Lily (who does not go into hiding because without the prophecy she is not particularly targeted by Voldemort) to meet up with Slughorn, and almost get taken out by Death Eaters who are after her for being a Muggle-born. She lives, but Slughorn is shaken by the prospect of one of his favourite students almost being killed, and guilt drives him to confess to Dumbledore that he might know why Voldemort seems to unstoppable.

Dumbledore and Slughorn manage to find out about Voldemort's Horcruxes and set out to destroy them all. There's some interesting potential with a story where Dumbledore and Slughorn hunt Horcruxes!

** I do nothing because prophecies do not work that way.

Smartass answer out of the way, Pettigrew rats them out to Voldemort. Or Rookwood, Voldemort's man in the Department of Mysteries, finds out that a prophecy exists that concerns his master, informs him, and Voldemort pops in to grab it. Or Evil Mustache Twirling Dumbledore leaks the prophecy to Voldemort so he can sacrifice Harry for the greater good.

He finds out that there is a prophecy regarding Voldemort but not what it says, leading to an early heist/all out attack to steal it and hear what it says. Maybe in the fight Dumbledore or someone breaks it so he only hears half of it over the noise.

** As fate I will relax. Nothings has changed. Snape wasn't the intended target anyway. Didn't I do enough when I chose to reveal peophecy in a interview with Dumbledore.

As fate I chose my intended audience after careful congratulate. Snape was extra but there to speed things up.

Dumbledore is cunning and heartless enough to do whatever is needed when desperate.

He raised Harry like a lamb pampered to be the most delicious sacrifice.

As fate I would know he has enough motivation to use a kid for greater good.

Even in Canon the is a long gap between prophecy and murder. I don't think Voldemort is the kind of person who would tempt fate without any due need. People that dumb don't become the most feared dark lords.
