** I want this fic to exist, and I want a Tom/Harry ship (or just Harry being attracted to Female!Voldemort) just for the potential discussion of Harry trying to defend his crush while Ron and Hermione wonder if he is right in the head because /it's Voldemort/.

*** Yeah, that'd be pretty funny and I imagine alienate Ron very quickly if he finds out.

**** I don't know who would take the news worst. Sure, Ron has some solid reason to hate her : "/Hello, tried to kill my sister, and my father, and probably every other members of my family both of us included/". But Hermione has the "/She lead a movement that wanted me dead just because of my parents, and probably called me a Mudblood 15 times already/".

In the end, I don't think ever of them would truly abandon Harry (though they would probably draw the line at Myrtle murder of Hagrid expulsion). They are all very close and loyal, and being stuck together in an alternate time/ dimension would make them even closer.

I see more something along the lines of "/Well it's your decision mate. I can't stop you from seeing her, or try to reform her, but I'll be there to collect your body after she murders you, and probably try to avenge you too/".

** i imagine if its post 5th year Riddle, and she opened the chamber, Ron is all for offing her before she was able to create more Horocruxes.

What other diffrences are there between the universes, can Ron call himself a Weasley or Prewett, can Harry call himself Potter without being put in a rough position.

*** I was thinking something along the lines of a test at Gringotts giving Harry the Peverell surname, because it does not conflict with the Potter family.

Hermione just presents herself as the muggleborn that she is, and Ron would have to create some kind of fake identity for himself, since there are existing Weasleys and Prewetts out there.

And then the conflict between the three would start because the Hat would put Harry in Slytherin or something...

And it goes from there.

**** Giving him the Peverell name during Gellerts rule, no he's already dead the second he comes out as one.

Harry post 2nd year is also a boafied 100% lion, he passed the ultimate house test with flying colors.

Gellert wanted the hallows and the peverell coat of arms is the hallows

****** its not like Albus had a weakness for the Hallows 50+ years later right.

It's a complicated mess, i would assume he's far more likely to be more aggressive in regards to the stone here than in canon, which is the reason he died lol.

Albus would also not be able to "babysit" Harry 24/7 + he sucks at protecting his own mind, Gellert has master mind readers under his command
