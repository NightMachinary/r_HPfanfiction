Have a long flight tonight and would love to have some recommended fics to download for offline (preferably AO3).

I can't get enough Sirius Black. I've seen plenty of request threads on here focused on him and have combed through them all, but I'm specifically looking for stories where the author's characterization is spot-on and the story itself edgier/darker/more adult than canon.

For example, I love the characterization in /Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ or /Summer of the Phoenix/. While I generally enjoy the Innocent story line, it's a little too fluffy for me.

So please send me any and all recs for stories - AU, canon compliant, gen., romance, whatthefuckever, but give me a Sirius that reflects his actual character, and not the stuff of Tumblr lore.

Holy Grail fic is post-Azkaban, canon compliant (at least to an extent), and some M/F romance with other elements to the story. Prefer no Wolfstar because it's been so done and it's a hard pairing to get right, but don't mind slash otherwise.


** I don't think there are that many, so I'm self-consciously going to suggest mine because I think it fits what you're looking for. linkffn[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13007514/1/Dark-Birthright][(13007514)]]

*** Thanks for the rec! I'm making my way down this thread and just finished the first part of this series today. Definitely a fanfic that has made me think more than usual. I actually kind of hated Sirius in the story, and yet he felt properly characterized, so it was challenging for me to confront my favorite character's less savory traits. His parents are fantastic. This feels like probably the story that comes closest to the “truth” of what happened between them, and isn't caught up in the trope of /'Sirius is his mom's favorite Crucio target'/ which I think is generally unsupported by canon. Though for someone as loyal as he is, I do imagine the break - so to speak - was probably precipitated by more serious things than old arguments rehashed.

Excited to read the second story and interested to hear your thoughts too.

  Post-OotP --- Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? Harry & Sirius family fic.
