Studious Harry

Is there a Harmony Fanfiction where Harry is just as invested in magic as Hermione and loves reading books and learning about magic? Maybe, he can be the top of his year along with Hermione. I have already read Blindness and Cupboard Under the Stairs series. The problem is that either way one of them is overpowered while the other one knows everything about the magical world and a genius. It would be better if it were long enough to have a decent plot and some adventure and romance with it. Even better would be if they were not prodigies of their age, but hardworking and smart. Thanks in advance for your help.

**** Oh damn, that means Harry/Hermione. My bad, I skimmed the paragraph of your preferences and thought Harmony meant a harmonious relationship. No, they aren't, though I think the mind arts flirted with it for a bit.

***** It loosely flirted with the idea for like, half a paragraph before discarding it, still excellent story, can't recommend enough.

Edit: I think the one you were thinking about was linkffn(More Equal Than You Know by The Obsidian Warlock)

** Try Moments in Love by Gandalfs_Beard it tries for a more consistent and studious Harry. There is a companion fic called Moments in Love The Steamy which has the rewritten chapters with some lemons. Eg you read the main fic then an AN tells you the chapter has a lemon so if you want to read the lemon you go to The Steamy Version. When done you come back to the main and skip to the next chapter.

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power that he knows not. ... First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

**** Thank you for your reply, but unfortunately, I have already read this story. As far as I can remember though they were married by the end of the forth year. Kinda weird, right ?

***** Well if you consider that the wizarding world is 100 to 200 years or more behind the mundane that would put them roughly 1794-1894 in terms of culture and law. I believe it wasn't until the late 1920's that the age for marriage in the UK was raised to 16 where it still is today. So getting married at 14-15 isn't that big of a stretch.
