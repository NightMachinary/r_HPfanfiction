This fic has been stuck in my head for the past couple of months , and I'm 95 percent positive it's not a dream

All I remember is that Draco, Blaise, and Theodore are all best friends and are asked to be deatheaters but refuses or something along those lines , Voldemort kills Blaise and Theo and Draco escapes.

I sorta remember at one point Ron makes a comment and Draco beats the crap out of him and almost gets expelled or something.

I think it was called written in the stars but I'm not sure.

Please help me find it, I don't know what the pairing is or even the plot but I remember really liking it.


** I think you meant "fic search" not request flair?
