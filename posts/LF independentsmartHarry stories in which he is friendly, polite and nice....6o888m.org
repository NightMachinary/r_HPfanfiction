... absolutely no stories in which he immediately antagonizes his main opponent (no yelling at Dumbledore, especially if Dumbledore is as evil as Voldemort). I'm sick and tired of fics in which Harry behaves like a whiny and pathetic asshat yet everyone is in awe of him for some inconceivable reason. [Someone needs to write a mock-fic in which this kind of Harry fails spectacularly - as he should]

I'd prefer it if Harry isn't evil. Lord Harry Slytherin-Peverell-Potter-Black-Merlin stories are okay if they fulfil my requirements (should be close to zero anyway).

I want stories in which Harry forges his own destiny, but doesn't act as if everyone else is beneath him or, like a fool, ignores advice by friends and allies - who he doesn't deserve and wouldn't have if he acts this way. If there's a giant conspiracy against Harry he's not going to reveal to the conspirators that he's onto them and make idiotic bond villain monologues about it... he's supposed to be smart! Actually it would be best if there's no monologues at all.

Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]] is completely off the Canon rails, and far more fun to read.

It felt like the title doesn't really matter to the story (just as a deviation from Harrys canon childhood). Will the whole animagus thing really matter (except as an occasional gimmick)? IMHO the animagus thing should have been a one/two-shot and then it becomes "Harry Granger" and maybe "Harry Granger at War"

*** You know what I mean ;) Non-obnoxious! I don't mean an arsekisser... But if he thinks the Minister for Magic is a moron, he's not going to tell him to his face - unless he's about to kill him in the next 2 minutes.

****** makes perfect sense

for my part i find harry an incredibly boring character in a fascinating setting, but most authors a) can't write and b) focus more on the character than the setting

therefore i mostly read stuff like wastelands

******* Yep, that's the perfect opposite to me. I think HP has very interesting characters in a extremely flawed (borderline stupid) setting. I read fanfics for a plot and setting that make more sense than what I got in canon (especially minus all the idiotic stuff that got introduced after OotP)

Harry in particular is pretty consistently written and DH-Harry is a decent independent!Harry, just a shame that the plot is dumb and makes no sense.
