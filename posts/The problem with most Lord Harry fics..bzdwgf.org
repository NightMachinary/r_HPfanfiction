Don't get me wrong, I love this trope. It's one of my favourites actually. But it's hard to find a well-written one. Most fics I read are either like "Harry decides to take control of his life and now EVERYONE IS EVIL! AAAAAAH!"

Sorry.

Anyways, either like that or "I am Lord Potter, you will bow down to my ultimate, supreme, awesome, insert random positive adjectives here, power."

And with that, I will defeat the purpose of the flair being discussion and ask you all to send me more fics. /I need more./ */Need them!/*

(clears throat)

Yeah, so, um, what do you think?


** I too enjoy them. If only for their ridiculousness (or is that just what I tell people?)

I hate the ones where he's an utter asshole though, knows better than everyone else, and starts talking like Percy Weasley got sent back to the Elizabethan age.

Yes, I'm reading it because Harry on a power trip is fun. But it's much easier to enjoy a story when I don't spend every word sincerely wishing I could punch the main character. As a personality transplant, that one came out of nowhere.

But the key here is how much. A 13 years Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverell-Slytherin.... with a harem is just ridiculous. A 13 years old lashing out against every (perceived) slights and having his way sounds suspiciously like the author is overcompensating for something. Even worse, this super Lord Potter-Black... often still falls to Wormtail in the Graveyard because the author clearly has no idea how to develop an original plot.

*** I agree with you. I have a Lord Harry fic in the works that I started when I was 11. Two years later, I'm restarting it, pouring the hours spent on it down the drain, because I gave him /way/ too much power at the age of fifteen. For the exact same reason as above. My only other fic in the works that has a child as a lord is a fic in which Harry's 15 year old cousin (It's a fourth year fic), after having gone through years of training, tries to restore the names of Peverell and Potter. He's Lord Peverell and Regent Potter in that fic and the only reason I'm not rethinking that is because I reasoned that the training could have involved political training.

****** The problem with having read so much HP fanfiction over the years is that because I never documented which stories I've read they all start to sort of meld together in my brain and become this sort of hodgepodge amalgamation of ideas and threads which all weave in and out of each other throughout that murky depth I'm told is my head. My big big empty head. What I'm saying is, not only do I have no idea if I've read this story or not but even if I read it now I'll STILL have no idea if I've read it before or not. Ironically this is also a silver-lining since it means after a little while I can start to re-read the same stories without realizing I've read them before. Alternatively-alternatively, now that I'm reading what I'm writing I'm starting to wonder if I should see a doctor about having myself checked for Alzheimer decease.

** My main problem with "Lord" Harry is that it often ends up with full grown adult bending backside for the whims of a petulant child because "Old Family, Lordship and shit".

Seriously, while I have problem with this trope from the start (because I don't like the idea of "nobility" in HP, or the one of child being in an equivalent of a Parliement just because their parents were), I consider any Noble Harry story where he doesn't end up either as a puppet for political adult or dead for being petulant as either too unbelievable or just as a crack fic.

We, uh, had this as an actual political institution in the actual parliament of the actual United Kingdom at the time the books are set. Legislation that started phasing out the right of the hereditary peerage to sit in Parliament wasn't passed until 1999, and there are still 70-something of the buggers with seats in the legislature by virtue of who their fathers were. I can't quite put my hands on the date they made it a rule that they had to be 21 to take their seats.

As for young politicians, the record in this country is Pitt the Younger, who was elected at 21 and Prime Minister at 23. They started 'em early in the 18th century.

***** I disagree, I think it can be written believably either way. Even before the Statute of Secrecy formalized the separation of Magical and Muggle society, it's quite plausible witches and wizards would have considered themselves above any Muggle notions of nobility. How noble can your blood be if it's not even magical, in a witch or wizard's mind?

To me it seems more likely that there were always powerful Magical families, some of whom may have styled themselves "Noble" as in "belonging to a hereditary class with high social or political status" but never any real formalized systems of royalty or nobility like we have in Muggle monarchies.

At the end of the day, magical power is what matters in Magical society, and it's more important than organizational/hierarchical power. That matters more in the Muggle world, where it's more of a population numbers game between different states, so it'd be natural to see more powerful states in the Muggle world, while one would expect more individualistic forms of government to preside in Magical culture.

Another way of looking at it, superpowers in the Wizarding world are genius-level talented individuals like Voldemort and Dumbledore, while superpowers in the Muggle world are nation-states with big economies and strong militaries.

More likely low nobility or even merely knights.

And there's also no evidence wizards were deciding battles or being routinely used by Muggle rulers at all. Mostly each side kept to themselves, even before the Statute.

Even more remarkably, all of the tropes actually make some sort of sense within the universe of the story. It's really quite remarkable, and I tip my hat to Ebenbild for managing to not produce a bunch of 12-year-old super politicians.

  “So you think that . . .” He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. “Lord Vol ---”

** My biggest problem with this trope (and why 99.5% of all stories like that I stop reading immediately I find it) is that it completely breaks the substance of JKR universe. JKR (given her own political opinions) wrote the Harry Potter universe very much middle-class bourgeois, where most people are ministry officials, tradesmen, etc. The spirit is of Victorian modernist middle-class world. “Lord Malfoy, please ask Princess Greengrass to pass me a salt, Scion Longbottom is in the way.” just doesn't work in such universe. Northumbrian is one author which (among other things) caught this down-to-earth spirit perfectly.

In order to make it palatable, you have to tone the nobility down a lot and make those lords in little more than town councillors, which is what linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) did and it makes it palatable for me (White_Squirrel is a grandmaster of using offensive tropes in non-offensive manner).

Magical powerhouse Harry is entertaining when he's blowing away faceless Death Eaters, but give him a powerful LV or inner circle DEs to slow him down or being him to a stop temporarily. Give some tension, make me actually wonder if Harry's going to win rather than skimming over plot and shopping montages to get to the end of the book where he smokes Voldy with one spell.

Politically powerful Lord Potter is only deeply entertaining when he's dealing with greater problems that require that power. He's having to dance around a policially savvy and powerful Dumbledore or Malfoy, or dealing with problems on an international scale.

Captain America would be pretty lame if his entire story was beating up regular Nazis. Superman's lame if nobody ever finds some kryptonite.

*** I dream of HP stories where Harry is ridiculously powerful, but that actually has in turn a lot of it's own problems. Like every spell he tries is completely overpowered with potentially dangerous consequences. He keeps burning out his wands and the teachers keep having to escort him to buy new ones or use old ones since Harry can't afford to keep buying new wands which could lead him to learn to craft his own wands etc. Maybe he isn't a great student per-se but not bad, while Hermione is the mirror image of Harry, ie very accurate and great with pure memorization but very low power (what if purebloods were partially right about new magical bloodlines not being as powerful as old ones or something?). Anyway, I'm just not seeing a lot of fresh new takes I guess. If you know of any stories that are like what I described please link them. Thanks.

Like a miscast cleaning charm that scours the top few layers of skin off a DE, or a levitation charm that makes them erupt in flames. Repairing charm fuses their fingers together into mittens or seals their mouth and nose shut, etc.

** I want to talk about why all Lord Potter fics are either Harry/Daphne or Harry/Harem? I've never come across a good Harry/Ginny Lord Potter fic, and I find the idea so much more interesting. I mean, you can either have the perfect pureblood heiress, who tells Harry what to do, or a normal witch, who has to grow alongside him. And it's not out of the question that Ginny could know things, either. She's also a pureblood.

*** Probably because there isn't an actual representation of politically savvy pure-blood witch that is more or less neutral regarding the war in the series, and her name is a popular one to put in. It also pretty much has to be a slytherin because they are the ones in the book that is pretty much aligned with an aristocracy. As for Ginny, she is a part of a poor family that more or less rejects the concept "nobility/aristocracy" at least how its usually portrayed in these fics.

** The first problem with all Lord fics is that Dumbledore is the Chief *Warlock*.

The second is that almost all of them fail to show true political games with different groups pursuing different goals.

The third is that if there's a young potentially powerful politician, without proper support he/she is likely a dead one.

*** How would the first make a difference? I know from previous experience that misunderstandings lead to major downvotes so I'd like to make it clear that I'm genuinely confused.

The second is true, but I guess only one who really keeps up with politics or is a politician can understand true politics. Hmm, that makes me wish the Queen or Prime Minister would write a fanfic.

The third is true, but not in all cases. In some, he does have the backing of some other powerful houses. Though there are very few fics in which this is achieved in a believable manner. Unless they have a solid reason, they're not going to follow a child. It also doesn't really apply to Adult Harry fics, seeing as people have a reason to follow him.

**** The first shows that an author didn't really put any thought in creating a political system. He or she just used the trope for his/her purposes that are far from writing a good political story.

It's not necessary for an author to be a politician to write a political story. I think the good start would be to use a rule: actions have consequences.

The biggest issue with powerful backing for Harry is that his father and grandfather had them (and even more) too and it kills the whole canon backstory (10 years of war with Riddle and powerful "Dark" side after his demise).

just slap some ring on, give some blood to a goblin, and suddenly you are the hair of all founders and the ultimate authority on everything.

​

But there are a couple that i can recommend that are actually well written and just feels good to read them.

​

The first i re read it today.

Novocaine

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]])

Which is basically a fanfic written dealing with the rebuilding of the wizarding world after the war and how the reconstruction efforts went.

i love how well written it is and how realistic it gets in some parts.

​

And the other i don't remember it a lot, but it was on AO3, it had a Harry that was introduced to the traditionalist way of belief in first year and he actually understood the reasoning behind the traditions, so he became one of them, it's one of the rare completed fan fiction that is actually well written and enjoyable.

** It just gets slightly old with the fact that pretty much everything out there is a Lord Potter based story. I think in most cases it just needs to be toned down a bit. The idea of Harry forming a Potter-Longbottom-(insert other houses) coalition with a wizengamot majority just feels outright wrong.

I also hate it when Harry has no composure and just throws tantrums at Dumbledore or whoever else has wronged him. He never seems to be able to realise when to let something go, and that feels out of character to the point where it's not Harry anymore. He named a kid after Snape, so unforgiving Harry doesn't make much sense unless you change something about his upbringing (i.e. more abusive Dursleys).

It also often ends up taking away the fact that Harry is a child. He can't laugh because he's a lord, or some other strange logic. I don't get it.
