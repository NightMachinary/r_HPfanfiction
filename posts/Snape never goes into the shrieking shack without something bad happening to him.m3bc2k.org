** To be fair, on only went there 3 times (to our knowledge), and only under crazy circunstances (Werewolf during the Full moon / Werewold during the full moon + most researched man in Britain + Potter / Very pissed Voldemort + technically Potter).

That would be like always jumping into the lion den covered in blood and complaining that bad things always happen there. If anything, I'm impressed by the fact that it took him 3 tries to finally die.

** Pretty sure he would be pretty much the same, but he wouldn't hate Remus/Sirius/James quite as much and would not owe a life debt to Harry. Like he would still be a a jerk right?

***** More like he gets hit with a triple dose of the disarming charm, which flung him into a wall hard enough to knock him the fuck out.

*** Maybe. I always figured the werewolf aftermath was the final nail in the coffin for Snape's choices. As in, Dumbledore gave Sirius a slap on the wrist and told Snape to shut up or get expelled. Thus, he concluded that there was nothing for him on the "light" side, and ended up closer with, and finally choosing, the Death Eaters, in the end. Keep in mind that this was /before/ the Defense OWLs, which means that James clearly didn't think their harassments had gone too far yet.
