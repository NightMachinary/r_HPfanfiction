:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello,

Much like my last post, am looking for 2 fanfics that escape me..

*(Solved)* 1. Harry places the hogwarts vanishing cabinet next to the veil of death. Death Eaters come in through Borgin and Burkes' cabinet and immediately die. I believe Harry has other traps set in the Department of Mysteries also.

1. Moody demonstrates the Cruciatus curse in class. Harry stuns? him because Moody would not do that in front of Neville Longbottom. I believe he mirror calls someone and says the same.

These are very likely 2 separate fics and that's pretty much all I can remember from them.

Please help.


** I'm sorry that I can't help, but the first point sounds pretty interesting!

*** Unfortunately no, that's not the one.. I think the one I'm looking for has Harry (and Hermione?) laying multiple traps in the DoM?

** Ok well the story I recommended does actually place the vanishing cabinet in front of the veil. With the additional detail provided the story you're looking for is Harry Potter and Future's Past by DriftWood1965.

Where Harry and company place a door in front of the veil and place boulders sand etc throughout the room as well as some traps if needed (eg the brains) and basically trick some of the deatheaters to run through the door into the veil.
