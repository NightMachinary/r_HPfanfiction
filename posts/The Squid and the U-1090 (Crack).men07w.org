So basically, there is a sunken U-Boat (U-1090) under the Black Lake. During the Battle of Hogwarts, just when it seems the defending Order and Free Ministry forces are about to lose, the Giant Squid tosses the U-Boat at Voldemort's forces, killing most of them instantly. The ones that don't immediately die are caught in the explosion caused by the half-century old torpedoes going off. As the dust settles, a large, booming voice is heard by all left alive: "Shut the bleeding hell up, I'm trying to sleep here!"

*** Most lakes are fed by rivers, and U-Boats were small enough to fit into medium to large sized rivers.

**** So I just checked the Harry Potter wiki for where the water for the Great Lake actually comes from...and apparently it's landlocked, and Hogwarts' plumbing drains into it.\\

That does beg the question; where does the Great Lake get its water from? Rain? An underground river? The merpeople in there had to get in there somehow, so perhaps there's some magical portal somewhere in the lake, or an underground river big enough for merfolk (and U-boats) to swim through.
