:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic is either on FFNet or AO3, I have no idea what the pairing is, and it's a Tournament Fic (as in, one that covers it primarily, not a whole-seven-years-fic that just features the tournament).

I remember a section about Authority, where Harry talks/thinks about having Magical Authority to do things in certain places. It seemed to basically be the magical version of admin privileges, where being giving those permissions allows you to do a whole lot more. That's what leads to him submerging himself and doing something weird with occlumency to make himself think he's Sal Slytherin. He then walks publically through a crowd in the main hall, causing some ruckus, and drops his name into the goblet before collapsing. Pomfrey reveals that was a very stupid thing to do and it's going to have some psychological after-effects.
