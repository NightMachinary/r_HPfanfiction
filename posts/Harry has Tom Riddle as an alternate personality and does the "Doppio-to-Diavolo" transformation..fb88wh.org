** The closest I've seen is in Accidental Horcrux linkffn(11762850) - it features a relatively nice Harry being being devoted to amoral and sadistic Tom who possess him. There are a couple scenes where Tom takes over control of the body.

The biggest differences is the fact that Harry is aware that he is possessed and that Tom is /somewhat/ cares about him.
