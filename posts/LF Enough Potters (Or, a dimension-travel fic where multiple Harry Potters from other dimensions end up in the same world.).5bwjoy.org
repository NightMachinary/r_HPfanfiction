See title. At least three Harry Potters, plz.


** I can't remember the name right now, but there's a fic where Dumbledore summons a number of Harry potters and keeps throwing them at Voldemort in hopes one of them will beat him. None of them do.

*** Hmm...by any chance, did you find that fic again? Do you remember any phrases from it? Plot points?

**** Not really, I just know that it's a H/G pairing(because that's pretty much all I read). If I remember correctly she reveals what's going on because she feels sorry for the latest Harry(canon Harry) because he's much nicer and more pitiable than the prior Harry's.
