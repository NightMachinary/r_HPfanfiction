At some point, Harry disappears from the Dursleys and Dumbledore can't find him until the summer after 4th year. The Weasleys (Ron, Ginny and Molly), Lupin and Snape go into the Muggle world to find him and run into Hermione there, looking completely OOC in dress and behaviour to her typical Hogwarts persona but ends up helping them find Harry at some club/party. Published pre-2011 but I can't really remember anything else.

Any takers?
