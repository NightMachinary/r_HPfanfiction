I like triad fan fictions. I also like fan fictions where the Dark and Light leaders end up uniting and keeping eachother from going to far (only seen a couple of these so if anyone has any recommendations that'd be much appreciated). But I haven't seen any that have a light and dark leader feuding then a neutral leader steps in and helps them reconcile. Any fan fictions of this or a similar nature? Doesn't have to be a romance but that'd be preferable. Like Dumbledore and Gellert with someone or Harry and Voldemort with someone. Probably an OC but could be an existing character as long as they're truly neutral while the other two are very dark and very light. Is that even a plausible idea? I sort of just had a dream about it and now I'm writing this while I'm still not fully awake so I'm not even sure I'm properly expressing the idea.


** I think it needs a reason to exist. What is causing this triad to be a thing in the first place? Is there an outside enemy they have to work together against? Why would their completely different and irreparably different ideologies be able to coexist?

*** It'd probably have something to do with a threat to the existence of magic, or exposure and a war with the muggles, or a severely decimated population where wars keep counteracting the birth rate.They'd have to agree that some of their beliefs weren't as important as ensuring the survival of magic and as many people as possible.

I'd like to think certain beliefs weren't actually staples of a certain magical affiliation but rather cultural developments that somehow became associated more with one side than the other. Like blood purity is associated mostly with the Dark but a lot of others were blood purists that weren't Dark. Or how certain types of magic were restricted mostly because of just one side.

** I think the main question you need to answer is what kind of people want to stay neutral in a conflict with genocidal murderers on one side and people fighting for muggleborns and muggles on the other.

*** Maybe they're not neutral against genocide in particular. They're willing to fight against specific topics like that. But they can't entirely side with either the Light or the Dark. Because both sides are so bigoted against one another. The neutral faction would be more about freedom of choice in any given situation. Also, supporting those in the magical community that both the Light and Dark tend to reject or use as pawns. Like all the magical beings, creatures, squibs, and muggles tended to be discriminated against by both the Light and Dark. During the war they tried to sway as many to their cause as possible but when the wizards didn't need them they seemed to ignore them if not worse. Even some members of the Order were prejudice against Remus for being a werewolf. Wizards and goblins don't like eachother, but if I was a goblin or I'd be pissy with wizards too when they wouldn't even give me equal rights to use a wand.

**** If the "Light side" is as bigoted as the side who plans to murder all muggleborns, then that's some very serious bashing there.
