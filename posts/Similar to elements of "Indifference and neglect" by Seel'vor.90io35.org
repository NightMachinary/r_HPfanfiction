I've just finished reading "Indifference and neglect" by Seel'vor. I'm looking for some /completed/ fics where everyone turns on Harry and like in "Indifference_and_Neglect" but hermiones parents stand with Harry. They understand him and try to help him or be there for him. If there are any other parent figures in a similar fic I'd be happy with that too. Eg, Andy and ted Tonks, etc


** Is it an absolute requirement that other people turn on him, or do you just want a nurturing parent figure?

*** Well I like the part of the fact that in Indifference_and_Neglect, hermione decided because Harry will die due to the prophecy and not having much chance against voldemort, that she will date Ron because he is safer. Everyone treats Harry like a g child and he has no intention of fighting their war. So it's not a matter of them all turning on him as much as they trying to force him to do stuff against his will. Whereas hermiones parents are sitting there thinking what the hell is wrong with you all. Just leave Harry to do his own thing. Why you forcing him to fight.

Basically that.
