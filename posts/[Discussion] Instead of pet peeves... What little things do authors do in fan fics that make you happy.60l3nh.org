Let's call them... pet delights.

For me, it's the author introduces new spells and teaches a bit about them in the story, like the theory of how they're cast and what the incantation is. Bonus points if the Latin sounds cool!

Of course, I usually see the opposite in fics:

#+begin_quote
  Today in /DADA/ Harry learned the Earth Shattering and Moon Displaying spells; so he started using them in battles but you don't need to know how they work, what they do, or what the incantation is.
#+end_quote


** When the writer gives a minor character a moment of awesome, while still keeping them in character. Tougher than it sounds, and really rare when you're talking about the bad guys. Most fanfiction writers don't want to give the enemy any moments of delight, but really, everyone just wants to look good, get a babe and enjoy their perks.

A well-written Luna is a thing of joy to behold.

** Things that made the canon series so magical and whimsical to me. Some of those things are:

- Letters/newspaper clippings
- Other trivial, detail-oriented minutiae, e.g. clever shop names, book titles
- Food descriptions; in fact I wish there were more food descriptions in canon (I'm talking Farmer Boy-level)
- Some description of day-to-day happenings; this is, I feel, a bit tough to get really right, since it can easily seem like the author is just writing and including things to take up space
- Minor characters that have their own small arcs

I feel a lot of the above can be lumped into "expanding on the world JKR's already given us". I like that world. When people explore more of it, it's grand.

Like make a wiki page about the sweets of the Wizarding World, and then have discussions on what to add. Then in the story description, you can say that it is compliant with the extended fanon, so if you name drop "Twinkling Sugar Crystals", you don't have to spend a paragraph explaining how it make your skin luminescent, and it tastes like Raspberry's.

If you look up Severus Snape there will be like 'Loyal to the order because Voldemort killed Lily', 'Loyal to Dumbledore only because he wants Vengeance', 'More Loyal to either side that is winning at the certain time', 'loyal to Voldemort, and only wanted Lily as a possession' etc. They'd have to more detailed than that considering there is different representations for character.

***** I suppose, but really it would be more intended for non-plot relevant things. Actually get a list of shops with a map of diagon alley. Nobody is going to need to change that unless they have a plot specific shop. Whereas things revolving around say Snape's loyalty are suspect. Perhaps have it in the style of the HP wikis, but everything fanon must fit seemlessly into canon. And mark which is which, so authers know which can be changed accordingly to comply with the fanon. So like, the magical government of New Zealand. Never going to be important, but if we have a Harry travels the world fic, having an established Ministry for New Zealand, as well as a minister and political issues could help prop up some plot points. A lot of authers rely on canon as a way to prop up their stories, sticking to canon names, dates and everything else. This would just be good, because it adds more reference points for writers to follow.

  Making Dumbledore competent. He might be evil or good, but most stories don't have him competent.
#+end_quote

I feel most people don't know how to successfully write a character that is manipulative. It's a lot more than setting back talking about what a great schemer you are, while cackling madly about all the orphans gold you're stealing, and then huffing candy fumes while stroking your beard to pensieve memories of Harry getting the belt by his uncle.

On the same token a competent character is more than just a Deus ex Machina. Having him consistently ride in at the end to save everybody, while at the same time passively allowing those events to happen (or worse, not even noticing) doesn't make a character competent no matter how many times the characters in the story say so.

**** I feel like the key to writing a manipulative character like Dumbledore is to allow them to stay in the background as much as possible.

Manipulative people don't run around openly forcing people to do things.

Manipulative people evaluate situations, and enact subtle pressure on the situation when and if the pressure is needed to keep things going in a favorable direction.

Dumbledore wouldn't just tell Harry what he has to do or blackmail him into doing something. He would manipulate Harry's circumstances in much more subtle ways. For example, placing him in Gryffindor where he will be influenced by his housemates, giving him access to people who will guide Harry in the direction Dumbledore thinks is favorable, or using his power at the Ministry to create a specific outcome and then telling Harry that the Ministry had made the decision.

***** Almost exactly. As a writer you do need to show these actions being done, but you don't need to let the other characters see beyond the veil of ignorance. So show Dumbledores thinking, make references to what he's doing, etc. Why is the action he's taking manipulative? How is he controlling the dice?

It's never going to be overt, it will always be subtle. And a manipulative character shouldn't be a main focus. Just enough so you are shown their work, not just told that it happens.

Bingo. I love a perfectly used [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit][Batman Gambit]] because that's what manipulative people do: they get you to /naturally/ react the way that they want to. That way it can appear as if they're not doing anything, which is what makes them that much more manipulative. If you're actually reacting the way you normally would, is the other person really manipulating you? Or are you conveniently reacting in a manner that benefits them?

That is the beauty of a manipulative character. You. Don't. Know.

** Pet delights:

Magic

- Any mention of needing to understand a spell to be able to cast it properly.

- Any explicit denial of exhaustible magic.

- Presentation of spells as related nodes in a theoretical structure rather than discrete and static objects.

- The presentation of magical theory as completely incompatible with the body of knowledge known as "science". E.g. a magical theory of matter which directly contradicts atomic theory.

- Complex magical theory which does not devolve into a science analogue e.g. that avoids the use of formulas that are reminiscent of the formulas of physics, only with magical units instead of physical ones. The best kind of magical theory is that which draws on philosophy, theology, alchemy, law, numerology, astrology, etc. Essentially a constructed narrative about some aspect of the world or human experience.

- Pluralistic magical theory. That is, there not being a single, comprehensive and unified theory of magic but rather a large number of competing magical philosophies, which have different merits and may be suited to different areas of magic. Further, it's not the case that a single unified theory is possible and it simply hasn't been arrived at yet, but rather that there is no single "magical truth". Instead, many different narratives can be told about magic, all of which have validity (though this does not exclude the possibility of a magical theory being completely wrong, it just means that there are more than one which are right).

- Single-word incantations.

- Complexity of magical theory being alluded to by reference and by illustrative examples but not explicitly detailed. The problem is that it is impossible for any author to come up with a convincing magical theory i.e. one that is suitably complex that it bears the appearance of a deep field of study which has been developed over thousands of years by countless different thinkers. Any author-described magical theory will feel far too simplistic. As such it's better to allude to there being this body of theory out there, and to illustrate it with small slices of bits of theories, but to never attempt to go into any comprehensive description of any given theory or magic generally.

Story

- The tying in of plot, character arc, and magical theory. E.g. a character has been struggling with a personal issue, the resolution of this personal issue leads them to better understand a concept which in turn means they now understand a piece of magic which had previously been eluding them. Being able to finally cast that piece of magic allows the plot to be resolved. Non-HP example: Kaladin in The Stormlight Archive.

- Goal-oriented duels where the opposing characters are moving through the environment towards some objective, simultaneously duelling to prevent the other achieving it. These duels tend to be far more dynamic.

World

- Politics being more than the possession of titles. Far too many fics give Harry de jure legal authority in the form of titles and that is the end of it. There's no struggle for de facto power because magic itself enforces the authority of those titles. This is boring and arguably not really even a political storyline. Politics is about having to make deals, compromises, about winning influential people over etc. I'm okay with Harry having a title, but I prefer the title to be largely defunct.

- Presentation of the wizarding world as changing over time, not static.

- Small wizarding population (under 15,000).

Character

- Strategic Voldemort.

- Villains in general who adapt and change their plans based on developing circumstances.

*** Ahhh!

I agree with so much of your "Magic" points. I'm currently working on a fic with moderately deep magical theory and it's incredibly exciting for several reasons

- world building
- cool details
- and perhaps most importantly, /setting limits on what characters can do/ but also /offering opportunities/loopholes that characters can use/

#+begin_quote
  Any mention of needing to understand a spell to be able to cast it properly.
#+end_quote

Absolutely $100% agree. It literally makes no sense if a character can be like "whoa, that's a cool dragon-destroying spell right there, how did you do it?" - "Oh, the incantation is /Draco Destroyerius/." - "Okay, /Draco Destroyerius/, wow it worked, thanks!"

In my theory of the HP universe, you /have/ to understand what a spell is and means before you can cast it. In my mind, knowing the incantation is next to useless--the only reason you need an incantation is to be able to strongly focus on exactly the spell you need. That's why nonverbal magic is so hard: have you ever tried talking/reading/praying/etc in your head? It's nearly impossible to do it in a way that doesn't have hundreds of images, sensations, and words leaping in and out of your mind's eye/consciousness. (This next sentence is true real life, not just my view of magic universe) That's why so many people recommend saying things /out loud/ as a way to organize your thoughts, figure out what you're thinking, and help solve problems.

#+begin_quote
  Any explicit denial of exhaustible magic.
#+end_quote

What do you mean here? Do you mean that there should be no such thing as a spell that you can only cast once or twice before you're tired/before you run out of... magicn-aether around you?

#+begin_quote
  Presentation of spells as related nodes in a theoretical structure rather than discrete and static objects.
#+end_quote

Absolutely. Spells are just a small aspect of magic; there is so much more.

#+begin_quote
  The presentation of magical theory as completely incompatible with the body of knowledge known as "science". E.g. a magical theory of matter which directly contradicts atomic theory.
#+end_quote

So you're saying you like it when magic is presented as incompatible with muggle science theory? Why so? To be fair, I don't know if I recall ever seeing an explanation of magic that was /consistent/ with muggle science.

#+begin_quote
  Complex magical theory which does not devolve into a science analogue e.g. that avoids the use of formulas that are reminiscent of the formulas of physics, only with magical units instead of physical ones. The best kind of magical theory is that which draws on philosophy, theology, alchemy, law, numerology, astrology, etc. Essentially a constructed narrative about some aspect of the world or human experience.
#+end_quote

Great point. I especially agree with theology and alchemy (simply because that's stuff I'm working on in some fics). I've only seen a couple fics even /touch/ on alchemy, which is insane, since Dumbledore worked under Flamel who was a famous alchemist! I'd love to see more alchemy. I just read a fic recently (hmm, was it Patron? I don't recall) where it described Albus as a master alchemist, and in one of his duels he did all sorts of cool alchemy spells.

#+begin_quote
  Pluralistic magical theory. That is, there not being a single, comprehensive and unified theory of magic but rather a large number of competing magical philosophies, which have different merits and may be suited to different areas of magic. Further, it's not the case that a single unified theory is possible and it simply hasn't been arrived at yet, but rather that there is no single "magical truth". Instead, many different narratives can be told about magic, all of which have validity (though this does not exclude the possibility of a magical theory being completely wrong, it just means that there are more than one which are right).
#+end_quote

I can go both ways here. If a singular, magical truth exists; a magical truth/theory out of which all "types" of magic are derived, then I can buy it. It's really hard to write a fic with that correctly, however.

#+begin_quote
  Single-word incantations.
#+end_quote

+1.

I read a fic awhile ago where there was a moderate focus on single-word incantations, because they're so much faster than other spells with multiple syllables/words. I vaguely recall a scene where Harry duels Snape using single-syllable blasting hexes. Anyway, what a great fic.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In theory I agree with you; however, I do enjoy the occasional guilty-pleasure indy!Harry where he steamrolls everyone politically. Anyway, I do like some political wrestling in fics. For example, minor things like

- so-and-so person who appears to be (or is) evil has diplomatic immunity so legally no one is allowed to touch him
- manouvering through certain laws (e.g. in a trial or arrest) using certain loopholes/by-laws
- aren't technically allowed to fight duels on foreign soil, or can be arrested for it

and so on.

#+begin_quote
  Small wizarding population (under 15,000).
#+end_quote

I actually disagree with this one. I really like it when the story plays with the global context of the magical world. Magicians, sorcerers, wizards, etc. all over the world with differing types of magic. Usually meaning that the wizarding population is in the millions.

#+begin_quote
  Strategic Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Definitely this one. I've seen too many dumb, blood-thirsty Voldemorts. "What? Harry Potter and the Order are attacking the gates of my fortress? WAHHHHH I'm mad, go, send a few dementors!" - "What, the dementors have been repelled? Send death eaters" - "More death eaters" - "Oh no, they're here now!"

(I assume a tall person would not jealously imagine their crush marrying someone also tall. Or at least, they'd specify someone /taller/.)

  She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the Potion and change.
