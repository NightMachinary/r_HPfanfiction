HPMOR and the partial transfiguration is one example.


** Lily and the art of Sisyphus, one of the best fics out there in my opinion. It's also a fem!Harry fic with a unique twist, an added bonus.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
