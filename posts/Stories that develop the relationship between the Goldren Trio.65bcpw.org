I'm looking for a story that takes a long, hard look at the relationship of Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Any walks of life appreciated: super!Harry, H/HR/RW, whatever.

After reading linkffn(Sum of their parts) I can't get this type of story out of my head.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has a great 'killer' Trio. Unlike in Canon, this Trio was far more proactive and dangerous, they were able to utilize school and outside resources very effectively.

  â€˜This universe has absolutely no magic, but super-science can create some similar results, and biochemicals can cause mutations that create superheroes and supervillains (although that wouldn't become public during this story's timeline). This is also a James Bond crossover, so expect that level of violence.'

WTF. Is this a joke, or is it actually replacing magic with Super Science?

**** It's not a joke, and it's a great story.

I personally like it better than Canon anyway.

The kids were a LOT tougher than in Books, and Dumbledore was actually cool, despite being a mean manipulative bastard.

This Harry, in author's own words, is a "very dangerous young man".

******* It's not. It's part of a crossover with parallel dimensions (sort of a prequel, even if it's the fourth in the series), including the canon dimension, though magic doesn't appear in this story.

"No Magic? No Harry Potter" was my reaction when I heard about it, but once I started reading it I was hooked. It works very well, and the relationships (canon pairings) are well-foreshadowed. In addition to that, the plot is just varied enough so it's not just rehashing canon with guns and Q-style spy tech instead of wands.

***** Yea, but it defeats the whole purpose of Magic itself, and many of the fields of Magic. For example, Alchemy is supposed to be mixing Science and Magic together to create Magical Objects and Transmutate Properties (Sort of like a Clunkier and more Archaic form of Transfiguration), yet, what would the Super Science Version of that be?

******* Agreed. I remember one philosopher saying that in the future, we won't be able to tell technology from Witchcraft, but I don't really think so. No matter how much Magic is stated to go against the laws of nature and manipulate them, it is also a part of nature, in the PotterVerse, Magic leaves traces, Magic is everywhere, Wizards create it and channel it, saying that Science can produce anything like it is very absurd, as Science is the opposite of Magic.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) is probably the best trio fic in the fandom. And one of the best in general.
