You need to read the Firebird Trilogy, by Darth Marrs.

And for a completely, and I mean completely re-imagined harry potter world, read this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]

Darth Mars keeps the major theme of Harry Potter, but changes just about everything there can be about it, it's like reading a whole new book.

It's so gripping and realistic and emotional, and I love each and every update.


** I tried to read The Firebird Trilogy but it was so incredibly depressing. Every character seems to get tortured and raped and the witches in charge sell muggleborn witches to the goblins so they can breed more goblins. If I wanted to put myself in s shitty mood, I'd just read the news.

** Realistic? Hardly.

Couldn't get more than two chapters into the story before I stopped reading it.

** Ehhh...pretty boring, lots of long, drawn-out scenes. Also, full of teenage "edginess". It's sort of /shoved/ in, as if there only to make sure everyone knows that, though they're writing a Harry Potter fanfic, they're really mature and into guns and pot and Gears of War and shit. Not like, into baby stuff, man.

Not even Darth Mars' best stories.

My fics have straight-up sex in them, and I do outright smut fiction too, so it isn't like I'm a prude. But it just seems...more blatant in the eye-rolling power fantasy and over the top adult, darky dark darkness than it has to be.

Tried three times to read it, never made it even halfway through. Would really help if the purpose of the story was put front and center, with stronger foreshadowing. Or, maybe not.

I think his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]] is a much better story. And that's a fucking /soul bond/ fic. But he does it well, really deconstructing how uncomfortable and invasive something like that would be.

So, no. Skip the Trilogy and try that one. Much better story. Much more "realism".

** It isn't the worst fic but there is certainly better out there.

** Darth Marrs is not as bad a writer as made out to be by many and though his work gets panned in places like DLP or this sub, I don't feel that it's entirely deserved. He writes technically competent prose. His biggest forte is that he's reliable, putting out new updates every week with few misses, a pattern he's been following for several years now and millions of words. As the fandom slowly dries up, as updates of quality stories become fewer and farther in between, this is no mean feat. This is both good and bad--his stories often drift, losing the consistency of, say, an Inverarity or Perspicacity, who write their stories to completion before posting.

As [[/u/firaxus]] notes, the /Firebird Trilogy/ is Grimmdark with a capital 'G'. It's truly a shitty world full of shitty people unworthy of saving, making the story an emotional downer to try to read. Harry. Hermione. Luna. Even Lily was a shitty person.

I do follow it, but I read it in fits and starts. I'll sit and trudge through a dozen or so chapters at a go, then I need to put it down for awhile and work up the nerve over the course of months to go for some more.

That the author has made the reading experience decidedly unpleasant is a pity because there's something here that could have been great. Truly, the worldbuilding is commendably unique, something that's rare to find in a fandom of a million-plus stories rehashing the same old same-ol'. That's really the attraction to this story. I just wish there were more bright spots to temper out the bad. (And that he'd get out of the harem rut: Hermione and/or Ginny + Luna + ... gets old after a dozen takes.)
