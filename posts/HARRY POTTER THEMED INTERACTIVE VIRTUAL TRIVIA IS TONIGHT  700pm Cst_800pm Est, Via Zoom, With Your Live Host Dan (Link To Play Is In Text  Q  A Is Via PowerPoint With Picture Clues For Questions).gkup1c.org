Click the following link tonight prior to or at 7:00pm CST/8:00pm EST and you'll be brought directly to the game: [[https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85106699719?pwd=UXJyOW1vU2RLNjhQSGFYd2V4clFhQT09]]

The Meeting ID is 851-0669-9719 and Meeting Password if prompted is 731080.

HOW THE Q & A WILL APPEAR TO YOU ON YOUR SCREEN: While playing tonight, you'll notice we were able to keep our unique interactive format and brand identity intact with the Q & A for the rounds displayed via PowerPoint along with picture clues for the questions. It will be as if you are playing with us at one of our weekly bars since the slides appear as if they are on a TV in front of you on your screen.

CONNECTING VIA ZOOM: The trivia game may be joined from any computer (PC or Mac) or any Apple or Android smartphone or tablet device. Joining via Mac or PC? If prompted, click “Join with computer audio”. Be sure to turn on your computer's speakers to hear the audio.

HOW TRIVIA WILL BE STREAMLINED TONIGHT: Once you are connected, the host will share the trivia slides and questions through Zoom. Each team should communicate via their own text messages, google hangouts, FaceTime, etc. The host will provide each team with a Google Forms answer sheet via the Zoom chat feature, which the leader of every team should download in order to submit their answers to the host at the end of each round.

Looking forward to seeing a lot of you tonight! Should be a blast!
