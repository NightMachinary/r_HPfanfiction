I've mentioned the story before, but one aspect of "Reclamation of Black Magic" that I like is the religious aspect. The Black Coven worships Morgana and celebrates certain holidays (not necessarily exclusive to their own beliefs) like Beltane, and it's mentioned that other characters and previous covens worshipped Nimue for instance. Are there any other stories where this kind of thing is relevant?

Now I don't really want to read a poor man's theology in a fanfic (or indeed, any theology at all) or feel like I'm back in a philosophy of religion class. But stories where the characters have some interesting religious views that are explored a bit (like what they celebrate, what it means to them, etc) is an itch I need to scratch at present. It doesn't have to be /the/ central theme but it'd be nice if the religious aspects were relevant to the plot for whatever reason. Maybe Morgana really hates Riddle for some reason so her worshippers are given a message to do...something.

Romance is fine, but it's optional at best (only 'meh' ones would be Hr/DM, HP/GW, SS/Hr or Hr/RW)


** I seem to recall linkffn(3766574) Prince of the Dark Kingdom having something along those lines, but it's been a long time since I read it, and it's incredibly long.

*** *Queen Mab*

Queen Mab (pronunciation: "M/ă/v") is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, where "she is the fairies' midwife." In the play, she is a symbol for freedom and also becomes Romeo's psyche after he realizes that he is also a floating spirit. Later, she appears in other poetry and literature, and in various guises in drama and cinema. In the play, her activity is described in a famous speech by Mercutio written originally in prose and often adapted into iambic pentameter, in which she is described as a miniature creature who performs midnight pranks upon sleepers. Being driven by a team of atomies, she rides her chariot over their noses and "delivers the fancies of sleeping men." She is also described as a midwife to help sleepers "give birth" to their dreams.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; mature!Snape; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (but with 50% more snark). See first chapter for preface. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. McG first contact/guardian. PM for pdf.
