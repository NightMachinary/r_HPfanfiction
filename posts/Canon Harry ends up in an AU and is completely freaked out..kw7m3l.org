Mentor Snape? "Excuse me, but who the **** are you and what the **** did you do with Snape?"

Ron the Great and Terrible? "Damnit Ron, you must have eaten some Potion-ed candies. Better get you to Saint Mungo's before it ****s your brain up even worse than it already has!"

Ginny the Potion Mistress? "Nice work, Gin, but you won't need that. Trust me, you DEFINITELY don't need it."

Dumbledore the Douchebag? "Well gee Professor, even I could come up with a better master plan than that, and I'm HARRY FREAKIN' POTTER! I honestly can't think of a worse insult!"


** I mean there is also Canon Harry wakes up in a WBWLed AU. Ok Harry lets make a pros and cons list pros my parents are alive and I have a brother. Cons they are dicks to me or abandoned me to the Dursleys anyway. Also I am in Slytherin that sucks but I seem to have some new friends who are not assholes so that is nice plus Hermione is still friends with me so that is good. Also I don't have to be the BWL great! Now if only I can find a way to have my parents and brother act like a real family this could work out really nice. 5 minutes later when it is revealed that Harry is the BWL well this isn't going to get any better for me is it...

/'Harry unzips pants'/'

That got me, though.

Then again, I love stories where both Harry and Ginny are not that experienced romantically and just fumble through it. Or where Ginny takes charge.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9737014/1/In-Another-Place]]) is fairly similar to what your asking although a more serious take. Both Harrys are AU though in that the first is suffering worse abuse than canon, but it's still got a Harry from a more canon timeline dealing with a world where everything's completely different.

  He had done it. This time, he had done it. His uncle had gone too far, and Harry had to pay the price for it. As he lay dying on the floor of his Number 4, Privet Drive bedroom, what unexpected force will save Harry? (Rated T, warnings inside, rating may go up later; AU).
