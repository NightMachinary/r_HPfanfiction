After reading basilisk-born, Bound in servitude and The girl who lived in three castles, I would like any wand all fics where Harry or fem harry(fem Harry is always preferred) is royalty, either by adoption or anything else.


** I strongly recommend linkao3(11631114). It's fascinating and extremely interesting. The worldbuilding, the characters, the plot -- it's just wow.

Royalty part: Salazar adopts Harry as a brother. They are royalty in Le√≥n.

If you get hooked, I would recommend then reading the whole series but Part 3 could be read as stand-alone, I guess. I started reading the series with Part 3 myself.

  Harry Potter's fifteenth birthday starts off just like all the others...for the first few seconds, at least. The gift he receives changes his entire life.

** Self Promotion if I may? In the recently released chapter of my crack fic, Nyarlathotep(Harry) crowns himself Shahanshah(King of Kings) of the Antarctic Principality and goes to war with most of the world.

**** Thank you! I'm currently working on a one-shot that'll explain the lore. There will be Romans, Fifth Founders, Knights, Pirates, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the Civil War, Gunslingers, WWI, WWII, Vietnam(maybe), and finally how Nyarlathotep became Harry Potter.
