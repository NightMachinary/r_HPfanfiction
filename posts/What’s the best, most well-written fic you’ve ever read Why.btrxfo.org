** Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild

I love this story because of how complex and beautiful the plot was.

​

It is a time travel fic, but there are no cliches at all!

​

When Harry Potter is attacked by the dementors while he was with Dudley, he gets transported thousands of years into the past. A mysterious person takes Harry Potter's place, so no-one gets suspicious. This fanfic never really tells you who took his place, but as the clues pile up it becomes more and more obvious, so there is no need for the author to tell you.

​

It follows two people, the Harry sent back in time, and the 'Harry' in the present day. There are many plot twists that I never saw coming, and it was a wonderful read. It is ongoing but very nearly finished.

​

I can not tell how awesome this is without spoiling it, so if you want to find out it would be a good idea to read it! I hope you enjoy it.

*** I second this story. Some of the plot points left me scratching my head at first but then amazed when it all came together. There are some things that at first don't seem lore friendly but are then used masterfully. For example, without giving much away: in basically the first/second chapter we are introduced to Merlin, but HP lore says that Merlin came from a certain time period and was in Slytherin. This incongruence is later resolved later quite brilliantly, strongly giving the impression that the author actually has a well thought out plan.

** Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 was absolutely incredible, although it's definitely a hard read. I've only done 1 read-through, and I've been trying to get around to reading it once more. It's a WBWL fic where James and Lily are still alive, but Harry still gets sent to the Dursley's (around age 8 I think). James and Lily never abuse Harry, but he grows up in the shadow of his twin Skyler. As he gets older he becomes more resentful of them, and feels the need to prove that he's a better wizard than Skylar. It's a much darker Harry because due to certain events he ends up living with Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers, and Voldemort. You can imagine what kind of childhood that leads to.

The reason I loved it so much was because of how the author writes Harry's character. Harry is not a great guy in this, but you can understand why he does the things he does, and you can sympathize with him. He‘s childish and naive in his resentment towards his family, but that's because a 13/14 year old is still a child. So many Dark!Harry fics have him characterized as an “adult-child”, where he acts like a fully grown man at the age of 13. This is a dark, angry, bitter Harry who has the understanding and outlook on life as a growing child. He's always a bit more mature, but that's because he goes through some horrible shit that forces him to grow up fast. But even through this, you can see through his “adult” act, and that underneath he's just a scared kid who wants to prove himself.

** "A better mirror" by BlueBeholder on AO3. Not very fond of the Fantastic Beasts movies (although the first one has grown a bit for me upon rewatching it), but this one is everything they should've been. A sequel to the first movie that completely ignores the events of Crimes of Grindelwald, and goes absolutely crazy deep into worldbuilding and historical accuracy, but in a good way.

  “And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer, because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit.” --Shane Koyczan, “To This Day”If someone told Percival Graves he'd spend his fortieth year as a fugitive on the run from MACUSA, in the company of an Obscurial, a smuggler, a Legilimens, and a No-Maj, he would've put them in an institution. But now, after a near-miraculous survival of captivity at Grindelwald's hands, he's become a wanted man because he can no longer in good conscience uphold the laws he'd once vowed to protect.This is the story of a man on the run, haunted by more ghosts than he cares to count, on a journey that will span an entire continent. This is the story of how Percival Graves saved Credence Barebone from execution; how he fled New York in Newt Scamander's suitcase; how he got something he never thought he needed: a family. Complete.

** Pretty much anything written by AO3 writer montparnasse is achingly beautiful and inevitably contains elegant, astoundingly vibrant prose, but my favorite is Skirt Full of Thorns ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8105836]]). It's Luna/Ginny and smutty (impeccably done, btw), but even beyond that, the way in which the writing manages to display in unparalleled prose the deep experiences of nuanced female characters struggling with a reality much more complex than J.K Rowling's teenage world makes it probably the best fanfic I've ever read.

Brilliantly creative plotting, hilarious, moving, everything a fic should be. It's one of the most popular fics ever written, so it's attracted its share of jealous haters, many of whom will downvote this I'm sure.

Edited to add: The folks who keep downvoting this, your stories have been favorited more than 24,467 times, right? That's what qualifies you to downvote this story?

*** I greatly enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]] and recommend that most people give it a try, but I can understand why people would downvote your comment. You pre-emptively accused downvoters of being “jealous haters”, but it's possible to dislike the story because of legitimate matters of taste. For example, many readers find Harry's know-it-all attitude grating (though there is a good in-universe explanation for this attitude, and the author does not intend Harry to always be right when he is acting like a know-it-all). Your accusative tone probably made people feel defensive on behalf of legitimate dislikers, leading them to downvote your comment. (I did not downvote.)

Asking people not to downvote your comment because the story has many favorites is also quite a stretch. One could make the reverse argument that you haven't personally written stories with that many favorites, so /you/ don't have the right to /upvote/ this story either. One must also consider that the FanFiction.Net Favorites system doesn't support “non-Favorites”, so even though many people like the story, it's possible that even more people dislike it. We don't have the data to determine what /proportion/ of readers enjoy the story.

**** I definitely don't think that the majority of the HPMOR hate comes from people who hate atheists or humanists.

I think that HPMOR can read as smug even if you agree with its morality. Just because you're an atheist doesn't mean you have to like how Yudkowsky or Dawkins or Harris or any other famous atheist approaches religion. Atheists can still find other atheists smug.

And even beyond all that (because I really think you went off on a tangent trying to turn this into an American atheism pity-party), just look at how HPMOR is structured: 660k words dedicated to one year. A needless (in my opinion, of course) War Game section. There are things to critique than the religion.

Not everyone who dislikes it in an anti-intellectual, or an anti-liberal, or an anti-rationalist.
