Almost all fics I encountered where Harry is not Boy-Who-Lived fall into one of the two categories. Either somebody else is BWL/GWL, but Harry is still protagonist or there is no prophecy.

So I'm looking for fics where Harry is neither BWL nor protagonist, but where protagonist is the BWL/GWL/whoever happens to fit prophecy in this world.

The only example I know of is an Unbroken Universe series by Robin4, and that's not much.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
