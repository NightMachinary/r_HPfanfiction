So, I'm thinking about writing A story that's basically the title. A story where Hermione is the central character, not a Dramione, not a harmony, not a Romione, but basically where I think she would've ended up had she not had a crush on Ron.

This means, no dark Lady Hermione, no Ron bashing, no mysterious powers or heirships given to her. Plain Hermione after the battle deciding to make her own way in the world and change things.

I wanted to get you guy's opinion on it, and get some of your ideas. Maybe I do add in a bit of the pure blood system from the fandom, and have her skirt her way around it and manipulate it to her favor.

I'm thinking about making her a professor, because I really don't see her as a minister of magic. I don't see her as an auror either. That part really didn't make sense to me.

Maybe it ends with a 19 years later scene, where as aunt Hermione she's wishing her nieces and nephews good luck at Hogwarts.

Or maybe it ends up where she adopts some of the war orphans, maybe even death eaters kids, and decides to teach them the light side.

Maybe she becomes a master of ancient ruins and runes and decides to excavate different Wizarding settlements.

The point is, she doesn't end up with anyone, she takes the Wizarding world by storm, and she owns being a Muggle born. No blood adoptions in validating her blood status, and her power is truly her own.

What do you guys think? Do you have any ideas? Please let me know.

Edit: As of June 21, 2020 the plot idea I have is that Hermione becomes a master in charms, and decides to use this to help free house elves without them having any magical backlash. She cannot date Ron because of pureblood standards, but he still respects her and they are still friends. Hurry and Ginny are happy together, in the pairings are basically the same as they are in the cursed child but Ron is engaged or dating someone else.

"B-b-b-but that's /boring!/ You can't make Hermione like her canon self when she can be Perfect!Pureblood!Princess!MarySue!Hermione! And no Draco romance? No Ron-bashing? No secret powers? What a fucking rip-off! I'm not reading this shit!" --- from the thoughts of the hardcore Hermione stans

Personally, I think a unique direction to go in is to make Hermione a Charms Mistress (her favourite class after Ancient Runes). I've read the super tropey Hermione fics (where she's good at /everything/), I've read the Arithmancy/Runes genius ones, I've read the Potions Mistress ones. I haven't really seen a Charms one.

*** That's an interesting bit of speculation; but it's far more likely that the downvotes come from the far more numerous Harry-centric mavens, who insist that Harry must always be the lead character and scoff at the idea that Hermione could ever amount to anything without Harry's wise leadership.

Also, Hermione as a Transfiguration master is a bit more likely, given this scene we get immediately after the sorting:

#+begin_quote
  On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (‘I do hope they start straight away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult --'; ‘You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing --').

****** McGonagall would have to take over as Headmaster, leaving the Transfiguration Master position open, and (as I quote above), she had expressed special interest in it early in canon.

That said, I think that Hermione being prepared to /teach/ a subject immediately out of Hogwarts would require an earlier divergence, where she works more on her magical skill and less on the social causes and Harry-related ones.

Hermione mentored by McGonagall is a very underused fic premise, IMO.

*** My issue is that Harry is lucky.

Harry has Voldemort saying only he can kill Harry.

Harry has decent reflexes.

Harry has an anti-Voldemort wand.

I've seen fics which have Hermione trying to challenge Voldemort, which without those advantages ends in a bloodbath for anyone who isn't Dumbledore.

** I think that Hermione working towards better treatment of magical creatures and equality for goblins, elves, werewolves, etc. Even if we were all skeptical or scornful of SPEW the ambition was admirable. Hermione started this organization with no support and defended it against everything. Along with what she would have learned from Lupin and from interacting with Griphook, I could see her making a big impact. Along with the fact that she is muggle-born fighting against a pureblood, centuries old aristocracy, there is a ton of directions that she could go.

** I've actually been looking for a fic (for a very long time - though I'm sure that it doesn't exist) similar to what you are describing (except for the professor part). Honestly, after the war, imo - I think its the best time for someone like Hermione to try and do a complete haul over. She's capable - a war hero, best friend of the boy who lived and friends with an old Pureblood family - the stage is literally set for her. Would be nice to see no pairing of her, Ron or Harry or if that is not an option (because it seems to me that fanficiton was created on the sole basis of pairing) then seeing each of them with a pairing that is not often used or new/unique (I know I'll never get that in a fic - but one can hope).

** Indeed. Non-'ship-oriented Hermione fics are hard to come by.

Some thoughts:

- In principle, you don't need any reason whatsoever to diverge from her canon destiny however you want; but in practice, I think it's more elegant if the changes all flow from a single cause.
- By the time the Battle of Hogwarts is over, Hermione knows exactly what she must do: they have a society to rebuild, and so she must go to work in the Ministry to fight for the rights of beings and beasts. In that sense, her post-Battle actions are a culmination of her Hogwarts-era work, starting from her defence of Buckbeak and continuing through her activism for House Elves. There ought to be a way for her to smoothly diverge from her path.
- If you want to play up the pureblood privilege, you could postulate that if she and Ron never worked out (without it being anybody's fault), the purebloods in the Ministry would be less accepting of her and getting actual reforms through the system would be difficult. But, the counterargument to that is that the Order had just won a civil war and were effectively dictating the terms of surrender to the Ministry: anyone who obstructed her could be simply fired.

Combining that with the Transfiguration master mentor!McGonagall idea, here's a possible sequence of events that diverges in Year 3 but that still mostly hangs off the canon storylines:

1. Buckbeak doesn't happen. Maybe Draco's reflexes are better, maybe he slips, maybe he exercises basic common sense. Ultimately, the hippogryph lesson goes without incident.
2. Firebolt still happens, but Hermione is no longer studying wizard law, and so she instead latches on to McGonagall both for emotional support and for magic and gets more deeply into Transfiguration.
3. The ending of Year 3 is as canon, except that they break Sirius out, he just turns into a dog and runs off. Hermione keeps the course load and the time-turner.
4. Years 4-6 are pretty much as canon, but Hermione mostly skips the house-elf plot, keeps up her classwork and extra Transfiguration studies, takes a huge number of OWLs, and gains an Animagus form, though not one that would significantly affect the plot, and it's registered and public, like McGonagall's. Too busy with schoolwork and extra studies, she never gets together with Ron.
5. She has to surrender her time-turner immediately after taking the OWLs, and it gets destroyed with the others.
6. Year 7 proceeds largely as canon, with minor differences, mainly brought about by Hermione being better at Transfiguration. Her animagus form is right there on the Wanted posters next to her human portrait, so it doesn't play much of a role. She pines for Ron less when he leaves, but, again, no major consequences. She doesn't quite figure out how to translate her magical skills to combat ability, so they still get caught by the Snatchers.
7. At the Battle of Hogwarts, she finally manages to let loose with a Transfiguration-based combat style, and manages to kill Bellatrix before Molly intervenes. (This could be either in the first round or the second.)

** Thoughts about the updated premise:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I still think Transfiguration works better, because it would create an interesting mentor dynamic with McGonagall or even Dumbledore.

Regarding house-elves, as far as we know, there is no magical backlash for free elves in canon, so I don't know if you intend to introduce that as an AU element. I don't think it's necessary: consider that if Hermione invents an easy spell that simply snaps house-elf bonds, that could already cause a lot of interesting conflict, since anyone can free anyone's house-elf.

#+begin_quote
  She cannot date Ron because of pureblood standards, but he still respects her and they are still friends. Hurry and Ginny are happy together, in the pairings are basically the same as they are in the cursed child but Ron is engaged or dating someone else.
#+end_quote

This requires a pretty heavy divergence. Either the Weasleys are no longer ideologically opposed to blood purism, which would make Ron to his family what Sirius was to his, or there are actual anti-miscegenation laws in place, which sounds like a very heavy and very oppressive AU, on the level of [[/u/Starfox5]]'s /Patron/.

*** And Hermione tore that system down in "Patron".

Really, what is the problem there? If you do not want Hermione to date anyone, just have her not date anyone. Problem solved.

**** I didn't come up with blood status as a reason for Hermione and Ron not getting together; the OP did.

The problem with it is that when you change a significant component of the setting like that, it's going to change a lot of other things. The status of Muggleborns in /Patron/ wasn't just a small tweak to the canon setting but a part of a major and coherent reenvisioning of the wizard society and its power structures.

If the author wants to go there, they can, but the difficulty of the world building is significantly raised, and the challenge of describing the new reality without boring the reader is added, since one can no longer lean on the reader's knowledge of canon as much.

In the and, I actually agree: there is myriad possible reasons for Hermione and Ron /not/ to get together, without having to introduce a setting element that requires a radical rethinking of the whole setting.
