** You can do this on Archive of Our Own. You can also sort by rating, other characters, etc.

** [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/][Ultimate Harry Potter FanFiction]] does that although it's only with Harry as one half of the pairing

** [[http://www.archiveofourown.org]] (aka ao3) is the easiest for me, [[http://www.fanfiction.net]] has this too but many people there seem to not put the pairings together as a pairing only name them as the main characters instead. So A Harry and Severus story may be slash, may also be severitus or something else involving them - i find it difficult to search there. Personally, I like ao3 for slash and ff.net for gen or het. There is also hpfandom.net which lets you search by pairing , see here [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/search.php]] Cheers

*** Archiveofourown is useless for me as I look for Ron/Hermione stories and most of them (and I do mean most) are actually Harry/Draco stories with Ron/Hermione as a background pairing. As far as I can tell it is not even possible to filter out the stories with Draco/Harry.

**** true ron/hermione is often a secondary pairing. you can filter out harry/draco though if you put in

-filter_ids:99

in the search column

** I think mugglenet fanfiction sorted their romance category by ship. Then there are character specific archives like Granger enchanted that sort by pair. FFN also let's you filter by pair, but that only works well back to a certain date, since the actual "pairing" thing is relatively recent and not all authors use it.
