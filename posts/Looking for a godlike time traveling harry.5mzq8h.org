  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  This one has a "very godlike" Harry. He uses his future knowledge in such a frightening way and has a lot of power to boot.
#+end_quote

That Harry was not really that powerful compared to his enemies. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort almost managed to get the drop on him.

If you want truly ass-kicking Harry in time travels, try "Reunion", linkffn(4655545), where hundreds of his enemies died in 'unfortunate accidents' before he even went to Hogwarts.

#+end_quote

Yeah, Harry is really powerful of course, but far from godlike.

IMHO the most godlike Harry is in linkffn(Core Threads), but I really didn't get very far into it at all (seems very obvious were it is going and totally boring). I just skimmed some later chapters and reviews after losing all interest in that story... seems completely off the rails in terms of power.
