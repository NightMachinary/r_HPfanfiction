I have read a lot of time travel fan fictions where Harry ends up in the “Marauder Era” and a lot of the time he becomes really close with James or doesn't really like anyone at all. Is there a fan fiction where Harry travels back in time and he and Lily become like best friends?

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

**** Okay, so I'm not quite sure if this is the fic I'm thinking about, but if I remember correctly then Harry is much closer to James & Co than to Lilly. I can't even remember Harry and Lilly being that close at all.

Well, I guess I give is a reread to refresh my memories ^{^}
