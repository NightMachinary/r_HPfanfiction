Are there any stories where a competent force takes over the ministry and all the people who only have jobs because there purebloods get fired? Including Author Weasley because be doesn't actually know anything about muggles?


** While interesting, the issue would be that non-Purebloods wouldn't be particularly more competent than Purebloods. Wizards are in general not good at being stern and ordered about anything, is the thing. I don't think, for the record, that there are that many Purebloods in the Ministry, because there aren't that many Purebloods at all. A lot of Half-Bloods with old /names/ who go around strutting, is more like it.

And Arthur definitely didn't get his job out of /favor/, I think, but rather because /no/ Ministry careerists simultaneously knew very much about Muggles /and/ cared, so he was the only candidate because at least he cared.

*** Arthur doesn't know much about Muggles, though. He does know a lot about enchanting Muggle stuff, and this is what matters for his job.

** Arthur is good at his job. His job isn't to work with them or blend in, that's more the obliviators or Muggle worthy excuse committee.\\
His job is to handle enchanted Muggle devices, to fix whatever it is they've done and remove the magic. He's clearly quite talented when it comes to enchanted Muggle objects, just look at the flying car.

When he gets promoted by Scrimgeour it's not to a muugle related job, it's to finding fake enchanted objects.

He's not a Muggle expert, he's an enchantment expert who happens to take more interest in muggles than most.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Most of the Wizengamot and majority of the Ministry, including Kingsley Shacklebolt, were executed for supporting Voldemort and subsequently a marriage law. Arthur, however, quit the Ministry before the revolution and worked on adopting Muggle weapons for magical warfare. This time, he would charm a flying invisible [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_tracked_armoured_vehicle][Warrior IFV]] instead of a mere Ford Anglia.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
