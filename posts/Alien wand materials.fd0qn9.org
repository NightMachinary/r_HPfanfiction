Wandlore, as we have so far come to understand it, is very heavy on symbolism. It takes a particular kind of person to wield a particular kind of wand, and there are many factors that are at play, some of which are in direct conflict. For instance, we see it often enough to be a trope - the basilisk/phoenix wand. This combination sounds cool, but is the symbolism associated with the two cores actually compatible? There are differing opinions, but I believe that in most cases, this wand would clash with itself. Perhaps a resolute and robust wood could be used to metaphorically force them together, but then they would only fight harder. Other wands, such as those containing human blood, for instance, would be even more strange to wield, and might take up more of a life of their own.

Adjoining to this, my actual point for this post is a question. What effects and/or possibilities may materials have that aren't native to earth, or known to humans, but do have their own history and cultural symbolism? One such instance would be the Mallorn Trees in Lothlorien, out of the Lord of the Rings series of books. These trees have a rich history and traditionally grow in very significant places, such as Valinor, Numenor and the aforementioned Lothlorien. Do you think it would be possible for, say, a lost wizard to harvest some of their wood and construct a working wand out of it? Many such woods exist all over fiction, all with their own history and unique cultural significance. Perhaps a wand made of such wood would only be wieldable by an elven wixen, or it would be completely overtaken by the Mallorn's massive significance, making the core all but meaningless. Perhaps the wood itself would be better served as the core. What's your opinion on this? Are there any fics which explore this further?

The second aspect of wands is then cores. Cores are important, and many fics lampshade this by giving nu!Harry a badass-sounding wand core, like thunderbird feathers, basilisk parts, his own blood, etc, without really taking into account the symbolism behind those things, and the wizard required to wield them. However, conversely, some fics change Harry's life, personality or even destiny, and still make him end up with the Holly wand. But that's not the point of this. Do you think there may be other substances capable of channeling magic to the degree of the three cores Ollivander uses? Perhaps a substance like Magicite, often used in many works of fantasy as a crystalline ore either infused with or created from pure magic, would work. Or would a highly emissive substance like this, which often has its own inner glow, not allow the flow of foreign magic through itself? Can you think of any materials from other works of fiction which might work, based on what we know about them?

I'd be very much interested in your opinion on this subject.


** Eh, not sure there's a definite answer to this. In HP canon, it seems unlikely that even Ollivander's view on the best magical wand cores being the ones he uses is true (some powerful stuff is mentioned in side material that isn't a dragon, unicorn or Phoenix core, like the one that Sayre lady has from some magic serpent).

But broadening out into fanfic, well, it can work however you want! Just have some general idea of what the wand parts indicate and don't have something stupid like a "best" combination that of course your MC will get. As for alien or other weird materials, I did consider this for an HP/Marvel crossover that I have a few unreleased chapters of (I randomly abandoned HP fanfic), where one of Thanos's followers is a sort of alien mage who's scythe weapon isn't a traditional wand per se (more like a magic staff), because wands are an Earth invention. But since I had it made out of vibranium, I thought it'd be interesting if that made it better suited for defensive spells. I dunno, something like that maybe.

Tbh I don't really see the point of a magicite wand cores since wand cores are already magical, but just make it interesting I guess, lol. Not just "Omega Wand because rare thing inside".

** In my personal headcanon of wands, the wood gives the wand character, preferences, and traits, while the core gives it personality and power, and the combination gives a goal. For example, Harry's wand.

Holly wood likes to act as a tempering agent for impulsive and anger prone wizards, it looks to promote growth, it is prone to dangerous and spiritual quests, it is associated with protection from evil, and is connected with the idea of death and rebirth. Wand wood is special in some way. Not any Holly tree can produce wand wood, there is something special about it, and every wand tree and even branch will have different characteristics that affect the wand.

Phoenix feather is also associated with death and rebirth, they are a preserving force. Phoenixes are protective, animated, prone to action, and picky. Harry's wand would carry specific personality traits not just from Phoenix in general, but from Fawkes in particular.

Together, these components indicate a wand suited to defensive and protective magic, especially against evil. It is a questers wand, and specifically wants the quest tied with its brother. It indicates the wands ability to learn and act on it's own to protect Harry, as seen during the Seven Harry's battle. And is practically prophetic regarding the end of the Voldemort conflict and Harry's sacrifice.

I think that for Alien or Other Universe wand components symbolism is key still. The wood of Lothlorien would certainly make for a good wand. I personally think that the wand wood must be plant matter and the wand core must be animal, but I think any magical animal would work.

*** Slightly disagree about the wand core having to be animal since iirc Dittany stalks can be used as a wand material in canon. They just aren't a great one.

Also not sure phoenixes even count as animals.

**** What would phoenixes count as if not animals? They might be beasts but a beast is still an animal

***** Un-Beings like dementors? Since they can't actually die apparently, and there's no evidence they reproduce.

******* If I'm not mistake, the only one of those we saw from Fawkes it was implied he still knew Harry and Dumbles. If that's the case then I don't think it counts as actually dying as we would understand it.

******** Well yes but honestly he's the only phoenix we get to see in the seven movies, I can't remember if we get to see that quidditch teams mascot in the movies.

Also there's no way that phoenix that was in that scene in CoG where the phoenix comes to Credence or Aurelius whatever you want to call him was Fawkes. And we get to see him have a burning day (I think)
