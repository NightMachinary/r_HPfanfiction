Think of an extremely bizarre Harry Potter fanfiction that captured your attention. I have created one myself. It is Thirty More H's, the sequel to Thirty H's. It is almost as insane as the original but it actually has a vague plot this time, who knew?

** Meh. The original was funny because its original (herp derp), if you're going to write a badfic, do it yourself and don't base it on someone else's work.
