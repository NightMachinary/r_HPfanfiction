** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=361][The List and its sequel The Oath]], by Brennus. An AU where Harry never goes to Hogwarts and meets Ginny in his early twenties. And yes, it's romance-centred and very fluffy.

** Cadmean Victory, just had to be mentioned.

Hp and the Lightning Scar by questionablequotation. The lie I've lived by jbern, though there's a lot more than just romance there. The hunt for bridal perfection, a hp/fem Draco story. Hp and the sirens song, h/daphne

Brennus writes some good romance fics.
