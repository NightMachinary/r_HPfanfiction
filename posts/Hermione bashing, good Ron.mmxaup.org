I read a lot of fics where either Ron and/or other Weasleys, or Ron, Weasleys and Hermione are bashed. Can anyone recommend any where Hermione is bashed, but Ron and/or the Weasleys are good?

I prefer no romance or at least that it isn't the focus, but I'll read it in pretty much any combination. No underage child/teachers, though.

Thanks!

Hermione and Percy are Ministry boot lickers.

Ron, Ginny, Neville and the rest of Harry's old crowd are in his corner.

Fred and George aren't really bashed but Harry definitely has no time for their BS anymore

** I just reread this one-shot by Yunaine: linkffn(4390267)

It's not a focus of the story, but is explained at the end. First time through I got to that part and was thinking "aww, here we go again" but was surprised. Also Good!Umbridge (wtf?!?)
