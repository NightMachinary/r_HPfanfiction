Idk how but Hogwarts ends up reading the Harry Potter books, and everyone is offended at how Harry described them.

Pansy nearly bursts into tears as she's described with a pug like face, Snape flushes in anger at being compared to an overgrown bat with bad teeth, etc.

Lol everyone getting offended at an 11 yo Harry being a savage sounds hilarious!

EDIT: This wasn't meant to be serious, just everyone reacting to how passive aggressive Harry was to people he didn't like (or didn't know yet) lol just thought it was kinda funny

** Snape is a teacher at a school full of teenagers.

Especially if you are teaching what would be 3rd to 4th year at Hogwarts you need to develop a very thick skin, a sardonic sense of humor and roast the little shits better than they roast you.

** I hate to be that guy, but a lot of fanfics take digs at the characters around Harry.

Alternatively, you could try doing a roast of Harry himself, possibly taking place when he's older, with the characters bringing up things like his inability to go one year at school with something trying to kill him.

****** Fair point, but I wasn't saying it was a bad idea or anything like that. I was just pointing out that tons of fanfics take shots at everyone around Harry, with varying levels of awareness of that fact to be expected of course.

In any case I just thought it would be interesting to go the other route and roast Harry as it seems like a fairly unique idea that occurred to me when I read the OP

I will also point out I posted before the edit.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's had a hard life, much harder than most people could have ever thought of. Unfortunately, it only gets harder on him in his fifth year. Finally he's had enough and decides to go all out for once, but when Umbridge fights back, it affects both his life, and possibly her freedom...permanently. This may sound like the story Exploring Harry Potter's Life. Well...it is. When reading this story, you will have to have the appropriate book beside you. This is a reading the book fic, without the actual story line. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. Labels: Paragraph = self explanatory.Dialogue line = One or two lines where a character speaks or does an action while speaking.Dialogue set = More than two lines where a character is speaking and doing actions.
