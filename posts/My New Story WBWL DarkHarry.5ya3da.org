**** Alright, a few things.

First off, since its just a basic requirement, really: Get names right. /Arabella/, not Arbella Figg in this story.

Then I have the same criticism for this one as I have for almost all - as in 99% of all Wrong BWL stories. I just don't buy that Lily and James would be so callous to one of their children. /At least/ your Harry has Remus as some sort of substitute, but the criticism stays the same. What I could buy is that Lily and James would struggle with balancing out the attention James and Harry receive. Since James is the famous one, caring for him and shielding him from the public would require more attention, leaving Harry with less time, but only involuntarily. I could also buy that James would have problems connecting with Harry, the studious bookworm. However, in the same vein I feel like Lily would have much more to talk about with Harry. My point is that it isn't necessary to demonize the Potters as super-uber-bad parents; some sort of wizarding Dursleys. It would be enough if society would force them into parenting decisions that often enough leave Harry behind.

Your writing is okay-ish for a starter, I'd say. Try to reduce adverbs as much as possible. However, adverbs describing how somebody said something are a mortal sin.

- replied sarcastically

- said hotly

Don't do that. Ever. As in, if you find yourself writing that, delete it and do 5 push-ups as punishment ;D

Another bit of writing advice: If your story could, in theory, be rewritten only using sentences beginning with "And then...", chances are you'Re not descriptive enough. You're writing a novel, not a chronology.

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck writing this. Everybody starts somewhere and your start is a pretty decent one.

****** I'd recommend sleeping over it. Think where you want your story to go and of course /how/ you want it to go.

If you want Lily and James to be the bad guys, that's okay too. There are plenty of people out there who buy that. I'm just saying that I, personally, don't.

But in my experience, immediately acting on criticism is seldom wise. Think about it. Then change whatever it is you feel needs changing.

With the exception of the adverbs. Kill those. No mercy!

****** "Said" should be the main speech verb to be used. The one where you don't really worry so much about the tone, yet have to precise who says what because it might get confusing and cannot rely on gestures.

If you have to infuse emotions, don't use said + adverb, use a strong verb instead, it convey the feeling much better and is not so jarring to read. said angrily is not strong, because it does not mean anything. How is the tone? Is it snapped, hissed, growled, bellowed, screamed, screeched, howled, scowled?

same for "sadly", it can be cried, moaned or sobbed.

"happily" can be chuckled, laughed, chirped, singed, sniggered, teased.

And then you have "confessed", "admit" "wonder", "yap", "squawked", "confirmed" which all tell information much better than said + adverb.

Of course verb + adverb can be used, but sparringly, to reveal other information that are not convertible through a verb. "hotly", "icily" are example of that. You can hiss, you can hiss icily or dangerously. You can also say "In a dangerous hiss" but that is also to be used sparringly.

The bottom of the line is that use speech verb and adverbs in a way that it will pack a punch. You would not threaten your kid of putting him in his bedroom at every little misshaps he does right? Otherwise it just loses its impact. The same can be said with verb speech, keep them when you need to make an impact, not because you absolutely want to convey your meaning across and want to hold your reader's hand while doing so.

** Congratulations on putting some words down and for having the courage to seek comments.

I'll assume that you're genuine in seeking to improve and the following are my impressions. I'm not trying to be overly harsh, just calling things as I see them:

I generally skim the first chapter of any WBWL fic I encounter to see if anything is different from the classic setup. If I were encountering your story for the first time, I'd basically scan it, then ten, maybe fifteen seconds later I'd decide on whether to continue. In this case, given that you've a comma fault in your third line and your last paragraph overuses dogs' cocks (!), I'd be inclined to X it and move on. It's the same with time travel fics: the first chapters are almost always throwaways. If you want us to read, you need to catch our eyes. We're picky like that.

As another poster commented, unless you're really shaking things up with the intro, you're better off for a WBWL story starting off /in media res/ and fill in the history as backstory. The train is a cliche starting point; perhaps a first potions lesson or a sorting might be better. (The sorting allows plenty of the Sorting Hat's injection of story points, so it's a convenient spot to use.)

Regarding style, the sentence fragments at the start didn't work for me. Voldemort isn't a feral beast, but rather a conniving, academic record breaker. The guy was brilliant and you'd imagine his thought processes to match.

Kill your adverbs. With fire.

Your paragraphs are rather long for fanfiction, making it a bit hard to follow. Also, and don't take this wrong, your sentences come off as... flabby. Like there's a lot of extra stuff that could be trimmed with a bit of discipline and broccoli. Much of what's stated could be shown through exposition.

You've a few cases where you lapse into present tense, which is somewhat distracting, and lots of comma errors, which are more distracting. You may wish to pay particular attention to this when you edit. Also, it might help to read aloud the dialogue. I don't know that a young Harry would call someone a Dunderhead.

Harry's brother as a Dudley stand-in is pretty boring and bog standard. While it might be the story you want to tell, it's going to be hard to hook readers if they feel they've read a dozen incarnations of this same setup.

** 1 thing I don't think anyone else has said, you switched tenses at the start. Your first 2 lines are in present tense and after that you switch to past tense. In general, tense switching is a bad idea, and unless you're really skilled, present tense is a bad idea in general.

** Grammar wise, there were a few mistakes but I see that other people have already pointed those out.

A few things I noticed:

- The Potters left the're children alone with a squib to go to a party when they know that the children are targets? Wouldn't they be to worried about the twins to go partying?

- Why did Voldemort use a killing curse on the door instead of something else? Bombarda, etc.

- Why exactly did the Potters get an alert that Voldemort was at their house? He knew the secret to the Fidelius, he had permission from Wormtail, so were there other wards? An Alert ward? Why?

- The chapter also seemed to end rather abruptly, Harry seemed to be halfway through a thought when it ended.

Normally I give a story two or three chapters to give me the facts, make sure they have decent grammar and give me a interesting and original reason to continue reading. So far I feel it's been rather generic so I am waiting for the next chapter to see where you go with the plot and if you make it intriguing enough to continue. Good Luck and I hope you do well!

*** The things you mentioned in order: The potters were more having Arabella babysit the twins. They were not worried that the Fedelius would go down. The next thing you mentioned is simple: my Voldemort is a lazy bastard. First curse that came to mind was the killing curse, his favorite spell, and he has a but of a love for theatrics he wants to look as impressive as he can to intimidate his enemies. An alert ward seems kind of a staple in my universe. Why they would have one and a fidelius. It has to do with the fact that it is a bit of a habit it wasn't an afterthought for plot convience. I was going to end this chapter differently, but I don't know which version of the chapter you read (the most recent is up now) but I made the ending a bit better (not much) I'm hoping to add better endings when I get better at writing :)

** There is a lot, and I mean a lot wrong with this.

1) It's written in a paragraph format, with thick chunks of exposition between every few pieces of dialogue.

2) Emotions aren't realistic. Is Voldemort a twelve-year-old girl? Why does he keep chuckling? Arabella Figg was capable of being in the presence of Dementors without being noticeably affected, I doubt Voldemort would scare her to the point of whimpering. Why did they leave a squib to protect their children anyways? Unless she had a noticeable contingency, it's pretty pointless.

3) Jimmy Potter? Do they call him that because he is James Junior? Like how people call a Robert, Bob for short? With the quality of this fic, I highly doubt it.

4) Can Dumbledore not be manipulative in this one, pretty please? I would rather him develop a close relationship with Harry.

5) Why does everyone call each other Honey? Do they not know each other's names?

6) "Harry said sarcastically", oh boy, using self-insert emotion are we?

Along with several grammatical issues involving the incorrect use of commas, and the non-use of semi-colons where they would fit.

*** I have noticed these errors via other commenters, and they presented their issues with the story in a more constructive manner. With that said I have fixed the problems that you brought up that I recognize as a problem. Arabella Figg was terrified of the dementors in OFTP and at the thought of Harry putting his wand away she freaked out and told him to keep it out. Voldemort is also the most horrifying dark lord of their time since Grindelwalde, he finds humor in other people's suffering. He chuckles at how much idiocy he see present he knows he could have done better. I have never like manipulative dumbledore and would love to see him try and keep Harry in the light. Jimmy's full name is James Charles Potter after his grandfather. Honey is a name many mother call their children and many husbands/wife's call their spouse and it is not uncommon for someone to use the same name for both children and spouse. Thank you for you comment no matter how rude it may have been I do like the idea of a dumbledore close to Harry. Try to be more constructive in your criticism especially to a new author they will appreciate it, and who knows maybe they write the next POTDK... -KB

You used it four times in a row in the same scene, it's redundant, no matter the real-world connotation.

No, stop with these constructs of light and dark, magic doesn't choose sides. Also, if you're going to make Dumbledore attempt to be Harry's father-figure, make sure not to make it completely random, like him calling Harry to his office and randomly taking out a book of questionable spells that Harry stowed away. Maybe give them a common interest, like Harry petitioning Flitwick to make a Duelling team, Flitwick confronts Dumbledore about it, Dumbledore responds that he will take care of it. He calls Harry up to his office and states that he is going to train him in the art of Duelling for the School-wide tournament starting in February and since he is already good in his classes, the teachers will trust him with independent study.

Don't let Harry fall into the same habits as his canon counterpart, and since he has a different personality remember to give him a different wand (Don't make it some op construct that cannot be destroyed, however, make it something simple with a singular, yet powerful core).

Magic Cores shouldn't be a thing, but magical capacity should be.

I think that's about all the advice you need to make another Prince of The Dark Kingdom.

***** Well, this comment is a lot better than the other, constructive at least. I had not realized the use of honey four times in a row it is repetitive and I will change it. My portrayal of Voldemort is an extremely powerful and overly cocky sadistic bastard... I think he would laugh at everybody else's mistakes whilst not recognizing his own. Dark is a construct for magic in the world of hp or at least my own but rather than being evil and all powerful. It is obscure and looked down upon and more commonly used to hurt others. Anyways forgetting. My over defensiveness, I love the idea of a school wide dueling tourney and fumble trying to father Harry a bit. What I have in mind for Harry is him being manipulated through his scar and tom riddles diary much more than he was in canon. Thanks -KB

****** Sounds like a good idea/plan. I'm assuming that Harry's Duelling-style would be influenced by that; the whole Voldemort stand-still and reroute spells back at your opponent, then going for the Offensive. Would be interesting to see in combination with a Dumbledore Hyper-Offensive style. Although, remember, don't be afraid to use a trope. There are no bad tropes, just bad writers, I hope you succeed, I will be looking forward to new chapters to come.

****** Just a quick point from the UK, honey is a term that is very rarely used in this country if at all. If I overheard someone calling someone honey, I'd assume they were either American or had been on a Netflix binge. Pet names aren't really a thing here. Perhaps 'love' or 'sweetie' at a push?
