I'd be grateful for any recommendations if so!

I would also be grateful to hear your other favourite Fleur centric stories (it feels a little bit like I've exhausted ff.net though!)


** In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]) she and Harry are still against evil, but theyre not above killing and manipulating.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** She's an evil minor character in linkffn(to fight the coming darkness by jbern). And in linkffn(unspeakable things by darth marrs).

Neither has her as a major character though.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

** Hmmm... in Darkness Ascendant she's the host of Angelus power but has no control over it. She HATES Harry and doesn't understand why since she's also incredibly attracted to him, culminating in a hatefuck that will produce the three gauntlets of power that take over three other people's lives. She's the host of evil but isn't evil.
