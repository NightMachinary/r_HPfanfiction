Hey everyone

I've recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7896457/chapters/18037123][whispers in corners]]. Hope I linked that correctly.

It has a really cool concept where Harry uses his newfound powers as master of death to solve crime. I don't want to spoil too much for those who haven't read it yet.

My question is: does anyone have any similar stories that are preferably NOT SLASH? Because I'm a straight guy and the slash in this fic was very explicit.

Thanks a bunch!


** Oh please it's tame in comparison to others but I would be interested in some similar fanfics too. For me with slash of course. I found “Names Confused” with has no slash at the beginning just in the later chapters a bit more pronounced but barely mentioned.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
