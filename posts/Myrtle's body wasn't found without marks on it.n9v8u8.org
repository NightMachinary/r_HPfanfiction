The Headmaster of the time was all too quick to blame the death on Hagrid's Acromantula. I propose the following, which I have seen in at least one fanfiction so far: Myrtle's body was desecrated in some way by Tom, either to perform the Horcrux ritual, to frame Hagrid's Acromantula, or both.

â€‹

This explains why nobody was looking for a creature that could kill without leaving a mark, and nobody was looking for someone using AK, given that the only evidence for the use of an AK is the lack of marks on the body. Discuss?


** I always assumed that while Hagrid was accused by Tom, he was never convicted for the murder because there was no evidence supporting it, which is why he is still working at Hogwarts. However, during the investigation it came to light that Hagrid was raising a smuggled deadly creature (even if it wasn't large enough to be a man-eater yet) in a school full of children and without the magical cabablity to restrain it, which was an expulsion and possibly imprisonable charge in its own right. Remember that even when Fudge has him imprisoned in book 2, nobody ever claims that Hagrid was a murderer, just that he was a suspect for a time during the previous investigation.

***** well that was a great read. Thanks for sharing it mate.

Honestly, I am 100 % willing to adopt this headcanon. It just makes so much sense and... well Dumbledore is canonically willing to break the law to aid good people. Just look at the entire time-turned incident. That is a major crime to free 'an escaped mass-murdered' in the eyes of the law.

**** Like: Avada Kedavra was developed by imitating the Basilisk Gaze but adding some elements of bombarda onto it so instead of reflecting off things, it explodes them, but magically protected objects have the potential to override that. So maybe the mirror of Erised can cause this effect but your hand mirror would just explode.

I don't remember a mirror in Fate, do you mean Stay Night? I couldn't really get into any of it beyond the original trilogy.

** I choose to maintain that the fact that Hagrid was obviously innocent is the reason he was never convicted of a crime. His biggest punishment was being expelled from Hogwarts, which by extension meant his wand was snapped because that's what happens to wizards who get expelled or otherwise leave school before passing their OWLs.

Hagrid's fate is a compromise. The Ministry almost certainly wanted Hagrid to take the fall for what happened. Dippet and Dumbledore both knew he didn't do it. So they refused to have him carted off, and instead just expelled him. As much as I like Hagrid, to be brutally honest, he deserved the expulsion. He had an ACROMANTULA in an UNDERWEAR DRAWER. In SCHOOL. Acromantula are class five dangerous creatures. They are intelligent and eat other intelligent beings as their primary food source, with humans being preferred. I like Hagrid, I really do, but that's far, far over the line.

Hagrid got expelled for Aragog. He also took the blame for what happened to Myrtle, but was never convicted for it, because there was no proof. Likewise, Riddle was obviously up to something, but there was no proof that he did anything wrong either. Hagrid being blamed for Myrtle's death is circumstance. He was expelled for keeping a dangerous creature, and some dangerous creature killed a girl at school. Even if there is no conviction, what will everyone THINK happened? Obviously they'll assume Hagrid was responsible.

And that's the situation we arrive at in CoS. Hagrid was never convicted of a crime, but he had his wand snapped and was expelled. Everyone assumes he had something to do with it, even though there's no proof. When Fudge needs to be seen doing something, he goes after Hagrid first, because of course he does. He's the only lead anyone besides Dumbledore has on who was actually responsible. It all lines up.

*** I agree with almost everything, but I think he would be more frowned upon if it was so obvious that he did it, as in "he has a deadly creature hidden in the castle and a deadly creature killed a student". Maybe what raises doubt is the fact that Aragog was too young and therefore uncapable of killing a human and everyone could tell Hagrid lacked common sense more than he was evil. They blamed it on him because they needed someone to take the fall and had no idea who was responsible for her death, but they knew he wasn't guilty. Hagrid just happened to have Aragog, which by itself is a reason for expulsion.

Ps.: I think the magical world handles diversity really bad. They only have one school in Britain / Ireland with no special ed for students like Hagrid, who has a different concept of danger (which you would expect if he is half a giant) and Lupin, who gets violent and deadly once a month. They have the right to be provided with proper education (I'd say the Ministry and Hogwarts' board are responsible for providing education for all wizards and witches within school age) but at the same time students and staff must be safe.

There could be a second school or a secluded part of the castle / school grounds that handles this. It would help decrease prejudice and also give everyone an equal opportunity to be a part of the magical society. How many werewolves actually disdain of Muggle-borns? How many of them were on Voldemort's side just because they were promised dignity? I'd say the vast majority.

*** Ok, I agree but: Hagrid was like, 12 or 13 at the time, he's a few years younger than Tom.

He, being a half-giant is much more resilient than regular humans and have a different perspective on what is dangerous and whatnot. As an adult, he just doesn't see eye to eye about his creatures, imagine as a teenager. And Aragog was still really young, he said it himself.

As much as I understand, why he was expelled, I think a lot of it came from the need to find someone to blame. They found Aragog because of Tom and decided to say it was the one to kill Myrtle, I bet of they investigated they'd find out she wasn't poisoned by the spider at all.

** Alternatively, perhaps Tom claimed that Hagrid had harvested venom from the acromantula and used it to poison Myrtle.

I'm sure they'd be able to tell that she wasn't poisoned if they did an actual examination, but they clearly weren't too concerned with one random muggleborn girl.

** I've once read a fic where Harry goes to Dumbledore and does his best Karen impression and is about to kick over an anthill about getting Hagrid his wand back...

And Dumbledore replies, cool as cucumber, that of course it was a cover up! Because Hagrid took the blame AND the evidence was inconclusive all that happened was an expulsion - and Hagrid was allowed to stay on the grounds. Tom Riddle's Award for Services was a bribe, and Headmaster Dippet's method of keepin his enemies where he could keep an eye on them, at least somewhat.

A new investigation into things would not improve Hagrid's situation - if it was discovered he had an acromantula (and it could not be hidden from a full investigation), Hagrid would be facing Azkaban time for raising a 5X beast without license, bringing it to school where it could attack children and attacking Tom (even if he wasn't hurt).
