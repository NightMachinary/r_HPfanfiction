** 1.

Marietta, at the age of eleven, loved horses above all else. She couldn't help but feel the slightest bit insulted when her mother's friends laughed that all girls went through that phase. She wasn't all girls; she was unique.

On her first morning at Hogwarts, when she awoke to find a copy of /Black Beauty/ at the foot of her bed, she assumed that it had been a gift from one of her honorary aunts. Aunt Abigail, perhaps. It seemed like the kind of thing Aunt Abigail would do.

Then she saw, through wide, sleepy eyes, that all of her roommates' beds were adorned with books. There were two copies of /Hogwarts, A History/; a book of tips on avoiding homesickness; and what looked like a silly mystery novel that Marietta was inclined to borrow at the first opportunity.

When she and her roommates stumbled yawning into the common room, they learned that it was tradition for Ravenclaw students not to tell anyone else about the peculiar enchantment unique to the Ravenclaw dormitories: each night, a book would materialize on the foot of each student's bed. The book would be based on each student's dream.

“If you don't want the book at all, or you're finished with it, you put it on one of these shelves,” the prefect explained, gesturing to a handsome bookcase beside the fireplace. “They'll vanish in the night, and turn up on some other student's bed. Never feel bad about keeping a book you truly love, but don't keep them all just to keep them.”

Marietta and the other first years nodded enthusiastically.

“Now,” continued the prefect, “I want you to swear on Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem that you will never tell a soul outside Ravenclaw House about the secret of the books."

“I swear,” the first-years repeated in unison, and the prefect led them all to the Great Hall for breakfast.

There was so much to see and do and learn in her first few days at Hogwarts that Marietta barely had a chance to read her book, eager as she was. Other books arrived for her, all about horses: a slim non-fiction volume about the Abraxans of Beauxbatons; a novel about a teenage girl who saved an abused winged horse without her parents finding out; and another Muggle book, this one called /Misty of Chincoteague/. There would never be enough time to read all of the books!

But it was /Black Beauty/ she most craved. Her favorite character was a horse named Ginger who had a reddish coat and was a long way from home. Marietta had reddish hair and was a long way from home.

On Friday, she eagerly curled up in a chair in the common room and read as fast as she had ever read... only to learn that Ginger died a horrible, painful death.

Marietta burst into tears, right there, in front of everyone.

Her pretty roommate, Cho, was the first one to ask her what was wrong. Cho walked in circles with her while she dried her eyes and didn't make her feel silly for crying over a book (or for being homesick, which Marietta haltingly admitted that she very much was).

“Let's put /Black Beauty/ on the shelf,” Cho suggested.

Marietta refused. It was the first book Ravenclaw House had ever given her, and it was one she would keep.

Cho was the first friend Ravenclaw House had given her, and she would keep Cho, too. She promised herself that one day she would repay Cho for her kindness.

2.

Marietta developed a real interest in history during her second year at Hogwarts. She learned that most Ravenclaws received /Hogwarts, a History/ at least once after they dreamed about school. She also received biographies of the Founders and one of Merlin. Her favorite, though, was the fictionalized account of the Goblin Rebellion of 1512. Who would have thought that goblins had time to fall in love in the middle of a rebellion?

Her research told her that the Goblin Rebellion of 1512 hadn't really happened that way, but she didn't mind.

3.

Gilderoy Lockhart came to teach at Hogwarts during Marietta's third year.

Suddenly, she couldn't dream of anyone or anything else.

His smile.

His eyes.

His hair.

His hands, and how they would feel if they brushed against her skin...

Every morning, Professor Lockhart's books appeared on her bed. /Magical Me. Holidays with Hags. Break with a Banshee. Gadding with Ghouls. Marauding with Monsters. Travels with Trolls./

She thought of arguing that she was just interested in Defense, now, like she'd been interested in horses during her first year and history during her second.

One of her roommates raised an eyebrow and told her to come off it. Then she held up her own copy of /Voyages With Vampires./

When they all put their duplicate Lockhart books on the shelf to be vanished, some of the boys teased that no one should have bothered spending hard-earned galleons to purchase the required Defense books that year. The girls loftily informed them that Professor Lockhart was one of Ravenclaw's own, not even twenty years out of school, and that their display of house pride was natural.

Few of them dreamed of anything but Gilderoy Lockhart that year--- until their prefect, Penelope Clearwater, was found petrified.

Then they dreamed of ice and death and also Gilderoy Lockhart. /Year with the Yeti/ appeared on every bed in Marietta's dormitory for two weeks straight.

​

4.

Fourth years were much too busy with classes and friends and boyfriends and clubs to wake up eager to see which books had landed on their beds. Sometimes Marietta put the books on the vanishing shelf without even looking at them.

She used the extra time to experiment with her hair and her makeup. Her reddish-gold curls had grown long, and people were starting to say that she was pretty. She wasn't as pretty as Cho, of course. Everyone from Cedric Diggory to Harry Potter was gazing lustfully at Cho.

(Cho still read her books, which were almost always about Quidditch. Marietta still thought she would rather ride a horse than a broom.)

​

5.

If Marietta had thought she was too busy to put much stock in the dream-books as a fourth year, that was nothing to how busy she was as a fifth year.

Marietta's mother worked for the Ministry of Magic, and it was universally known that no one worked for the Ministry of Magic without achieving top scores on OWLS and NEWTS.

Marietta was going to make her mother proud.

She laughed and she dated and she spent three nights before the Yule Ball fussing with her hair, but above all she studied.

She started to look at the books on her bed again. Some of the history books from her second year came back to her, along with heavy academic tomes of all kinds. Often, in the morning she found just the book that would help her finish the essay she had labored over the night before.

She did well on her OWLS; she was sure of it.

Then Cedric Diggory died, and no one in Cho Chang's dormitory slept well enough to dream for the rest of the term. There were no books on the beds in the morning.

It was as if the world had changed completely, and yet not at all.

*** 6.

Before Marietta left for her sixth year at Hogwarts, her mother told her over and over again that she must be respectful of Dorlores Umbridge.

/"Nothing is more important, Mari. Nothing! You need to respect the Ministry, do you understand me?”/

Marietta understood.

She put it out of her mind as she listened to three of her roommates grouse that Cho had better stop crying and let us get some sleep, or else she can sleep in the common room!

“Right, Marietta?” asked Bridget.

Marietta draped her arm around Cho's shoulders and glared at Bridget. Cho's grief mattered far beyond the inconvenience of not sleeping.

Still, Marietta was relieved the next morning when there was a book on the foot of each bed. Everyone had slept. Everyone had dreamed.

Cho's book was called /Healing After Loss/. With a flash of anger, she set it on the bookcase to be vanished.

Marietta's book was called /The Metamorphosis/, by Franz Kafka. She thumbed through it and had no idea what her dreams and her bed were trying to tell her, so she set it on the vanishing shelf beside /Healing After Loss/ and told Cho that yes, she did have to try to eat something before their first class.

The other students didn't gaze at Cho in rapture anymore. Often Cho and Marietta were alone, with Marietta desperately trying to help Cho relearn spells that Cho had done perfectly before Cedric's death.

To be fair, one boy kept staring at Cho, and that boy was half-mad little Harry Potter. Cho came home from their dates in tears, and whatever benefit of the doubt Marietta had been willing to give the boy evaporated.

But Cho seemed to like him. And Cho dragged Marietta to a secret meeting at which half-mad little Harry Potter announced that he was going to teach the older students because he was just that brilliant, and he was going to flout the authority of Dorlores Umbridge, because he didn't have a mother whose career could be ruined in the blink of an eye.

Marietta hated the whole thing.

She had promised her mother.

Harry made Cho cry.

But this was the only thing that had interested Cho in half a year.

So, against her better judgment, Marietta went.

For weeks on end, every book that popped up on Marietta's bed was about mothers and daughters. Terrible, ungrateful daughters. Mothers who sacrificed. Mothers who died. (The irony of it was that one of the books was an unauthorized biography of Lily Evans Potter.)

A Muggle book called /Beloved/ was on her bed the morning that Marietta followed her own counsel and confessed to Professor Umbridge what she had done.

That was the last book she received that year. She read it over and over again in the Hospital Wing as Madam Pomfrey tried in vain to remove the pimples that spelled out the word SNEAK across Marietta's face.

The pimples were round and hot and swollen and they hurt.

Even after Madam Pomfrey managed to reduce the pain, she couldn't vanish the pimples. When she suggested that Marietta go to class regardless of her appearance, Marietta hyperventilated and fainted from the pain in her chest.

Cho brought her homework and class notes to the hospital wing for the rest of the year.

​

7.

The pimples faded over the summer, but the word SNEAK still screamed at Marietta each time she looked in the mirror.

She considered not returning to school.

But she had to get her NEWTS. She had embarrassed her mother enough.

Each night, she dreamed that her face was whole again. (It would never be; at least some of the pimples were going to scar.)

For the first six weeks of the term, all of the books she received were makeup tutorials. They were useless. No amount of makeup could fix her.

For the next six weeks, all of the books were about people with scars. A child who was so deformed by a fire that her classmates ostracized her. A man who spent his life seeking revenge against the soldier who had cut his face as a boy. Evil pirates; evil queens; evil stepsisters; evil werewolves. Good people, it seemed, did not have scars on their faces.

After scars, she dreamed of other deformities. /The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Hiding From the Mirror. The Ugliest Witch in the Land./

She didn't date or talk to her friends much anymore. She didn't even like to watch Cho play Quidditch; there were too many people around.

She studied. She thought she'd done well on her NEWTS.

When the NEWTS were over, she cleaned out her trunk and found the first book Ravenclaw House had ever given her.

/Black Beauty./

She read it.

She cried.

Her tears washed off her makeup.

/SNEAK/.

“It doesn't look so bad anymore,” whispered Cho. “Really.”

It was a lie and Marietta knew it.

“I loved this book,” she said, turning it over in her hands. “Even though it always made me cry, I loved it.”

“I know,” said Cho.

Marietta put the book on the vanishing shelf. She didn't want anything that reminded her of Ravenclaw House or Hogwarts anymore.

All the reminders of school she would ever need were written across her face, written more boldly than any book.

** Unfortunately the enchanter at the time wasn't aware of how recursive loops function and after a particularly bad nightmare, darker and darker books appear every morning as the poor traumatised Ravenclaw can't help but read them leading to worse nightmares.

Soon enough the Necronomicon sits at the foot of the bed one morning. A week later the 5th year is offering blood sacrifice to the giant squid and singing the song the ends the world.
