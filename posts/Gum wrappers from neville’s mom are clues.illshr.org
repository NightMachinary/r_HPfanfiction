:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all!

Just had a random memory of reading a fic where the wrappers that neville's mom (maybe dad, too) we're giving him had clues on them. I wanna say they were being held in st mungo's, maybe drugged?

I know it's a long shot with just one random subplot but I'd really appreciate it if anyone has any ideas!

EDIT: [[/u/kyella14][u/kyella14]] gave some additional details in the comments about the fic I'm looking for! Here's what they said: “Neville keeps all the gum wrappers and eventually they figure out that some of them have a letter written on them. They put it all together like a jigsaw and it comes out with a sentence that says something like ‘get me out of here'. Neville is devastated for missing the signs all these years. After they dig deeper, they realise that the Healer in charge of the Longbottoms' treatment at St Mungo's has been deliberately feeding them potions that will cause them to regress instead of heal, as the Longbottoms have some kind of information locked away in their heads that the Healer does not want known. Something to do with one of the Unforgivables---specifically how to counter/nullify it.

The Healer is working for either Dumbledore or Voldemort (helpful, I know). I'm tempted to say Dumbledore, but I'm genuinely unsure...”


** i'm pretty sure it's called “Becoming Neville” on ff!

*** Hmmm I'm not sure. Harry was the main character in the fic I'm talking about

**** If it's not that one then it's probably an inspired fic. Don't know of another which goes in hard on the conspiracy like that one does.

**** linkffn(2736892)

They're both named characters in this fic. It's the only one that I remember with the premise that's not a plagiarized re-upload.

** This... is hurting my head because I'm pretty sure I know what fic you're talking about but I don't remember the name either. I'll provide some info on what I remember, hopefully will help someone else find the fic or may jog your memory---Neville keeps all the gum wrappers and eventually they figure out that some of them have a letter written on them. They put it all together like a jigsaw and it comes out with a sentence that says something like ‘get me out of here'. Neville is devastated for missing the signs all these years. After they dig deeper, they realise that the Healer in charge of the Longbottoms' treatment at St Mungo's has been deliberately feeding them potions that will cause them to regress instead of heal, as the Longbottoms have some kind of information locked away in their heads that the Healer does not want known. Something to do with one of the Unforgivables---specifically how to counter/nullify it.

The Healer is working for either Dumbledore or Voldemort (helpful, I know). I'm tempted to say Dumbledore, but I'm genuinely unsure...
