Hi all.

I've always wondered what would change if the above happened.

Does anyone have any fics they can recommend?

Cheers.


** linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) is brilliant. Very clever and tense and does a deep look at Remus running the Order during the first war. I think I was more tense at the end of this than Deathly Hallows.

It is a wolfstar fic, I don't know where you stand on that but if your not ok with it then don't read it. The characters are well developed, theres no smut for the sake of it, its very plot driven but the wolfstar is the main driving force.

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

** This reminds me of a groundhog day story centered around this day, and that story goes over every possible outcome in quite a humorous manner. After some time, it goes off the rails (as you would expect from somebody stuck in groundhog day with no way out)

The story is DOOM Day
