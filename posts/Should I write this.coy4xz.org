I've been thinking about this idea for several months now and I don't know how it would be received.

I want the story to be focused on an OC (Harry's sister) and it'd be heavily AU.

So, my question is, how do you think it would be received/would you read it? My point of doubt is the combination of an OC as a main character and the heavy AU, because I'm sure that a lot of people would at this point say that it's basically its own story. What's your take on it?


** Some questions

How AU ?

If Houses are still a thing,what house is the OC in ?

What is her friend group ?

What are her flaws ?

What is the central conflict ?

*** The Au would start, at first, as different choices made by characters. Further on in it'll expand to how the Magical World is like around the globe, this'll be different from canon because I've just read the 7 books and 8 films and any holes I have will either be filled in by how I think it'd be or Googled.

I'm unsure of the House. On one side I'd have her in Slytherin because she's a good bit more ambitious than Harry. On the other hand I'd have her in Hufflepuff because she's loyal to the ones that can win her trust.

Not really decided on a friend group, it would probably come down to what house she's in. Two members I've decided upon are Harry and Hermione. Harry because they're pretty close and Hermione because she'd have a great interest in magic, both in learning applications and learning how it works. I want her and Hermione to have a rivalry, but not one of those you see normally where Hermione can't take that someone can do something better than her, but a friendly one where they're urging each other on to do better.

I'm not sure what you'd call it, but I guess wrath fits. She can be quite callous, (eg. she's not afraid to harm others to save something she holds dear).

The central conflict shifts throughout the story. Initially it's Voldemort, but I've put my own twist to it so it isn't the standard Horcrux Hunt. I can't realy write about the conflict later on because it'd spoil quite a bit, but as said before, it'd explore the rest of the world.

**** I would think " loyal to the ones who win her trust" is a Slytherin quality

** Is that all you have as your idea or all you are willing to share right now? Plenty of people read fics with OC main characters and plenty read fics where Harry has family members.

What you have there is a small plot point, not a kicking off point for a story. What kind of AU it is is and what the plot is are far more relevant to the question of if people will be interested.

Is it a canon rehash told from the point of view of Harry's 9 month younger sister with few to no changes? Unlikely that people will be interested. Who is this sister? Twin, younger sister, older sister, adopted sister? Are Lily and James alive? What happened to her when Voldemort attacked, why is she important to your story, what is her goal, what is her drive, what are her conflicts, how will she change the world by existing? Those are important questions.

*** I'm willing to share more if you've got any questions, I'm just hesitant to post it all because I know myself and I'd post some major spoiler.

**** I'd recommend working out a "back page summary" of the story. There needs to be enough about the plot available to potential readers for them to want to read at all. It's nice to not want to spoil major plot points but nobody will read if they don't know anything other than that the main character is Harry's Sister.

The setting and scenario of a story is not a spoiler.

**** And? We cannot tell you anything intelligent if you don't spoil the story to us. If you don't spoil it, just write it down and let us review the result.

** There is never anything wrong with trying to write a story, but that said make sure it actually deviates from Canon in a meaningful way.

Nothing worse than starting an AU and finding out it's just canon with some slight changes

** I would read it. But if your going AU dont be afraid to fuck with things. Make it weird! The best AU's are the ones that change everything completely. Imagine a fic Naruto styled. That is AU!

Most AU fics aren't even AU as they rehash cannon, and I'm glad that you are doing heavy AU. And with your character I would say give her a massive character arc. Like from the first scene she wants to protect Harry from danger and have her fail and finally she saves him, like the Dr Strange and Ironman moment in Endgame.

But please do write it! And make the OC different from Harry.

** If you want AU, make all the changes consistent with each other, possibly caused by the same incident in the past which is gradually revealed in various background information. Instead of just telling the reader, have hints here and there about what else beyond the obvious is different.
