** They paced a slow circle around the Great Hall amidst the breathless crowd. The pale light of dawn filtered down through membranous clouds to immerse the scene, casting a grey pall upon Voldemort's face. His scarlet eyes burned with imminent triumph.

"The road ends for you here, Harry Potter, and I do hope you've taken the time to appreciate the journey. Seventeen ancillary years, paid for in blood and fair fortune."

Harry matched Voldemort's ponderous steps and smiled, projecting all the assurance he felt. "Of course, Riddle. I'm all but done for---you're /absolutely/ going to win."

The Dark Lord's eyes narrowed a fraction, and his voice sank to a hiss. "Your words don't seem to match that fatuous expression, Potter. Is there something here which you find amusing?"

"Amusing? No," Harry said. He flashed Ginny a jaunty wink as he edged past her spot in the press; she stared bloodlessly after him as if he'd gone utterly mad. "There's nothing funny about all your grand plans being more or less completely undone by a persistent group of teenagers. Nothing whatsoever."

"Undone?" Voldemort snarled. "Unless I'm much mistaken, my designs are drawing tantalizingly near to fruition. I have but to speak a few words . . ."

"Yeah, /Avada Kedavra,/ right? Have at it. I'm /dead certain/ that'll work out well for you. It always has."

Voldemort's smooth sidelong stride hitched a little, and he barely stumbled. "What is this?" he cried, voice high and chilling in his outrage. "Has terror loosed your mind's feeble grasp upon reality? I cannot be beaten, I cannot be killed! You have /no hope!"/

"No hope at all," Harry said, his tone still light and conversational. The countless rapt faces of their audience reflected abject horror and betrayal at Harry's words, to his inward bewilderment, but he maintained a sunny smile as he met Voldemort's gaze again. "I can't hope to kill you here, because you /most definitely/ have /several/ horcruxes intact at this very moment."

"Enough! I will not be /mocked!"/ Their wands flashed into motion in the same moment, and the world seemed to hold its breath. /"Avada Kedavra!"/

/"Expelliarmus!"/

A brilliant jet of emerald rebounded against a burst of red light and soared back to strike its caster in the chest; Voldemort fell backward and collapsed to the stone floor, pale thin arms splayed overhead in ignominious finality, as if he'd had a deathly yet cartoonish scare.

"Why, Tom, I'd never even /think/ to mock you," Harry said, shattering the momentous silence. "Now, put your hands up. I'm taking you in."

** "Yeah sure I'll join you." Harry said snarkily.

"Excellent Harry!" Voldemort exclaimed as he turned around.

"Avada Kedavra." Harry exclaimed. "Seriously, did he not get the sarcasm?"

** Canon has quite a few moments like this. It's rather unappreciated.

Hmm, linkffn(So Sue me) is a good fic rec.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12087691/1/]]) has something tangentially related.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

** There's Snapped, a fic where Harry decides to go full snark during the Dueling Club. It has some extremely good recurring gags, such as my favourite:

"“Ding,” Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. “That's my bullshit detector,” Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. "

Fair warning, there are some cliches like Manipulative!Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, but if you can stand those it's short and quite fun.

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.
