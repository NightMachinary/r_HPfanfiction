I want to read it. Child!Hermione/Snape? HELL YEAH! Harry cuts both of his legs off? TOTALLY AWESOME! Anything else like that? PLEASE TELL ME!


** Honestly, 12 years old Hermione giving 11 years old Harry a blowjob is bad enough, and this fic ranks very high on the popularity chart.

As long as this fic is not taken down, every posturing by FFN is just for show.

***** Isn't this the one where Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape have a bet on whether Harry and Hermione have seen each other naked... Children engaging in sexual activities is bad enough but for adults, their own teachers to bet on it...

The concept is nice, post-war recollection of secrets that nobody knew about, it just needs to tone down the underage sexual exploits.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's had enough. Enough of the lies, the manipulations, and the backstabbing. Now, he wanted to live for himself. Taking his Ex-girlfriend as his slave, and geting a very attaractive nine year old wife, Harry begins to form his army against those who would stand against him. An army of loyal slaves to carry out whatever orders he gives.

  Shining examples of literary genius abound as Harry & friends do some stuff, and some other stuff, and some other stuff, and then some stuff happens, and some people do some stuff. And then Snape cuts his head off with a chainsaw, everybody is Luna, Oliver Wood plays Slayer out his mouth, and some other stuff... whatever.
