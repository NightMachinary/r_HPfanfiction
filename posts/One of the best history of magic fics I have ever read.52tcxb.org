This is about the history of ollivander and is permanent head Canon for me.

What do you think of it?

Edit apparently too many n's is a crime lol


** I do think you should discard the word “cannon”, for the word you want to use is “canon”.

But that is a mere nitpick. And as far as the story itself goes, I only had time to skim through it quickly now and there are some original characters so I'll have to withhold any judgment until I actually have the time; thus, I won't say anything about it.

**** Might very well be, I've had it do some inane things---the most notable being that it once changed every word after a “the” into another “the” in one of my documents, though that was the Word one---and I am writing about that since I see this particular word used for that often enough and I was already in this thread so I though I might as well do that and be useful in some way. I apologise if I worded it (the original comment) poorly, I did not mean to sound offensive.
