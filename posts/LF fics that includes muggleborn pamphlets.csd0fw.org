Any good fics where Harry/someone notice that Harry hasn't got the muggleborn fanon pamphlets and it has consequenses? Anything from malicius Dumbledore, to accidental overlooking muggleraised status, to Harry suddenly understanding Magic better and having an impact on his studies.

Really any type of fic with missing pamphlets that has an effect on Harrys life.


** linkffn(10192722) starts off with this premise and follows through with small changes in Harry's first year.

#+begin_quote
  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?
