Soo, I for some reason really like Dark!Harry. Not like, Harry joins the dark side but they're actually good. I mean I want an evil, dark Harry that doesn't necessarily have to be on Voldy's side.

☆ I don't care what ship, but I prefer Drarry

☆ Preferably no rape (if so, I'd rather it not be very detailed)

☆ Don't mind bashing

☆ It'd be good if Harry gets back at everyone who wronged him. Doesn't matter how.

☆ Has to be written well

☆ Preferably nothing under 50k words but if it's good, I'll read it anyway

☆ Preferably nothing over 500k words but again, if it's good, I'll read it anyway
