Bit basic but I'm really just in the mood for something nice and wholesome. Though if it does offer a bit of angst, then better lmao

  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

  "'Dear Mr Godfather,' the letter read, 'My name is Harry Potter, and I'm living with my aunt and uncle, but I don't like it very much.'" When through an act of desperation and accidental magic a letter finds its way into Azkaban, Sirius Black decides that his godson needs him. But how do you take care of a child when you're a wanted criminal?

** I was going to recommend Innocent but it's already on here... But I would not stop there because it's the author you should be recommending since he created prequels and sequels to it. So here:

**** I'm saving up Intensity chapters to read so please don't spoil me with recent events personally White Flags was my favorite because the Marauders weren't depicted as saints but also not as bullies (but as actual pranksters). Book 3 was also great especially the moment where Fred and Gorge found out that Remus was Moony if they had found out in the original Harry Potter books during 3rd year that definitely would have been their reaction.
