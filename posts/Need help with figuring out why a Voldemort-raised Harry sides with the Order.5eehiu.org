So in a fic I'm writing, Voldemort adopts Harry instead of killing him due to seeing Wormtail's killing curse rebound. He's raised pampered as basically the prince of magical britain (since Voldemort toppled the ministry shortly after taking him) and is taught to hate muggles and see muggleborns as little more than pets and stock to get half-bloods out of.

He's a bit of a monster honestly, and once he sides with the Order he only really diverts the cruelty toward Death Eaters, but my only issue is I don't know how he joins them. At one point Hermione (one of the few muggleborns in Hogwarts and a secret Order member) helps kidnap him and he spends some time with the Order while they use Voldemort's distraction to launch some raids, but it's not nearly enough time to develop Stockholm syndrome.

So I'm kind of stuck for why he joins them as he's pretty indoctrinated into the whole pureblood supremacy thing, and Voldemort never mistreats him so it wouldn't be a "he's a violent monster" thing either.


** The simplest would be a blood purist Harry discovering that Voldemort is a halfblood.

Actually, a blood purist Harry as a 'good' guy would be interesting.

*** The problem with a lot of Draco redemption fics is (at least for the ones I read) he swaps sides because of how Voldemort treats him or his father, and in my fic Voldemort's gone through great pains to make sure Harry knows he's "loved" and perfect and when he graduates he can do whatever he wants, be it headmaster or minister or anything, just to make sure he never gets the urge to "vanquish" him

** Did Voldemort kill the Potters? If he did, that would be enough to sway Harry.

Of course, this Harry would still start out as a rapid anti-Muggleborn blood purist. However, since Voldemort's ideology was basically built on lies and deceits, it would not stand up to scrutiny over time. Harry, through his interactions with Hermione and other 'good guys', would soon start questioning his 'education'.

The one fact that strongly disapproved blood purity ideology was that it weakened magical power, instead of strengthening it. Examples included Gaunts' degeneration, Voldemort himself (muggle father and almost squib mother), Dumbledore (Muggleborn mother), Dora Tonks (metamorphagus very rare, Muggleborn father), Weasley's virility vs other purebloods' difficulty of having children, and psychotic behaviors in many pureblood families (Blacks, Bulstrodes, Carrows, Crabbes, Goyles, Lestranges).

Harry's transformation could take several months to a few years, depending on how much angst you want to introduce in your story. But vengeance of his parents and absurdity of blood purity ideology should be the main reasons.

*** He doesn't see them as his parents though. Voldemort is his father, James and Lily Potter were filth. Though I suppose stories while kidnapped might sway him a little bit. Or start the process at least. Plus thinking his father is wrong wouldn't automatically make him want to kill the guy. Just, "ehh, he's wrong but he's my father, so I can forgive him for that."

**** Well, once Voldemort's lies had been exposed, Harry would see things differently.

But if your Voldemort treated Harry really well, then your Voldemort was obviously quite different from the canon version. In that case, he might have more redeeming qualities and Harry would indeed have difficulties in killing him.

So, Harry might first only oppose Voldemort's agenda, while still trying to sway him. Of course this would fail, and Voldemort would kill someone (Hermione?) Harry cared deeply about. Then all gloves were off.

***** Except it only comes out during the final battle that Harry is working for the order. He takes a killing curse sent by Voldemort meant for Hermione (since she's his, and he means that in the most possessive, objectifying way possible and he knows he can block it) and it breaks the face mask he was wearing, revealing his face.

The turning point from "oppose and rescue muggleborns" to "I'm going to kill my father" is Sirius's death though, so yeah him killing a "loved one" (more like a possession) is a big deciding factor.

That Harry was taken by Wormtail and Voldemort decided to raise him. Harry was subjected to multiple false memory charms and firmly believed Voldemort's cause, until he was captured and brought to Hogwarts.

***** Ish. There are a few. It basically breaks down as Voldemort is building and breeding an army. He wants strength, so he is okay with strong muggleborns being taught magic. Usually by the time they graduate they're so broken they don't think to rebel anyway, and it's not like they're allowed to keep their wands when not in class, so there's no real risk (unless they get illegal wands like from, say, the Order).

They pick the muggleborns who get the "honor" of being taught magic based on magical strength and intelligence. They're taken as soon as letters would go out, forced to perform spells with no training and if they get any right, they're a candidate. At Hogwarts the sorting process involves more spell work, so they're typically placed in the lowest houses (they're ranked by talent not traits). No muggleborn has guaranteed rights to protection, but they're allowed to defend themselves if they can.

Hermione ends up being the first muggleborn in the highest ranked house, because she's talented but also because Harry nominates her to rise that high as she's his pet/student/project and he refuses to let his property be so pathetic as to be in a low house.

** How about Harry does it for Voldemort's own good?

Like, imagine your parent is an alcoholic, and drinks and drives all the time. You love your parent, but you can see that what they're doing endangers not only themselves but others, so you call the police the next time you catch them grabbing the car keys with a bottle of bourbon in hand.

Think of a scenario where Voldemort takes things "too far" and have Harry go to the order not because he agrees with them, but because he thinks that they're the only ones who can stop Voldemort's self-destruction.

This is one way to avoid the cheesy "evil person sees the light and makes a complete 180 overnight" plot that plagues so many bad fics. Harry still isn't really a good guy, but he's willing to swallow some pride in order to do what he sees as helping his father figure. Maybe he doesn't really care for either side's ideals, but you know how family is family and so he sticks with Voldemort out of loyalty. (This is me differentiating 'family' and 'relatives.' They are not always the same thing. Harry could see the potters as relatives, but Voldemort is his family.)

*** Actually I really like that idea. Maybe finds out his dad tore his soul apart, goes to the Order wanting help getting the soul bits together to hopefully give them back to him and convince him not to do it again or something. Then stuff happens and he deems his father too much of a mad dog. Though even if he "sees the light" he doesn't make a 180. He just changes who he points his wand at. When they raid Hogwarts, he has no issue setting it up so a bunch of purebloods, including babies and young children will be caught in the crossfire because he's gone from "kill all the rebels" to "kill all the death eaters."

** Note: this suggestion is based on the assumption that Voldemort views Harry as a possession and has an indulgent, somewhat distant relationship with Harry.

Maybe at first when he's kidnapped by the Order, he envies the familial relationship of the Weasley family on some level, but on the surface holds contempt for 'love', as Voldemort does. He probably sees love as weak, as that's what he has been taught and believed his whole life, but gradually, as he sees how the Weasleys support and lend each other strength, he could come to believe that while love makes you vulnerable it can also be something that holds a lot of power. Plus, how the depths of a relationship is altered by love--Harry, a pampered prince who is largely seen as a possession by Voldemort, does not truly understand love, but sees how it makes the Weasleys' relationships more meaningful, how it makes their bond stronger, etc. He may not ever truly understand that bond, but that doesn't mean he cannot desire it and become somewhat embittered toward Voldemort for making him incapable of experiencing that feeling. It could be a starting point to turning against Voldemort that only festers as he grows closer with other Order members who offer him the one thing that Voldemort cannot--real affection.

The rest of it can be just that as he becomes disillusioned with what Voldemort has taught him about love, he begins to question everything else. He questions Voldemort's thoughts on Muggleborns, blood purity, etc., and eventually come to realise that there is little value in pureblood supremacy, and that there may be a better way of doing things. It helps, too, that he has perhaps developed some relationships with certain Order members.

Hope this made sense.

*** I do think this would be the best way to go. Harry is already as close as he's ever gotten with Hermione when he's kidnapped and Dumbledore's insistence they treat him with respect and kindness as well as the influence of Sirius and Remus start jarring him from his comfort zone of "untouchable, uncaring and intimidating". I think in the end he'll at least still see muggleborns as lesser and muggles are right out, but he's willing to help anyway, sort of as a "these poor beasts are too weak to save themselves, I shall have to assist" thing.

(I've wanted to read a Voldemort who wants a body swap fic for awhile because eternal life doesn't necessarily mean eternal YOUTH and I can't see Voldemort settling for a fragile old man's body forever when he could steal someone else's- and since Harry is similar to Voldemort and has sheltered a piece of his soul for his entire life, he'd be a good candidate for body subjugation.)

** What does your Harry see as right and wrong, good and evil? Where does his morality come from? An eye for an eye morality would be looked down upon by the order etc but if for the most part he left people be if they leave him then it could be argued he's fine. Does Harry realise Voldemort is evil or alternatively that there is something in the order worth fighting for, has Voldemort wronged him? Another approach and one I don't think I've seen is Harry uses the order to rise above Voldemort, letting the order and death eaters tear each other apart so he can seize power kinda like the emperor in Star wars. If Voldemort raised him to see people as tools and to seek greatness and be ambitious then he must realise Voldemort is the final barrier between him and power so joining the order so he can use them is possible. Narrow it down to what does your Harry want most?

*** In the beginning, Harry definitely starts with "right is whatever my father says is right and wrong is everything he doesn't like. If it helps him or me, it's right. If it brings benefit to magicals, it's right." After the kidnapping I think he does start struggling with his morality. He's seen that he was defenseless and wasn't tortured at all and they even let him go like they said they would. It definitely would confuse him. I also think for much of it he doesn't even know why he's swapped sides. It just started abruptly when he told his father he didn't remember who kidnapped him. He justifies it by wanting to torture Hermione himself but as time goes on he keeps helping. Snape (ever the double agent) may even talk to him about it.

I also think what Harry wants most in the beginning is possibly to see where it's all going. He might confuse actual compassion with self-superior pity. By the end though it might be rage and a desire for revenge over Voldemort killing people he'd grown close to.
