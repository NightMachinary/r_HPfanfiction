I read a fanfic from another fandom like this where multiple people traveled back from completely different timelines and then they all ended up in the same timeline and they are all trying to fix the outcome to be a positive one without knowing the others are time travelers and they think they are in their own timeline.

So like, Ron travels back from a timeline where Tom Riddle kills Ginny and takes over, Hermione travels back from a time where Harry does at the end of GoF by Voldemort, Snape travels back in time from a timeline where Harry falls into the veil instead of Sirius, and Draco(or any other Slytherin), travels back from a timeline where Harry is controlled by Voldemort and sides with him and the world is ruled by tyrants and pure bloods are dying as well as the muggleborns and muggles.

Something like that and they are all trying to fix what went wrong without letting anyone know that they know the future.


** Sounds like Far Too Many Time Travelers. linkffn(6728900)

A cracky fic where each traveler is a last survivor of their timeline, use some time/dimension warping magic to send them back to the divergence point, but somehow they all end up going to Hogwarts together.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog][Echoes in the Fog]] certainly fits as 3 universes are combined. Harry and Ginny from canon, Harry and Hermione from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar][For Lack of a Bezoar]], and the entire cast from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming][Downward Spiral Saga]]. This is honestly a masterful job of combining universes and is a great read.

** I remember reading one where Sirius travels forward in time from the Battle of Department of Mysteries to a world where Harry jumped into veil after him. He ends up hiding out in Grimmauld Place where Daphne Greengrass has purchased the Black properties. The storyline is basically Daphne trying to find a way to send Sirius back while forcing herself not to fall in love with him. Magic is dieing in that world, and she's an extremely isolated person because of things that Draco Malfoy did. Of course, she sided with him because of Astoria. That's why she lives in hiding from the rest of Death Eater society.
