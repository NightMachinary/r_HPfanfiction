** Lily: Uh... James?

James: Yeah?

Lily: Remember when Alice and Frank came around and we were experimenting with Polyjuice?

James: Yeah that was fun. Wait... why?

Lily: Well...

James: Is she...?

Lily: Yeah...

James: And... whose was it?

Lily: ...

James: No... /struggles to hold in laughter/ is it yours?

Lily: James this is serious!

James: I don't remember inviting Padfoot around.

Lily: James!

James: Hehe, I know, I know hon. Still whose the... “father.”

Lily: ... Me...

** Can't help directly, but linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) has Remus registered as Harry's godmother, because James wanted both him and Sirius to be included (no, the Ministry didn't normally allow that, but these are the Marauders we're talking about).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
