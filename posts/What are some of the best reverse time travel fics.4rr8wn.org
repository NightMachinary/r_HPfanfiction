Meaning characters go to the future as opposed to the past, which is the case in most fics.

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

**** Oh, hey! The story has a good beginning and a great ending sequence. The middle is a bit dull, but overall it is certainly worth the read. Hope you enjoy it!

***** Ahhhhhh I just binge-read the entire thing and it was so good! I've never even seen that fic recommended before (maybe because it's so old?) but it was excellent. Thanks again for recommending it! :D

** Okay: I haven't read it (it's in my "to read" pile), and it might not be at all what you're looking for, but in linkffn(Misplaced Moony) Remus gets sent to the trio's timeline, which is at least a little different than the typical one-of-the-trio getting sent to the past.

  Snape wakes up expecting to celebrate his seventeenth birthday. Instead he finds out he's missed the last twenty years and the wizarding world is celebrating the death of the Dark Lord. Cast adrift in this strange world, where he is seen as both hero and villain for things he has no recollection of, he struggles to come to terms with suddenly being famous and the unlikely attentions of one Harry Potter.

  A mysterious item and mischievous Marauders end up accidentally shoving Remus Lupin into another time and place where he has to rebuild his life from scratch, deal with the aftermath of a war he hadn't yet been a part of, all with the help of new friends and a special young witch. Remione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. (Remus/Hermione) *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** I dont know about the BEST, but I liked these:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]] - linkffn(5846417) The basic premise is that Lily Luna Potter accidentally time travels back 47 years and meets Sirius and James in 1980. She finds out she cant change the past and has a brief romance with Sirius and then travels back into 2028. But THEN Sirius time travels forward 47 years and a bunch of the other next gen characters time travel too and exciting adventures happen. This fic, although totally different from canon, actually maps perfectly onto canon - it is a great example of using the events from canon but changing our perception of them to tell a different story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1774120/1/Tempus-Fugit][Tempus Fugit]] by Stylophile- linkffn(1774120)

This fic is Harry/Draco where due to a potions accident their minds travel forward in time 8 years into their 25y/o bodies. They are surprised to find out that they are in a relationship and live in Manchester. The magic in this story is really original I thought the writing was good. I also really liked the ending. This is AU from HBP onwards I think.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  A monumental cock-up in Potions leaves Harry and Draco contending with more than mutual enmity, and a strong desire to utter all manner of profanities. Slash, sex and slurred words ensue.
