** linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW)

It's a good-ish story. But sloooooow af. But with believeable character development and plot. And the romance part is great. Bonus points for no IcePrincess!Daphne. And the contract stuff is actually semi-reasonable! Which was quite the surprise.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

** linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories) is the best story with this premise I know, but he doesn't "go underground", and for a good reason --- he gets Voldemort's memories but they're a broken haze, and he can only remember things one at a time, so he doesn't instantly get clear knowledge of everything.

linkffn(Seventh Hocrux) is of course a classic.

And, well, there's another one, but it's sort of a spoiler that it involves the idea at all, sooo...

And it's not necessarily about killing either - readers want to see Harry taking the fight against his enemies seriously, using spells that require more than an 'ennervate' to undo.

That, I think, is what people are frustrated with. Also known as the fighting Death Eaters with stunners syndrome. With good reason - Death Eaters were captured and returned again to murder and torture more innocents.

That being said, some have made solid arguments that Stunners in battle aren't such a ridiculous concept, though they might not be /best/; these arguments point out that successfully casting a spell like Ennervate isn't just pointing and saying the word --- you have to do the right wand motion and focus on it, which is taking valuable time and attention from you even though wizarding battles are first and foremost won through speed.
