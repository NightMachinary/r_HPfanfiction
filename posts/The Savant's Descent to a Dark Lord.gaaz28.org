It seems like Rowling thinks that immortality is immoral because she shares the philosophy that can be summarized in 3 words from an edgelord, "Life is Pain". When the resurrection stone is used, the wraiths "want to go back to sleep." When the ghosts stay alive, it is a joyless existence. When you drink unicorn blood, it curses you to live a half-life. When you use the Philosopher's stone, it traps you in a cage of flesh. When you make a Horcrux, you become insane due to breaking your soul into pieces.

What I am interested in is a wizard similar to that of Harry Potter from Methods of Rationality, but rather than being able to "reason out" things like transfiguring gold, the magic system simply disagrees with him, hard. They should take injuries and experience pain from the "risky" process of spellcrafting, they should be physically distorted by the potions they invent, and through this altogether, descend into the depravity of a Dark Lord, and this should be implied to be a process that has happened countless times before, and that it will happen again.

This could happen to a variety of characters.

1. Tom Riddle - If you made him into someone who wasn't automatically a psychopathic sociopath, then this would be a reasonable answer.
2. Hermione Granger - A talented young witch that has already experimented with spellcrafting in her 4th year at Hogwarts, seen the results of the Half-Blood Prince's diary, and now... Now there is perfectly researchable material in the corpse of a metamorphmagus, it would be a victimless crime to dig it up after it has been buried. Besides, it would be what Tonks would want, wouldn't it?


** I can think of a few examples, though descent into depravity is variable:

- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) - Harry is already crazy, and as the story goes we learn what he did to screw himself up. Good magic and chapters 5 and 6 are very good in particular.
- linkffn(The Mind Arts) - this one is a mixed bag. On the one hand it definitely has a sociopathic Harry exploring magic and his capabilities in ways that change him. On the other, its a bit of a hodgepodge of canon plots and the storylines from several other fics (of which the author explicitly states in the first chapter), and the characterizations are often flat beyond two or three people.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) - not quite a descent into depravity per se, but the fic is full of characters who are or have already lost their minds exploring certain aspects of magic (such as with divination in Year 1).
- linkffn(The Crown of Metis) - somewhat tangentially, it shows how both an advocate of the light and dark arts can separately become so inhuman and cutoff from everyone else. Good oneshot.
- linkffn(Druid of Holly and Yew) - Harry is somewhat unhinged, but we see clearly the effects of how his experiments have unintended, and even painful, consequences for the world around him.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.
