I know Hogwarts has its own band, but imagine marching shows before quidditch matches, (not sure if half time is a thing in quidditch) and pep band music when goals are made and snitches are caught.

Competing with other schools, because marching bands are competitive AF. A gryffindor trumpet would likely assault a Durmstrang drum major.

The houses are forced to work together to create something amazing. Like real marching band, where you have the emos, the nerds, the gays, the crazy kids, the kids who are in it because their friends are, and the jocks that were made to participate by their parents because they bought them an expensive instrument in middle school.

I was a band kid, and it was the type of chaotic Hogwarts would have done well with. So naturally, since I've got nothing better to do, I'm assigning Hogwarts Characters BAND instruments. Feel free to add, correct, and argue.

Harry: Trumpet.

Ron: Mellophone or trumpet.

Hermione: clarinet

Percy: drum major. I don't know why. He just is.

Ginny: Euphonium.

Fred and George: alto saxophone. Definitely.

Luna: Tuba. When it came time to pick instruments she felt some off connection, despite barely being able to carry it.

Seamus: trombone

Dean: pit

Draco: flute, obviously.

Vincent and Crabbe: tenor or Baritone saxophones. Maybe tuba, but they have the tenor and bari vibe.

Cedric: drumline

Cho: flute

Lavender and the Patil twins: color guard!


** I love the mental image of Luna with a tuba. She'd probably supply flower crowns for everyone in the band too.

Part of me feels like Hogwarts would have some unconventional instruments too. I could see Fred and George teaming up with bagpipes, for maximum chaos.

** Do they have marching band in schools in Britain? I thought it was more of an American thing

*** To the best of my knowledge, the only marching bands in Britain are part of the military.

**** Pretty much yeah, but we also have marching band groups that play at the odd event (club day etc.)

But nothing in schools though

*** Nope. Sit down orchestras, choirs and bands of all descriptions but not marching bands. Probably because school sports are waaaay less important,
