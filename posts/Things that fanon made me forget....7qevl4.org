So, we've all read lots and lots of fanfics here. And we've all encountered fanon, which according to the sum of human knowledge that is Urban Dictionary is:

#+begin_quote
  ideas or events that are accepted by most fans, but were not actually in the original story/book/show etc
#+end_quote

And as I'm rereading the books (or rather listening to them, thanks Audible), I realized that a lot of things I thought were true actually were never in canon to begin with... here's a short list:

- Auror are /not/ the police, they are closer to counter intelligence/secret service. Often we read of Harry explaining to Muggles that he is a policeman, or even read that aurors arrest drunks in the street or stuff like that. But in the books... they hunt Dark Wizards, they protect the Prime Minister. And in OOTP Mr Weasley clearly states, when Harry asks if Aurors will be investigating the regurgitating toilets, he answer that it's way too trivial for them and that regular Magical Law Enforcement Patrol will take care of that.

- There have been muggleborn in Slytherin. Not a lot, but there are muggleborn Slytherin out there.

- Lockhart is actually not incompetent. He is a coward and a liar, but very good at memory charm, which is a complex magic. He is useless in a fight sure, but he is not a weak wizard.

- James Potter wasn't an auror, nor was Sirius or Remus. And they actually never calls themselves the Marauders in the book.

- this one was not mentioned in the books but by JK Rowling (on her site I think): pureblood thinking is actually a recent (18th century) concept.

- An old one (I realized this years ago), Severus is actually not Draco's godfather.

- And of course the usual: Head Boy and Head Girls quarters are not a thing, nor are magical cores, the words "Golden Trio" are never mentioned in canon, and pureblood do not speak or act like a Jane Austen novel.


** Always hated how everyone considered Severus Draco's godfather.

Firstly, I doubt existing of godfathers in wizarding world at all. Sirius is a godfather, yes, but how do we know if it's not something that Lily came up with because of her muggle upbringing.

Secondly, Severus is a halfblood. Period. The Dark Lord might respected him because of his skills at such young age and the fact that they were somewhat similar and both halfbloods. But Lucius is not the Dark Lord. Lucius is a blood purist. To make Severus a godfather of his son? He must go insane for this to happen.

That's why I use "Aurors" for cops, and "Hit-Wizards" for the guards (and what passes as army), with a fierce rivalry between them.

I think that because JKR hadn't come up with the word 'Auror' by the time of PoA. Outside of that one mention by Fudge, they are never mentioned in the books since then. Starting from GoF, JKR decided to retcon Hit Wizards into being a wizarding swat team and Aurors into being the wizarding MI5/FBI.

I like to think that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement represents various aspects of law enforcement, given that even Mr Weasley's job is enforcing the law on those who illegally enchant muggle artifacts. So technically, the entire Department of Magical Law Enforcement fills various main and specific roles that the police fill, with the Aurors doubling as a hybrid of the military and secret service. Though given that every ministry official can write legislation (even someone like Arthur Weasley), the ministry (or at least the DoMLE) is some odd hybrid of government, legislators, and law enforcement.

Prior to GoF, Voldemort's followers were never called "Death Eaters". They were just referenced as being Voldemort's followers without the group being named prior. Hence why the Death Eaters as a group were never mentioned by name in PS, CoS and PoA even when they logically should have been mentioned. Its most notable in PoA where Sirius, Lupin and Wormtail somehow went an entire chapter without once mentioning the Death Eaters by name. Even in PoA as a whole, nobody ever called Sirius a Death Eater whatsoever. They just say he was Voldemort's right-hand man or just generally say he was a follower of Voldemort.

I do agree that the Aurors never felt elite in the books, and that is something that annoyed me about canon. The Aurors are shown in roles fitting of such status (guarding Fudge, guarding Hogwarts and the Muggle prime minister, arresting Death Eaters), yet Aurors are basically the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Anbu][ANBU]] of the Harry Potter series. We are told they are elite guards who work for the Ministry. Yet when push comes to shove, Aurors are outclassed by most Death Eaters and Hogwarts professors, and are mere cannon fodder compared to Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort.

***** But like "permanent magical defences or protections", the lack of the name isn't a coincidence but rather is a side-effect of the actual nature of the thing in question.

With "magical protections", there's no unified name because the items of magic which constitute that function are not unified but rather belong to disparate branches of magic.

With "police", it's because each department of the Ministry handles its own enforcement, because in the magical world civil servants both write and enforce the law. They don't have a word for "police" because there is no police force.

With regards to the police, if I tried to follow your logic, I would have to assume that just because the USA has several police forces who enforce various laws (FBI, DEA, State and local police, US Marshalls etc.), as well as several other agencies who enforce the law (IRS, Coast Guard, etc.), they have no police force. Somehow.

Which would be rubbish.

So, in the absence of canon names to call cops and wards, people make up their own, or adapt canon.

Arthur Weasley thinks up laws. He writes them. He passes them. Then he goes on raids to enforce them.

That is like nothing that occurs in the Muggle world. It is not like having multiple law enforcement agencies. It is the merging of the civil service with law enforcement.

******** If the DMLE has employees who patrol the streets and deal with theft and other similar crimes, then the wizards have what people generally call "cops". And according to the wiki, at least, they have them and it's called "Magical Law Enforcement Patrol" (formerly Squad). What is missing, though, is a catchy short name for its members. Like cops, or officers, or agents, or bobbies.

Also, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement certainly sounds like a Generic Law Enforcement Agency.

With regards to wards, I can't help it if some weird people try to pretend that there is no such word in English. But that doesn't change the fact that Ward is a word. Merriam-Webster even defines it as "protection".

You have to remember that the magical world has a small population, and that what happens in large societies like the one you are almost certainly a member of is not a good guide to what happens in smaller ones. If you've only got a few thousand people it's completely reasonable for someone to write a law, argue for it in front of the legislative assembly, vote in that assembly, and be responsible for implementing it in government. Somewhere like San Marino, or the Falkland Islands, for example in the real world.

If you want an example in a /large/ and relatively modern society then I give you Winston Churchill, Home Secretary of the United Kingdom (approximately what would be called Minister for Justice in some other countries, and responsible for proposing new laws to Parliament within his area of responsibility, which included policing and security) and Member of Parliament (so he voted on whether those laws got passed) turning up at Sidney Street in London on the 3rd of January 1911, when the police and army were dealing fatally with some revolutionaries.

That was literally the only way Voldemort could be defeated. /The good of the many outweigh the good of the few, or the one/, and all that. For christ's sake the man gave his life for his cause, it's not like he was a hypocrite.

Once and for all: does he manipulates people? Yes. But that doesn't make him evil. That just mean he made mistakes, from his point of view he wanted to give Harry a childhood, and I think OOTP was really clear on how that was the wrong move in the end. And then he concealed the truth to Harry because HBP and DH's plot for Dumbledore's plan is simple: Harry needs to understand why. He needs to understand why Horcruxes are evil and who he is fighting, and he needs to understand what needs to be done. Only in the end because it's the only way to be sure.

That doesn't make him evil or even a bad man. When you are in a position of power sometimes tough decisions, where there are only bad choices, need to be made. If people can't understand that, if people still think in the end that Dumbledore was just an evil manipulator, then they lack maturity. Sometimes telling the truth to people is not the right thing to do, sometimes telling everyone is a mistake. Did Dumbledore do everything right? No, because he had flaws, but he did everything he could.

****** I don't find "the ends justify the means" arguments very compelling. In particular if there's no direct connection between means and ends.

Most people who raise this argument in defence of Dumbledore always do it from the perspective that it is a guarantee or a given that everything will work out. They construct a /false/ utilitarian argument along the lines of: "I have to send this soldier on a suicide mission, so that the evil terrorists don't blow up hundreds of people."

Except, that totally doesn't apply. I can see hundreds of scenarios in which Dumbledore would have acted differently towards Harry and things could have still worked out. Furthermore I can see hundreds of scenarios where all his manipulations were pointless, because Harry Potter died on a broom, got his soul sucked out by dementors or grabbed and murdered by Snatchers (which almost happened).

So the whole notion that Dumbledore did it for noble goals is simply way too ridiculous for me to take seriously, because - really - how could anyone predict the ridiculous events in DH? If I'd be able to interview Dumbledore in say 1990 and gave him veritaserum and he laid his plans out for me I'd have him committed in an insane asylum. I don't know Albus, wouldn't it be better to avoid a direct confrontation between Harry and Voldemort by not bringing the Philosophers stone to the school?

I agree... sorta. I never said that Dumbledore did not made mistakes, and yes his mistakes had heavy consequences (e.g. Sirius' death). I just said that overall he did the right thing. Harry /needed/ to go to his death. Unless you want to say that the book and Rowling are wrong in some way there is no changing that: he had to willingly give his life. Any attack on Dumbledore that include "he wanted Harry to go to his death!" is not valid, there was literally no way around it. Details could have been different, but in the end things had to happen this way. Tell me, what could have been so different that he just did not need to lie to Harry?

He had too much faith in himself and is plans, he was a bit arrogant. Yes. But...

Rrriight. That's why there's a herbology challenge, a flying challenge, a chess puzzle and a logic puzzle that can be solved by first years to protect the stone... and not the stone under a Fidelius somewhere.

Of course he wanted a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Don't tell me you actually bought that cock & bull story "I just wanted you to have a normal childhood". That's one of Dumbledore's most transparent lies he's ever told and I'm really confused that people just believe it when it is blatantly absurd: He put Harry with his asshole relatives because he wanted to have him protected, he certainly wasn't going to have a normal or enjoyable childhood there. You yourself admitted that Dumbledore did the things he did for the greater good, nor for Harry.

********* Okay... so a few things first.

Book 1 is really weird when compared with other books. There are things that just don't make a lot of sense (more so than in other books). They are only explained because it was the first book, it's called first instalment weirdness. You just can't say "why didn't he used X" when X wasn't invented yet, the Fidelius simply did not exist back then, it's as simple as that. You need to put the book in context, and in the context of the first book (a book where Dumbledore can't apparate for example and has to fly) and as a young adult novel it make sense! Yes the stone was supposed to be sufficiently protected. But Harry was also supposed, due to the plot, to cross the challenges. That doesn't mean that Dumbledore wanted him to do so.

And for the challenges, they actually are quite difficult: the dog is not easy, Snape was gravely injured and he did not even attempt to cross the room, just to guard it (and btw, why did he went to Filch? Because plot reason that's all). Harry has a gift on a broom, it wasn't necessarily adapted for a 1st year. Same thing with chess and logic, Ron and Hermione are just that good at them. A troll, that's not easy.

#+begin_quote
  Don't tell me you actually bought that cock & bull story "I just wanted you to have a normal childhood". That's one of Dumbledore's most transparent lie
#+end_quote

It's not a lie, it just doesn't mean what you think it means. it doesn't refer to the Dursleys, it refers to the prophecy. Dumbledore knew that Harry would grow up to face Voldemort, and that V wanted specifically to kill him. But he did not told him that because he wanted Harry to enjoy Hogwarts as a normal child, not see his years as a training program for the ultimate battle (which would rob him of his childhood). It made sense in 1, 2 and 3. By 4 he should have told him, he even admitted it. But put yourself in his shoes, would you really tell a small 11yo, "btw I hope your ready because this is not just school, you need to learn how to kill one of the strongest dark wizard alive!".

Same thing with his fame, he wanted him to be a normal child, not worshipped as the Boy Who Lived.

#+begin_quote
  You yourself admitted that Dumbledore did the things he did for the greater good, nor for Harry.
#+end_quote

Yes, but I also think that he did everything he could for Harry when he could afford it. And that's not evil. I'm conviced that he did not expect the Dursleys to be that bad, but still it needed to be done. Just because Harry hated it doesn't change that fact.

He was misguided at times, but he is not evil.

At that point, it's clear we will never agree. So let's agree to disagree. Btw, what do you make of the fact that your theory is not supported by the book, since Harry named his kid Albus? (and remember, for JK children are /everything/).

**** Well, we only /hear/ about how Lily is oh-so-very-smart while we actually /see/ Sirius in action. I think it goes without saying that the dead are often praised and orphans often hear how sweet, brilliant and beautiful their parents were (except for Snape and Petunia). Let's be compelety honest here: even Lily's deeds would've been exaggerated.

Now, I'm more inclined to say Sirius and James /are/ smarter than Lily and Lupin.

Firstly, Sirius and James were equated to be on the same level of skill, intelligence, wit, etc. so because we only have Sirius as an example and James was dead throughout the series, I'm using his feats.

Sirius was said to be very smart by McGonagall, Slughorn and Lupin, all of whom have no reason to lie about their talent. McGonagall was talking to fellow adults (who don't exaggerate), Harry was out of earshot so they wouldn't over exaggerate to make Harry feel better and all that. Slughorn's comment was almost a throwaway one, for god's sake! Lupin wasn't trying to a) make Harry feel better and b) Harry loathed Sirius at the time. There was no need for exaggeration.

Almost all of Lily's praise comes from Slughorn (who seemed biased) and others who met Harry, the boy-who-lived, an orphan and someone whose mother died to save him. They /would/ exaggerate.

Now, onto Sirius's feats.

Firstly, he broke out of Azkaban. His innocence will have helped, sure but it takes mental strength and skill to be able to function properly after spending twelve years in that hellhole being mentally tortured 24/7.

He managed to evade the dementors (very shrewd creatures) and the Aurors (who are the elite) coupled with all the people in the ministry (Mr. Weasley's words).

Harry managed to send owls to him but not the aurors? I don't know how he made himself untraceable but he didn't have a wand at the time between PoA and GoF.

He gave Harry that knife that unlocked even doors in the DOM. Sirius gave it to Harry in GoF, and he was a wanted criminal so it wouldn't be safe to go to a Wizarding black market or something since he had a huge price on his head so he wouldn't just waltz in and buy it. Again, he had no one. Did he charm it himself? I don't know, but his pottermore page does say that he was very good in charms.

The age gap between Sirius and Bellatrix would ensure that she'd graduated from Hogwarts before he even started first year. Now, Bellatrix would've had like, seven years more experience than he had and she was known as one of the, if not the most, powerful death eaters in the Wizarding World and her feats prove as much.

Let's go to the DoM, Sirius had been out of practice for 15 years and yet he andbellatrix dueled equally and if he hadn't been so arrogant, he'd have defeated her since he was giving her a hard time as she was giving him. And that's like, with Bellatrix having seven years of additional experience over him.

This is further evidenced by Bellatrix beating Kingsley in a shorter amount of time and he was one of he top aurors at the time. He was part of the Order, the one responsible for hunting Sirius down and he was just a beast from what we see of him.

Also, in the DoM, Sirius was dueling so fiercely that his wand was just a blur. That's evidence enough for him being above average.

I think his experience with magical creatures is also overlooked quite a bit, he was very friendly towards Buckbeak and he respected Sirius. He was also very good friends with crookshanks, who appeared to be a very stubborn and extremely shrewd cat. He also gained Pigwidgeon's trust, although that might've not been as hard...

Now there are other things mentioned in the books, such as summoning six butter beers all at once, healing his hand immediately after being harmed by WartCap powder and him charming his motorbike. That was an act similar to Mr. Weasley's car, which was described by Dumbledore as a brilliant piece of magic.

Onto his school years now, he became an animagus at the age of fifteen, that's extremely impressive. JK Rowling described it as a very hard process that can result in nasty aftereffects if gone wrong. Not only did he manage to achieve it perfectly but also without the guidance of an adult, unlike the students of Uagado.

He managed to apply permanent-sticking charms to his posters in fifth year too. This all shows his ability in charms in addition to the marauder's map, which was the only one of its kind in the Harry Potter series. It is a very complicated piece of magic and sketching it all out would've been very difficult since Hogwarts was huge and the spells they'd have applied to discover the tunnels in the first place seemed hard.

Charms has been mastered by the most powerful of witches and wizards (Flitwick, dueling champion) and Dumbledore and Voldemort. I'm not saying he's as good as the other two but that's very good for only 12 years of practice.

Transfiguration is the same too (McGonagall), and he'd have mastered that. This is further evidenced by Sirius conjuring thick, heavy chains out of thin air by a wand he hadn't even won over and after 12 and half years of never practicing his magic. That's pretty complex.

Slughorn mentions his talent so he must've been competing with Lily and snake if he was worthy of slughorn's comments even if he didn't seem to like him that much and since he brought it up himself in the first place.

What we know of Lily is her ability in Potions which we never actually see applied and the extremely vague thrice defied part of the prophecy (which Rowling said is /not/ dueling or confronting Voldemort three times) and her control over underage magic (which is ever brought up again) and wouldn't apply when using an actual wand after seven years of practice. All of what we know of Lily is heard but never seen in application and Lupin is very bookish, which doesn't automatically mean he's smarter.

I'd provide sources but my phone is lagging from the wall of text (I'm sorry) and the books are across the room but the phone would drive me mad and I'll throw it across the room again, which didn't end well last time...

***** most of your points are quite convincing but i may have to complain about others

sirius was not only protected by his innocence but also by his animagus form...which peter pettigrew also managed to learn. We dont know how shred dementors really are and the competence of aurors is also unproved

handling animals doesnt have anything to do with intelligence and he could have easily got the knife in a different way, for example hiding his looks or just taking family heirlooms with him

his letters which are untraceable for the aurors but not for harry are more of a plot hole i think

he seems equal to bellatrix, that doesnt impy that he would have bested here eventually, seven years might not have been a huge disadvantage and he probably lasted longer than kingsley because he is more emotionally invested and therefor completely reckless which might have only worked because of sheer dumb luck (until his final mistake) bellatrix was also more influenced by her stay in azkaban (she was not protected by innocence and animagus form) his wand seeming like a blur might have been out of rage, we dont know how rare that really is

concerning the motorbike and some more quotes there seems to be a large discrepance about the abilities of the average wizards if something like a basic shield charm is taught at hogwarts to children but not all wizards are able to perform it. plus maybe the motorbike is just a brilliant piece of magic because no one ever thought about it, so it could be more like an act of protest(sirius liked having muggle pictures in his room and might have discovered more of muggle culture)

  sirius was not only protected by his innocence but also by his animagus form...which peter pettigrew also managed to learn.
#+end_quote

Well, that's a great point but it leads back to mental strength. Even though he had his dog form to help, it didn't necessarily make it a breeze in Azkaban. And your second point about Peter, this really bugs me. Pettigrew was never described as /stupid/. Pettigrew was merely described as below /Sirius and James in magical ability/. McGonagall said he was hopeless at dueling but /not/ Transfiguration, potions or charms. As shown by his ability to brew a potion designed by Voldemort himself, it's enough evidence to say that he was never hopeless at potions. He managed to blow up an entire street in one curse, killing 12 people. It's a shame if that's not classified as above-average charms. And he was an anigamus with the help of Sirius and James, yeah.

Pettigrew wasn't say, younger Neville, ability-wise. He seemed higher than that. It's just that Pettigrew is very hated by the fandom (and I'm no exception) for how pathetic he is, that nearly no one gives him credit for things he was good at. We're making the same mistake as Sirius and James and underestimating the rat, from what I've seen.

#+end_quote

There are different kinds of intelligence, that's a well-known fact. For example, I might not be very able at science but you might be a genius at the subject but, maybe I'm smarter than you at English and you're just as bad as me in the area I'm good at. The same applies for Care of Magical Creatures. Hermione is great at it, Ron isn't. You see what I mean? Lavender and Parvati are good at divination, Harry isn't. So yes, it does require its own kind of intelligence, patience and skill.

  he could have easily got the enough in a different way, for example hiding his looks or just taking family heirlooms with him
#+end_quote

Hmmm, if hiding his looks was that simple then he'd have had better living conditions to live in. He would've easily hid his looks and bought something from a store, am I not right? He could've easily entered Hogwarts but without his typical appearance, etc.

As for the family heirloom, he got it in GoF. Crookshanks wasn't with him at the time and he was a wanted criminal who couldn't have possibly walked into Gringotts and demanded to enter the Black vault. Going to Grimmauld Place would've been the last thing on his mind at that time from what we have seen of him.

How could seven years not be much of an advantage for Bellatrix over Sirius? I would really like to know that. What would she have been doing at the time? She herself has said that Voldemort had taught her personally. She didn't have a family to tend to, no work and her marriage to Rodolphus would take what? A day?

Sirius did have emotional ivenstemnt but so did Kingsley, Tonks, Moody and the Death Eaters. Why wouldn't they? After all, they were fighting the same battle and in the same circumstances. The Death Eaters have most likely been locked up just like Sirius had but with each other and practice. They'd have been desperate too and yet he did best a lot of them.

The motorbike seemed pretty unique, other than that and Mr. Weasley's car we never see something even slightly similar to it. And Arthur seemed to have a knack for it, and /he/ was at least 10 years older than Sirius.

They have a lot of stereotypical middle class qualities:

- they live in the suburbs

- it's implied that they own their house which has at least 4 bedrooms, and separate living room, dining room and kitchen (it's fairly normal in the UK to have a combined living/dining room or kitchen/dining room)

- They (especially Petunia) give enough shit's about their garden to discuss the hose pipe ban and think they've won the All-England Best-Kept Lawn competition.

- they live in the south of England, and although working class people live everywhere, it is thought that the south is a lot posher than the north and JK would've been well aware of this when writing their characters.

- Vernon has a decent enough job to be given a company car. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I've known literally zero working class people who have been given company cars compared to middle class people I know.

- also while you may not think Majorca is a very classy destination, owning property abroad (especially places like Spain if you live in the UK) is so stereotypically middle class it's unreal.

** I always just assumed Hit Wizards were the Ministry's police whereas the Aurors are the actual elite wizards. To be an Auror, it takes getting 5 NEWTs at 'Exceeds Expectations' or higher, followed by 3 years of training. As such, they are the cream of the crop among the Ministry's fighting force. *Contrary to fanon, being an Auror doesn't require actually taking NEWT DADA, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology and Charms. Any five NEWTs at 'Exceeds Expectations' or higher would be enough. Contrary to more widespread fanon, Snape's high standards to enter NEWT Potions didn't cause any shortage of Aurors whatsoever.*

To be a Hit Wizard, all it takes is 5 OWLs at 'Exceeds Expectations' or higher including DADA. Meaning not only does it mean Hit Wizards don't have NEWTs, but they likely either lack the skill to do wandless magic. No wizard who is actually remotely decent at magic will ever become a Hit Wizard since they either became an Auror or they became the head of one of the Ministry's departments.

Aurors are the ones who bodyguard the Minister for Magic in OotP and who also guard Hogwarts in HBP. So they wouldn't be the police, but instead they would be the magical MI5. I'd even say that Aurors are a combination of a magical MI5 and the military. Hence why in Fantastic Beasts, it was five Aurors who were tried (and failed) to capture Grindelwald at the beginning, and also why it was the 20+ Aurors who attempted to arrest Grindelwald (as Graves).

When dark wizards who are actually competent at magic pose a threat, it is the Aurors who deal with them. Hit Wizards only exist to deal with 'average' problems like arresting Mundungus Fletcher. The only time Hit Wizards were stated to do anything of note was in POA when Fudge explains how they found Sirius after Wormtail faked his death. *That example doesn't count since JKR had not come up with the word 'Auror' yet to describe the elite force of the Ministry, hence why Hit Wizards are never referred to in the books once Aurors are introduced in GOF.*

To put into perspective how untalented Hit Wizards canonically are, basically half of Harry's year would be qualified to be Hit Wizards on (implied) OWL grades and dueling alone by the end of OOTP. Hit Wizards are basically wizards who weren't good enough to be Aurors and/or wizards who got decent grades at OWL-level but who failed most/all of their NEWTs. We get the impression in canon that outside of the Aurors, the rest of the Ministry employees are made up of average witches and wizards. The ones who never took their NEWTs or who failed them, the ones who can't cast the Shield Charm, the ones who very likely have no actual combat experience whatsoever.

Because of how weak the Ministry is as a whole, it wouldn't be an exageration to say that Voldemort could single-handedly defeat the entire workforce of the Ministry in an open battle. Aurors are the elite so I doubt Magical Britain has more than 20-30 of them in total at one time. The only plausable challenges would be either the head of the Auror Office or the head of Magical Law Enforcement. Most Ministry employees probably haven't dueled a dark wizard in their life given that the vast majority of the Ministry would be made up of average wizards, since most Ministry workers would be indoors doing paperwork.

That very fact shows just how important Aurors are in canon, given that they are the only actual force the Ministry has to arrest competent wizards. Any dark wizard who is above average would crush any Hit Wizard. It also reveals just how dependent on the Aurors the Ministry are. Hence why when a wizard like Grindelwald/Voldemort comes along, the Ministry is utterly powerless. This is a major flaw of the Ministry since while the Ministry can handle even competent dark wizards like the Death Eaters, it is completely powerless when faced with someone like Grindelwald or Voldemort.

*TL;DR: Aurors are the magical MI5/FBI, Hit Wizards are the police, and the rest of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement are magical versions of the Fire Brigade and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_police#United_Kingdom][Special Police]]*

  That example doesn't count
#+end_quote

If only because your assertion relies on it not counting.

I could say it /does/ count, and then come up with an equally unfounded claim as "Rowling just didn't know what to call them at the time." For instance, we could say the Hit Wizards don't care about your grades, because they're military-equivalents, not supercops. About all you need to join the military is a diploma and functioning limbs. They'll train you in whatever they need you to do.

Then, it makes perfect sense for Aurors to be doing most of the heavy lifting. It's only when the situation requires magic soldiers that you'd send out the Hit Wizards. Naturally, in an extreme crisis, they'd also be the first ones dead, since they were the first to go fight.

It's not like the wizarding world needs the same sort of police and military structures as the muggle world anyways. You wouldn't even need a full-sized military, just a single combat unit for whenever you have a particular need for a lot of violence and not a lot of discretion.

I know this sub is hyper contrarian, but sometimes the fanon actually exists for a reason, and in this case, it's because it's trying to fit a piece of canon in, instead of tossing it out as Rowling's mistake (which, if that was our standard, you've got bigger fish to fry than Aurors and Hit Wizards).

****** Sorry, wasn't clear.

Rich people are not nobility. That's my point. Just because you're a snob rich man with a disdain for the "inferior classes" doesn't make you nobility. Class differences, inhereited wealth and pretentious upbringing is not enough to "act noble". The heir of a huge megacorp is not nobility, even if he has all those traits.

Nobility is the specific mindset that your birth gives you an inherently better status that create respect, and that only you deserve to be in a position of power due to this birth. Furthermore not only do you think like that, society agrees (more or less) with you. That's why there is a House of Lords in the UK or why in pre-revolutionary France only nobles could be military officers or bishops, because noble blood /literally makes you better/. Classism is not tied to birth, just to wealth.

Now, do Pureblood thinks that way? Not really. While there is some trace of it (and yes there is indeed a bit of noble thinking here), the Malfoys are more classic rich guys than nobles. And their blood supremacy is /racial/. It's tied to the idea of losing the purity of blood and the mixing of races. It's 19th century scientific racism not 15th century noble privilege. It's more "wizard master race" than "destined to rule", that's why the pureblood genealogy is called "nature's nobility", it's racial. And furthermore society doesn't give a crap about their blood. They do, but not the ministry, they don't have special privileges... up until the blood purists take over that is.

I feel like the epilogue undermines that a bit. Harry has exactly one crush before Ginny, while Ginny's first crush is Harry. They get together at 15/16 and it's true love forever. Both Ron and Hermione have teenage crushes, but neither really acts on it (I read the Ron/Lavender relationship as being mostly physical, with no real feelings from Ron involved). They then start crushing on each other, get together at 18 and it's true love forever.

There's also a lot of background characters for whom this doesn't hold, though.

#+begin_quote
  There is one major exception to the general magical aversion to Muggle technology, and that is the car (and, to a lesser extent, motorbikes and trains). Prior to the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, wizards and Muggles used the same kind of everyday transport: horse-drawn carts and sailing ships among them. The magical community was forced to abandon horse-drawn vehicles when they became glaringly outmoded. It is pointless to deny that wizardkind looked with great envy upon the speedy and comfortable automobiles that began filling the roads in the twentieth century, and eventually even the Ministry of Magic bought a fleet of cars, modifying them with various useful charms and enjoying them very much indeed. Many wizards love cars with a child-like passion, and there have been cases of pure-bloods who claim never to touch a Muggle artefact, and yet are discovered to have a flying Rolls Royce in their garage. However, the most extreme anti-Muggles eschew all motorised transport; Sirius Black's love of motorbikes incensed his hard-line parents.

** Only two little problems.

- Our only knowledge of possibly muggleborn Slytherin during the time of the books comes only from Scabior, who's commenting on the idea in a mocking and unbelieving way to Harry. Hardly proof. More proof against it, if anything. On Pottermore's sorting though, which is set in modern times, yes, there are muggleborn Slytherin. But beyond those two things, everything points toward muggleborns being excluded during the time of Harry/the Marauders.

- Pureblood thinking is clearly not a modern (or even somewhat recent) concept. Salazar Slytherin himself, one of the founders of Hogwarts back in the 10th century only wanted purebloods in his house.

For the Pureblood thing that's not true. He did not wanted any muggleborn, not the same thing (and no it's not proof, that's just one of the thing he wanted). Also there are exceptions of course, but Pottermore and interviews with Rowling (which I consider canon) clearly states that pureblood mania is recent... (proof enough for me). and more importantly that pureblood do not exist: a Malfoy wanted to marry Queen Elizabeth I (muggle), the Weasleys claim muggle ancestors and the Malfoy definitely have some hidden muggle ancestors according to her on Pottermore.

For examples:

- Snape met a few obnoxious Slytherin purelboods on the train first instead of James and Sirius. Consequently, he decided to follow Lily into Gryffindor.
- Ariana Dumbledore was killed by those Muggle boys, and Albus was fully committed with his friend Gellert as a result.
- Sirius decided to take care of Harry and report the truth to Dumbledore instead of chasing down Wormtail. Harry would then grow up in a very different environment and have a different personality too.
- JKR trivialized Harry's abuse, but what if an author takes it more seriously? Then it's very reasonable to write Harry into a Muggle hating sociopath, who quickly fell in with Voldemort's anti-Muggle ideology.
