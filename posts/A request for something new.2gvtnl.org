While I am working I end up with these stretches of down time which has become my primary fanfiction time, but often fall back to stories I have read over and over and want to read something new for a change.

I don't have any preference on what type of story it could follow cannon almost perfectly or be a wild AU I don't mind as long as it follows Harry (during or after Hogwarts) and it's well written.

I do like a story to have a parring and again open to Harry/anyone with the exception of the following Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, and Harry/Cho. Those parrings just don't inrerest me.

On a final note I don't care for bashing, if a author wants to portray a character in a negative light thats fine, but outright bashing turns me off from a story. For instance I once read a fic where the entire Weasly family (Barring Arthur I think) was turned into these cartoonish villains trying to get "revenge" on Harry which ended with Bill, Charlie, and the twins trying to murder Harry.

** Not sure what you mean by "new". But some recommendations for you: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10364683/1/Harry-s-Golden-Nuggets][Harry's Golden Nuggets]]. Complete. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]]. Abandoned, but very good anyways.

*** Harry's Golden Nuggets is such a strange fic.

There is this really sudden full fledged rape scene and detailed aftermath and then two paragraphs later it's like it never happened and by the next chapter it's never mentioned.

WTF?

That and the whole being groped and stripped in public is so wildly unrealistic I was rolling my eyes every time it happened. It wasn't funny or endearing or made me sympathize with Harry, it just made me realize how dumb the story was.

Now that being said, I do think there were some great ideas that I haven't seen before in other stories, I just can't shake the feeling that the author has some crazy femdom rape fantasy that he's written through Harry.

*** Wit of the Raven got so good when Harry arrived at Hogwarts. And to think I was about to drop this story when it turned out that he was too cool for a wand. (Meh, I can't figure out how to create a spoiler tag).

**** Don't worry about spoiling me I typically do so to myself when reading through the reviews, so this lets me know what I'm in for and gives me a point of refrence of giving the story a try

*** First thanks for the recommendations I'll be sure to check them out

All I mean by "new" is something I haven't read before... which I am now realizing is difficult because I never mentioned what I have read before.

For the sake of future recs in this thread if its one of the more well known fics in the Harry/Fluer/Daphne or/Tonks sections there is a good chance I've read it.

*** While I do like crossovers I haven't looked into Harry Potter crossovers so I appreciate the recommendations. I am not a fan of Fem!Harry but maybe those recommendations can change that, thanks for them.
