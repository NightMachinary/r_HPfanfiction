Not looking for rehashes per se (As I tend to get annoyed) by them). Or if they are rehashes, put in extra could have happened scenes. But more like missing scenes, could have happened scenes, us following character(s) outside of Harry, etc. Still set in what we know of as Canon, but not just only rehashing.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or Not

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc. Does NOT have to focus on pairings.

Note: Does NOT have to focus solely on the Golden Trio Era for the Canon Compliant. There's a BUNCH of stuff that could be written that's Canon Compliant.

How'd James get Lily interested in him?

Order Missions while Harry and co are at Hogwarts.

Why did Pettigrew betray everyone?

Heck, could be set in the Next Gen Era, as long as it's Canon Compliant, could have happened/etc (Just no Cursed Child Compliant).

What were the other students or even the teachers up to when Harry, Ron and Hermione were doing crazy stuff at Hogwarts?

Showing what happened during Hogwarts when Harry, Ron and Hermione were looking for Horcruxes

Showing the fight between Remus and Tonks, Teddy being born, etc.

Just anything that could be Missing Scenes, Could have Happened in Canon, or Did happen in Canon, but shown differently, etc.

etc.

Flawed Characters are a YES, Bashed Characters are a NO.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13882532/1/Ministry-of-Mendacium]]) --- The Fall of the Ministry of Magic

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13873728/1/To-Hell-and-Back]]) -- Fudge meets Sirius on his inspection of Azkaban

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13857771/1/Worthy-of-Her]]) -- the few moments before James Potter dies.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13854078/1/Ornamental-Precautions]]) -- the staff meeting to set up the Philosophers Stone crystal maze bullshit.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13824044/1/Burn]]) -- The fire in the Room of Requirement.

This author does a bunch of canon compliant oneshots if that's any good to you?

  Amelia Bones felt as though she was late to everything these days. Too late to the meetings, too late to the raids, too late to save her people from being killed. There was a rat in the Department, Moody could smell it, though Amelia refused to believe it. But the evidence keeps piling up. Can she trust the Aurors she once hired, or would a small leak sink the great ship?

  "If you wanna be a hero that badly, there's a quick way to do it. Believe that you'll be born with a quirk in your next life and take a swan dive off the roof!”When Katsuki's comment comes at just the wrong time, Izuku takes his advice. But it is not the end. Alternatively:In another world where Izuku is attacked by the sludge villain on the way to school instead of after it, his dreams get crushed too soon. With nothing to save him and Katsuki's words ringing in his ears, Izuku decides to end it all by jumping off his school's roof. As his body cracks on the ground, Izuku does not pass on to the next world. Instead, he is left as a ghost among many others. When the slime villain escapes from jail and attacks the person Izuku can't help but care for, he learns that there may be more to his afterlife than he thought.And maybe he can be a hero after all.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Remus lets out the breath he's holding. He's been holding his breath for a very long time, twelve years maybe. Something is aligning itself with horrible, brutal clarity in his mind.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** The Hogwarts Retold series by MelasZepheos. It details another trio of forgotten students that were only mentioned in the first book (Lily Moon, Lisa Turpin, and Sally-Anne Perks). Sadly, it's on hiatus around midway during Book 3.
