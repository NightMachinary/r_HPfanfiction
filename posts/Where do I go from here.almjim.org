I just finished reading everything Inverarity has put out; The Alexandra Quick series and Hogwarts Houses Divided.

I liked the fact that they are essentially full-length books, and (except Houses Divided) they don't reference the original series hardly ever. Are there any others out there that compare?


** Most Harry Potter fanfiction is written by people who like the characters and settings and want to use those pieces in some capacity. If you want something at Alexandra Quick levels of AU, with effectively no canon characters or settings, you might as well look up other fantasy literature including more traditional fiction recs over on [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]]. The magic school trope is not uncommon. Not specifically related, but [[http://topwebfiction.com/][I've recently been reading the top books from this list: stuff like Worm, Mother of Learning, and Worth the Candle are all fantastic.]] Or I can highly recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB][Sufficiently Advanced Magic,]] which is a great take on the magic school idea and has interesting developments in both magic and the story.

** Can recommend Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly.

It's a series of futurefics focusing on Dudley's daughter Holly after she discovers she's a witch and an empath.

It's not really super independent from the original series since Harry's kids are also present and major secondary characters, but there's lots of original ideas and at least for me the series hit many of the same strings that Alexandra Quick did.

Edit: Oh, and you should also check out [[https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1][Gunnerkrig Court]]. It's a webcomic about students at a magical school and it sort of explores the implications of humans trying to bend magic to their will and creating magitech in a world that also has a lot of wild magic.

It's a really great comic with great art, great characters and lots and lots of seemingly whimsical mysteries that somehow all connect together.

Oh, and don't worry if the first chapters don't look that good, both the art and the story quickly get much better.
