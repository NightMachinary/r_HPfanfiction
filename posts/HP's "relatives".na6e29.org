Has anyone explored the idea that Lily and Petunia Evans weren't sisters by blood?

One scenario I've bandied about goes was follows: 1) The Evans parents marry in the late 40's; 2) Possibly, Mr. Evans participates in The Korean Conflict; 3) By 1957, the couple is still childless, and on the verge of divorce; 4) A family friend of either sort, suggests adoption; 5) Petunia is born in '58, and the paperwork comes through by year's end; 6) With the pressure off, Mrs. Evans naturally conceives around Beltine (Second of May); 7) The couple find out about the pregnancy in August, having Lily in late January; 8) Being such a stressful time, and not wanting any questions of which girl is the favorite, the family agree to delay telling the girls about the adoption, until Lily is also eighteen; 9) The Evans parents die in 1977, and Petunia packs away all the paperwork.

... Discuss?


** I've definitely seen a few fics where they were actually half-sisters or one of them (usually Lily) was adopted. I think it's usually used to justify some extra Dumbledore bashing based on the blood protections being BS. Or to make Lily secretly a pureblood because...I don't know, there are probably some reasons that aren't racist, but I can't think of any.

I can't remember any specific fics that used the idea though.

** I've read a few where Lily was adopted by the Evans family and she was related to some old pureblood line. Sometimes it's a random made-up family and sometimes not, there was one I read where she was a Slytherin descendant.

*** Lily being descended from a Slytherin squib is a pretty common plot point, I thought? I've seen it used as the reason for Voldemort's spell rebounding too - magic gets pissy when you try to kill your heir or something.

** One of the most interesting takes on Lily's heritage that I've seen is in linkao3(Lady of New Avalon). She and Petunia are actually cousins. Petunia's aunt was a muggleborn auror who was raped by Voldemort as part of a ritual before dying a year later. Lily was adopted by her aunt and remained oblivious to this fact until Sirius accidentally made her mom blab about it.

  Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder --- a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy --- the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy --- and above all, lucky --- the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

** Yes, I've seen it quite a bit in bashing fics as a way for the blood wards not to be relevant reason to send Harry to ‘Durskaban'.

It's also often used as a reason petunia can be so cruel, both because of insecurity and also a weird blood is thicker than water thing which is about as relevant to life as using half a proverb and applying it to the opposite of the true meaning of it (blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb)

So on that point, I'd like to see a fic where petunia actually takes him in and adopts him despite her being adopted and Lily being the biological child. And you could even have a nice ‘magic can do anything' moment, where the wards work despite them not having the same genes because she swore she would honour Lily's sacrifice or something And the magic takes her at her word

*** Actually "Blood is thicker than water" is the original version, dating back to the 12th century in Germany. The longer was created randomly and adopted by a lot of people centuries later. So the true meaning was the original that family is more important than friends. But people realized how stupid that was and now it is the newer one where choosen family is more important than the one you were given.

**** Oh wow! I didn't know that! So interesting!

It might be interesting to think about how changes in beliefs and cultural understandings might change the way magic works if it was intent based as some people have it. If belief is so intrinsic to the way a six forms their intent does blood magic change? if the spell was formed while the saying was blood is thicker than water perhaps the change in cultural belief would mean that the intent in the magic changed or perhaps it doesn't change, and people just assume it will work a certain way because of cultural beliefs and be surprised when it doesn't work

That is really interesting. It would be cool to see spells changing how they work because of changed meaning. Or even connotation of words, could you imagine? What it somebody tries to conjure a cottage in the forest and gets a cabin in the woods instead?

*** Funny Story: I'm currently re-reading "Strings of Fate" (by Knife Hand), which is a "Petunia takes Harry in and teaches him how to outwit the manipulative wizards"-story.

I've heard of some stories where Lily is the adopted one, but those seemed more focused on the idea of Harry being a Parselmouth by inheritance, not to explain Petunia's antagonism. I just always thought it would be fun to have a reason for Petunia to be the adopted one, instead.

Also, thanks for the heads-up on the source of that proverb; I don't think I ever even thought about where it came from before.

****** Perhaps I was thinking about “My Nephew Harry” linkffn(5165369) with this story of Petunia's parents:

#+begin_quote
  The true story of the matter of her parentage was that her step-father had rescued her mother who had been raped and was in the process of being murdered. After being led by her parents to believe that if she got an abortion for any reason she would go to hell after enduring a horrible life as punishment for her sin, her mother had kept the pregnancy. Soon after the rescue, she married Mr. Evans who had fallen in love with her during his frequent visits to see if she was alright, and didn't want her to go through the shame of raising a child out of wedlock, especially considering the fact that it hadn't been her fault in the first place. Eventually, her mother had come to love her husband as well, and they had a child of their own which was Lily. She had heard this story only once, shortly after she had reached adulthood, and as it had never been brought up before, it was never mentioned since.
#+end_quote

I am not sure I really like the rest of the story, but this background sub-story somehow got stuck in my head.
