Just what the title says. Have at it, folks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] Not really a time travel, Hermione sends what is effectively a tweet back through time. After a long break, just updated.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] Fem Harry, no pairings...sort of. This is one of the best stories I've ever read. Highly recommended. Currently updating, usually once a month.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] It has two sequels, considered a classic. Canon pairings. All three are complete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] End of third year, Hermione makes a time beacon where they can return to that point. So far there has been 6 loops I believe. Harry/Hermione pairing. Probably a dead fic though.

******** Fun (useless) trivia: the title is almost certainly a reference to a Poul Anderson short story of the same name, also about time travel, which is itself a reference to the famous Latin phrase "Carthago delenda est" ("Carthage must be destroyed") from the Third Punic War.

** [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26009][Yet Everything Remains the Same]] This story was excellent. Snape/Hermione pairing. Snape is sent 30 years into the future by Voldemort to see who the child in the prophecy is. Meanwhile in present day, Hermione is living in Spinner's End overseeing a museum she set up to honor Snape, who died in the war. Heartbreaking, but just a great read IMO.

***** I started Vanity a while ago but never finished. Didn't Hermione come back from the past fairly early in that story? I can't seem to remember exactly why I never finished the story. Maybe I should check it out again. I know I started Consequences of Meddling with Time as well but it's been a while since I've read that one as well.

A couple of my favorite Snape/Hermione TT fics are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/1/An-Unwritten-Future][An Unwritten Future]] and [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17758][For All Intents and Purposes.]] Thanks again for the recs.

****** Yes, in Vanity Hermione comes back fairly early in the story. It's basically The events of HBP from her point of view. It's one of my favorite stories.

In Consequences of Meddling with Time, Hermione makes several accidental jumps back to when Snape was a student. Snape spends those times taking care of her and protecting her.

** I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]]. Harry goes back in time to kill Voldemort as an infant and gets entangled in the war against Grindelwald, it suffers a bit from pre-DH syndrome, but not very much. There is a sequel, but it's a lot weaker and unfinished.

** Some of the best writing of the genre is by Deadwoodpecker with her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] series.

Sarah1281's humorous story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is recommended.

For something a bit different, Perspicacity [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][has]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][written]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/Yule-Time][a]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/6/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][few]]. Though his writing is a bit hit and miss at times, the story ideas are pretty original for a well trodden genre.

Harry has an accident and winds up studying under Flamel. I had plans for him to join Hogwarts as a contemporary of Dumbledore but we never got there. Half an additional chapter is complete, but sort of shitty and boring so I never bothered revising and posting.

****** And most fanfiction isn't time travel. I get that much but I still don't see the appeal. The on ones I have seen are the 'set right that which have gone wrong' or 'stuck in a time loop' variety and while the latter makes for interesting reading, the former is far too prevalent and not done too well.

*** I would guess that it is because, instead of primarily expanding/continuing the world, many (most?) authors want to make changes to / play around with (we'll politely not say rehash) the basic cannon plot. There are only so many ways of doing this: go AU by having some event or circumstance suddenly deviate at the author's discretion or have the characters react differently by having future information/abilities which implies time travel. Add in that the characters and tone change over the course of the books and some people want to mash later canon elements with earlier canon plot, and time travel it is.

** There's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]]; which is kickass in the same kind of way as Wastelands of Time. Sadly it is only updated every now and then. It's pretty good, but most people who like timetravel have already read it (sometimes more than once).
