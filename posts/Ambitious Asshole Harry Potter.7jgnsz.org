Any fics where Harry is an ambitious, power hungry individual that will do any thing for power. Where he doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself or cares how his actions affect other people. Where he is likely to punch the guy who annoys him in the face. Crossovers and Wbwl fics welcomed. Female Harry welcomed too.


** linkffn(for love of magic)

He grows into more of an asshole over time.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
