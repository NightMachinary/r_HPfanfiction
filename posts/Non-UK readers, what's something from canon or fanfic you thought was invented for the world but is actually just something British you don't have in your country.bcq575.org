*** Well, sort of: /private/ schools do. Hogwarts is an oddity in that (aside from the fact it teaches magic) it is organised like a private school, with a board of governors and relative independence from the government, but no mention has ever been made of tuition fees. The best comparison is to an English [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_(English_school)][academy]], but these really don't have the same sort of culture and prestige the great old private schools do.

****** I think it mostly just encourages students to do good things and get rewards. No school I've ever been too takes house points away, you just get points for doing well. Plus for sports day and other extracurricular activities it adds some healthy competition. It doesn't get nasty or overly competitive like in the books, but unlike the books, real schools don't divide up classes and student groups by their houses, so everyone is friends with whomever regardless of their house. It only comes into play during school competitions in a more relaxed way. At hogwarts they really take houses more seriously than any school I've been to

Granted I'm from Australia but my school took it's cues from the fact that we are descended from an Irish Blessed (the point before you get called a saint) and use a very British kind of system.

It's nowhere near as horrible as HP, we just wore different coloured shirts on Friday, sat in our squares for big events (there was a large square of brick marked into quarters for assemblies and the like), and sports carnivals were one side vs the other.

Really light hearted and other me than having the best colour (blue) we didnt mind at all. No stereotypes or anything, but that was likely because our names and mottos were in latin and nobody cared enough to learn about them.

Also, although our houses didn't have traits like in HP, they did develop reputations -- my house was generally considered the "sporty" house, one of the other girls' houses had more of a girly-girl rep, and the other was nerdy. Boys houses had it to -- the bad boys, the popular cool boys, and the prim-and-proper lads. Only the mixed house didn't really have a reputation like that, but it was also the only house that was for day students instead of boarders.

****** I don't know if you're a football (soccer, if you're American) fan but our support for clubs is pretty much like this. People in England (and other European countries) support a certain club almost always because it's a local club. But for those of us living outside this region, we don't have the same local connection. We don't have family members supporting the same club, we don't have our town/city teaching us the club's traditions and mentalities and chants. Is our support any less though? Nope. I'm a Liverpool FC supporter without ever having visited England, let alone our club's stadium. I religiously wake up in the middle of the night to watch matches even though almost always I have to go to work the next morning. I've cried tears of joy when we've won a certain crucial match, been depressed for days after we lost a final. I've got into quarrels with friends because they derided a player of my club.

I don't know the exact explanation for this but I think evolution has given us this trait where we love the sense of belonging to a certain group/organization/house/club/team and develop intense feelings of loyalty to defend that sense of belonging

******* No, I don't follow sports of any kind, but I have been thoroughly exposed to this phenomenon as well, and always been mystified by it. I've never really felt any care for any specific team winning, except maybe briefly the Kings basketball team when I lived in Sacramento (California) but I quickly grew out of that (and also moved away). And that was only because everyone else was into it at my school.

I totally get the belonging thing and it is important to me too, but what I don't get is how people choose which group to belong to or what team/club to support when it is arbitrary. I did briefly join an intramural soccer league recently and briefly got a sense of that team spirit, but that was because I was actually playing (and it quickly dissipated when we didn't have regular practices and I dropped out of the league).

For me, I want my sense of belonging to be based in something more meaningful/less arbitrary, which in the past has often been activist causes. But even that has changed, and these days I am more of a loner. My desire for non-arbitrariness trumps my desire for belonging, it would seem.

******** It isn't exactly non-arbitrary though. I've watched soccer for a long time without supporting a certain club. But I've preferred certain playing styles and players and coaches/managers. I have greatly enjoyed reading about the history of this city and club over that of others. I have sympathies (although I wouldn't call it outright support) for the traditional political mentality of the city (which is also intrinsic to the club in many ways). Then there was a certain match in 2005 when Liverpool played and won in a way that never happened before and probably would never happen in the future. A lot of us across the world fell in love after that match. So, it was almost inevitable that I'd be a Liverpool fan at some point.

Similarly in schools, the initial house assignment might be arbitrary but whatever happens after it isn't. You guys change schools on an average of two-three times, if I'm not wrong (at least, most of you change schools when you enter the high school level). In India though, most of us have studied in the same school for 12 years (right from the point when you enter school to the point you leave for college). As a result, for 12 years, we are taught and brought up in the ethos of our house. For 12 years, we compete fiercely in extra-curricular competitions (both sporting and non-sporting). We have houses excelling in certain fields and our house teachers encouraging us to perform well in those fields because of our history (my house was brilliant at debates for example). So, after a point, it really doesn't matter that we we were assigned randomly to a house.

*** Houses are more a boarding school thing, where you literally live in different houses. Day schools often have teams that score points for good work and so on and those are sometimes called houses but it's purely a label.

At my secondary school each year had four forms, L, R, G and S (from Lancaster Royal Grammar School) but that was purely to divide 120 people into manageable class sizes. The forms didn't compete.

We had prefects, who could hand out minor punishments: giving someone a "sheet" meant they had to fill a sheet of A4, typically with stuff copied from the school rules or similar.

**** Hah!

No, a Yorkshire pudding is a part of a roast dinner. Traditions vary around the country - in parts of Yorkshire they make one huge Yorkshire pudding and serve the roast in it, in other parts the Yorkshire pudding is served as a starter with gravy, but most places in the UK would have little fist sized Yorkshires on the side of their roast. They would usually have one or two, so you would offer someone a bowl or tray of several of them to add to their plate. They are made of a batter of flour and eggs that gets nice and fluffy in the oven.

******** I read Lupin as being lower middle class, which, in England up to this century, had nothing whatsoever to do with wealth, even though there was a correlation. It's a culture and an attitude of mind, so a stony broke middle class person does not become working class, and a working class millionaire is still working class, although their kids probably wouldn't be, because they'd socialise with other children who grew up with that level of money and those children would probably be middle class by sheer peer pressure.

Anyway, at this point in time, lower middle class people are aspirational and care about doing things properly, which is what marks them out as not being working class, even though the wealth levels overlap widely. Working class culture tends to be something of a crab bucket, with a social stigma against 'talking posh' or 'thinking too much of yourself' or 'putting on airs and graces'. Lower middle-class people, on the other hand, want their children to speak properly, get as good an education as they can manage and be acceptable to the higher classes.

Remus reads as lower middle class in all sorts of subtle ways that can be pulled apart by an outsider as being meaningless; word choice, clothing, the things he lets go and the things he chooses to get angry about, and it would be exhausting to pull them apart and have each one be dismissed as 'other types of people could say those things too' - it's a totality and I can't 'prove' it. It's just, /being/ lower-middle-class myself, growing up on a housing estate with working class and 'underclass' people and then hanging about with the 'horsey set' which go all the way up and down the classes and having an upper-middle-class best friend, I grew up with all of this. Class is something middle classes in particular were fairly obsessed with, and being able to sum up someone's class was something of a survival skill.

These days it all seems to be down to wealth, although honestly a lot of class markers are still there, but in class discussions people say no, it's down to how much money you have. I grew up with class being about attitude and speech patterns. Lupin grew up before my time, but that sort of class differentiation was only more marked the further back you go, up to the Industrial Revolution.

I distinctly remember thinking that middle class people really wanted to be accepted by higher classes, so it has a bit of a negative connotation to me, though I mean no offence to you!

I never understood mentioning 'red- haired woman' as quality of that person for a long time until I looked up English stereotypes about redheads. Everyone I've met in real life has black hair and black eyes... I wondered if people had weird fetishes whenever I read about Potters marrying redheads in the fandom. It was just another hair colour, what is everyone fussing about?

I also thought that red hair meant the shade of a red rose, or probably the colour of Ariel's hair in The Little Mermaid and wondered why the film actors never bothered dyeing their hair red.

**** No it's a British thing, once you hit high school each class will likely be in a different room with different teachers (some classes may well be in different rooms on different days, and occasionally even have different teachers). The different rooms for the same subject were all near each other when possible (though a few subjects had classes in 'mobiles' which are basically prefab buildings added cause the school intake grew as population did).\\
Teachers usually taught in the same room for most of their lessons, but would sometimes have to shift around.

There's the classes where it's necessary, anything using computers, design technology (ranging from designing stuff on isometric paper, making CAD plans {though almost never actually using the machine to make them}, to making and painting wooden {well MDF} and plastic stuff with coping saws and hand files), art, music, drama and the sciences, but we did it for everything.

You should be able to find them if you're in North America, or at least a place that gets Canadian tourists. No idea if putting raisins in treacle tarts is as common as it is for butter tarts though.

** I didn't know what was up with "er." It was only recently when I watched a completely unrelated YouTube video where someone said 'eh...' and it was captioned as 'er...'

I guess because of the soft 'r' sound?

*** In the UK, I would read "eh" as a tone of confusion that sounds like the letter "a". I don't know why it's written like that, but that's how it seems to line up in audio books and subtitles in films and tv.

**** I only read as confusion if accompanied by a question mark. If it's a full stop, I read as indifference.

****** It's curious because I actually find the questioning one stranger. I'd be more like to say "huh?" or "what?" (Although, I do watch a lot of American TV and very little British, so perhaps I've been unduly influenced lol)

*** I always though ‘eh' and ‘er' were different- at least that's how I use them: eh means an indifference, but er means a confusion or awkwardness

**** Oh yeah, with an accent it probably does sounds very different. I should have said it 'sounded like eh,' that probably would have been less confusing. To me 'er' is such an odd thinking noise, even harder to say than a pirate's 'Arr!' haha But with the soft r it sounds so different, much easier.

Maybe in between eh and uh, with my accent.

** The word "Keeper."

Since we call them "goalies" in America, I'd never heard this word before! And it obviously aligns with the other Quidditch positions: Seeker, Chaser, Beater. Imagine my surprise when I learned that that's actually what Brits call goalies in football!
