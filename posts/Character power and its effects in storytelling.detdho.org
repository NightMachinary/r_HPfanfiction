** IF the point of the story is the struggle between the hero and villain, then yes. If that isn't the story's main purpose, it becomes less important. An overpowered character who just can't find a date for the yule ball is still an interesting story.

*** I agree. Making a character OP makes focusing on another aspect of the story easier. Not all story needs the classic Hero vs Villain conflict.

OP Harry sent to another dimension? Let him beat Voldemort in a chapter, then focuses on his angst and PTSD in seeing the alternate version of his dead loved ones. You can also focus on the reaction of other people after Harry arrived. Suspicion? Awe? Worship?

OP Harry met another dark lord in his 70s? Focus on his relationship with his family, how he tried to balance saving the world while changing his grandson's diaper.

If the entire fanfiction is only exist to wank OP Harry's super big magical core, it will be boring. If the author can add another aspect that makes the story interesting, it will be worth a read. It's similar with Canon rehash story, you need to focus another point that makes your story unique.

*** That raises the question why you brought up the power thing in the first place. There are quite a few smut fics which do that. For no apparent reason they drop the size of Harry's magical core or how powerful he is, even if the "plot" has nothing to do with it.

**** For contrast, would be my go-to. Everyone's strong in some areas and weak in others: it could provide a very dramatic view of the diversity of abilities within a person.

Or it could be used as an exploration of the effect that much power has on a person's actions, and the way they're perceived, entirely apart from any actual battle that may take place. My point is the basic fact of 'character is more powerful than their nemesis' doesn't have to be detrimental to the story.

Of course, this all assumes a competent writer - certainly there are far more stories (especially fanfics) where they know they want the character to be cool and awesome and powerful but don't understand how to make it genuine and feel appropriate instead of excessive.

******* But it doesn't. If you take time to characterize Harry as an uber powerful dude then don't make use of his strength it's just bad writing.

If a character is written as super strong then make use of this. Even if there is not an enemy to challenge him, at least make some sort of conflict out of his OPness compared to his peers, but just hyping him up as some sort of demi-god and then not making use of it is just bad.

** Power fantasies are a staple of fanfiction. Ever see a character in a movie or a book suffer, and wish they didn't? Re-writing them with more power and agency is a way to fix them. It's part "righting the wrongs", fixing plot holes or Idiot Balls that lowered the perceived quality of the source material, and part wish-fulfillment catharsis. Because we all love Harry, and Harry deserves to win, not get branded a delusional liar by the number one wizarding newspaper.

I disagree that a villain should be powered up if the hero gets improved powers. What OP!Harry fics suffer from isn't necessarily a wimpy villain, but an overall lack of conflict and tension in the story. These kinds of stories revel in making Harry special, independently wealthy (10000 galleons and 5 estates!), and emancipated from his guardians. All the minor obstacles that Harry had to deal with in the books are suddenly gone when he can have his best friend Cornelius Fudge sack Umbridge because Harry inherited the Wizengamot.

There are other ways to introduce conflict or stakes in a story, without beefing up the villain and making him a cartoonish parody of himself. For instance, an OP!Harry could defeat Voldemort with his eyes closed, but there could still be conflict in the form of dealing with the PTSD of his abusive childhood, or struggling with the bureaucratic mire of Ministry reformation. Balance the strengths with the weaknesses, and you can still tell an interesting story. Look at One Punch Man, where Saitama has god powers on one hand, but paralyzing ennui on the other.

I do think that, ultimately, OP Harry Sues are a symptom of novice writers, and that's why they lack complexity that we expect in polished professional fiction. This is the very reason that OC's like Ebony Darkn'ess are so derided, but with Harry (and Super!Hermione) we have enough emotional investment to the books that their storybreaking powers are tolerable to read, instead of insufferable.

*** In addition to your example of One Punch Man, I think DBZ's Frieza saga is a brilliant example of how to to tell a good story with incredibly mismatched power levels:

At any point in time, Goku was so beyond the power scale of anyone else in that story, he could have snapped and just solved all the problems. He's not just like 1.5x or 2x stronger than anyone else, he's like 10x stronger than Frieza's final form, while Frieza was 10x stronger than everyone else. The reason this is still, in my opinion, the best told DBZ arc, is that there is a LOT of good set-up and payoff going on to build tension:

1. Goku first has to get to Namek to be effective.
2. While Frieza is to everyone else as Goku is to Frieza, Frieza has a lot of personality flaws that allow Gohan and Krillin and Vegeta to out-smart him and his goons.
3. The Super Saiyan set up is introduced by Vegeta near the beginning of the arc, and reminded a few times later, while being a /personal/ motivation for Vegeta: he wants to avenge his people, and his people were slaughtered due to a vague prophecy that Frieza would be defeated by a Saiyan, so it all comes full circle. The motivation of the character is intrinsically tied to the set-up and payoff structure of the plot.
4. Goku himself gets outsmarted a few times due to his own flaws.
5. The pacing and constant back-and-forth builds tension and releases it at key moments in the story, always teasing the audience that something is coming, making tiny reveals along the way (Vegeta and his multiple heel-turns, the Ginyu Force, Nail+Piccolo, The Dragon Ball mcguffins themselves, Frieza's final form, etc), only to make the big final reveal when shit really hits the fan.

There's a constant back-and-forth, where the powerful are consistently outwitted by the weaker players, realistic mistakes have realistic consequences, and the ending is properly set up with a satisfying payoff. That's how you tell a good story with mismatched power-levels.

** If the main character is overly powerful the plot can move in a different direction, like focusing on philosophical themes or some such, an example is "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", in which Harry is a god of death, so she(it is a fem!harry story) is more powerful then any villain could ever be, but the story is much more philosophical then anything else.

** Overpowered characters are pretty much the bread-and-butter of fantasy/sci-fi/supernatural fanfiction (even some adventure style fanfiction). It comes from the same place as anything else in fanfiction really - wish-fulfillment. Everyone wants to 'see' something they did not in canon, and generally actual stories/novels/manga/etc. have characters that are not strong(est) and have to overcome more powerful obstacles. This is both more enjoyable to read (i.e. tension and conflict) and closer to the real-world (i.e. believable within the context of the world since people are generally still people in such stories).

OP characters are very much a form of self-insert for the author (and readers), mainly so they can write scenes with them being adored or praised for how incredible they are at 'insert-ability-here.' This goes hand-in-hand with most harem-fics as well. The praising and adoration are often the point, as in real life that rarely happens to people outside of a handful of political, social, or religious elite.

There is, of course, another reason for the OP character (or rather main characters): its easy. Making your character superpowered compared to everyone else means they can just breeze through every challenge or conflict while keeping the storyline relatively unchanged outside of fawning over the main character. Now, thats not all OP characters, but I would bet everyone reading this can name at least a handful of HP fics off the top of their head that fit /exactly/ this description. But thats the point is it not? Wish fulfillment isn't about writing a new story so much as making the character go through the same story except be awesome at everything.

Now, does that mean I am necessarily opposed to OP characters? No not at all. But for an OP!Harry (or any fanfiction really) to work and be worth reading they must:

1. Provide a believable pathway for the character to become overpowered (ex. Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived, The One He Feared, The Prisoner's Cipher)
2. Maintain conflict in the story despite the character(s) upscaling of their abilities (ex. The Lesser Sadness, The Unforgiving Minute, The Mind Arts)
3. Demonstrate that the story is /not/ solely a rehash for the authors benefit (ex. Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure, A Black Comedy)

Sadly, such fics are far-and-few between. Hell, most of these are uncommon more generally in fanfiction as a whole (lets say 90% of fanfiction or so is mostly rehash of whatever canon it exists within).

** Depends entirely on if the main driving force of the narrative is on hero vs baddie, or if it's character driven or a comedy. The latter two, it works just fine. It's just harder to do right.

*** Which is a shitty saying even if you don't realise that another magic sword won't do anything for Frodo. When the heroes in canon only won through luck against overwhelming odds, making the villains even more powerful is not a good idea.
