I'm looking for a book about the Marauders time at Hogwarts. Like, when they decided they wanted to become animagus and the process they went through, and finally the ritual where they first become animagus.


** I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights]] . So far, it's the best Marauders fic I've read.
