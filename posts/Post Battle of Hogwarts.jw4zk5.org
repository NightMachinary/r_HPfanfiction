I've just been rereading Deathly Hallows and it had me wondering. Do you guys know of any fics where Harry stays dead after the forest? Let's say he doesn't have a choice to go back. There can still be a scene with Dumbledore, but it is up to Ron, Hermione, Neville and the others to finish off Voldemort and deal with the consequences thereafter.

Thanks!


** I actually have no idea if this is any good or not, but I just came across this fic that I'm about to start reading and I think it meets your criteria.

  What happens when Harry makes a very different decision at King's Cross after being killed by Voldemort? Originally published in 2008, and I haven't made any changes.
