Looking for a HP that follows in his fathers footsteps being confident with females in Hogwarts. Also a Harry that doesn't let people drag him around.

Prefer it when Harry is better then average when it comes to magic also.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Linkffn(The Merging) isn't so much about the Hogwarts bit but is good. I might be able to come up with more flirty/independent Harrys OR Harrys shagging everything that moves but with no plot. The thing is, he's destined to single handedly save the world so Harry spending his time dicking about pulling pranks and goofing off isn't something that many writers go for.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

**** I second "The Merging". It's a great story. A shame it hasn't been finished but it /has/ updated in the last year so there's still hope it will be finished someday.

  Harry grows up without the threat of Voldemort and is sorted into Ravenclaw. He's been allowed a lot more free time... to chase girls. The only problem? Some girls want to chase him. Arrogant!Harry, Ginny/Harry/Hermione, Harry/Pansy, Harry/Luna. Humor and Romance.
