:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where everyone finds out that Harry is a horcrux much earlier on. So when someone tells Voldemort he decides to kidnap Harry. But refuse to kill him, cause as a horcrux if Harry lives Voldemort thinks he will be immoral. Remus lupin also becomes a death eater in this fic to try and help Harry. I lost the tab before I was able to finish reading this fic so this is all I can recall about it. So if anyone has any clues. Please help.


** Sounds like it might be this? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10089646/1/Prized]]

*** Not sure. As I said I wasn't able to finish the fic, barely even started it honestly but it had an interesting start.

**** Ok well he meets regulus right at the beginning in the one I'm thinking of. I'll see if I can find it for you because you might enjoy it anyway if it's not the one you're looking for

****** I'm so sorry, but after all of that I couldn't find it! I bet it will turn up in a few days when I'm looking for something else. That's always the way of it ðŸ˜«

** Are you interested in Founder fics, time travel fics, heir fics, betrayal fics, bashing fics, Harry Potter-Avengers crossover fics? If so I'd suggest you go to fanfiction.com and type beloved of naruto Into the search bar of the site. Click my username and look at my favorited stories. I think I have the one you are looking for favorited but I have over favorited 500 Harry Potter fics. I'm in the process of categorizing them on paper in a notebook cause it is getting tiring wading through them all.

Anyhow I'm willing to look out for it but I figured it might help for you to look through it. Anyhow I figured if you were interested in the other stuff it might make it worthwhile.

If you would like me to delete this comment as it is not on topic tell me and I will. If this is the case I'm sorry for wasting your time.

**** Side statement: I suggest using mobile vs laptop/pc mode. It doesn't seem to see all my fics when looking from guest view.
