Most of these WCWL fics seem to be more or less the same. I don't want to sit through all the canon events with new characters... just get to the big "You aren't the CWL, Harry is!" reveal already!

Seems like a lot of authors want to recount all the details of all the events of every year to the point that the author seemingly gets bored with writing the fic and just abandons it before the reveal happens.

I, personally, feel like WCWL fics only truly get interesting once it's revealed that Harry's twin isn't actually the child who lived and the consequences of that reveal.


** Spoiler: Most fanfic authors don't actually have a big original idea. They rehash canon because it's easy, and when they run out of canon to rehash and it becomes hard, they abandon the fic.

** I second that.

For some reason, a lot of WCWL fics like to have Lily and James go total idiot ball with spoiling the WCWL and abusing/abandoning Harry to the Dursleys for some contrived reason just so the story can do a canon rehash. Since it's such a clear AU setting, might as well go wild and make the story deviate from canon.

** I don't know if the fallout from the reveal is the big draw to everyone with WCWL - without the build up to it, it kind of doesn't have any real impact.

On the flip side, the real issue is that the build up is fumbled. The trope of Harry getting completely neglected for no reason, rehashing canon, character bashing, etc - that's where the stories fail due to bad writing.

Instead, IMO, the story should be deviating from canon fairly heavily - and the authors should give some thought to making it /believable/ how Harry and his sibling get treated and why.

Though I do agree with one aspect of the reveal being important and very interesting - and that's with Harry's sibling. If they've spent their whole life with 'Being the CWL' as one of the foundations of their identity, well... How do they deal with them finding out it was really a lie the whole time? How do they move forward afterwards and change? But most WBWL stories seem to have the twin be a complete asshole, so one of the more interesting possibilities just... gets ignored.

** Here you go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13182638/1/Who-Dares-Wins]]. Harry and his friends show up at the DoM at the end of 5th year to reverse the trap being set up and Dumbledore's plans to reveal the 'real' BWL get all fucked up. This all happens in the first chapter and goes from there.

** Something always confused me about the whole Wrong Boy Who Lived genre. Can anyone explain how anyone is the Boy/Girl Who Lived while Lily and James are still alive? I mean the only reason Harry survives at all is because his parent (usually Lily) sacrificed their life for him and that act imparted a protection around him. I've read a couple of WBWL fics and I never see it explained at all, James and Lily are just alive and usually assholes for some reason.

*** Sometimes I see it explained that the grandparents (Charlus and Dorea Potter) were the ones to make the sacrifice because James and Lily weren't home.

Most times it's Harry having enough control to deflect the curse but is magically drained and declared "unimportant".

*** Yeah, that makes no sense. I get it when James is still alive but not both of them.
