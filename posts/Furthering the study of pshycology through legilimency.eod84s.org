** Not sure if it's what you're looking for precisely, but this fic involves 'consensual legilimency' where the practitioners explore each other's minds to learn more about each other, and it also shows how different minds have intuitively different 'textures' linkffn(13381792)

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
