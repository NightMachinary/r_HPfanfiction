  *Ravleen:* How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  *J.K. Rowling:* It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him... The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

It's /symbolic/, not literal. Voldemort didn't understand or value love because he had never been loved, not because he was physically incapable of feeling love.

*** Thanks for sharing this quote. I've always wondered where the "Amortentia causes congenital psychopathy" idea came from.

**** Comes from misinterpretations of JKR statements, and fanon/fanfic running with it so people forget that it was never in the books. Like people thinking that Snape was Draco's godfather.

If you dig down far enough, there's usually an official source that bears a resemblance to the fanon. That "wizards shitting on the floor" meme, for example, came from a legit JKR Pottermore page.

** I wonder how Merope would have been. Would she have loved him fiercely bc he looked like the man she loved? Or would she have resented her son, bc he was identical to the man that never reciprocated her love?
