I'm looking for some good fanfics where Harry learns that he's the lord of house potter and black, and maybe others like peverall or gryffindor. I don't like when he's the lord of 17 house because that's a little ridiculous to me but to each their own. Let me know if y'all have any good ones! Thanks!

Harry learns that he's inherited seats on the super secret council that the Wizengamot takes orders from. As you asked, he fucks shit up :-)

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

*** Lol I meant I'm ok with him being lord of a few houses. I just don't like when he's lord of a bunch of them. But that's works I guess
