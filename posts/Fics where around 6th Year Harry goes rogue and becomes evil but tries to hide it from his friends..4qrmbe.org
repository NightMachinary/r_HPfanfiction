So basically as the can reads. Maybe his possession by Voldemort in the Ministry messed with his head, maybe he joins with Voldemort so that the people he loves stop dying. But whatever the reason Harry has joined Voldemort, and now he's back at Hogwarts for his 6th year and has to hide the fact he is practicing dark magic, maybe he has a dark mark, maybe he's sneaking out to join in on raids, spying on Dumbledore. I think it would be good. Thanks.

I actually really like the idea of Harry joining Voldemort to protect his friends. He's depressed cause Voldemort is making him do terrible things and basically humiliating him and testing Harry's loyalty, and then they find out and Dumbledore is disappointed that Harry thought this was the best solution, but at the same time is understanding. Ron is scared and a bit angry at Harry for joining Voldemort, Hermione is determined to try and get Harry to realise that this isn't the right way to protect them, Draco has become all buddy buddy. Maybe Harry is drowning his sorrows in alcohol/drugs. It would be pretty angsty. If someone has this kind of story I would love to read it.


** I can't think of any that fits this description to the word, but a few similar ideas come to mind, which might hopefully somewhat resemble what you were looking for.

linkffn(Imprisoned Realm) has a DE Harry that no one knew about until it was too late. But there's more to him than meets the eye. To say more would be spoiling it, but I think you might like it if you bear with the pace for a bit. It's a few chapters short of finishing and the author updated recently.

linkffn(A Soulless Solace) is slash, and Tom/Harry at that, but extremely (and I mean /extremely/) well written and a wild, wild ride. The Horror genre isn't just for laughs here. This one actually fits your description of him going dark in 6th year, and he does a lot of hiding. Warnings: it's on a hiatus, and toward the end of the existing chapters Tom is resurrected into a girl's body and proclaims herself a transsexual. I personally enjoyed the first 16 or so chapters. One way or another, the writing quality is sound - not just sound, but superb, at least to me.

linkffn(Friend or Foe by Niger Aquila) is an old one, but it has the whole Harry going dark and trying to hide it from his friends thing. He's also chummy with Malfoy. It's set in 5th year, but it fits a great many of your criteria, though for the sake of not spoiling the story I won't go into detail as to which ones.

Hope any of this might be of help.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

  To what length would Harry go to keep his promise? Harry goes back home and is about to start his fifth year in Hogwarts 'again'. He is confused and doesn't know what to do with Voldemort anymore. Are they friends? Or foes? Sequel to Learn from History
