I'm so confused...


** No, but there is a background slash pairing in the story (sirius and remus). There's nothing remotely explicit irrc.

*** Wasnt that just a beta/alpha werewolf relationship that had nothing to do with sex? Iirc in the second half its explained that they are both hetero.

Also (unrelated), i really liked luna in this fic, shame its been abandoned.

** The Harry/Voldemort relationship varies from mentor/student to friendly rivalry to direct opposition to brothers in arms. But there's not even a hint of slash there (thankfully).

*** I always get confused cause slash is supposed to be CharacterA/CharacterB. So whenever I see Harry(Slash)Voldemort I can't read it

** I like to think of it as friendemies, since honestly that's the best way to describe how their relationship is in that hazy territory. Best part of the series imo is how the two characters are mostly canon yet still haven't killed each other throughout the book.
