I've seen plenty of comments lately about how the tags system for Ao3 is the worst thing in the universe, so I figured I would link my own filters list here to help out.

I'm obviously not the target demographic for Ao3, but I still love fanfiction. If you enjoy slash, then feel free to remove whichever filter you like - if you want some angst or hurt/comfort? Go ahead and rip that list apart.

Everything listed here will be removed from the search results of Archive of Our Own. The "parenthesis" will make the results very specific so that nothing is removed by mistake.

You'll have to separate the fandom specific filters to keep the list as small as possible. (Too many filters breaks ao3)

If there are any flaws, unnecessary filters, or duplicates please let me know.

(FYI -filter_ids:110293 is to remove Steve/Bucky stories. The normal filter doesn't work.)


** Since they updated the search engine, you can now exclude stuff through the usual interface. It also allows you to exclude all crossovers, set a minimum word count, remove categories (m/m for example).

Just set up a search once (blacklist every character, tag archive warning and relationship you don't want) and bookmark that search for future use.

*** I knew they updated the search engine, but had no idea you could save searches as bookmarks, this'll definitely save time in copy and pasting.

But regarding the m/m filters, it's very unreliable. It's just such a normal genre of fanfiction that less than half of the members will tag it properly. With my Superior Filters™ it'll remove just about everything

**** You can still use the context search on top of the improved engine.

Since the search is done through the URL bar (forgot the technical term for that), you can simply save, bookmark or even share it. For example:

***** The built in filters are definitely close. I spent nearly 10 minutes customizing it all and it was almost perfect, but there were a few results I wouldn't touch with a 10ft pole (e.x alpha/Omega, non/con, really creepy kidfics) The only way to remove them would be to add custom filters.. so I guess the best way to do it would be a combination of everything.

****** Yeah, the one issue I know of is that blacklisting characters doesn't stop them from appearing in pairings whereas "-Malfoy" removes him both as a character and as a ship.

******* A lot of characters get added to the tags whether they're important or not. If you only want to remove Malfoy from relationships entirely then try -"/Draco Malfoy" or -"Draco Malfoy/" Or just add a name after the slash to remove that pairing only. I actually like the tag system because of how specific it can be

******** The inverse of this, if you want to read a story that explores a minor background character, it's almost impossible to find because people will tag them even if they only show up once.

*** I keep a bunch of separated lists in my notepad for each fandom and then copy/paste into Ao3. You can't put the whole filter into Ao3 because it's too large, so I remove the other fandoms I don't need.
