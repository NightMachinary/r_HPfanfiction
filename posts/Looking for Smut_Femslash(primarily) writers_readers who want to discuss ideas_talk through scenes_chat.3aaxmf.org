** I know someone who would love this and I'll pass it along to her.

I'm commenting because your username made me snaffle. Did I mean smile? Yes. I like snaffle more though.

** I'm writing a story but I'm terrified of being a terrible Lucius writer, because it's entirely for smut purposes. I hope you find someone though! :D If I had more experience with the books, I'd offer to help, but I don't. .-.

**** It's nothing special honestly. It was inspired by my irritation with how everyone in Lucius M/F fics tend to just bend to Lucius's will and fall for him right away, but instead I made an oc who is manipulative and cruel, whose ultimate goal is to gain power over Lucius, so he is a bit of a sub for once.

***** In discussions with a former Dominatrix, she revealed that most of her customers were successful businessmen who normally were control-freaks. It was only under her glove that they could truly relax.

****** That doesn't surprise me! I took that kind of idea into consideration when writing it because in my fic, he's a bit of a player (unhappy marriage in my version of hp universe), and she's the first woman to deny his advances. After a while he realizes he's enjoying being toyed with. c:
