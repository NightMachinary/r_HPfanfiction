I like the stories of a 'new perspective' of the world. For eg. time travel where MC knows everything and everything falls into his schemes is something I probably won't like.

Dimensional travel usually involves a world similar yet different and WBWL is something I like, as the genre is similar enough to Naruto 'neglect' stories. Both of them together... /drools/ (Yeah, most of the stories of this genre end up abandoned or drop the ball sometime around, but I said I like the genre not the stories...)

Gamer stories usually have Harry getting a new perspective in terms of understanding magic and such. Even if there isn't a Game System, a story where Harry gets a new, better view and understanding of magic will be cool.

Self Insert/ OC stories usually have a muggle character / author character with a history of living in the mundane world suddenly enter the world of magic. Me likey.

Also, this request may be out of whack, but a story with incest of some sort (Harry x Lily, Harry x OC sister/ parallel world analogue) would be good too. Actually, Harry x James or one of his daughters from Epilogue would be good too (Might as well see how deep the rabbit-hole goes).

EDIT: A 'New Generation' story in the perspective of one of our old protagonists will be cool. Eg. Harry as Professor. I would like him interacting the kids and such.

Actually, a 'New Generation' story with major focus on Harry or trio will will do as well.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** linkffn(10851278) is one of the two SI/OC of stories I like in the potterverse The second one being linkffn(A Curse of Truth by butalearner) well the story I felt was good, very good even, but, well it has a sad ending.........nothing too sad the good guys win and all that but there is moderate amount of emotional roller coaster rides. (Think like those kiddy roller coasters which do not have those loops but you still feel a bit uncomfortable despite having fun when the carts going down slope.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
