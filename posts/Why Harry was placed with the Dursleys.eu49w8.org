In a lot of fics where Harry asks why Dumbledore goes to the Dursley's he often gets a list of people that were supposed to take him but couldn't. Usually its something like Sirius, Remus, The Longbottoms and the McKinnons. Dumbledore says that everybody listed was killed or otherwise incapable because of the war.

The point of this is that Harry is given to the Dursley's on the first of November 1981, the day after his parents murder. Hagrid takes Harry directly to the Dursleys. The Longbottoms were attacked im the days after the dark lords down fall. After James and Lily died the Longbottoms were perfectly capable of caring for Harry and he should have gone to them straight away and not the Dursleys.

Yes it is a good thing he didn't because then the death eaters would have killed him but still they shouldn't be listed as possible caregivers and be excluded because of insanity by torture.

Edit - It seems a lot of people have missed the little bit at the start that goes a little bit like "In a lot of fics where..." The area that this post covers is when these fanfics come up. So much crap about "There is nothing to say the Potters were close to the Longbottoms." This post is relating only to the stories where they are close and Alice Longbottom is Harry's godmother which is often the case.


** Dumbledore explains his reasons in OotP chapter 37, in his office after Sirius dies.

He was primarily concerned with Harry surviving - everything else was secondary at that point. Voldemort was seeming vanquished, but Dumbledore didn't for a moment believe he was gone forever. Voldemort's supporters were also still out there and would just love to kill Harry. The lingering protection of Lily's sacrifice, anchored by Petunia's blood was the strongest defense Dumbledore could give Harry and he took it.

Remus, The Longbottoms, The Bones, under no circumstances is Harry to be placed with Petunia... is fanon. The only one canonically mentioned is Sirius, who everyone thought was a traitor working for Voldemort.

**** Nope: there was about a full day of wizards celebrating enough to make the muggle news between the attack on Godric's Hollow and him arriving at the Dursley's. Probably spent at the Hogwarts infirmary.

Even with that though, Dumbledore had about 24 hours to make sure Harry wouldn't be murdered immediately by Death Eaters while trying to sort out the immediate fallout of all the people Voldemort had directly Imperioused, and then commanded to Impirious someone else, etc etc. along with all his other responsibilities.

*** The thing is, in the immediate aftermath, Sirius wasn't considered a traitor yet. His interactions with Hagrid seem pretty normal and Hagrid keeps using his bike.

As for safety, ignoring the damage caused by child abuse to Harry, the protection was still very weak. Voldemort was able to basically spawn camp him in DH, so even going to the shops would have been a death sentence for Harry. Or going to school. Dobby also proved that there were ways around the protection, ranging from elf assassin to elf suicide bomber.

The love protection also worked exactly once in PS and never afterwards. It did nothing in year 2 or 4, where by all logic it should have BBQed Voldemort. And by GoF, it was a moot point. At that time, a Fidelius with Dumbledore as secret keeper would have been much safer.

Dumbledore knew Sirius was the Secret Keeper. All this means is that he didn't tell Hagrid to watch out for Sirius, that's all.

Well, Dumbledore says it was the strongest protection he could give. And I think he knows a bit more about magic than you do.

As he would've done with basically any protection. That's how they work. They protect an area, but not around it.

#+begin_quote

Seeing as even Imperiused non-Death-Eaters couldn't enter, I imagine the protection would've stopped Dobby if he had been sent to kill Harry.

#+begin_quote

There wasn't any chance for it work in either of those two years. What are you talking about? Voldemort doesn't directly attack Harry in either.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, use a Fidelius hours after it got Harry's parents killed. /Genius./

Dumbledore is incredibly busy. He would need someone else to watch and raise Harry. Who would that be?

McGonagall is busy. Hagrid and Remus are dumb choices for obvious reasons. If Sirius Black, the BEST FRIEND of James Potter, was apparently a death eater, then why the hell would Dumbledore trust anyone from the wizarding world?

***** I can't think of a single character who wants Harry Potter dead that can build a car bomb, or know where to go to learn, or would even think to use such a thing, or would want to in the first place because that would be admitting that muggle methods can succeed where the greatest Dark Lord failed.

Snape knew Petunia existed, but I doubt he knew where or was terribly interested in learning. Especially so soon after Lily died.

******* You say that because you have audience clairvoyance. You know the facts as they are, that Lily has a sister and that's where Harry was staying. It is exponentially harder to locate someone you know nothing about. Picture looking for my sister, or the sibling of any poster on Reddit, with only their username to go off of. Even with the internet I doubt it'd be easy. For all you know I don't even have a sister, but you wouldn't know because you don't know me.

And let's not forget that even if Snape is no great fan of Petunia or Harry, at that point he's not going to endanger their lives.

Also, yeah obviously Harry's only alive because of plot armor. The boy should have died in just about every book at one point or another. There's no story around that doesn't use plot armor to some degree, because the point of storytelling isn't to give concrete, ironclad, and logical reasons for why and when characters should logically die. The real reason Harry wasn't discovered by Death Eaters in his developing years? Because if he was and that's where JK stopped writing we wouldn't be talking about it on the internet. Also that's just boring.

The only reason it worked was because nobody bothered. Book 7 is a terrible example because Riddle used Harry's blood in his ritual.

******* That same Death Eater family wanted their son to befriend Harry because they hoped he'd be a Dark Lord. Much like most of the Death Eater families. Also, Harry ran into several wizards, who also happened to be friends of Dumbledore, while out doing muggle things, so I don't think it would be so easy to snatch him

Lastly, I don't know why you guys think it would be so easy to get Harry's location. Voldemort had to take over the Ministry to get several addresses.

Of course, Dumbledore was already preparing to leave Harry with the Dursleys at that point, presumably because of the blood protection.

** When Harry was placed with the Dursleys :

- The Longbottoms were alive, though probably still in hiding, or just out of it. But absolutely nothing in canon indicate that the Potters and the Longbottoms were close, except for the fact that they were both Order members, and both forced into hiding for fulfillling the Prophecy conditions. The Longbottoms were also probably several years older than the Potters, since they were already well etablished Aurors at the time of the attack.
- Sirius was not yet accused of being a Death Eater (at least officially), since he met Hagrid at Godric Hollow, and even ask to take care of Harry, though ultimately accepting Dumbledore decision for going to take his revenge. But even if he didn't say anything, Dumbledore probably already suspected him, since he though he was the Secret Keeper, and yet Voldemort had still found the Potter.
- Remus was alive, but a suspected treator, a werewolf (you don't give a baby to someone who transform into an uncontrolable bloodthirsty beast once a month, no matter how he is the rest of the time), was poor (because of his condition), and had a habit of self loathing.
- Peter was alive, but in hiding (and would "die" 4 days later just after being seen in public for the first time in weeks, if not months).
- The Mc Kinnons were all dead, being massacred in the last months of the war. And even if they were still alive, we just know that Lily was friendly with one McKinnons (being in Gryffindor around the same time than her, and crying when learning her death), but for all we know, she had the same chance to be what Ron is to Harry (best friend), than what Dean or Seamus is (friendly roomate).

These are all the "good" guys that could had a confirmed relations with the Potters and may have tried to claim Harry. With the exceptions of the Longbottoms (who had the least relations anyways), none of them seemed to be a good guardian, and at that time, 2 of them were suspected of being a traitor, and the last one was really a traitor.

Also, at that time, most of the Death Eaters were still at large (the Lestrange had not attacked the Longbottom yet, Rosier was not killed during his arrest, Rookwood was not a known Death Eater, and Malfoy was probably making a fuss at the Ministry about being "placed under the Imperius").

Dumbledore chose the Dursleys because of 3 reasons :

- Petunia was the closest blood relative of Harry (giving her the best "claim" on him apart of maybe Sirius since he was Godfather, but one would argue that he renounced his claim when he agred to give Harry to Hagrid and went to kill Peter). Contrary to what I saw in some fics, nothing in canon indicate that there are laws about "a wizard needing to be raised by wizard", which would make all the Muggles unfit parents (and there is no way such a law would either pass with all the Muggleborns and people like Dumbledore around).
- Because of previously mentioned blood relation, Harry could be protected by a magical protection (don't remember if Dumbledore erected it, or if it's an after effect of Lily sacrifice), during all his childhood. Considering no Death Eater ever went to Privet Drive, that all the wizard that Harry met in his childhood were friendly (some strange people observed him in the distance or came to shake his hand), and that he could burn Voldemort just by a touch, these protections worked.
- Finally, (and I think the reason why Dumbledore would have put Harry with the Dursley even if the Ministry had specifically asked him not to, or if there was any other legal option), is because the Dursley are, strangely enough, the best place to give Harry a childhood. There is no way Harry would have been as well adjusted as he was in canon if he had been raised in the Magical World. Depending of who raised him, he may have ended up as some Ministry Poster Child, a groomed Dark Prince, a mini Moody or just as someone even more arrogant and annoying the Malfoy, point is he would have had to spend his whole childhood with every eyes on him. Also, being in the Magical world would have mean that others wizard, especially Death Eaters would have known his position. So risk of assassination. The muggle world as a large was also not suitable because, well they are muggle and would have been unable to protect him from any risk. The Dursley were the only one who could raise him outside of the Magical World, while still giving him a protection.

*** This meshes with the explanation Dumbledore gave in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And The Shipgirls]]. Sustaining the protection that Lily left required either a blood relative or an adoptive mother who could love Harry in a *purely* maternal manner and since he was famous as /The-boy-who-lived/, there was no available wizarding family who would be able to give said pure maternal love as it would be mixed in with hero worship causing the protections to fail, leaving Harry vulnerable to Riddle's remaining followers.

**** But the whole boy-who-lived thing must have been sparked by either Hagrid or Dumbledore since no one other than them and Sirius, who was preoccupied, knew about the tally of that night. Hagrid was also preoccupied, come to think of it, so Dumbledore was the source.

And Dumbledore could have easily changed the overall narrative of the event since he knew about Lily's sacrifice (since he set up the protections based on it). Instead he chose to let some information slip (otherwise people would not have known what Harry looked like, that he had that scar and so on).

He was the one who created the myth, so saying that he had no other choice due to the myth makes little sense since he created it.

****** When? Hagrid was taking care of Harry for the whole day presumably.

Already the next morning people were talking about what happened there and that Harry was the only survivor, despite Hagrid whisking him away almost immediately. So somehow, the Death of the Potters and the survival of Harry as well as the downfall of Voldemort leaked to the general public without solid evidence. Half the house was destroyed, but that still said nothing about Harry or Voldemort, since neither left a body (Harry being alive should not have been the logical conclusion, nor Voldemort's death for that matter). A big explosion could have simply been what killed Lily. Dumbledore is the only logical explanation for everyone celebrating Voldemort's death when he could have simply kidnapped Harry or nuked him before leaving.

Hagrid was elsewhere with Harry, Sirius was tracking Pettigrew, so Dumbledore or maybe Snape were pretty much the only ones who could credibility say what has happened there (Snape because he knew about the prophecy). McGonagall wasn't sure since she was stalking the Dursleys for some reason.

Hagrid is the most likely suspect. The man can't keep secrets to save his life. It's not hard to imagine a drunk or excited Hagrid spreading the news to whoever listens.

Could have been a neighbor in Godric's Hollow who saw and heard just enough to spread the rumor of someone surviving the killing curse.

Let's be honnest, the whole "Boy-Who-Lived" thing is either something that Rowling did not think through, or Hagrid that got too drunk at a bar. You can either take canon at face value, while trying to fill the holes with minimal modifications (since Rowling world building is not perfect and ), but accept all the characters as Rowling presented them, or you can try to make Dumbledore a machiavelic bad guy, that everything was part of his evil plan, but by doing so you change all the characters so much that their only common point with canon is their name.

** Harry being placed with the Dursleys actually makes sense; the Longbottoms were not BFFs with the Potters in canon, the McKinnons were dead and we know nothing about their relationship with the Potters, Peter was presumed dead, Remus was a werewolf and lived in poverty, Sirius was presumed to be a traitor, and even without those factors the other marauders were all 21 year old bachelors with no kids of their own and, presumably, no parenting experience. On top of that the wizarding world isn't the best place for Harry anyway, because growing up a celebrity/messiah figure isn't healthy. Just look at former Disney child stars, it's hard to find one that ISN'T completely fucked up.

On paper, the Dursleys looked like the best option - they were blood relatives, established in a home they owned, employed, lived far away from the wizarding world, and had a son Harry's own age. The problem isn't that Harry was placed there - it's that he WASN'T REMOVED when it became clear they were abusive. And they can't say they didn't know - Harry had Mrs. Figg watching his whole childhood and his Hogwarts letters were addressed to “the cupboard under the stairs,” for fuck's sake.

Dumbledore sees the best in everyone and tries to give everyone a chance, and while that's sometimes a good thing (getting Hagrid a job after he was unfairly expelled, believing Sirius was innocent on the word of two 13 year olds) it's also a huge liability (hiring Snape, giving Malfoy multiple chances after he nearly murdered several other students, not firing or even disciplining Snape for abusing his students, did I mention hiring Snape?)
