Bonus points if the story is not a lemon. I hate lemons.

Also, bonus points for completed stories, series, AU, or crossovers mixed in. I suppose you can get bonus points if the story is over 70k words. I dont like oneshots either.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts.
