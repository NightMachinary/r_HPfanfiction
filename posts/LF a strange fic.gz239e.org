:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
the fic is a harry/Bellatrix/Narcissa where Voldemort sends Bellatrix to the Dursleys to kill him or something, and she ends up sleeping with him, then Voldemort tries to get Bellatrix back by trading Narcissa for her but they both end up staying with him, does anyone know what I'm talking about?


** I don't remember what it's called or who wrote it, but I've read that one! It's either on ffn or ao3, those are the only sites I use.

  When Harry Potter awakens in a cold prison cell after being captured in a dark alley close to Privet Drive his world changes so fast his world spins, many, many times. Eventual H/Hr/OC, R/L, N/G. M for adult content sex. Story was forgotten, but now finished! This is all OldWolf wrote.
