:END:
A few months ago I read an awesome Dark Harry Potter fanfic over on Ao3.Sadly I forgot to bookmark it and I cannot for the life of me find it again.And looking with tags hasn't really gotten me anywhere. It was really creepy,really original and was gen (so no pairings), and Harry had swallowed some kind of parasite that made him a lot stronger but also almost killed him. That's all I remember from the top of my head and I was wondering if there's anyone who's read it/ bookmarked it who could tell me the title? Thank you in advance!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
