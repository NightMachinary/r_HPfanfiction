I would love to read a Hermione-centric fanfic where the Weasleys' attitude toward Muggles is explored in a more negative light. Although it's written as harmless in canon, I think that Arthur Weasley's fascination with Muggles could be interpreted as him seeing them as curiosities and entertainment, not equals. I'd also enjoy anything from the POV of Hermione's parents depicting their perspective on how even the supposedly non-prejudiced wizards like the Weasleys still have subtle prejudice.


** Personally Arthur's fascination for muggle things remind me when a white savior tries too hard to fit in with ethnic people lol.

** This happens in The After Life by Th3Alchemist. linkffn(13120415) Its a Harry/Hermione fic but at the beginning she is dating Ron and a meeting between both families make Hermione realise how biggoted the Weasleys really are and she is utterly ashamed. Her parents are so shocked by the meeting that they decide not to have anything to do with the wizarding world to the point they decide to kick Hermione out once she goes back go Hogwarts. (The worse os that they have good logical reasons to do so).

Eventually they meet Harry (unbeknowsnt to Hermione) and their fate toward the magical world and their daughter is restored.

Its a really good fic, I recommand.

  In the aftermath of the Second War, Harry dreams of his future with Ginny - and utterly rejects it. Haunted with trauma, convinced he is broken, Harry leaves his life behind. But distance only awakens his heart's true desire - and the one girl he never allowed himself to love. All roads lead back to Hogwarts, where - destiny fulfilled - Harry can finally begin his 'after' life.
