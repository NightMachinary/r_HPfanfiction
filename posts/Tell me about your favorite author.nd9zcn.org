Today I got an update-mail for fic that wasn't updated for a month, after initially being actively updated.

Not very surprising. It happens all the time to those of us who dare getting attatched to fics still in progress. Nevertheless I am happy, take a break from coding to read this new chapter.

The author died and its his wife telling us the news. She's devastated as anyone can imagine. I feel sad. I've never really told this guy how much I appreciated him and that his fics gave me a smile week to week.

Please tell me about your favorite author and why you appreciate them, that we spread some positivity to banish this dark mood!


** My favorite author is Steelbadger. His DC crossovers have made me a loyal fan. Its the way he weaves humor and jokes into a story without it seeming off or out of character.

He also wrote the story that got me so invested in crossovers that I read nothing else for a few months. I'm talking about linkffn(The power he knows not by Steelbadger)

#+begin_quote
  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

** I really enjoy work by quite a few authors that make it worth it to open ffn or ao3 but I will break it down to like...three. Because it's way too difficult.

Kittenshift17 spins a fantastic story line. They can manipulate situations and people that seem realistic to canon. Everytime an update comes out for any of their WIPs I instantly drop what I'm doing to read it.

Canimal is a master at writing. Just...chefs kisses to everything she has every come up with. And I mean EVERYTHING. She got a lot of flak for one of her fics that was seriously amazing and I didn't even ship that couple (Now I do because of that fic) and still she triumphs over everyone with new rare pairs that make me melt.

ShayaLonnie is the absolute goddess of HP fanfiction. The best of the best, hands down her stuff has made me believe it's canon and wrote most of her best work on a manic episode that spanned months. Just...ugh the magnificence. I just can't.

These authors make me feel like...I love them. When I'm sad, I can go back and read through their work and it automatically makes me feel 10x's better. They are supremely nice people in real life and I'm lucky enough to be able to read their work that they put out...for free! Honorable mentions: Fraya Istar, Colubrina, Nautical Paramour, Ms.Merlin, blankfish and Mary Royale. You all deserve so much more than I could ever give you and I appreciate every single work you put out. Thank you so much.

** I'm not sure who my favorite author is.

But you know who I miss? Bobmin356. His stories were typically uncomplicated people-pleasers (and I'm sure at least some on this sub don't have the highest opinion of them). Every chapter of every one of his stories started with some ridiculous, dramatized conversation between him and his wife. I usually skipped them because the antics of this older couple were just too silly for me.

And then he died. Sometime later, I ended up going back to his stories and ended up just reading the chapter intros. For the first time, I really appreciated as touching and sweet what I'd always considered ridiculous, stupid snapshots of their lives. These two older (old?) people had so, so much /fun/ with fanfic. That realization really affected me.

** Tsume_Yuki , oh my god, it's like we have the same brain. I haven't read a fic of hers that i didn't immediately fall in love with. She does a lot of niche tag work which is where the gold is in fanfic. Most of her stuff is one shots, but she does have some series work which is dope too. She has a fem!Harry x Erik Killmonger fic that I'm obsessed with, and her current focus is this SI x Tom Riddle Sr fic I wasn't expecting to adore. She's turned me on to so much cool shit too, like i never would have read RBC if it wasn't for her fanfics of fanfic.

also shout out to MarauderLover7 who does the Intensity series, their depiction of Tonks' love life is so well written and realistic <3

*** Oh dang I forgot Tsume_Yuki. I completely agree with you, though many people have a dislike for fem!Harry. Tsume kinda sold fem!Harry to me and its kinda my preference now.

***** The author who promted this post mostly worked on Naruto fics. The thing with that fandom is that alot of authors do not write like they are writing a book/story. Rather they are trying to describe or imitate an anime thats playing in their mind.

That makes for many fics you simply can't read, because dialouge and pacing are all over the place. Can't really recommend that fandom if one isn't very tenacious.

** I gotta Say Gabriel Blessing. My all time favorite. They set so many fanfiction trends its insane. My second is Contra Bradus whose name was something like Carrot Glace back in the day. My current favorite is Darth Marrs the dude is an absolute writing monster and finishes everything.
