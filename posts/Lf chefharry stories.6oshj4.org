I've been spending a lot of time developing new cookie, okonomiyaki, sides like decon/recon quail scotch eggs, desserts like grapefruit sugared churros, and fry bread taco recipes for a food truck and i want some 'harry, super chef' stories be it him running a inn/kitchen or him using a seven chocolate cake to woo the ladies(which is how i started dating someone)c


** I remember reading a crossover with the Avengers in which Harry moved to New York and ran a cafe.

Edit: I found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble]]

In the story, (not sure at what point) Harry does run a place called /The Marauder's Den/ and he cooks food in it, IIRC.

  After a life of war and adventure, all she wanted to do was live a fairly quiet existence running her little café and avoid inquiries on future children from Mrs. Weasley. She didn't expect Tony Stark to wander his way into her life and decide to never leave. FEM!Harry/Tony Stark

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

*** Never heard of it but i have mused on a harry potter/yakitate! Japan crossover for some time where in his seventh year, harry's entered into a cooking contest. It'd be harry/Azusagawa Tsukino, maybe a poly story adding in tonks
