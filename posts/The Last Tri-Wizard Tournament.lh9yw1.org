Obviously most of our knowledge of the triwizard tournament comes from the modern one in the 90s but aside from a few brief mentions what do we know about the tournament that got this centuries old tradition cancelled (as far as they knew permanently).

The setting of an 18th century wizarding world, newly immigrated Malfoys who arent accepted into Slytherin due to their lack of roots in Britain, a world that still has wizards who remember before the Statute of Secrecy. Flying carpets, magical cross-breeding and the Dark Arts being taught at Hogwarts still in effect. The establishment of the Auror Corps due to a particularly nasty outbreak of dark wizards in the North-West and seeing the Black Family at its peak. Theres so much to be taken out of this in my opinion, if of course people can accept the fact that the entire work would be composed of OCs essentially, though its possible you could have a known character time travelling in order to have the blank slate character to explain the new (old?) elements with. And of course the ever present dramatic irony of knowing all the participants are going to die.

Basically, what fantastic beasts tried to do with expanding the world, but you know, good.


** It was touched on in The Accidental Animagus, Le Trag√©die de le Tournoi d'An Un. Held in France during the French Revolution. Not good, and it was because so many people stood by and did nothing that the competitors and judges died.
