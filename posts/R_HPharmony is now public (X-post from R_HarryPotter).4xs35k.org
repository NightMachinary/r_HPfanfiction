So, originally, I planned to spend more time working on the CSS of the sub. However, I received sufficient requests to allow people access, that I have gone ahead and made the sub public right now, in a very rough form. Now, I know Harmony doesn't have the greatest reputation among the fandom. We have a very small, but vocal part of the community that is, shall we say, aggressively intolerant of the ending of the series and dedicated to tearing the canon ships down. *This sub is not about that.* This sub is about celebrating the Harmony ship, and categorizing the best fanworks. If that's not your thing, or you object to Harmony in some way, then you don't have to visit, although I encourage you to check it out.

Some questions you might have:

*How Can I Help?*: If you know CSS, please PM me. My coding background is limited to Python and Java, and I expect learning CSS/HTML (even basically) to be very difficult. If not, don't despair! You can help by posting, or submitting fanworks to the submissions thread.

*Why are you using a throwaway?* Because the actual mod of this is rather self-conscious and worried about releasing a rough product.


** Not an H/Hr shipper, but I think this is a great idea for each major ship here. This way, it prevents more clogup here, and will lead to more discussion on this sub. So, I might be creating one soon for H/G too.

Just need to find a suitable name for the sub, because I don't think the "Hinny" name is that popular...

Really, don't bother coding your own stylesheet. USe one of those, change some stuff and you're good to go.

** Yes please i think the people here on even reddit have serious prejudice against us harmony shippers and I'm telling this from experience. If you so much as whisper harmony in comments you get downvoted immediately. Thank you for making a sub away from the useless hate. Ps. Please let it be vanilla harmony. No harem fics.

***** OK, yeah. The phrasing made it sound more harem-y. But I also would like to know if poly relationships featuring both of them are OK.
