Yes, gasp horror, I want to rewrite HPCC.

I have had the first chapter of Dark Wings up for years now, however I had to focus on finishing my other fic before I could tackle DW.

Anyway, just looking for some crit and brainstorming on my ideas because I'm a little stuck. I also have no clear direction or plan yet with this fic, so forgive me if ideas are all over the place.

1. There is no time travel. (Although rumours about Scorpius still exist)

2. No tea trolley lady

3. I want to go back to the old JKR HP formula of a new teacher starting at Hogwarts and crazy shit starts happening.

4. ASP is still in Slytherin and he becomes friends with Scorpius. I really like their relationshiop. So geeky and cute.

5. Harry and Albus still have a strained relationship.

6. Draco and Harry still have a strained relationship, however I want to explore this further and eventually become friends.

7. Delphini Riddle. Now originally I wanted her to be totes disillusioned about her parentage. Orphan with a parseltongue talent who draws conclusions about who her parents are, but it isn't true.

However she is a parseltongue, so should I make her a descendent of the Irish side of Slytherin's family? Therefore should I make her American?

1. So in ASP's 2nd year a strange murder occurs and the way they are murdered is really abhorrent. But the wizarding world gets on with life as Harry has the Aurors investigate.

If you've heard of a Viking execution technique called the 'bloodied eagle', then you can guess how they died.

1. Meanwhile a new Astronomy teacher starts -Delphi. ASP develops a plutonic friendly relationship with her over the next 3 years. She however starts to get him interested in the Dark Arts. So when Harry hears Bane say there's a dark cloud over Albus, he immediately thinks its Scorpius.

2. Voldemorts body from an unmarked gravenis stolen.

3. More murders continue, but this time it is a muggle-born student.

4. I want to include necromancy, but do you guys think this is a dumb trope?

5. Delphini uses the murders as part of a ritual to communicate with Voldemort. She wishes to bring him back.

6. Delphi's prophecy still exists. So I will need to play around with it so it works in this fic without time travel.

Anywaaaayyyy.... that's all I have now, just some ideas floating around with no clear direction. So any help and crit is appreciated.

** I would not make Delphini a child of Voldemort and Bellatrix at all.

In fact one of founders of Ilvermorny, [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/isolt-sayre][Isolt Sayre]], was Slytherin's direct descendant and a Parseltongue, and she had children. So Delphini could very well be one of her many descendants, but was kidnapped by Death Eaters as a baby, and later deceived, brainwashed, indoctrinated, and used as a weapon against Harry and his friends.

Most in the fandom hate this Voldemort's child nonsense with a passion.

** I do think that CC is such a mess it's perfect for rewriting and fixing. But my own experience has been that there's a lot of resistance to any fic based around it although some Scorpius/Albus stories are quite popular. I've done a rewrite myself - admittedly quite a different approach to yours - and it gets very very few reviews or favourites. You ideas sound likely to be more popular than mine but you might still find yourself posting into an uncomfortable void. You might have to grow a thick skin, but I hope it works out for you.

** I think if you should change one thing about CC it should be Delphini. Make her good. Make her not a cheap boring psychopath. It is the only thing that would break the ridiculous HP main theme that everyone becomes their parents even if they've never really met them.

** I think the idea of tying things back to Voldemort in the next generation kind of makes everything Harry and his friends did pointless. The prejudice and horrible government practices in the wizarding world gave rise to Voldemort, and for the most part still remain. Surely there's more fresh material to mine rather than going back to the Voldemort well?

I like next gen fics that are about similar pureblood/dark creature issues, but with a new face.

** Off topic, but the title for someone who speaks Parseltongue is a Parselmouth. It irks me whenever I see someone called a Parseltongue.

I would simply drop Delphini. I can't ever see Voldemort having a child with a follower as he believed himself immortal. Why would he want a child?
