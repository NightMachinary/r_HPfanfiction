I used to say that I don't have a favourite character because I read different types of fics and have already found myself able to sympathise with characters that I hate in canon just because the fic was well-written.

But time and experience have shown that I do have a favourite, and it's Draco Malfoy. He's the grey zone, neither good nor completely evil, and I find exploring his motivation and the context he's in really interesting. I like reading about internal conflict, personal growth and so on, and in HP Draco Malfoy is one of the characters that allows to get into these subjects.

What about you? I'd love to read about your favourite characters and why you like them so much!


** Harry. People rarely mess him up, since so much of his character is shown in the books. While Sirius is my favourite character overall, it's hard to find fanfics about him where he's not a womanizer or a man-child with the IQ of a dirty sock.

** Tom Riddle. I actually really enjoy FF where his psyche is explored. Even though J.K. gave us an explanation to why he is so evil I believe it is a mix of love elixir and upbringing and I enjoy reading about how changing anything in this equation could affect him. Perhaps it's because it's so hard for me to believe that someone can be born evil and doomed to do evil - people with antisocial personality disorder can live without hurting others and find fulfilment, so I wonder what other types of paths Riddle could potentially take

** One of the Marauders (minus Wormtail)

Don't mind which one

** The Marauders in their youth

They give you a lot to work with, but not so much that your interpretation of them couldn't be valid. You know a bit about their story and characters, but they still let you develop your own story

** Daphne. I just find it fascinating how a character who is mentioned only once in the books becomes such a popular and common figure in fan fiction. Since we know next to nothing about her from canon, fanfiction writers like me can do almost anything with her in their stories. I think that's really great and exciting.

*** I feel the same way about Pansy especially but all the Slytherins Harry's year (Theo Nott, Blaise, etc.). We know very little about them from canon but writers have really developed these names into recognizable characters.

*** Same here.

Although for me I like Daphne the most because of a few fics which I liked (all with the Harry/Daphne pairing, naturally.)

** - Percy Weasley. I've been reading a lot of him lately. Only thing that I'm not a fan of is that a large portion of his stories are him being paired with Oliver Wood and personally I just dont like that. And I'm a fan of angst but it's hard to find one that isn't like that. I've been wanting to find more happy fics where he apologizes to his family and all is well

- Tom Riddle. I like seeing fics where Tom is either separate from Voldemort or he ends up turning good because of Harry's influence. It's just a different perspective and it's interesting to me. There's this one, where Riddle becomes a parental figure toward Harry and I love those kinds of stories, too!

** Generally, for me it's Dumbledore in non-bashing fics.

However one specific character in one specific fic has a special place in my heart as the most interesting character I've seen out of any fanfic I've ever read - the fem!Voldemort Emily Riddle from Limpieza de Sangre. She's the Voldemort everyone always tries and fails to have in HP/LV fics - interesting and human yet evil, and mesmerizing without acting like a sex offender.

** My "true" favourite character would be Ron, but reading about him in a fanfiction is like playing roulette. Sometimes he is just like in canon and it's great ,but most of the time he is either ignored or bashed to death.

My favourite "fanfiction" character is probably Tom Riddle/ Voldemort. I just love it when he plays a bigger role in fic than the "End of year Boss". He is particulary great in the "Aware scarcrux stories" (I love most of them).

** I agree with Draco, writers often explore very well this white-grey-black zone and it's always nice to read fictions where Hermione/Ginny/Luna make the best out of him.

In fact, it's not so much the characters that I like but rather how writers treat them: I read fictions about Bellatrix that were so realistic and well-done, compared to all these fictions where Harry is very plain and boring.

If I ultimately had to choose though, it would be Hermione. Stories about her parents, her approach to magic, how much she evolves through time. Writers usually make her less stiff than how she is in the book, and that is great!
