I've no idea what the overarching plot was as I remember only starting this story. I think there were about 5 or 6 of them in the house altogether, one might have been Neville, some were OCs. It wasn't hosted on one of the more common modern sites like ff.net or AO3. Justin Finch-Fletchley might have been gay in this story, not sure. Anyone remember it?


** Was it a Harry/Hermione story? Harry does field work for magical CIA/NSA/FBI? If so I believe you are thinking of "Paradigm of Uncertainty" and/or its sequels, "The Show That Never Ends", and "Hero With A Thousand Faces". I think. Maybe? The website has a green color scheme so thats on point.

***** It's really good but it was started pre-GoF so it doesn't take into account any part of canon after that book. Also it might feel a little dated, but then it was written quite a while back.
