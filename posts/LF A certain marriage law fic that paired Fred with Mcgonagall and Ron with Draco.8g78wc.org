I think it also put Harry and Hermione either with each other or Slytherins.

Thanks

*** As a parody of the marriage law trope, I presume? Like, how /convenient/ that Harry ends up with attractive Daphne Greengrass or Hermione with supposedly-attractive Severus Snape --- if it truly is so random and wish-overriding and generations-spanning, of /course/ there'd be a /lot/ of quicky Fred/McGonagall types.

That being said, Weasley and McGonagall may not be such a bad match, age difference aside (and while it far from squares it to manageable levels, you should remember Film!McGonagall is significantly older than her book self). Both true Gryffindors with a prankish side, albeit one McGonagall buried out of bitterness (but it does come out in her treatment of the Dursleys in /PS/, for instance).
