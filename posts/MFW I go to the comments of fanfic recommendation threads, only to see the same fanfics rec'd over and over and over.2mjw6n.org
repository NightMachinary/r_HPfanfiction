*** You laugh, but my husband is actually reading it this week and he can't put it down. When he's through, I know he'll pester me for more canon-compliant fanfic.

**** Well that will be a tad difficult. Even the canon compliant stuff usually swerves off course as it progresses.

*** I'm with you. There's over a million hpfanfics across dozens of sites. I've read less than 5,000 and looked at the summary of less than 50,000. I can only recommend the ones I've read, and that number is not increasing at a significant rate. I'm so sorry for doing people a favor of taking time out of my day to recommend stories for them. Perhaps we should just close the subreddit so we don't have this problem anymore.

*** HPMOR's a great story. The circlejerk on this subreddit on Less Wrong is so real, I think they could use reading a story that teaches them about the dangers of bandwagoning.

**** I think HPMOR's an okay story. It has its faults. But it seems to attract massive circlejerks on both sides, whether it's the people who think it's the epitome of arrogance or those who think Eliezer Yudkowsky is Rationality!Jesus.

***** The worst parts of HPMOR are definitely the author and the fans. Everything else is just about on par with other good stories, but because of the aforementioned, it generates a lot of circlejerk on both sides.

** This sub has seen a big influx of new people in the last several months. Our unique pageviews are triple what they were a year ago, and only a small percentage of those actually post. Just because you've seen something recommended over and over doesn't mean it's not a new and worthwhile recommendation to someone else.

**** I think it's just a matter of momentum. It takes time for a site to accumulate enough members to generate significant discussion... as time goes by and more members appear, more discussion happens. That increased discussion in turn increases the attractiveness of the site and more people flood to it and take part.

**** As a whole, reddit is growing significantly, and every time anything Harry Potter related hits the front page, whether it's JKR, Pottermore, or the actors, somebody inevitably posts about fanfiction. Plus there's many, many times where the Harry Potter universe comes up in random discussions, and 90% of the time, somebody (such as myself) says "well in fanfiction..." and links to the subreddit. While we're not seeing as many quality writers as there were from say '05 to '09, there are a few who are just getting into writing as well, and they tend to use Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook to spread their stories around, thus getting more new people interested.

**** We had a big spike towards the end of June and into July. I recall a link to us being added to the sidebar in [[/r/harrypotter]] a few months back but I can't remember exactly when. It's possible it could be related.
