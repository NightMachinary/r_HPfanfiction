I want to read fics where Voldemort doesn't exist, and see what the wizarding world is like without him. Fics like the Alexandra Quick series are also fine.

I've read Murder Most Horrid, and in that, pureblood resentment finds other outlets. This was interesting, and I enjoyed the story despite the weird ship.

EDIT: Crossovers are also welcome.


** /Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/, linkffn(10210053) I've never read it but IIRC there's no Voldemort in this one.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

** *A Riddled Universe*, linkffn(8678567): Tom Riddle is good.

*Inverted*, linkffn(4849382): Tom Riddle is fighting the dark (phoenix) lord Albus Dumbledore. Severe Hermione and Weasley bashing.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** I remember reading an one-shot where Tom Riddle was caught with the chamber fuckery and was put into Azkaban. 50 years later he escapes and tries to attack Hogwarts... it was pretty good. Can't remember title or author though, sorry.
