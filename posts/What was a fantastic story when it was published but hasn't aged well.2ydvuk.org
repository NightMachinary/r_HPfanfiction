Things like the original Severitus story that has probably been done better since or just seems dated due to being published prior to the books ending like stories that have dodgy alternate versions of Horcruxes. Like i'm 90% sure I read a story called HP and the Order of the Phoenix/Half Blood Prince written in between the books name being announced and their publication that are very good just bizarre now that we know what the deal is with them.


** A Stranger in an Unholy Land is a classic example of this.

PART I: Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer Rated: Fiction M - English - Adventure/Mystery - Harry P., Voldemort - Chapters: 17 - Words: 470,388 - Reviews: 1,615 - Favs: 3,354 - Follows: 1,078 - Updated: 4/25/2007 - Published: 7/14/2004 - Status: Complete - id: 1962685

Everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/806133/SilverAegis][SilverAegis]] probably fits into this category as well.

** /Nightmares of the Future's Past/ was a great story when it came out, but now there are many better written, faster paced and complete time-travel fics. It did make the time travel genre very popular in the HP fandom though, so it needs to be appreciated for that.

Dumbledore and Weasley bashing were prominent then even in decent quality stories. Hardly anyone likes them now. /Bungle in the Jungle/ is especially prominent here.

*** Bashing in general has always seemed very childish to me. The author doesn't like some character and changes their personality to make them unlikeable, and then punishes them for it.

Tropes in HP fanfiction seem to have matured as the fanbase aged from teens in the the early-mid 2000s to adults of today.

****** /The Book of Albus/ is really cool. Its a large part of what makes BWP unique and sets it apart it from other time travel fics. It isn't as much of a sequel to the first part as it a companion book -- it's main purpose is to explain the mystery of the Merlin character in the first part. It's sorta fascinating to see how any given change completely changes the future of the world they live in, with many unforeseen and unintended consequences. Definitely recommended.

There isn't really much written in the third part yet, so there's not much to recommend. Read it if you really like /The Book of Albus/ and if you get attached to the protagonist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving minute]] is an awesome fast-paced and action oriented Time travel fic. Unlike other fics of this kind Harry has only twelve hours to destroy the horcruxes and kill Voldemort, so no fucking about here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]] is an epic, though you need to get into a different sort of mindset to enjoy it to its fullest.

***** I read BwP; I enjoyed it but I didn't really like the second/third. It was a good concept but I think I just wasn't down with the character switch. So just a matter of personal taste.

I've read jon's Hero trilogy, and as a huge fan of the Dark Tower as well, I thoroughly enjoyed that. I never got around to reading Wastelands since it was so long and the Hero one was already an epic haha. I actually re-started Wastelands two weeks ago, and I'm only two chapters in so far because of how little time I've had to read with midterms and finals coming up :P

That said, the Unforgiving Minute is wholly new to me, and also sounds awesome. I'll be checking that out for sure. Thanks!

I agree with Nightmares not aging very well, but it still has that "early trendsetter" quality that makes it still kinda good.

*** Y'know, I'm not an HPMoR fan. I dropped it somewhere around chapter 30 I think. But the circlejerk over how terrible it is and how Eliezer Yudkowsky is literally Hitler is starting to get on my nerves. I think that reader participation in determining the end of the story is kind of a cool idea. And what's wrong with wrap parties? As much as some people like to bitch about it, HPMoR's been hugely popular.

**** That's fine but when these threads come up don't be surprised that it's mentioned. It's the most polarising story in the fandom.

Also the reader participation bugged me because i've believed for ages he didn't have a clue how to finish the story and then he does that.

As for the wrap parties I just think it's indicative of his ridiculous ego that it's necessary.

Yeah it's been hugely popular. I firmly maintain that's because of how good it was at the start and mainly with people who know nothing about the background of it.

***** Given how obvious or easy the solution was to the final exam part was it's a bit ridiculous to think that he used it in some way to finish the story for him. And that people are actually going to wrap up parties (you can look at the Facebook groups).

I would bet most people on reddit subscribed to the subreddit know the background of it, as you term it, and that's 8000 people. More fans than most other fanfictions. There are over 700,000 words of reviews for the final exam chapter. That couldn't possibly be from only how good it was at the start.

I get that some people don't like it but to deny its popularity is a bit ridiculous, or to say that people wouldn't like it if they learned some background of it or something also seems ridiculous

****** I'm sure there are people going to the wrap up parties. That doesn't change my point, there will be people that would turn up to a Harry Crow wrap party if they had a few friends to go with and it was near them. It wouldn't change that the author is a massive narcissist for organising it himself.

Again I think there's a difference between subscribing and actively participating and again between that and following an authors personal life. I'm subscribed to loads of subreddits for books and tv shows and i've no idea about the authors personal life. That being said there's plenty of people who mention it on here when it's brought up as a reason why they dropped the fic.

And I may be wrong about this but I think people who don't like the fic or author bring up criticism of the author. I don't remember a single instance of someone saying that they liked the story but stopped reading because of what the author did. There's a lot of criticism of the author but I don't think if that was more known people would have a different opinion of the story or anything. People rightfully divorce those two opinions in their minds

******** I stopped reading it because the author moved from a good plot with hints of his philosophical views to him using Harry Potter to explain his philosophical views with no entertaining plot left.

** For me, Firebird started amazing and ended up being merely top 50. So, I'm being critical on a very high level.

I liked how the author completely remodelled the universe to a point of it being dark as fuck. But when he/she (?) got so caught up in his own inventions that the word 'coven' came more often than 'and' in a chapter, it lost this special little something it had at the beginning.

Not to mention that I got super weirded out by the amounts of underage sex and harem stuff.
