** “Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay”

linkffn(13230340)

Harry turned into a dragon. That's pretty much the whole premise. It's hardly a serious fic, but it is very enjoyable.

--------------

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

linkffn(11191235)\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 link]]

Harry Potter, brother of the Boy Who Lived, is sorted into Slytherin after a rough childhood with the Dursleys. Things only get more complicated from there.

Okay so this one is kind of cheating; it's written a subversion of a lot of tropes, so it has to have those tropes (which i don't care for) to start. But it's one of favorite fics of all time so I had to mention it.

Although a bit of a warning; to be honest, I was turned off by the prologue at first (it's written to be misleading, looking like it plays into the standard tropes of the genre). Also, it's a /lot/ darker than canon, so if that isn't your thing you may want to avoid it.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (Mostly fluff, no character bashing.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
