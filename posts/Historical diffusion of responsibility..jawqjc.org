Something that has come up in a fair few fics I've read, and if it doesn't ruin them for me, it atleast makes them lose my respect is when an author will act like alot of the major atrocities which have occurred in the recent past where done by wizards who were controlling muggles, or the muggle version was just a cover up. The classic example of this is 'Hitler was just Grindelwalds puppet' and that the Nazi's were orchestrated by wizards who had them under the imperious curse. Another one which felt very disturbing to me was an author who wrote off the entire actions of the IRA as some troublesome wizards messing around. I think most of my problem with this is it feels disrespectful too the victims of those terrible things, and also that it removes responsibility from the truly awhful people who did these things. I have less of an issue with the idea that the magical sides of conflicts were working with the muggle side, but to remove all responsibility from the awhful people who committed some of the worst crimes against humanity ever seems to me to be in bad faith.

This might be a bad explanation, but tell me what you think? Am I being ridiculous?


** I'd say the better way to handle it is to have it be more a case of wizards exploiting events/movements in the Muggle world to their own gain. For example, I've seen at least one or two fics in which the Troubles were used as a cover explanation for some Death Eater attacks, possibly making the Troubles worse in the process.

** Grindelwald could also simply have exploited the fact the Muggle world was in another conflict as big as the Great War to make his attempt at world dominance since the war would weaken and destabilise the Muggles and would be the perfect cover for invasions (you hide your men in the Muggle ranks and bim bam boom you just infiltrated Paris.

** You are not *completely* ridiculous, but:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's Law]] knowns no mercy: ninety percent of everything is crap. It certainly applies fully to fanfiction stories. Again ninety percent of crappy fanfictions are just boring or poorly written, but there are ten percent of crap which have some really horrible ideas like what you have described. Do with it just what you do with the rest of the crap: step over it and wash your shoes if you step on something.

2. The relationship between The Troubles and the Harry Potter universe is strange one and never fully understood. The fact that [[https://youtu.be/j48XwoTeFC4][Good Friday Agreement]] was just 22 days before the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts][Battle of Hogwarts]] is just something which cries for more investigation, but AFAIK nobody did it. It is just mentioned in “Sanctuary by Sheankelor” linkffn(12015723), IRA terrorists are used by Lucius Malfoy in “[[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian]]”, but I would say that generally this is largely unused area.

*** The Battle of Hogwarts starts the day before it ends and it mostly happens because Voldemort finds out about the Harry's Horcrux Hunt. The two events couldn't have been related since up until the day Harry broke into Gringotts, he laid low for a month. Unless, through some mental gymnastics, you assume that Voldemort had something to do with testing the power of his new wand on the Muggles. I believe JK chose 2nd of May as the end of the second war in order to match the date that WW2 ended in Europe.

****** No patronizing was intended, I just really don't know what you mean. There are possible multiple official ends of the WW2E (The Second World War in Europe), but May 2 is not one of them. The only thing which happened on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2][May 2]] was the Soviet announcement of the Fall of Berlin, which doesn't sound like any official even at all. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender][May 8]]. And the last large German troops capitulated in Prague, Czechia on the same day. And the last shot was fired on May 11/12 around the small village of Milín in Southern Bohemia. What did you mean?

*** I suppose you're right, I would do better to ignore it, its just one of those things where you are half way through a really good fic and then it just let's you down, but thats alot of tropes to be honest. thanks for replying!

** Isn't the Hitler being Grindelwald's Puppet thing something Rowling made up? It sounds familiar, but I can't remember if it's a fandom thing or an extra-book canon thing.

I don't really have any particular opinion either way myself - but I'd imagine those people aren't actually trying to say that those IRL monsters weren't responsible for their actions. They're not writing Harry Potter fanfiction and expecting people to go "Yes! The IRA didn't do all those things they did! It was the Wizards!", on account of the Wizards not actually existing.

So, yeah. It's an interesting question - is removing responsibility from real people in fictional contexts a problematic thing to do? - but I definitely don't have an answer to it.

Would you have as much of a problem if they put a disclaimer on it or something? "This is fiction, these people were dickwombles in reality." or the like?

*** I think it was Grindelwald and Hitler being buddies. After all, even in FB2, Grindelwald shows at his rally the atrocities of WW2. If he really believe what he was saying, he shouldn't have been supportive of it in the first place.

** You're not ridiculous. These authors are trying to take a short cut to beef up the characters ("you know how Hitler was evil? Actually, Grindelwald was the REAL Hitler!") but they just cheapen their stories and mock the IRL victims ("what if your pain was just a story? What if all the suffering and death of the Holocaust/Troubles/etc. was just fiction for entertainment?").

It's good when fics take real world history into account and great world building to show how that could have intersected with the magical world. But don't dismiss the history or co-opt the victims' stories.
