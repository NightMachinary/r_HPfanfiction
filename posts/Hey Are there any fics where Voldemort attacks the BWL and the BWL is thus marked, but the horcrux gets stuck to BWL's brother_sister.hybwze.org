I've been thinking of this for sometime... Is there such a fanfic... And if yes.. please gimme the link... And if no .. How will it affect the prophecy... Bcoz as far as I know.. (and that's too little) the soul attached itself to the nearest lifeform... It need not necessarily be the BWL right? And if the Wrong BWL gets to be the horcrux, he will not be subjected to the prophecy because he is not marked right? But then the "must die at the hands of the other" is not gonna apply to the BWL/GWL right?


** Lightning on the Wave has a completed fabulous epic series. It covers all 7 years and has this concept and similar within. Delves into great lore and character building. Puts JK's transphobic self to shame!
