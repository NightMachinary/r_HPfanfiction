This site that I found may be of help to you lot. Just a token of good faith.


** This is quite fascinating. It's interesting to see how the nobility treated each other in the Victorian era. But if we're going to go with historical accuracy, wouldn't the Statute of Secrecy preclude Victorian forms of address? The Statute of Secrecy would have to have come into effect during King William the Third's reign (William of Orange), in 1692, and without heavy Muggle influence, they would have taken a vastly different route in terms of the development of their culture.

But even further than that, Rowling's mistakes involving Merlin and the founding of Hogwarts have to be either largely ignored, or accepted, creating a vastly different timeline. Hogwarts was founded in 990AD, roughly 500 to 600 years after Merlin is actually born. Since in Rowling's timeline, Merlin was around in the medieval era and attended Hogwarts, he must have come at least 60 or so years after 990, because it is likely that he would have otherwise been involved in the affairs of the founders (Wizards and witches live long). However Merlin most likely was not born towards the end of the medieval era in the 15th century, simply because Flamel is a fair bit over 665 by 1992, which meant that he was born somewhere in the 14th century. Unless Flamel is hiding his true age, the sheer importance of Merlin would have made it noted on something like the chocolate frog card that Merlin and Flamel were alive at the same time. Moving up Merlin also shifts up the existence of Arthur, which means that he would have had to fight off some invasion other than the Saxons. Since King Arthur is a figure so closely tied into Welsh mythology and related to Celtic myths, we may surmise that distinct Celtic and Welsh influences would very likely survive for a while, influencing the Wizarding World.

Of course, a lot of what I wrote is conjecture, but still, it is important to note as it does point out along with a whole host of other details in Harry Potter that Celtic and Welsh influences may have been very strong in a more consistent timeline.

Edit: killed the comma monstrosity.

*** Didn't Merlin, like, live backwards or something, though? Couldn't he have been young and gone to school in 990 AD, then aged backwards through time until he was an old powerful wizard in King Arthur's time? He'd need to live for quite a while, but Albus Dumbledore made it to 115 and was very spry, so who knows how long wizards can live.

**** The view of Merlin aging backwards seems to have originated from T.H. White's work /The Once and Future King/. It was based on /Le Morte d'Arthur/ by Sir Thomas Malory. Essentially making it fanfiction of fanfiction. Merlin aging backwards seems to be from /Le Morte d'Arthur/, but other than one source on Quora that notes that Merlin simply didn't age and that there is no real mention whether Merlin goes backwards in time, I couldn't find it by searching a pdf. Perhaps what the Quora user said is true, but I'll have to do some of my own searching. If you want to know, I'll get back to you in about a week or two.

*** One thing to note however, is that Binns states that Hogwarts was founded /over/ a thousand years ago. For all we know, it could have been founded in the sixth century.

Alternatively, there are two Merlins, one who lived in the sixth century, and one who attended Hogwarts, possibly a descendant or successor of the original.

**** Hmm... That makes for an interesting point. With this, it is entirely possible that Rowling is correct in her timeline. In addition to what you noted, Geoffrey of Monmouth also combined two historical~ish figures into one, forming Myrddin Emrys.
