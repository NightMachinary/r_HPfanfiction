Before his defeat, Voldemort released a magical plague that targeted muggles, as death tolls rose the country was placed under quarantine by a joint operation between the UN and the ICW. Soon after the quarantine was established all communication from within Great Britain ceased. For the rest of the world, the only conclusion is that the plague has wiped out the entire population. Within the quarantine zone however the reason for the silence is revealed. The Statute of Secrecy has shattered, and the horrifically decimated muggle population must now live side by side with their magical brethren.

Tensions are high as blame is thrown at the feet of every witch and wizard for allowing things to have become so bad, while at the same time survival is unlikely without cooperation.

​

Fic follows Harry, either growing up in this new and strange world, or adapting to it as an almost adult, depending on which war is chosen.

*** I can see it going terribly for everyone.

While there are significantly less muggles now, there are probably still more muggles than magicals, and a lot of them are pissed. Angry that magic was hidden from them, angry that magic killed their loved ones, angry that magic didn't save them, angry that magic could have saved other loved ones from before the plague. British civilization may have collapsed, but that doesn't mean that a mob couldn't persecute the average witch or wizard, especially since their society is also in shambles from war.

​

The surviving magical purists would probably see this as a chance to take control over whats left of Britain entirely, and rule over the muggles. This wouldn't be taken lightly by the Order and other witches and wizards that had been fighting Voldemort.

​

The surviving good witches and wizards would probably try to make amends and help the muggles as best as they could to survive, but would have to face distrust and anger on a regular basis.

​

I imagine that with the collapse of society that Britain would end up in a dark ages/post apocalyptic warlord scenario. Some people want organization, others just want power. There would be factions everywhere based on shared ideologies and location. Especially as muggles will have lost their fast transportation while Magicals remain able to apparate within the bounds of the country.

****** Of course a wand is superior but Wizards tend to underestimate Muggles/are not well informed about Muggle stuff. Like what Wizard would recognize a taser if they saw one? They might not be able to react quick enough to block it. I think that in a "war" especially in the beginning, Muggles could use weapons like snipers and stuff that is remote controlled. A bit of magic doesn't disturb technology and a homenum revelio won't show anything. I think while this confrontation would be fairly even if only in the beginning, later on it would be very hard for muggles to gain the upper hand if they weren't to use bombs and stuff since apparation and the /imperio/ are the biggest advantages Wizards have.

******* I'll grant you that in the beginning, muggles would definitely have the upper hand, mostly because wizards are stubborn and arrogant. However, they're also very adaptable, and are very quick to get rid of this attitude once it becomes serious.

This discussion is one that also comes up in those "who would win" threads, and the best I've seen it described is (paraphrased) like this:

"Wizards are able to hide places directly from muggle view. They can make it so a muggle will never be able to even percieve it, and won't ever think that it may possibly be there. And nukes? Leaving aside that we don't use nukes against our enemies in real life, if the muggles have somehow gone insane and nuke Hogwarts, congratulations, you've just brutally murdered a bunch of school children. The wizards will now be ten times as cruel and vicious. All it takes is one single wizard to destroy the majority of a city - apparate in, unleash fiendfyre, apparate out. If he's smart, he'll be wearing an invisibility coat. The notion that we'll be able to kill every single wizard is ridiculous. We can't even defeat terrorists living in a desert in a third world country, and those guys can't hide themselves in a way that it's impossible to even concieve of their existence."

******** Now it would be interesting to see if magical creatures took the Muggle side in this war, just because Wizards have opressed them for too long.

********* That's definitely interesting, and I didn't consider it, actually.

Who werewolves side with probably comes down to the question of if muggles can become werewolves. If no, then I don't see them siding with muggles. If yes, then werewolves are most likely made up of muggles at a majority, but these muggle werewolves probably don't know about the magical world. Still, they would likely side with the muggles, if only because they would give them equal rights if they win.

Veela I'm gonna say are probably gonna side with the wizards. They may be slightly discriminated against, but they're still wizard-like and would most likely be lumped in with them in a crisis situation.

Goblins, too, are gonna side with the wizards. They may not like humans in general, but the fact that they stayed on the wizard side instead of the muggle side after the statute, and the even more evident racism in the muggle world most likely means that the wizards actually treat them better.

Giants could go either way, but the muggles don't know they exist without someone in the know.

Not sure if vampires are canon, but it likely boils down to the same as the werewolf argument, but leaning towards wizards because they can act in secret against muggles from within the invisible wizarding world, while it would be more dangerous from within the muggle world.

Phoenixes, if they're sapient, are neutral. They act against darkness, and if both sides are equally dark, no phoenix will do anything.

Centaurs probably stay neutral, but would stay hidden and then ask the winning side to please leave them in peace.

Merpeople are probably the same as centaurs, but they have the advantage of being able to hide deeper than any muggle could ever dive.

Not sure if there are any other magical creatures who may have their own agency in this war, but unicorns wouldn't be killed by anyone.

** This would really only suck for the muggles. Plague only got muggles (so wizarding society is fine) and the ensuing anarchy and chaos just makes it easier for wizards to profit off muggles.

Worried about guns? Protego and an Imperturbable charm to be safe. Worried about muggles in their natural state of aggression? Muggle repelling charms! Who cares about the statute? Oh the international wizarding community? /Fine.../

​

We'll only take a few muggles here and now. What's another missing muggle among millions? Speaking of international communities, we should tell the UN that we're shutting off the UK for their own good! Worried about the apocalypse? Good thing wizards are self-sufficient and don't need anything from the muggles.

Basically, I see this as a shit-show for muggles that, if anything, ensures that some wizards decide to ignore on the statute and start fucking with muggles. Dark wizards and purists start hunting muggles for sport or magical practice (ingredients too though this is a stretched inference off canon), muggles start killing each other, it's basically a shit show for the muggles. Meanwhile Draco Malfoy is casually relaxing in his house watching four muggles fight to the death.

To stave out off the inevitable argument over "Technology rocks":

1. It's not entertaining
2. Protego, imperturbable charm stops projectiles like bullets
3. Good luck launching bombs or missiles at muggle repelling, unplottable, and hidden locations. Turns out these days we don't bombs to go off randomly so if electronics fail as they do in magical locations, the failsafes on those bombs activate too. So basically that's an entirely useless category of weapons.
4. I mean if you wanna nuke London (though protective enchantments would probably protect Diagon Alley anyway), I guess you killed off millions of people for a few thousand wizards with the majority elsewhere
5. Careful apparation and imperiuses end the muggle world as we know it.

*** While it definitely wouldn't be pleasant for anyone, I disagree that it would entirely be the muggles getting shafted.

You're response seems to also be ignoring that a significant portion of the magical population is at the very least half blooded if not muggleborn. And that most people regardless of blood aren't just going to throw their hands up and say "hey, we've been living under fear of a muggle hating madman for years now. Now he's gone we should embrace his ideas and turn on the muggles because there is no more Statute."

There are probably a lot of witches and wizards with ties to the muggle world that in canon wished they could do more to help muggles especially with things like energy or healing spells. There are a lot more that don't even think of muggles because they are very isolated. Once things fall apart and that isolation ends they will have to face the fact that these are real people.

Then, theres no real need for technology wank here. Yeah magic can solve a lot of problems but it can't solve magical laziness. The witches and wizards of Hogsmeade couldn't be bothered to figure out the patronus charm when dementors were living on their doorsteps. How out of the realm of possibility is it that they would stop casting a battery of spells on themselves every time they leave the house after weeks without any issue. It doesn't have to be technology either, a surprise hit from a heavy pipe to the head can take down anyone.

Also, of the two possibly timeframes of the prompt, given the second one, Voldemort is completely dead as are a majority of his followers, and the rest are in custody. Do you have so little faith in the non death eater populace that you feel like without the statute they would devolve into hunting muggles for sports and ingredients just because?

Most of which embrace the magical world completely. I mean towards the end of the series Hermione was pretty much a pureblood in all but blood. She barely spent time with her parents and sent them away like she was shipping off a package. That kind of treatment doesn't instil a lot of confidence for the average non-magical.

**** That's actually a good point that I failed to address. One reason I saw the muggles getting fucked over is the end of stable muggle society. Before in a stable society, it was obvious that some something fishy would be going on and the aurors could be called in. Now? What's another missing muggle? Of course, most people would not turn to muggle hunting, but there's certainly a significant part of the wizarding population staunchly anti-muggle. And again they're "missing muggles among millions". Most people aren't do it, but a minority is doing it to the point where it's a significant part of muggle-wizard interactions. Most people don't hunt and fish, but enough do to make it significant. Again the statute protects muggles. If muggle don't know about magic, they can't incite wizarding aggression by making moves against wizarding children (the only realistic target). By banning magic in front of muggles, it's pretty obvious when a wizard is taking advantage of muggles with magic.

​

I did fail to consider altruistic witches and wizards, however, that's a very good point. I suppose that the apocalypse for muggles would also mean that most wizards would not be too apathetic and have the aurors up patrols in wizarding areas. I'm not even so sure the statute would fall. Is the magical government going to allow it to fall? And if it did fall, how would that information disseminate among the muggles? It's hardly going to be easy for them to communicate.

Yes the grieving from the losses would suck. Magical laziness? The patronus charm is not exactly the charm you fail to pick up because you're lazy, it's the one you fail to pick up because it's too difficult. The point is that they don't really need to cast a battery of spells, just stay in an area with muggle repelling charms (like your magical town, estate, neighborhood, house). Good luck attacking someone a pipe when you can't even walk towards him (though I have doubts as to the efficacy of such an attack considering superior wizarding physiology). If on the odd occasion, a wizard has need to venture out of protected magical areas (perhaps an auror scouting), do we really think they're that lazy as to avoid apply magical charms? They're apathetic at worst, not lazy.

You: "Do you have so little faith in the non death eater populace that you feel like without the statute they would devolve into hunting muggles for sports and ingredients just because?"

Counter: Do you have so little faith that the average wizard might take measures to protect their family's lives beyond the sizable measures the magical government would take?

I suppose you're right to an extent. Worst case, an idiotic wizard is going to walk out of his house into a muggle area. He's not going with enchanted clothing. He's not applying protective charms that could save his life. He doesn't have superior reflex times to cast a protego though at least some wizards have superior reflexes. He doesn't have any ways to magically travel. He's unlucky enough to meet an antagonistic muggle who shoots him. Maybe he drops his wand and as such can't apparate (it's doubtful such an idiot would be able to apparate wandlessly). The muggle, who probably isn't doing too well, manages to shoot him in a lethal location. Wizarding physiology can protect the wizard (guns are often highly overestimated in real life) but perhaps this was extraordinary shot placement and it hit the wizard in the head (though standard doctrine is center mass shots). The wizard dies...and the rest of the wizarding population is fine, happy and carefree to continue on to their likely 100+ years of life.

I suppose the potential wizarding response of altruism makes for an interesting story though I have my doubts about wizards truly breaking the statute. I'm sure that wizards would work behind the scenes to try and help the muggles, perhaps by even providing a cure. There were plenty of blood supremacists that did not support Voldemort and I doubt it's going to be the end what with an excellent reason for blood supremacy to continue on (like muggles dying en masse). I don't think it makes sense for wizards to be struggling alongside muggles though. They're be fine and like the rich. They would help out, but not at too much of an inconvenience. You're right though, that I definitely failed to consider the altruistic sides of people.

Where they at tho? Canon's best examples were Dumbledore (who forced the Dursleys to take Harry and harassed them in their own home), Arthur Weasley (who considered Muggles somewhat like a 'noble savage' or a smart animal) and Hermione herself who in the end, shipped her parents off after wiping/rewriting their memories. There are far more examples of wizards doing shitty things to Muggles rather than actually helping so I'm not sure this is the best example.

******* I agree

I think that wizards technically treat muggleborn the same way first world countries treat third world country. 'altruistic' wizard has the same detached attitude to muggle problems but has an arrogant 'see were helping' bragging when in fact it barely did a thing or what they did isn't really what's needed. They are only peripherally aware of muggles but has a general attitude of not my problem unless it's in front of me.

I'm pretty sure what appalled the masses about V's killings is the killing of the muggleborns. If fact you'd find that it's the muggleborns they are defending and not muggles, really. At the end of the day, altruistic wizards fight for magical children and not for muggles. The story has always been "there's an unseen world beside ours" and those who enter it never leave it. Muggleborn who enter it are just visiting their families but is no longer a part of the mundane world.

So statute of secrecy collapsed in a way people knew of magic but that does not mean people can easily find magical places. Wizarding world has to rebuild it self but it has no obligation to mix with muggles and help them thus will likely not help until they stabilized. Between establishing a new regime and dealing with plague, history has told us that people will prioritize government before dying peasants. Also, a plague that killed all muggles, assuming all that's left are squib descendants and with no new muggles, eventually UK will be purely magical (meaning magical and 'squibs') over time.

I'm pretty sure someone will lobby to annex the muggle world while others will fight it (muggles deserve freedom and not be under Wizarding law vs. their economy collapsed we need to 'take care' of them statute is broken anyway), while the rest of people are dying outside development of cure is slow due to low 'funding' since it's used to rebuild the Wizarding world.

***** Well thought out response. I think that most of our disagreements come down to a failing in the original prompt. I was imagining a situation where both magical and muggle society had collapsed along with the Statute of Secrecy, resulting in a tense and conflicted country trying to navigate through the negation of the Statute of Secrecy in the aftermath of a tragedy. My original prompt didn't give enough to justify the end of the Statute of Secrecy in any way to result in the situation I was envisioning. If the plague only affected muggles there would be no reason for magical society to take real notice at all, in which case you are totally right, magical people would hardly be effected, while darkly inclined people would take advantage of the lack of the Statute for their own benefit, and normal people would probably just try to remain insulated from the muggles.

​

I think you'll find what I was intending to be more interesting than what you were responding to. Lets for example give more detail to Voldemort's final revenge. Potentially, the magical plague is based off of an enchanted bacteria or bacteria like substance. Like in fanon where a magical child in physical contact with a muggle allows them to see through muggle repelling charms, the presence of the bacteria in their system (either as they are dying or a carrier if they survive) functions the same way. This allows them to see Gringotts towering over neighboring buildings in London, houses like Grimmauld place that weren't there before, floors of flats that didn't exist before, houses in villages throughout the country (only Hogsmede is an all magical village, many magical people live in physical proximity to magical people.)

Muggles that are already in the know about magic around the country seek help from wizards, for themselves as well as for their loved ones. The magical government is already in shambles after almost a year of control by Voldemort, what should be a time for rebuilding is thrown into chaos as the Statute begins crumbling and hordes of muggles approach any clearly magical building they find begging for help, including the ministry and diagon alley. The ICW and EU act to protect the rest of the world and seal Britain off completely, basically abandoning it to its fate.

The physical ministry is abandoned after being swarmed by desperate dying people. The crumbling remains of both magical and muggle governments have to band together to try to respond. All is chaos for the months it takes for the plague to work its way through the population.

The fic takes place during the rebuilding. Its too late for magical society to try to go back to the way things were. I'm sure one of the wizarding factions would just opt for physical isolation, given the muggles lack of ability to travel as easily, but not everyone would. Some would try to take power, others would try to help, and the readers get an interesting story.

While wandless magic is not nearly as powerful as in fanon, it does exist. Including accidental magic that kicks in even for older people in extreme circumstances.

I'm never entirely sure, but apparation seems to be wandless. So they can just remove themselves from any bad situation.
