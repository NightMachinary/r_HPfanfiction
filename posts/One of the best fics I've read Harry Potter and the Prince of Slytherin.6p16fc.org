I won't deny, the first year of this fic is absolutely horrible. There's ALL-CAPS screaming and generally just atrocious character behaviour.

/However/, the second year of this story (the bulk of the story), somehow, is the best 2nd year fic I've read and improves /dramatically/. There's interesting magic, Luna's oddness is explored in a way I found satisfying, the basilisk is easily the scariest basilisk I've read about and it becomes really quite worrying. Lockhart is very interesting. And Jesus Christ I feel so bad for Ron.

I'd recommend powering through the first year to get to the second year. I can't adequately describe how much better it is, literally like another author took over.


** there has been over 2 years, almost 100 chapters, and well over 500k words, and it's just entering into 3rd year. it's never going to end.

****** The difference is she didn't publish any of the story until what, 1997? Not to mention the fact that she had to create most of the content herself, when fanfics reuse a lot of content from canon. Fanfics shouldn't really take any longer than 5 years to complete if you work on them consistently, unless the fic covers a huge period of time and isn't just a rehashed 7 years at Hogwarts where 1st year takes 300k words.

*** I know! It's great!

Fics like this are why I peddle through tons of subpar stories. It's an absolute gem.

The concept of wild magic and wizardkind's taming of it, the different approaches to magic i.e. the "Merlinian" system brought by Roman conquerors and the far-east approach are seriously interesting. The history of Dementers, the workings and operations of the "Ancient and Noble" houses, and rivalry of Hogwarts and the Ministry are well done. Not to ignore the Horcruxes and the other magics in the "Anathema Codex" which we get snippets of. And just Ron's whole experience in Shambolla with the naga.

It's just such a mindfuck.

** I confess I am confused as to why people thought the first book was "terrible". It played many of the tropes straight, yes, but it was better written than most and had some good moments (Neville's story comes to mind) and I think playing them straight at first only to subvert them later isn't necessarily bad and may even be necessary

** there are three big problems with this fic... one is the fact that the first year is so terrible.

The second is nonrelevant as I fucked up two fics in the orginal post by combining their attributes. Ignore this point

The third is how slow it is. Bluntly, for most chapters, its 80% lore/worldbuilding/backstory and then nothing. This is extremely prevailant in year 1 and 2.

That being said, it is a great story to binge read, so imo wait for 10 or so updates (or months depending on your choice) and go for it.

***** Yeah your comment doesn't seem accurate with this fic. I'm pretty sure Harry has no romantic interests in the fic, though he is precocious in other ways.

Granted you are correct about the worldbuilding just sledgehammering you out of nowhere (i.e. the history of Regulus Black, while interesting in its own right, does immediately halt the story).

** I almost gave up on this fic during first year. Like, I literally couldn't stand it. But, man...the storyline in 2nd year is admittedly...great. So many twists and original narratives and takes. I've shat on this fic on here in the past, and I kinda regret that now. Yes, there is plenty of annoying bashing in first year, and Harry's brother Jim looks like a bumbling idiot. But after that, Jim turns into (dare I say?) a likeable character, and the dynamic between him and Harry (and also James) is extremely compelling. Harry isn't overpowered like he is in most WBWL fics, and his skill level is quite similar to that of his brother's. But what really fascinated me about this fic was Lockhart, and the whole story behind his...different demeanor than in Canon. Not going to spoil it, but, yeah - as OP said, power through first year, maybe skim a little bit, and then enjoy 2nd year and beyond.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I need an update now. Jkjk. It's so good I can't wait for the author to update again.

Just one suggestion for the author is to go over and tone down Year one a bit. But then again he fixed that incrediblly by resolving those issues later on so that it's not as angsty. It shows how much the author has improved.

** Yea, I read through it a while back (when it was up to chapter 83), followed along with the interludes as they were released, and just last week reread the whole thing. It's much better on a second read because you can skip all the lengthy parts, the segments of poorly written dialogue, some of the forced drama, etc. which really lets the smarter changes come through.

*** I believe I mentioned that the first year is horribly written.

This is better than 98% of other fics I've read, even after taking into account the first years crappiness.

I think this community is over-zealous about the word "bashing", the author shouldn't have included it in the description. In my opinion it is not deliberate "bashing", but more "James does unforgivable things (his reasons for doing these are /justified/ from his own perspective) which Harry and other characters rightly hold against him".

**** I do agree that James' actions are understandable from his own perspective. His actions are motivated by his reasonable emotions and knowledge, rather than happening "because the author said so". He's a fallible jerk, but he's still human.

BUT, James' motivations, emotions, and knowledge /do/ exist "because the author said so". He's given a contrived excuse to explain his behavior, and that's only a little bit better than not explaining his behavior at all.

Mind you, I still like this story. It sets out to simultaneously justify canon, fanon, and WBWL tropes, so it's not exactly the author's fault that he needs to give James a contrived excuse for his behavior; James being a terrible person is a strong part of the WBWL genre conventions, and only a contrived excuse can really justify it, I think.
