:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys! My friend is looking for a fanfiction and I was hoping ya'll could help! The following is what she can remember from the plot:

Harry goes to an alternate timeline using the chamber of secrets as a place to create a portal. He has the ability to change into a phoenix - I think! He takes some people with him and has researched people's deaths to prevent. He has the goblins purchase the land for him that privet drive gets built on and he builds an underground housing that he proceeds to raise baby Harry in a room directly under #4 Privet Dr to meet the criteria of the letter to not tip off Dumbledore.

I know they find basilisk in the chamber that they take with them before they go and I believe he may be in a relationship with Snape but I don't think it's that big of a focus in the fanfic?

Hopefully, someone can figure out what this elusive fanfic is, thank you!


** Does your friend remember what site it was on?
