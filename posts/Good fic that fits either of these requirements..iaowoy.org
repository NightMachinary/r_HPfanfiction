- SI/OC.

- SI/Canon-character.

- Person from our world SI as a canon character.

- Person from our world SI as an OC character.

General requirements: I don't care about pairings, I don't want a fic filled with too much sex. That's it.

^ a pretty comprehensive list of the good, slightly older ones.

But if you haven't read linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff), you should probably start there. It's just brilliant.

I also quite enjoy linkffn(Dichotomy by Yuuki no Yuki), which is a short, funny read.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Not every Slytherin ends up in the Snake Pit. Some cave to parental bias, some follow friends or family, and some make a calculated decision to align themselves with the most underestimated house in a bid for safety and security. Well, only one girl did that. But she read those books, no way was she dealing with all that plot. SI/OC Drabble Fic
