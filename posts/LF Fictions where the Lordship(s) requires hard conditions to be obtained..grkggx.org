You know the Drill, 11 Year old Ha(*drian*)rry Potter goes to Gringotts and do a Blood(*Inheritance*) test but instead of informing that he is now Lord Peverell-Slytherin-Potter, the Goblins inform him that he is eligible to obtain the named Lordships but he need to respect certains conditions.

For example:

- The Peverell Lordship, It is required to possess one of the 3 Hallows, and to be master Enchanter|Artificer.
- The Slytherin Lorship, To be a direct or indirect descendant, To have found the CoS, To be Master at least 15 Spells of Parsel-Magic, and to have 2 Parseltongue speaking Heirs.

So any Fictions, where instead of giving all his tittles when Harry is 11, he needs in fact to work for it, and I mean it, a lot of works,studies and talents (and obviously Luck).


** This idea is touched on by kathryn518 in Linkffn(12101842).

It's an adult Harry who's already met the requirements, but the explanation for it was interesting.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
