  Not sure if I'm allowed to post a link to Princess of the Blacks.

Related to why I couldn't get into the story. The characters normalize pedophilia and that just instantly kills all sympathy.

*** If you say so. Personally, I always felt like the story treated it almost as abnormally as possible.

**** The third chapter has a bunch of characters laughing and joking around with a pedophile, literally immediately after they find out she's one. There's an initial shock and outrage and then a few paragraphs later they're mostly over it.

Sirius finds out Narcissa was fucking his child goddaughter and is remarkably calm about it. I don't view that kind of behavior as the story making it abnormal.

***** So, despite that the dozen or so times it's mentioned it's displayed as abnormal and wrong, you're upset because one time they made a joke about it while also displaying it as abnormal and wrong? Pretty low bar there for "normalizing".

In any case, literally right after the scene you mention, Sirius threatens Narcissa about Jen.

****** Shortly after they find about it, they go on to banter amongst themselves. Some initial outrage and one threat doesn't excuse their acceptance of Narcissa for the rest of the story. You don't get brownie points for being against pedophilia if you go on to be immediately okay with someone you know /rapes children/.

**************** If your 35 yr cousin raped your 6 yr old daughter. You would work past that? You would forgive them? You would become friendly with them again? Because that's what happened in the fic.

If "Well, did she want it?" is a thought that passes your mind when it comes to a child having sex, please don't ever have kids.

** It's honestly weird to me how often this fic is brought up here (at least once a week). I usually don't judge people for their taste in fanfics, but this is one fic I make an exception for. It's fucking creepy, and the idea that there's 800k more words beyond the opening is kinda scary.

  Without warning, the world changed in ways no Seer could predict. History erased. Maps rewritten. Modern life replaced by monsters, magic, and fantastical quests. Some people are happy with what the world has become, but others will stop at nothing to turn the clock back. Harry as a Final Fantasy--style adventurer, no game knowledge needed.
