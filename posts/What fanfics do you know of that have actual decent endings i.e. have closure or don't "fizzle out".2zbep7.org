Lately the fics I've been reading have been great at the start but then just kinda lose their momentum and are either abandoned or are hastily ended. There seems to be a lot of fics with great beginnings but few with great endings.

What fics have you guys read that really make you say "WOW" after finishing them?


** Actually one of the best endings I ever read:

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4112736/Emerald-Ashes][Emerald Ashes]]

The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

***** I don't think that's actually implied, it's stated in the first book that that's exactly what a person in his situation would see in the mirror. I don't think it'd have to show every single thing he has.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] really stands out in my mind. I felt like there was really good progression throughout the story and a strong ending.

*** One of the few fics that gets stronger as it goes on. A little cliche at the beggining but it develops nicely. It has a rare "grey" Dumbledore and a rarely well done "dark grey" Harry. The last third is facinating.

** I've read literally thousands of fanfics at this point, and even though I know for sure that a huge amount of them had absolutely stunning endings, one has /always/ stood out for me.

Barb's [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Psychic_Serpent_Series][Physic Serpent Trilogy]] simply has the best ending I think I've ever encountered. The rest of the series is so-so (it was written back in 2003, times were rough then for fanfic), though it does get better as it goes along.

[FUCKING SPOILER ALERT! NO REALLY I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE ENDING OF THE TRILOGY UNDER THIS. I WARN YOU, DEPART IF YOU WISH TO READ THE SERIES!]

ARE YOU SURE?

Going to assume you're sure now.

The Serpent trilogy had the most heart breaking ending to me out of every fic I've ever read. To have Harry survive, but to lose his magic, even the ability to /see Hogwarts/, his real home was devastating. I actually cried at the end, and I think I was like 22 or something then. To Harry, the magical world is /everything/. His friends, loves, his whole world is magic. To have that stripped away, to be virtually powerless and ultimately probably rather unwanted in a very xenophobic society would be absolutely awful. Watching your wife manipulate her magic everyday as if it's nothing, while he can't so much as levitate a tea towel.

It punches me in the gut every time I go back and read it. Every single time.

*** And the reason Harry voluntarily lost his magic was literally /unbelievable/. That ending ruined the entire series for me.

No suspension of disbelief.

**** It's been at least 10 years since I read it, and I think I had that feeling slightly as well.

That said, I did love it in the end.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within][Harry Pottery and the Enemy Within]] and its [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3490702/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chained-Souls][sequel]] are my favourites. Solid fics & storyline all the way through, very satisfying ending.

*** Thanks for that one! Just finished it (3am last night. Oops.), and I agree that the ending of the sequel is really good :) Esp. loved the take on Voldemort's immortality.

** One fic I read recently that is astoundingly ended is "Time Heals All Wounds". It does have a sort of post-ending "sequel" thing, which one should read, but it's amazing overall.

** I can think of a few fics that ended 'well' (that haven't already been mentioned):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678295/1/Things-We-Do-For-Love][Things We Do For Love]] - Been a while, but a nice Harry/Daphne romance that has its ups and downs. I remember the ending giving me at least one warm feel.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] - I'll admit this fic was at the edge of what I'd call an ending. It all got thrown together in the last chapter but it didn't turn me off it, so there's that. It's timetravel and Harry/Bellatrix

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] - As I kinda like crossovers I had to have one. HP/Mass Effect. It'd be a bloody good ending if the sequel wasn't a distant dream.

But there was only one fic I can remember (as I peruse my favourites) that evoked much more than 'huh, that was cool' when I reached the end:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destines]] - I felt genuinely sad at the ending of this fic. I actually got a bit choked up. Madness. Timetravel again, Harry adopts Voldemort and bad-asses in the Grindelwald war.

Oh, I forgot one last fic that had the feels rolling unexpectedly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] HP/Firefly crossover.
