I admit it, I totally judge fics "by their covers." Usually, a summary turns me off or lures me in, but sometimes I don't even bother with the summary if the title strikes me as awful.

Obviously, this is a matter of personal taste. I tend to like simpler titles that aren't sentimental or trite. I avoid fics named after "wonderful new main character" (e.g. "Ellyria Raven Black-Lupin" and "Call me Hayden Silver" or whatever). I ignored the excellent /face death in the hope/ for a long time, simply because the title sounded angsty and silly to me, and dammit, I like capital letters.

Of course, I was being superficial.

So what stories can you recommend that you think have bad titles? Again, "awful" titles are entirely subjective. But perhaps we can all find something we'll like that we'd otherwise ignore.

No restrictions on pairings; slash/het/gen all welcome. If you love a trope-y fic, rec it anyway!

Thanks in advance.


** Very definitely linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone). It has one of the most unique and inventive magic systems I've seen in a fic, and a very interesting plot. You just need to get past the names.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) might also fit, being an absolutely brilliant fic.

**** Yeah it's much better now that there's a new description, but way back when I had no idea what the fic was about, the title combined with the old description made it sound like one of those "crack fics" that relied on just being random, not funny, making me skip over it a couple times before I gave it a try and ended up loving it.

** I'm not sure about it being /awful/, but linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) certainly doesn't tell you much about the story. And the sequel names have a pattern - Initiate, Identity, Impose, Intensity - which is kind of cool, but really not informative.

The series is excellent, though. It's based on Sirius escaping Azkaban a few years early, coming to check on Harry, finding him unhappy, and offering him another home - while still being on the run from the law, and now everyone including Dumbledore thinks Harry's been kidnapped. The characterisation of Sirius and Remus (who's searching for them) is great, and watching eight-year-old Harry blossom in the care of a parental figure who wants him is really sweet.

The most misleading summary I've come across is for linkffn(Grow Young With Me). It's actually a really touching hurt/comfort story of Harry looking after his children after being widowed, and meeting someone who draws him out of his shell and helps him learn to love again.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] is just a terrible title, at least to me. The summary doesn't help, either:

#+begin_quote
  *Summary:* AU, eventual HP/DM slash, (very) Slytherin!Harry. Harry's brother Connor is the Boy-Who-Lived, and Harry has devoted himself to protecting him---by being ordinary. But certain people aren't content to let Harry hide in the shadows.
#+end_quote

It sounds like some awful, Gary Stu self-insert who everyone, including Harry, is going to be annoyingly devoted to. Instead, it's the first part of a ridiculously long and detailed story with fantastic worldbuilding and one of the few OP!Harry's I really enjoy. And yeah, for the first several years Connor /is/ a wanker that gets way to much love from the Light wizards, but that's an intentional conflict driver.

**** It's not perfect, but it is really high quality. And I still can't comprehend how the author put out that much /polished/ content, that quickly - three million words in a hair over a year? Crazy.

I only really have two complaints. First, the author should have pruned some content. Yes, the characterization is great, and all of Harry's allies having their own, unique approaches to magical combat is nice, but... When they each need to have a page or two dedicated to their viewpoint in the major battles, it makes a few minutes of fighting just drag on for ages. Second, I'm just not a fan of romance in fanfiction, regardless of the pairing, so in later years the Harry/Draco romance scenes just take me out of it, and I start skimming until it's over. It's well written, but it's just not for me.

It has some amazing moments, though. The Harry/Voldemort fights are some of the most epic I've seen in the fandom. Dumbledore's thing with the Light griffon (trying not to spoil with details). And many more.

** I absolutely judge them by their titles.

- If the writer isn't creative enough to make a decent title, their plot likely isn't creative.
- If the writer can't spell or use grammar properly for the title, their story is likely as bad.

So I avoid them.
