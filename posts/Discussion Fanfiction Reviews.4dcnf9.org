Is there a yelp for Fanfiction? I'm talking about a website where you can give ratings to a story and leave reviews for other readers. Most Fanfiction sites seem to tailor their reviews towards feedback to the author which is great, but typically unhelpful towards readers and generally full of spoilers.


** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP's Library]] has everything you want.

- Ratings for stories
- Reviews focused on informing other readers
- Massive pool of stories that have already been rated and reviewed

There's even a tool to recommend you new fics based on your reading tastes, which you can find [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/recommended.php][here.]] It learns from which stories you rate what, and recommends you other stories based on similar user's preferences.

The DLP ratings are also incorporated into the search tool [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]], and will be displayed on the side if a library thread exists for that story in the list, along with a link to the thread.

** I don't know of one, but if it does exist, it will be one of the best things ever.

*** I know HPFanficArchive has a star rating system for it's own fics, but that sites is fairly small and limited mostly to smut.

** I think you're best off looking for recs here and on DLP. Your idea would have been great a few years ago at the height of potter mania, but I don't think anywhere would get enough traffic now :/

***** You could add flairs for abandoned stories, have pairings and genre browsing based around multiple sites with their summaries grabbed by something like our bot here. It could be a dream come true with everything or a nightmare from too much stuff.

** I guess the DLP review board and library is the closest thing to what you're looking for. The purpose is mostly for the critiquing fanfiction (with some discussion at times), which seems like what you're looking for. Also, it uses spoiler tags for the most part, so you can be safe from spoilers.

*** Not so much critiques as a review that would state things like slow plot, poor grammar, abandoned or detailed descriptions, OOC characters, but well justified and explained. Things that aren't necessarily for the author to read, but the reader.

Like yelp reviews restaurants on their quality and service, I was looking for a site that reviewed stories on their quality and writing.

**** The DLP library does that pretty well, actually. It's focused on letting people share their thoughts on how it was to read in order to advise other readers on whether it's worth reading.

If a story has frustrating elements, you'll probably be able to find people discussing them - presenting the merits of the story against the downsides. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=29116][Like in the discussion for 1800-Rent-a-Hero.]]

** Sometimes TV Tropes has pages/reviews for really popular fics, but there's not really a rating system.

*** I've run across that one before, it's not too bad, but it isn't great for anything that isn't the most popular.
