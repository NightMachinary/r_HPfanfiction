So I'm planning a fanfic where Dudley is also magical, and in it, the Dursleys are told ahead of time that both boys are magic. I've decided to plan out possible actions to see which one I want to write. Right now, I have two options once they learn about Dudley. Either they:

Reluctantly take Harry on, and try to raise both boys normally ie. mildly abusive when it comes to magic.

Or

Refuse to take Harry in /and/ give Dudley to Dumbledore, with the logic being they can have another "normal" child.

In the second case, I'm trying to figure out who Dumbledore would give Harry and Dudley to, which brought about the question of who Dumbledore's back up would actually have been.

Just keen to see what you guys think, please let me know who and why. :)


** Aberforth Dumbledore!

Harry and Dudley raised in Hogshead.

** Another option:

Harry and Dudley stay with the Dursleys for a bit (who would tell them Dudley is magical? would he have already done accidental magic at age one? are the Dursleys really given the option to reject Harry and/or Dudley since Dumbledore just left Harry on the doorstep with a letter?). This gives them reason to band togther. After a while it gets too much so they run away together. Then you have the option of someone like Aunt Marge or Piers Polkiss's family for them to stay with.

***** One of the benefits of writing the story means that I can decide how his accidental magic displays itself.

I actually remembered after reading your comment how I'd intended to write Dudley's magic into the story almost a year ago, which I stupidly didn't write down, and that was that on the day McGonagall was observing the Dursleys, Petunia is feeding Dudley when the phone rings, and she puts his food down out of reach of him. McGonagall sees Dudley levitate the food towards him and bam! Dudley is magic.

Obviously McGonagall tells Dumbledore and they check the book of admittance and his name is there, so Dumbledore decides that due to these new circumstances, he should talk to the Dursley's in person.

****** That would work, with the caveat that they needn't really check in the book if she witnesses him doing magic /because neither of his parents are magical/ and the thing with the quill of admittance and book of acceptance is that the latter requires a sufficiently dramatic display of magic precisely because of the possibility that it might not be the child that is magical but rather that the parents' leftover magic is still there. As you can see, with neither of Dudley's parents being magical there really isn't a need to check for that possibility so as far as I see it she could just go directly to Albus with it because it's clearly his magic despite the fact that he probably wouldn't be in the book for some time yet.

It makes the situation a bit simpler for you, I would guess, as for one ambiguity is nice and friendly and for two it means that if you needed to temper Dudley down for whatever reason you'd have the chance for it (it is precisely lack of Neville's name in the book at age shortly before 11 that made his family do what they've done) and if you don't then that's fine too.

** Every named adult from the series (who was born before 1965 or so) is a candidate, though a lot of them would need a redemption arc first. OCs are also candidates.

Dumbledore himself is an obvious choice. He's got the most personal ability with magic, will know the most about upcoming threats, and is the person he can trust most. However, he has long sessions at the Wizengamot at times (and presumably he does /something/ at Hogwarts), so he'll need someone to babysit. On the other hand, the average Hogwarts professor is much more busy, as is anyone with a normal job.

Augusta Longbottom too. She's raising the other potential child of prophecy. If the Longbottoms need to work, she's retired; if they manage their estate, she's already capable of raising Neville, so it's not that huge a time sink.

** I reckon whoever the next closest non death eater family is. Personally, I don't think Petunia would dislike Dudley just for being magical, after all, it was what she always wanted. I reckon she'd want to raise Dudley to be a greater wizard than her sister's son. She'd live through him. I think she'd still dislike Harry, because he was Lily, and live through Dudley, because he was her.

Vernon's entire perception of magic was through Petunia, and if she told him Dudley was going to be a perfectly normal wizard, not like that freak James Potter, he'd go for it. He'd believe that James and Lily had been freaky, layabout, no good wizards, and that Dudley wasn't going to be anything like them.

She'd probably call Snape in, looking 'normal' as opposed to Dumbledore, and have him as contact. Dumbledore would make him do it, too. Snape grew up with Petunia, and was a Respectable teacher, who was basically a chemist, despite the animosity between them.

*** The way I saw it was, despite Vernon getting his viewpoint on magic from Petunia, he is ultimately the decision maker within their household. Because he sees magic as freakish, and has only met Lily and James and, in my fic, Dumbledore, his ideas about it are pretty set in stone. Petunia would be against it, but Vernon would convince her with the "normal child" proposition.

Basically I want the fic not to pit Dudley and Harry against each other, but have them band together, to the point of them being reliant on each other for support. Whether that's because they were both abused by Vernon and Petunia, or because they have to deal with fame, bigotry and the fact that they're both orphans essentially, is what I'm trying to decide.

As to your point on the next closest non death eater family, who do you think that'd be? So far the top suggestions I've seen are the Weasleys, the Tonkses and the Longbottoms.

Both Harry and Dudley have no idea what is normal behavior, the twins are already out of control. Dudley's abusive tendencies would have to get even more out of control to be noticed in that house. The Longbottoms taking them in would be interesting. Neville would have some company. His grandmother seems stern enough to whip Dudley into shape and Harry wouldn't be overlooked or fawned over.

***** I've read that fic too, and really enjoyed it. I definitely agree on your point about the Weasleys, they couldn't afford to take in two more children and even if Harry's bank payed for both of them, it would cause trouble if Harry and Dudley could get nicer stuff than the rest of them. I am leaning towards the Longbottoms as well, mainly because with Augusta looking after them, they wouldn't grow up spoiled.

The only reason I have for Dumbledore approving it is that in canon, he seemingly has control over Harry's life. Plus he has Harry anyway so he gets to decide what to do, unless the ministry catches wind of it and forces their way in on the situation, but in that case they might get split up and I wouldn't want that.

**** I think either the Longbottoms or Tonks. The Weasleys aren't closely related at all, and aren't actively looking for orphans to adopt. They took Harry in because he was Ron's friend, with no close family. Parents around the world do this for their children's friends in similar situations - either the kid has distant parents, or a solo parent who works all the time, or is in the foster system.

If Harry weren't friends with Ron, he'd never have ended up as close to the Weasleys. If he'd befriended Draco, it'd be Narcissa sending him christmas presents, etc. Plus, the mothering really took off when Harry didn't respond to any letters, so the boys sneaked off and rescued Harry - if that had never happened, Molly would never have taken Harry in to the family quite the same way, because she wouldn't have known just how unfamily Harry's family was. Hermione, Lee Jordan, Angelina, and even Luna, who had no mother, weren't taken in in the same way.

Anyway, that was a big bunny trail. The truth is there are almost definitely relatives out there that we just don't know about. I'd say Andromeda, because she was Sirius's closest relative that wasn't a Death Eater/married to one, plus she was the eldest. Given that Sirius was an unofficial son to Harry's grandparents, plus his godfather, it would make sense that his relatives would be the next step, since Harry apparently didn't have any.

Of course, I've also read a story where Marge takes in both Dudley and Harry after Vernon and Petunia were arrested for child abuse, and it turns out her friend the Colonel was a squib. Apart from that, if you wanted to get OC, Charlus and Dorea Potter's son /should/ have still been alive. We don't know the exact relation, but can't have been much more distant than anyone else. Plus, he was a first cousin once removed to Sirius.

Otherwise, if Harry had to go to someone else, I could see Dumbledore looking into Sirius legal things, and discovering the lack of a trial.
