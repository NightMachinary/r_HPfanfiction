When Petunia writes to Dumbledore begging to be allowed to attend Hogwarts, what if he had taken pity on her and said yes?

Having found places in the magical world for squibs such as Arabella Figg and Argus Filch, Dumbledore thinks there could be a niche carved out for little Petunia too, as she clearly has the drive and desire to integrate into the magical society. Thinking to the future, Dumbledore gets a twinkle in his eye. After all, who better to teach Muggle Studies than a Muggle?

Since she obviously cannot do magic, she would have to be treated as a squib, but would be able to excel at certain subjects, such as History of Magic, Astronomy, Care of Magical Creatures, even Potions to a certain extent.

Petunia is ecstatic to be allowed to attend, and vows to do her best in the subjects she can take. She reads "Hogwarts, A History" from cover to cover, devours every textbook she can get her hands on, and eagerly plans for her new life.

Lily, in turn, is delighted that her big sister gets to come with her. Her new friend Severus, on the other hand, is not so enthusiastic...


** I think it is a wise decision of Dumbledore to turn down Petunia's demand. I feel like Petunia would have felt so alone, because she didn't have any magic.

** I honestly would rather not go to Hogwarts then go and watch as everyone else does magic and knowing full well that I'll never be able to achieve that.

** I really don't think having a squib with tendencies towards jealousy around Hogwarts is a good idea. However, I have two comments to this:

1. “Petunia Weeps” by adaon45 linkffn(7302450) has one of the best versions of the letter Headmaster Dumbledore sent to the young Petunia Dursley, when she asked to be admitted to Hogwarts so that she could be with Lily. I liked it very much, and it is surprising that this (completely canonical) letter has never been much investigated in any other fanction story I know about.

2. There is a story “Tuum Fatum” by DragonsAndOtters linkao3(10294436), where Petunia actually gets to Hogwarts. However, the result is quite different from what she hoped for.

** Why hire a muggle to teach Muggle Studies instead of a muggleborn wizard/witch??

The Muggle Studies teacher has to know not only the society of the Muggles but /also/ the society of the Wizards.

Unless you plan on having Petunia be the new Filch, I don't see her having any purpose at Hogwarts. Even Filch was probably allowed by Rowling on his post only so the students would have an easier time pulilng pranks and not getting caught on the corridors after the curfew.

** What if Petunia ignored Dumbledore's rejection and just camped out in front of Hogwarts starting her own house together with Filch. She'd just be attending classes. The homeless in Berkley do it all the time.

** The Ministry of Magic would likely get involved. It is one thing for squibs to know of the wizarding world and live in it, it is quite another for a muggle to do the same. They would probably step in and obliviate her of all magical knowledge before charging Dumbledore for completely disregarding the Statute of Secrecy.

If Petunia even got to Hogwarts in the first place, she would be in constant danger at all times, not just from pureblood supremacists, but from everyday wizards and witches who deem her as someone who shouldn't be there. This would be bullying and hostility that no one else in the series has ever experienced. She would not live a happy life at Hogwarts, and would likely leave, whether through her own choice, Ministry orders, or through an unfortunate fatal 'accident'.
