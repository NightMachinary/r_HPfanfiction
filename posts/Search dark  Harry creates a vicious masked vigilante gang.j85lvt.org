:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to remember a dark (or grey) fic where a masked group of vigilantes are fighting voldemort and maybe the ministry, and it turns out to be harry and his friends or the DA in masks? One chapter I remember clearly is maybe Ginny or Neville slaughtering Petunia in her new home as payback after she's moved away from Privet Drive.

I don't quite think its the same story where Harry is dating a rebellious motorbike-riding OC who lives in a tower flat in London, and somehow Tonks is involved?, and they get pulled away to help at a plane crash in central london caused by the death eaters. This is on my mind too though when thinking of the vigilante story, so it may be the same if that helps? Or I may be getting two fics crossed.


** The vigilantes part might be /Aspirations/ by megamatt09. The second one doesn't ring any bells. Maybe something by the same author?

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
