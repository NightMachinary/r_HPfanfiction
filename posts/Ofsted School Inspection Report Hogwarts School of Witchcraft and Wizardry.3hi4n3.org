I found this pretty hilarious. What would the formal report look like if Hogwarts got inspected by OFSTED (/Ofsted is the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills. We inspect and regulate services that care for children and young people, and services providing education and skills for learners of all ages/).

Excerpt

#+begin_quote
  Pupils at Hogwarts have access to a reasonably wide range of esoteric qualifications, suited to its key demographic. As an independent school, it does not have to follow the National Curriculum closely; however, it is disappointing to note that basic requirements such as English, Mathematics and Religious Education are all lacking or entirely missing from the school's syllabus. This has had adverse effects on all students, many of whom have never even been taught basic KS1 or 2 literacy. A few students have attended state or independent primary schools, and these students typically perform very well in contrast to their peers.

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

** This will be hilarious to anyone who went to school in England. I read it for the first time about 5 days ago and loved it.

** The great thing about this is that it's as much a criticism of how soft UK education standards have become as it is a criticism of Hogwarts. It's more subtle, but the absurdity of applying these bullshit alphabet soup acronyms to Hogwarts is noticeable, as is the way modern education looks down upon knowledge. A student punished for not knowing something? Deplorable!

*** As a non-Brit I can't intepret it as a comment on the UK education system in general but you may be right.
