I remember reading this fan-fiction long back where Hermione is transferred to Slytherin by Dumbledore and ends up having to play Draco's gf following which she dumps Ron (because she is blackmailed with pics of her) and ends up with Flint.

It was pretty mature and I don't know if I am allowed to say some of the stuff here. Anyhow, years later, now when I search for it, its almost impossible to find because the internet is flooded with Hermione becoming Slytherin fan-fictions.

I hope I am not the only one who's read that one - am I? please do tell me if you still have the link or know where it is!

Thanks :)
