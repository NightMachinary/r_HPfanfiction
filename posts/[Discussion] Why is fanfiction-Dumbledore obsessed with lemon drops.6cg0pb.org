So, I'm sure we've all been there - a scene, either with the old man present or just him being the topic of conversation, where the words 'old coot', 'meddling', 'greater good', etc. are thrown around, and then his fondness for a certain (possibly potion-laced, but hey, you never know) confectionery comes up.

Hark! A query, thus, has presented itself in my mind!

Why is it /always/ lemon drops?

In the British versions of the books, he doesn't even /have/ lemon drops, instead they were sherbet lemons, which was changed in the American release. However, Dumbledore is fond of other kinds of confectionery - at least in the movies - for instance the cockroach cluster incident in his office.

What I want to know is why there appears to be so little variation in Dumbledore's sweet selection in fanfiction, to the point where it's actually /refreshing/ to see a story where he doesn't just offer everyone and their mum a lemon drop. Seriously, give him some other sweets, even muggle ones like Werther's Originals, for God's sake, just make it different!

Bonus scene that knocked around in my head, involving a time/dimensional-travelling Harry having an unpleasant surprise from good ol' Albus:

/"Aren't you going to offer me a lemon drop?" Harry asked slightly rudely from his seat across from the Headmaster./

/Dumbledore paused, shooting Harry a piercing look over the top of his half-moon spectacles, his brow furrowed slightly in confusion./

/"Harry..." he began, scrutinising the young man over steepled fingers./

/"...What the fuck is a lemon drop?"/


** Well, the answer's simple. One fic introduces an actually original and funny idea, and then hundreds of others copy it until it becomes a worn cliche.

***** Storytime!

When I was in school, primary, I used to suffer from anxiety and I would be fidgety when dealing with people I didn't know. I was headstrong and dealt with all the issues and faced them, but I would often shift and it was rather distracting to other people.

One of the teachers noticed and handed me a mentos that was covered in colourful plastic.

The thing was fucking impossible to open.

I would sit there all lesson trying to get it open. At the time I didn't realise that I could still pick up information and not be distressed by the twenty other people near me. I focused on getting that goddamn plastic open and eating the sweet.

  "Enter."

  McGonagall opened the door and stepped into the Headmaster's office, then stopped and stared.

  There was a /poodle/ in the Headmaster's chair. One with white-grey hair, and had distinctive markings around its eyes in the form of Dumbledore's usual spectacles.

  "Er..." McGonagall started, lost for words.

  The poodle barked and wagged his tail.

  "This is going to be a difficult budget planning meeting..." McGonagall sighed to herself.

Quod Erat Demonstrandum, changing around the sweets that Dumbledore eats has potential for a lot of comedy.

...Also, X character thinking there's Veritaserum in the lemon drops is getting cliche.

*** Especially given the 'absent minded-dull eyed-answering everything' is a bit of a giveaway and if Dumbledore's going to do something so obvious (and highly unreliable given someone needs to accept) then he may as well go with Legilimency given he'll have to Obliviate the target either way.

***** That's exactly it. Honestly, in my opinion, canon Dumbledore wasn't evil in any way, but alright, that's interpretation maybe.

But I haven't ever seen a well written Bad! Dumbledore, to the point where I actively avoid fics with them, which seem to be all of them right now. It was so refreshing to see a good Dumbledore fic, and that was so long ago I don't remember it anymore...

Other than leaving a baby on the doorstep of his magic hating relatives (in november), then never stepping in to stop the obvious neglect (don't tell me he didn't know, Mrs Figg should have at least noticed the hand me downs and malnourishment)

Or and setting up a trap for the dark lord in a school. Or not closing the school when there's a magical death glare snake loose.

*** Making him a manipulative bastard who gets nothing done and relies on a bunch of kids to win a war he could have prevented is a 100% canon accurate representation of Dumbledore. He had one scene where he actually did something besides being incompetent and that was the Ministry Battle, which would not have occurred if he was a competent leader or actually gave some people vital information ("Hey Harry, Voldemort can get into your brain and mess with you. And he wants something from the DoM so better not go there.")

** I think it's because Minerva was so disapproving of him eating sherbet lemons at what she considered a solemn occasion. So I guess someone first used it as a way to highlight Dumbledore's frivolous indifference to the seriousness of the characters plight.

If Dumbledore has a lemon candy, he's an inconsiderate ass hat who disregards other peoples wants and needs, and this is illustrated by his fussing around with sweets instead of being serious.

For the record, I just don't think Dumbledore was very upset. Firstly, he's very old and has known lots of people and lost lots. He wouldn't have known James and Lily very well. McGonagall would have, but Dumbledore barely spoke to Hermione and Ron - James and Lily would not have been close to him. He would have been sad, yes. But, Voldemort had just unexpectedly been defeated, after some very long, hard, dark years. Sadness that yet more people had died, would have been overtaken with relief and gladness.
