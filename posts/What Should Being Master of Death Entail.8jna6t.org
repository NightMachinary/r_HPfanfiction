I've often wondered what the title "Master of Death" should bestow upon the one who gained it (obligations in particular, not just some godly shit) if it wasn't just a sort of metaphorical thing Dumbledore suggested, if the objects were actually enchanted by Death. Any ideas? I really like Dumbledore's idea that being the MoD requires accepting that death can't be avoided. Perhaps even throw in some Philosopher's Stone requirement that the bearer of all three Hallows wouldn't want the power they grant taken together, which would make actually becoming the MoD even harder.


** As an aside to this. I like the idea that the hallows only change hands in very specific ways.

Not only does the Elder wand change allegiance in combat. It ONLY gets a new master who has fought either with its former master and defeated them or has fought another third party to the death with equal claim to the wand if the former master is dead already.

The Resurrection Stone only ever to be hoarded, and in its hiding it's new owner steals it.

The cloak of death only ever passed down willingly from master to protege, only truely hiding he who has the right to use it by inheritance.

You could make a really cool story about the hallows changing hands. And it would also explain how no ones managed to gather all three before harry. Someone may have physically /posessed/ all three but maybe they took the cloak by stealing it and that's just not how the cloak works, and it'll eventually return to its proper master.

** I played around with the idea before and came up with a few things, some of which might be silly.

- They can feel if somebody's death is approaching when in proximity to this person, and can feel mass death coming so far as nearby countries, or the whole world should the disaster be terrible enough (2004 tsunami).

  - I was thinking of using this in a "Aliens attack Earth, wizards come out to play" kind of fic, where my Master of Death would feel the impending attack days in advance.

- Being able to intercept a soul that's passing onto the beyond and bring it back to a body that's not severely damaged.

- Immunity to magical death causing spells, such as from Killing Curses, Sectumsempra, "Blood Boiling Curses", etc.

- Outright resurrections

- Causing death with nothing but a touch

- Ability to kill the unkillable (dementors, ghosts, boggarts, etc.)

- Able to give true life to Transfigured animals, therefore bypassing Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration when it comes to creating food.

- Unaging, but still able to be killed

- Use of the Veil; using the Veil as a prison, with the Master of Death being the only thing that can release prisoners.

Confession: I need this for an HP/Avengers crossover I'm working on, so that's a decent idea. A kind of death sense or something.

** I always see him as being an agent for death with a primary duty in making sure the cycle of life and death is uninterrupted. If I was putting him in Marvel then I would make it his job to go after 'immortals' or others who are cheating the system in some way.

Depending on your Marvel cosmology this would include destroying Asgard as they've made a sort of tide pool to death's ocean in their Ragnorack cycle.

For Mass Effect I'd think he'd see the Reaper's as a mockery of the cycle of death, and as actively working to prevent life from forming new and interesting patterns.

One of the big things is that I'd try to keep Death mysterious. Like, if he does take orders/ instruction from the Death entity then I would try my best to do it without Death talking. It's very difficult to retain the kind of gravitas you might want with speech.

As for powers I think he would get a knack for undoing things, or bringing things to an end. You can make this super OP, or you can make it more of a path/direction that Harry tends to take.

*** It's for a Marvel crossover so this could be helpful. Though I wonder if being "Master of Death" and yet taking orders from it (or her, as the case may be) would seem a bit odd. I might not want him to destroy Asgard per se, but keeping the natural progression of death (given by the end of DH he has completely accepted that one shouldn't try to vanquish it) seems like it would be consistent.

**** IIRC In the Marvel universe, Death is a person - a woman. In fact, that's why thanos is trying to destroy so many worlds, to prove his love with Death. So maybe the MOD is Death's true partner, which could create a fun conflict between Harry and Thanos if you want to take it that way.

Outside of Marvel, I've always thought of the MOD as being an agent who can move back and forth between the land of the dead and our world. Maybe they can't die in the way normal folks can.

***** Hah, a Thanos and the MoD conflict is one I'm considering. However, it might not quite work that way since I've already paired Harry with someone else (no multi for me). Still, good food for thought. Maybe she'd see Harry as more of a... colleague? Any ideas?

** Being the "Master of Death" entails bombastic headlines in the /Daily Prophet/ and tiresome interviews with Rita Skeeter calling you such.

It also involves people smirking at you behind your back

** Whether or not the objects were enchanted by Death himself, the "Master of Death" idea is bogus. It's nowhere in the original /Tale of the Three Brothers/, and sounds very much like something people only dimly aware of the legend's reality cooked up. If anything, I'd say it's a metaphor taken too literally: owning these three powerful objects in conjunction /does/ make you as much "master of death" as a mortal man can be, but it doesn't grant any /additional/ powers from having the set.

Dumbledore's "he who accepts death is master of it" is neither here nor there. It's poetry and no more --- having come to realize that there's no such magical thing as being the Master of Death, he reasons that, anyway, it was a fool's hope because /if/ being Master of Death meant anything, it would mean making peace with it, not fleeing from it.

*** The original tale is obviously a children's story, I wouldn't expect it to get everything right (other wizarding fairy tale mentions things that only resemble what they're based on, like the one about the hairy heart that's a horcrux reference). But really, the premise of my question is that "'Master of Death' is an actual thing, what should it require of the one who becomes it?"

**** This people on this sub have a habit of immediately jumping to invalidate the question with "Well, /actually/, it's..."

It's kind of irritating. Sometimes I see a decent question that could lead to an interesting premise, and then most of the comments are just "This isn't canon, that doesn't work, the reasonable explanation is this," etc etc.

It's like Redditors get a hard on from correcting people.

**** You're right. Perhaps when Death created the Hallows the power to become Master of Death was unwittingly created. Unable to do anything about it, Death at least had the last laugh by making the person who got it to hate it.
