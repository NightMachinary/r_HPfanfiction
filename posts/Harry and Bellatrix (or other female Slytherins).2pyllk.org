Just read Delenda Est (and the sequel) and now I need more. Looking for good Harry/Bellatrix fics or fics where Harry is paired with another Slytherin/dark character. I don't tend to read slash for Harry or other major characters, so that's out.

I think there's a fair amount of Harry/Daphne but since she's an OC I wouldn't really know what I'm getting into. Would love more fics with Bellatrix/Harry.


** The only other Harry/Bella I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2208427/1/Earl-of-the-North]]

from the same guy as Delenda Est

*** Kind of like a Delenda Est prototype, very much not as good, so would probably be difficult to get through.

**** When I read Earl of the North I could not believe it was written by the same author as Delenda Est. It is so much worse.

***** Seconded. I checked, multiple times, to make sure it was the same author. I couldn't get through it.

**** /Super/ OOC Harry. Like, to the point where he's unrecognizable. Harry/Bellatrix is pretty much a minefield. You either make Harry completely OOC (/Only Enemies/), or Bellatrix (/Earl of the North/), or both (/Passageways/).

/Delenda Est/ is remarkable simply because it manages to make a reasonably in-character Harry/Bellatrix work: Harry is always a little idealistic, though he gravitates towards a more pragmatic approach, and Bellatrix is always pretty hard and mercenary, though she gravitates towards Harry's side. It makes it work, and the double time-travel thing is pretty much the only way to do it.

***** Not necessarily super ooc, just Harry after many years of war has changed him, he still has some of his very distinguishable traits i.e.:hero complex/willingness to do anything for family&friends

** Sorry, I'm on mobile but Passageways is a good one that is in progress. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways]]
