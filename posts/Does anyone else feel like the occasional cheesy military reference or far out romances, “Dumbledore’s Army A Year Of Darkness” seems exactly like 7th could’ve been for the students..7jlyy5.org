#+TITLE: Does anyone else feel like the occasional cheesy military reference or far out romances, “Dumbledore’s Army: A Year Of Darkness” seems exactly like 7th could’ve been for the students.

Snape was also a bit more cruel than canon snape


** Absolutely not. First, almost no character isn't OOC in that story. Characterization is generally a weak point of the author, resorting to clichés when portraying female and/or non-english characters. Also, the militarism in that story goes well beyond the odd cheesy reference, I'd even go as far as calling it a glorification of child soldiers. And the violence and torture is way over the top.

Here are some seventh year stories that I liked. All of them are from Ginny's point of view, The Changeling is slightly AU with Ginny in Slytherin. linkffn(11419408; 6919395; 8078750)

**** I remember the post that was on this subreddit about the author and was a bit disappointed. It was actually the first fic I've read and was the whole reason I got into reading and eventually writing a fic of my own.

***** It was my first fic too but if I go back to it now it seems pretty bad.

****** I haven't read it again, but looking at some of the other comments here, I feel you're probably right.

***** I know what you mean, I just finished the first two novels. When reading them, I stayed up way too late and had to drink way too much coffee to get through the day. I couldn't help but wanting to know how each story ended. I only found out after that there are a multitude of sites in contention over the author, making me want to shake my head vigorously in the attempt to rid some of the gut-wrenching scenes out of my head. Obviously that won't work, so I'm off to read some of the other fics listed here to forget what I just read. Maybe even reread Deathly Hallows so I can look more closely at Snape as a character.

*** The thing that bothers me the most about the militarism is that Neville/Luna/Ginny ... All purebloods who have never lived in the muggle world create this muggle military hierarchy. My brain can't handle it.

** I was just saying the big picture of it all seems decently accurate, the torturing did happen though. I've been trying to find more books in that type of genre, the farther from canon the less interest I have. Can you recommend any good post war ones or AUs with similar characters in different scenarios?

*** Torture took place in canon, but if I remember correctly bleeding students were hung from the ceiling of the Great Hall in DAYD, and later some kind of mad nazi scientist appeared. And that's just way over the top. Most other stories have beatings and the Cruciatus Curse occur.

*** As [[/u/SchroedingersKneazle]] mentioned in their top-level comment, the standard-bearer "Hogwarts during Harry's 7th year" fic is /Not From Others/.
