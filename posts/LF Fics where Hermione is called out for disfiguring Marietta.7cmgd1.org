Book point. Wondering if there are any fics (or at least a chapter of a fic) has Hermione being called out for disfiguring Marietta and where better options are presented.

Anyway, the bit in Seventh Horcrux is, Hermione wrote the disfiguring clause into the contract, but didn't tell anyone- so the curse was simply preemptive revenge, not a deterrent.

**** I don't have much of a problem with the contract itself. I /do/ have a problem with the fact that Hermione didn't tell anyone what the consequences were, or that there even /were/ consequences. Harry describes a vague feeling that he was signing something significant, but that could have been purely psychological.

But I actually have a bigger problem with Kingsley wiping her memory. Yes, it was necessary to stop Umbridge from gathering the testimony she needed to expel the entire DA, but as a matter of "justice", the punishment is pointless now because Marietta doesn't even remember what she did (and presumably lost the self-defense skills she learned). That there was no follow-up to that was a serious oversight on JKR's part IMO.

(I feel the same way about Cho's role in the movie. Harry is angry at her for betraying the DA, but he never reconciles with her after he learns Umbridge dosed her with Veritaserum.)

****** I don't think that really changes anything. In the real world if someone pressures you into signing a contract and you violate the terms you will still be hit by the consequences.

Though I think it is true that it wasn't known what the consequences would be. Still, Marietta knew that informing would violate the terms and she would be subjected to the punishments.

Edit: Also, pressure is not the same as making her join.

********* Getting her to sign in the first place? Yes, probably not duress, unless there's more history between Cho and Marietta than is known (blackmail, familial obligations, prefect!Cho abusing her position), but that would just be fanon.

Umbridge putting actual economic pressure on Marietta via her mom's potential job earnings, that's pretty clear cut. Forcing someone to violate a contract under duress shouldn't cause the penalties to be enforced.

Regardless, my response was more directed towards your general statement of real world pressure, which could be anything from mild peer pressure to 'Vinnie here will break your knees'. Where exactly the line is drawn depends on how good your lawyer is.

**** Ok so acne even permanent acne is in no way comparable to dismemberment or branding. Also there needed to be consequences for betraying the group that do disappear after a few days or even months. And finally I am sure someone asked why they had to sign the incriminating list at which point everyone knew that there would be consequences for betrayal. Telling them what those consequences would be would allow people to try and protect themselves from the contract.

***** as far as i know, nobody questioned why they had to sign on the List. And that it gave consequences was only revealed the next day, after Hermione saw the new Rule (Marietta didnt betrayed them on that Point, it was this low-Criminal from the Ministry). But Hermione hesitated as she asked the Group to sign on the List, so she felt uncomfortable about it. But Honestly, i dont blame her for doing such measurements, after all, the School was step-by-step overruled by the "Enemy", who refused to teach them spells for paranoid reasons. Who is actually to blame, if anything, its Cho.

Harry is concerned with the rise of Voldemort and protecting his fellow students, while Cho is defending a friend who betrayed all of that - not just Harry. Cho brought in someone who tipped off a person who was torturing students, propagating lies, as well as perverting the whole education system.

Harry rightfully saw that as betrayal, and supported the consequences who would do something like that.

***** I don't know why you're getting down voted about this; this was war, they were hiding their group from a woman who left permanent scars on students hands for doing minor things. Hermione did what was necessary, and to be honest, bully Marietta for caving to peer pressure and signing her name on something she obviously didn't believe in the first place. The resulting consequences for their group being found, especially with the name they had for it, Marietta could have gotten much worse and it be entirely justified. Perhaps if genuine remorse for her actions was portrayed later on, then Hermione would remove it, but after all the BS the Gryffindor's had to go through and deal with Umbridge, Hermione shouldn't, imo canonically, feel compelled to guilt on her behalf.
