an awesome beard

even better if he's 50+ years old with an awesome beard


** Considering that some of Harry's strongest adult influences include Dumbledore and Hagrid, I'm honestly surprised this doesn't come up more often.

*** Propably, because James. You cannot be a look alike m, when half your face is covered.

Aside from that, most fanfictions have him at an age where he cannot grow one. They only time we also hear his facial hairgrowth mentioned is in a context, where he is actually proud to be able to shave.

Last, but not least, most fabulous beards (well kept) are a time consuming matter. That would be very new territory for person whose hair is frequently described as unruly.\\
It is kinda odd, but deciding on a beard is unusual for a man in this day and time and at first feels really unlike you.

Though, Hagrid, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore had beards. While definitely in some part they are role models; I never felt it in the books that he would imitate them.

Fuck; I think the most reasonable kickstart for him growing a beard might just be, when he gets told that you should have tried it once as a man.

***** *Beard (companion)*

Beard is a slang term describing a person who is used, knowingly or unknowingly, as a date, romantic partner (boyfriend or girlfriend), or spouse either to conceal infidelity or to conceal one's sexual orientation. The American slang term originally referred to anyone who acted on behalf of another, in any transaction, to conceal a person's true identity. The term can be used in heterosexual and homosexual contexts, but is especially used within LGBT culture. References to beards are seen in mainstream television and films, and other entertainment.

** Idk why but ive always loved the idea of Harry with a beard. Particularly a still young/adult but not old man harry. I cant remember which fic it was that had a still school aged Harry growing mutton chops and surprising everyone. It's not inconceivable, i knew a bunch of guys with full blown beards in high school.
