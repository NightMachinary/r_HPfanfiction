** I read what was written back in 2012, I think, so I don't remember much except that it was decently written (like e.g. DisobedienceWriter's fics). I don't like that it's practically abandoned (the author's gimmick of having for all x, x chapters in year x doesn't matter much if you don't carry it through the end). I think it's in the style of what the Dark Lord Potter forum likes, so that's how it got its initial popularity and because of that strong recommendation it came to be known as the default Slytherin Harry fic.

**** The DLP style isn't as defined as it used to be - really, if it's well-written, thought out, and doesn't rely on tropes - like OTWTG, DLPers will advocate for it. This fic is popular because it is well-written and well-edited, and DLP members tend to make a strong effort to advocate for fics that have time and thought put into them. It's actually one of the fics in the DLP library that I'd argue is farthest away from the traditional style on that forum.

If you're interested, check the forums out! It's a much tamer place than it was ten years ago, although the reviewing standards are still high.

** For "traditional" Slytherin Harry readers who go into the story looking for Lords and Ladies, Wizengamot seats, political teenagers, endless smirking etc. then On The Way to Greatness is going to be a disappointment.

For people who want a realistic take on how the Harry Potter story would have diverged, if the only change you make is Harry's sorting - One the Way to Greatness is probably the best story that does that.

There's a lot of sticking to the track that canon set, but that's the whole point of the fic, and it is redeemed from the worst sins of rehash by the fact that it takes a whistle-stop tour through the years, which each year having allocated to it the same number of chapters as its year number.

So when you say you have read up to year 3, let's be clear: you've read the first 3 chapters of a 20 chapter fic.

*** I skimmed the rest but nothing really seemed to change.

I don't need a fic with “lords and ladies” and all the rest, I just never really saw the appeal.

If you want to make the argument realism, that's a paradoxical argument. If Harry was sorted into Slytherin at the age of eleven (and we're going on realism here) he would naturally be malleable to their beliefs because he is 11. Now I'm not saying he would have become a DE or a blood purist or anything like that, but the events of canon would not have played out like they did. For this reason I don't really think the realism debate is overly applicable to be honest.

I guess it's personal preference though. I am very big on character building and progression and the format of this story doesn't really allow much of that to happen except for Harry.

**** Harry isn't really that malleable though. He is a snarky little shit who backtalks his relatives despite being abused by them for years. He has a strong moral compass which is not swayed by the opinion of others: he dislikes Malfoy instantly upon meeting him, and stands up for Hagrid the day he meets him. He breaks rules without hesitation and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong because he is curious.

Throughout the 7 HP books, his moral certainty is unwavering, even in the face of criticism from older, more experienced friends and allies such as Dumbledore and Lupin. He's basically one of the least malleable characters in all fantasy fiction. Indeed, his stubborn refusal to bow to the opinions and will of others may be his defining trait.

And on top of all that: you're rather assuming that there is such as a thing as a unified Slytherin belief system for Harry to be influenced by.

I mean realistic in the sense of "you could see JKR writing this" - the fic is a plausible candidate for how an alternative HP series could have gone, had JKR sorted Harry differently. Characterisations, events, worldbuilding are all faithful to canon, with just the outcome of a single event changed, and then the fic plays out the consequences of that single change in a way that is (i) faithful to the way that JKR tells stories and (ii) faithful to the character and tone of the HP stories.

I personally fail to see the point of putting Harry in Slytherin if he acts and does exactly the same thing he did in Canon. Same personality, and the same actions. It's like OP said, except for the change of clothes there are absolutely no differences. That's basically putting a green tie to canon Harry and call it a the "best Slytherin!Harry". Except thinking JKR is a great author (which she isn't) I can't see how you can find this realistic or compelling at all for that matter.

**** Have you read /the changeling/ by annerb?

It's a fantastically written fic that deals with Ginny being sorted into Slytherin. It's honestly one of the best Ginny fic's I've read.

However, the authors mission wasn't to write a complete AU. She wanted to show how Ginny would have changed and stayed the same if she joined slytherin. It was a character piece most of all.

/On the way to greatness/ is similar. The goal is to show how Harry changes by being put in slytherin. Moreso, it shows how the greater world doesn't change much because Harry is in slytherin. Quirrell is still processed by Voldemort, Malfoy still wants to get rid of the diary and targets Arthur's family because of the search... Etcetc. The butterflies happen very slowly.

If the fic hadn't been abandoned, I would have expected 6 and 7 to be quite a bit different compared to Canon. End of 5th year had Harry a lot darker than his Canon counterpart.

All in all, people like it because it's a realistic and good portrayal of Harry as well as being well written.

What would you say the best slytherin fic is if not for on the way to greatness?

***** That's fair. It's just really hard to get into a fic that has no character development until 4th year. If he does end up different by the end of fifth as you said... fair enough, but steady progression is important in terms of keeping reader's attention, though in Mira Mirth's defense, the format they chose made doing that rather difficult.

Personally, I think The Sinister Man's Prince of Slytherin is by far the best Slytherin HP fic I've read and I don't even think it's close. Even ignoring the AU vs realism debate, I just find his writing to be far superior to anything else I've seen in this genre. His ability mould sub plots together into an extremely intricate story is wonderful and the characterization/character development is some of the best I have ever seen. I understand the story's a bit controversial with some people, but just my opinion.

****** I knew it was going to be the prince of slytherin.

And for me, I really dislike that fic. Simply because Harry is a Gary sue where his actions never have negative consequences. He's a freaking 3 year yet has broken into Azkaban, has more important allies than most lifelong politicians, friends with all kinds, beats even Hermione at grades and more. He literally has no downsides. This last arc made me drop the fic as he fixed /everything/ that went wrong previously and because he was /so selfless/, he even got the prince of slytherin's seat. He didn't have to give up anything to get even more power. Oh, don't forget he also cured Remus in about 5 seconds which even Dumbledore couldn't do for decades! He acts like he is 50 even though he is 13. I hate any fic where a child is smarter than Dumbledore. It makes no sense.

For me the plots don't matter if the main characters are awful and overpowered. I think this is the case for a lot of readers. They want good characterizations with conflict and consequences. It doesn't necessarily have to be AU.

Different boats for different folks.

******* His actions have consequences for example he didn't want the prince of Slytherin seat because of what that power means for the fate of the world. He has gained the attention of the DoM which has a mix of the SCP foundation in its nature (not who you want to be observed by). Harry is as skilled as he his (Hermione still finishes first overall every year) because he works hard. He got super lucky to cure Remus and the only reason he found it was he tried to not kill Remus while saving every else aka he got lucky. Harry had very little to do with the Azkaban breakout it was going to happen without him and he was not a key part his parts were stopping Sirius and Bellatrix from escaping. He has worked to gain those allies by helping them in various ways while most Lords are shown to rest on their laurels for example it was Lucius and not his Father who made House Malfoy as rich as they are. The reason everything went right was because Fate needed Harry to become Prince of Slytherin for prophetic reasons.

I disagree with that. Especially concerning the majority of HP's fanbase.

Canon!Harry is a strawman character who is so likable everybody could be friend with him as long he's a good guy (liberal, in JKR's world).

Overall, HP's characters are mostly plot devices. So it always baffles me when people talk about complex characterizations when at the same time they praise HP.

******** I am surprised with the opinion about characters being mostly plot devices in HP. I have always thought establishing characters as a strength in JKRs writing. They are not necessarily complex, but Rowling is able to make characters feel like living, breathing people without a lot of investment into the plot.

By his just shaking Harry's hands a lot, we get an idea for the kind of person Dedalus Diggle is. The first scene involving Slughorn tells us a lot about what kind of a person he is, without any telling on Rowling part. She just shows it. Another example that jumps to mind is Tonks introducing herself to Harry.

So while I agree that none of the characters are particularly complex I still think they are more than just plot devices.

Rowling is known for her complex characterizations. What she sacrifices for her plot is her world building. Her magic and the world are used for plot devices, not so much her characters.

There wouldn't be fights about Snape, Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, and more if they were simple. Moreover, Umbridge is still a favorite villain for many famous writers and people.

Harry might be a little bland, but even he was pretty well developed by the later books. He made mistakes, he got angry, he fucked up a relationship and more. He may not been as developed as some of the others, but they all were well built.

Snape is the only developed character. Do we need to talk about Hermione in book 6? Wasn't she a plot device? Dumbledore was generic until in book 7 when Rowling chose to give him more layers than the old good mentor trope.

Umbridge a favorite villain? Like seriously...

I think you conflate the fact that the community argues about if or not they like a character and the complexity of the character itself. The majority of HP's adults are incompetents for plot sake but you talk about complexity in a Manichean conflict in a children series.

The only development of Harry is the fact he grows up. He's a good guy through and through.

**** Mild spoilers: I agree with the other comment who's already answered you about "Harry Potter realism", but I'd also like to add he really is affected by the beliefs of his housemates. It might not become evident or be obvious immediately though, but it really changes him.

In his 5th or 6th year, his non DE slytherin friend Blaise Zabini says something along the lines of "I think everyone has underestimated the impact an older Montague could have on a younger and impressionable mind", Montague in this case becoming a DE Harry has interacted with quite a lot. Harry won't ever become a death eater ofc, but there's a lot of meaning behind that statement.

** I tend to rail against canon rehashing, but I think that it's important to acknowledge its benefits from the point of view of both the writer and the reader, particularly for a fic with pre-Hogwarts or early-Hogwarts divergence. Diverging too quickly means that the writer can't rely on the reader's familiarity with canon, which effectively obligates the writer to fully describe what happens instead of canon. This creates a very high risk of getting bogged down in the first few years---years when the characters' magical, emotional, and social possibilities are narrow and their actions relatively inconsequential.

Now, from the point of view of the reader, the problem with canon rehashing is that 1) the reader is forced to reread almost word-for-word repetitions of what they'd already read in canon; and 2) the reader is often confronted with a particular station of canon being visited even when it no longer makes sense given prior divergences.

OTWTG's commitment to having X chapters for Hogwarts year X is a masterful way to balance these issues. In the early years, canon is rehashed heavily, but there isn't much text devoted to those years by design, instead making heavy use of referencing canon events that everyone already knows about, allowing the author to focus on what's different. Thus, the fic neither bogs down in details of preadolescent activites nor bores the reader with repetition of canon scenes. In the later years, when divergences accumulate and the characters have greater agency and potential to influence the world around them, the amount of text narrating them grows correspondingly.

** It's because it's a very good depiction of Canon if Harry was sorted into Slytherin, without all the AU stuff of nobility, worldbuilding, and other stuff to make it more interesting.

It takes canon!Harry , sorts him into Slytherin and then runs with it as close to canon as possible(some worldbuilding required for characters that are not explored in the books).

It does have some cool character development though, with Harry growing up to be a lot more "dark" and cunning than in canon, and the universe around him doesn't change that much until later. He also has less friends, and a harder time adapting to school.

I like it for what it is, a good fic, and good character study, it's not my cup of tea because it's too close to canon for my tastes, so it ends up boring me, but its quality is undeniable, good writing, good editing and so on.
