Looking for story (or name of the story) where Harry Potter travels back in time to his current body day of the Yule Ball during the Goblet of Fire Tournament. He dances the the whole night with both Parvati & Padma, then ends up spending the night with them. He also claims his Head of House Potter ring publicly at the ball, upsetting Dumbledore. I think Luna also eventually travels back in time to her own current body also.

How... uhm... accurate is that warning?

edit:

  What the ...' Harry thought as he saw that his cock was much bigger then before 'must be a side affect' he thought smiling to himself,
#+end_quote

That's literally the fifth sentence in the third line. Just a heads up for anyone who braves this one. Also, the following sex scene is a great example of what happens if someone writes a sex scene who himself (and I'm pretty sure the author is male) never had sex before. If you'Re looking for an absolute trainwreck, you found it.

  Years after the war ends Harry discovers shocking secrets about his past. So Harry sends himself back in time to change everything. Armed with knowledge of the past and the future nothing will ever be the same again. After all what's the point of time travel, if you can't change the future and have fun doing it at the same time. Harry is not a dark wizard, he is grey with alot of anger issues. Warning: also contains rape, strong language and incest

** This sounds amazing. I am always looking for a good patil twins pairing but all I've ever found was short oneshot smutfics or massive harems where they blend in with the rest of the harem. Its weird that there are no twin lovers out there to make a fic like that.
