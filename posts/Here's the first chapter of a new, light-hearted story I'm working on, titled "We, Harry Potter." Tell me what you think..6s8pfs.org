Summary: When he was bitten by the basilisk, Harry Potter had no idea that he would be unlocking the beast within his bloodline. When the horcrux in his head was in its death-throes thanks to the same venom, it was not aware that it kicked Harry's transformation in the metaphorical 'nads. Harry's magic, however, was resilient. Now, Harry "Blue", /Harry "Green"/, *HARRY "RED!"*, H̲a̲r̲r̲y̲ ̲"̲Y̲e̲l̲l̲o̲w̲"̲ , and /harry "Grey"/ Potter have the distinct pleasure of being the world's first literal five-headed dragon.

--------------

Why yes, that is a nod to Hiram McDaniels of /Welcome To Nightvale./ I was binge-reading fics with other fictional dragons and I thought, /'There's no fic with a literal five-headed dragon in it.'/

Thus, this.

^{In the sense of 'do want', which is to say, I enjoy this concept and your characterisation of Harry, and would be highly fascinated by more chapters.}

*** Thanks. I've already got another chapter in the works at the moment, so it's not doomed to the land of one-shots at least. (I have a bad habit of not finishing the stories that I start.)

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
