Or any fics where it features strongly. I find it too clean the way the books ended and would love to read about Harry wanting to say goodbye or apologise to those that died in the battle. Ideally struggling to live a normal life and not use the stone to seek guidance from Dumbledore/Parents/Sirius/Remus or Tonks maybe even a chat with Voldemort.

Thanks.


** I think he shouldn't have dropped it, but instead have used it as a public service. Sure, summoning his parents immediately might not be a good idea, because he'd have to let them go soon and it might be sad for him.

But dang it, what about summoning, say, Merlin, and get some answers about how magic works? What about summoning literally anybody to have answers on what the afterlife is /like/? Harry gets /two/ opportunities to talk to a dead person in the series (the Stone Ghosts and Glowy-Limbo-Train-Station Dumbledore), and he never thinks to ask: "By the way, what's the Great Beyond like?" That'd be the first thing I'd think to ask if I met a dead person.

And once that is done, make the Stone into a public service. Somebody's been murdered? No matter! Summon the shade of the victim and ask /them/ who did it, simple as that. Then ask them who they want to bequeath their things to and where they want to be buried, if they didn't have the time to make up their minds in life.

It would also provide an opportunity for ghosts (who are doomed to wander the Earth forever) to talk to their loved ones who chose to move on, and vice-versa. For instance, how heartbroken must Myrtle's parents be that they didn't have the chance to meet their little girl in the afterlife? And Moaning Myrtle might not be so whiny if she wasn't a pre-teen girl who was separated from her parents for fifty bleeding /years/.

*** I'd just like to say, he kind of gets three chances, if you count the specters/ghosts/echoes/etc. that come out of Voldemort's wand in the graveyard duel.

  The Hallows were not an ending. Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest after the Battle and finds the Stone -- the start of his salvation and the path to his damnation.

** Yeah it's pretty dumb how Harry thinks that the using the stone more than once will cause something bad to happen to him. Why is assumed that anyone who uses the stone will become addicteded to it? Like he doesn't have any problem with using the cloak all the time.

*** The Stone's powers are nothing like the cloaks, though. I'm not sure if you've ever lost anyone close to you, but I can assure you if that stone was real, I would have already tracked it down and hoarded it, making sure to speak to my brother daily, hourly.

I can understand his fear of being trapped with the dead because I would succumb to it. I believe he fears that he would stop living if he could speak to the dead. It may not make much sense, but it's a scary thought.

**** Yeah really. It is like an interactive Mirror of Erised, and we all saw Harry's reaction before everyone and their best friend died. That, coupled with Harry's nasty habit of survivers guilt, rather implies addiction to the Stone.

***** Well the mirror of erised shows their greatest desire, so it's a perfect (or as close to perfect as it can get), while the Resurrection stone wouldn't be nearly as perfect.\\
Of course it would still most likely be addicting, but not as much.

****** I would beg to differ. Canonically, the mirror shows you what you want. In essence, a smiling nodding picture of what you want most. But for the type of people that would have dead loved ones in the mirror, the stone would be way more effective. After all, the shades can talk, be seen, reason and think like the people they represent. They have a better shot at pretending they are real, where as the mirror is just glass at a certain point.

*** I suspect that the idea cones from the story of the three brothers in canon, where the first two gifts seem to lead the brothers to death, while the third gift does not. The idea that the first two gifts are cursed somehow makes sense as an in universe belief, based on the concepts that the characters are exposed to.

Whether or not it actually is cursed is immaterial. The original brother wasted away after talking to the spirit of his dead wife, and the temptation of the stone caused dumbledore to suffer a trap. Everyone known to wield the elder wand has been defeated and killed for control of the wand. The cloak doesn't have a bloody history.

Once again, it doesn't matter if the above events are actually caused by the items in question, it only matters, for the purposes of Harry not using the stone, if he believes that they were related.

Can you write a story where harry decides the events are unrelated and uses the items? Of course, nothing to stop you there. But there is enough foundation in canon to also wrote the story where the curse either is real, or is believed to be real, even if it isn't.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I would say the same, but for the Elder Wand. In essence, the Elder Wand was capable of breaking the very rules of magic itself, it isn't a far-stretch to assume that if one delves deep enough into Necromancy, they could resurrect the dead with that wand. I particularly enjoy that one fic that took a different approach to the Elder Wand's power, and it instead meant that you got the knowledge and skills of all the previous users. It's a bit broken, but it makes sense.
