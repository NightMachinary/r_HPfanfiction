This is a big scale project I'm tackling (full on trilogy), so I absolutely do not want to get into it without making sure that I have my writing down to at least a readable level.

Without further ado, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/153KCU6VFmv-OPhlp9yKLi22vTUFrZx2w6fo8UOjyY4I/edit][here's the chapter.]] Yes, it's short, I'm aware, but it's only a prologue and I don't think it needs to be any longer. I'm aiming for an average 5-6k for future chapters.

Is it readable? Is it engaging? Is it garbage? Whatever it is, I'd be very glad if you could let me know, so I can try to improve.


** Cut out at least half of your adjectives. I'm afraid I didn't concentrate beyond the first few engaging, breath-taking, mind-blowing, fascinating, expansive paragraphs.

Nothing happens in this chapter. It's about three people - who aren't properly described, despite the avalanche of adjectives - being somewhere and seeing someone. And that's it.

Sorry to be harsh.

*** Don't be sorry, it's exactly what I need. Without your "harsh" words I would have went on to publish this, which clearly wouldn't have been good. There is extensive editing to be done here.

Edit: After some more thinking... wow, you are right. That is really not a good chapter at all. In fact, it shouldn't even exist the way it does. Kinda messed this one up.

**** Thank you for taking that comment in the spirit it was intended. The last thing I want to do is kill someone's creative instinct.

I'm not going to volunteer for beta duties at this stage, but if you want feedback, my ffn profile name is the same as my name here.

** It's quite turgid. I skimmed after the first paragraph. It did grab my attention, though. I'd simplify it down to what you want to happen, the bare minimum, and then add back in details. Add back in details which serve some purpose.

I understand what you're trying to do--humanize the girl so the reader feels something when she is attacked--but you ended up describing the lake, mountains, wildlife, etc. (unimportant), which tells us little about the girl (important).

If you were to frame it more as:

The stillness of the lake was disturbed only by a small girl. She frequently visited it, enjoying the beautiful vista near the village she calls home.

While you're still describing the lake and setting, you're characterizing the girl at the same time. The detailing serves a purpose while also providing flavor/style.

** I agree entirely with the review that [[/u/rpeh]] wrote. You are good at painting a beautiful image of the location, but it is quite overdone.

My major critique is that it doesn't function well as a prologue. I want to be emotionally invested in your fanfic, and I want to be excited to continue reading your story. However, I have absolutely no attachment to the characters because they're not really present. I should be scared of the two men and worried about the evil they're doing, but since they don't really do anything except kill a girl I don't care about, none of that happens. Not to mention, I don't know what any of the three look like and how they act as they're not at all described.

That being said, you're miles ahead of your typical fanfic author regarding the quality of your writing, so I look forward to reading what more you come up with.

** I'll agree with what others have siaid so far, but with a caveat: stray away from using second person.

#+begin_quote
  Now, this wasn't your usual village.
#+end_quote

Instead try "This was no average village," or even better, drop the line entirely and show me its uniqueness. I'll draw my own conclusion from there.

Second person breaks immersion because it sounds like you're addressing the reader, even if it's more of an idiomatic sort of phrase, not meant to literally talk about /me/.

** It's nice, but way too short for me to make myself a real idea of your capabilities.

Otherwise, I enjoyed it but you need to address several questions like "why would a seven year old girl would go collect fruits, alone and early in the morning, for the entire village?".

And don't worry for your style, because sure, the girl could have used more characterisation, but if you can balance everything properly, I don't see why you should destabilise your writing. And Kudos for the grammar, I didn't see any mistakes (I wasn't really looking for them but still, better than most).

** You did go a bit adjective crazy in the first paragraph, but other than that it was quite good! For a prologue you don't need much, just enough to grab interest, and this definitely did.

I'm left wanting to know what's so special about the village? It's obvious the masked men were looking for it. Is it hidden by wards and that's why there are no outsiders? I want more!

And that's exactly what the prologue should do. So good job! Cut some adjectives, clean up the description of why the girl is out alone (it seems like the youngest are tasked to pick food once a week, but is it her turn, or is she the only young girl?), and you'll be doing ok.

A hint: as you take our advice, make sure you don't lose your own writing voice in the process. If it becomes a chore to write you will fizzle out before you can finish. Take advice, practice and adapt to become a better writer, but don't change so much that the words don't flow anymore

** As somebody already said, cut on the adjectives. I'm all for building great scenes, but then I'd also like to know where I actually am.

Readable? Definitely.

Engaging? Not very for now. Who knows what happens after the girl is killed? However, if this style goes on for much longer I would stop reading. Get to the point a bit faster.

*** Yeah, I have been reflecting a lot on this piece and I've decided that I'm not ready for it. Currently writing some nonsense sci-fi just to practice my prose some, then I'll revisit this and make it into more of a /story/ than a /scene/.

I of course thank you and everyone else who responded; I would not have been able to realise these issues otherwise.

** This might have been a good prologue for an original story, or a movie, but I don't think it works in fanfiction. Almost nothing happened here. We have no idea what the story is about. There is nothing to hook the reader. Death Eaters killing an innocent little girl For Teh Evulz feels like a very cheap way to make the reader emotionally invested.

Your writing is generally good, even if a bit too verbose. My advice is to cut this prologue completely and start with things actually happening. Once you get the reader hooked, he'll feel much more compelled to read a long, tiring description of a village. And stay focused. This prologue starts with focus on the lake, then on the village that lies nearby, and only then on a girl from that village. It feels like an empty, grey canvas that you add little details to over time, until a picture forms, instead of starting with a picture and then zooming in to its relevant details.

*** Yes, I fully agree. This chapter was very misguided, I think, and I will have to revisit it in a completely different way. It's too short, too uneventful, too needlessly descriptive about things that don't matter... I'm kind of disappointed in myself.

But I'll get it reworked into something more immediate.
