So, I'm looking for fics where there's an amazingly written bromance, I actually tried to explain it better in my head but my brain shut down soo..

Now, to explain the "more fights like the DoM fight"

I meant as in, there's fighting like Harry and Sirius did against Lucius, it just struck me how well it showed the bond they had formed

"Nice one James!" When Harry hit Lucius with a nice one

More moments like that, I need them

I guess this could have been more compacted into "great bonding moments between bros and their fruits showing" or something similar

Dont make it into slash, I will destroy you if you do

No oneshots

Thank you and stay safe
