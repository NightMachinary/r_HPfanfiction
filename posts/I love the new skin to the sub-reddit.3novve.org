** Dunno what to think about it, looks fancy but really unwieldy. No obvious breaks between comments either, and the front-page posts are really blown up and not very orderly. Ah well, I'll just praise RES and disable the CSS. No change is best change >:]

*** It could use more contrast IMHO. Like those links to comments which are only #888 on a white background, or the hard to see difference between visited and unvisited links.

** I'm reading on a small screen, so maybe it's just my situation but the small, grey text on a white background is hard to read. I find myself squinting or zooming to see how many comments a post has. Otherwise I like it so far.

***** That is actually pretty weird - I just got rid of that error. Try clearing your cache/etc?

I'm going to sleep soon, so if that doesn't fix the problem, just use the default subreddit style, it is not much different from what we previously had.

** Glad you like it! I thought it was time for a change, especially since [[/r/harrypotter]] went all-in.

If anyone finds any bugs, feel free to tell me. This is actually my first time working with CSS (like, ever), and I've basically hacked together many open-source existing themes and added some of my own touches, so I hope you like it!

*Current Bugs (Fix ETA is this weekend)*

- Upvote/Downvote arrows reversed (simple fix)

- "/Nox/" animation doesn't play when downvoting comments (relatively simple fix)

- Selftext image doesn't appear next to links (minor issue, but a bit more involved due to the hack-y nature of this CSS stylesheet)

**** Yes, if you look closely the upvote image is actually the Deathly Hallows symbol imposed on a backdrop of stars. But you make a good point and I'll work on reversing that.

**** Yeah, that was me accidentally testing a new feature on this sub instead of my testing sub. I got rid of it a few seconds later, which might have been why it disappeared when it refreshed.

***** And honestly, i have no idea what haft of that on the picture is supposed to show. Who it the guy getting hit by the red spell right next to voldy? Why it the witch that is having Prior Incantatem with voldy? Who is Bellatrix(?) blasting with green, and who is the girl crawling just beside him. What white bird spell is shot at the guy behind Bellatrix. Is that a goat head i see inside the explosion on the left? Why the dragons? Is that Luna in the stribed shit under the red spell? What is standing right under/next to Luna? Why is there a disembodied face under voldys hand? Why is Molly just standing there? Why is there a fire inside the window, and only there, and on the topic of fire, how does the stone above the Weasley burn? What Weasley is that? And finally, why do Hagrid(?) have a three eyed skull on his pants, and what spell is the trying to do? Patronus? Lumos?
