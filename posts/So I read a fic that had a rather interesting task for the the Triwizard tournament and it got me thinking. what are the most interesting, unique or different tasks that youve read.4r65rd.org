The one that I was talking about had curling as I believe it was the second task. (Please forgive me I can't remember the fic). It stood out to me not because I dont like curling, because I love the sport but because it kinda came out of nowhere and suddenly tons of wizards knew how to curl. I get the historical aspect of curling in Scotland but it still got me thinking.


** While I absolutely love curling, why the hell would that be a Triwizard Task?

** The 2nd Triwizard Task in Hogwarts Battle School is my favourite. */SOME SPOILERS AHEAD/* There's an island of ice in the middle of the Lake, and the three teams from each competing school start equidistant from an ice mountain that's in the centre of this newly-made island. Each starting point has a group of VIPs (immobilised in a similar manner to the 2nd Task hostages of canon) that belong to another school - the VIPs must be retrieved by said school, and brought back to the original starting point. linkffn(8379655).

*** I was going to mention a task from that story, but a different one (although I did like the apparition challenege). My first thought for this question was the challenge room where they had to get Wiglaf's (?) dagger. It was such an interesting idea, and I really liked all the different methods that the champions used.

** There was a fic I read years and years ago (I can't remember the name of it for the life of me) that had a dimension crossing Harry being forced to be in an Triwizard Tournament. Voldemort won and was effectively the ruler of everything, and Harry was trying to hide his parseltongue abilities.

Anyway, I don't remember all of the tasks but one of them had something to do with a basilisk. In the fic, the basilisk was pretty young so its killer eyes weren't nearly as powerful as an adult's gaze would be (at least, that's how it went in the fic).

I'm not sure the fic ever went to the 3rd task (maybe it did though!), but the tasks it did engage with were completely different than canon.
