:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all I am looking for a fic that I read once and never saw again it had the Irish Seeker getting hurt and Harry somehow ends up playing as their Seeker and if I remember right beating Krum to the snitch. Obviously it is a 4th year fic. I don't know anything else about it unfortunately.


** I wish I could remember, I know I've read this fic as well. Sorry =(
