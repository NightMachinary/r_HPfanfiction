In canon, the twins use it a few times. Not too much, and not too extremely.

In fanon, the twins share a mental connection and are the same person in two bodies.

Most twinspeak is annoying and stupid, but it doesn't have to be.

Here's two examples, in the context of planning a prank. First, the bad way of doing it:

T1: "We'll have to..."

T2: "...slip him..."

T1: "...something, in his..."

T2: "...drink."

You see the problem. Now the good way of doing it:

T1: "We'll have to slip him something."

T2: "In his drink?"

T1: "Perhaps his food."

T2: "Or his bed."

T1: "Maybe we could get the elves to do something?"

T2: "I know just what to bribe them with."

The difference is palpable. They're not a collective consciousness, they're two brothers who are very, very im sync. One speaks, and the other knows the thought that brought him to that, and responds to that instead of what the other said.

Use the Twins wisely, if you do at all.


** One hundred percent agreed. It's not something that will totally kill my ability to read any particular fanfic, but it is incredibly annoying when done wrong.

It's right up there with blatant misspellings that any autocorrect should have caught, or ludicrous punctuation (or lack thereof). It may be worth suffering through to get a decent plot, but it's still a cause of suffering.

**** I'd say true twinspeak would be even more convoluted than this, with ellipses and barely connected fragments making up the conversation, but you pretty much have to dial it down for comprehension's sake.

Something like

T1: "Fred, the potion."

T2: "his goblet?"

T2: "no, too risky. he may not be there"

T1: "Where's his bed?"

T2: "They'll know."

/T1 goes off to the kitchen, while T2 gets the laxative/

would be what I consider true twinspeak, but it's barely coherent.

***** Personally I quite like this. It's hard to follow but not impossibily so and it shows off a well deeper personal twin connection.

It shows a great bond an look into the minds of two of the greatest characters.

*** What I remember twin speak being in the books, is that Fred would say one sentence to Harry, and then George would say the next, it was very fast paced and a great way of showing how innsync they were. Twin speak in the fannon however just slows the while thing down, it reads like they're taking massive breaks between each of their bits.

** As an identical twin, I can absolutely tell you this is correct. My twin and I are Fred and George level close, and we've never done the top type of conversation but we have many conversations like the bottom and the other ones you've done in the comments. I went to a High School with three pairs of identical twins, a pair of fraternal twins, and a set of identical triplets and I don't know any of them that talked like the top conversation. You nailed it.

I guess not. But these three lines imply 'Twinspeak can be done well and here's how'. So you need to be more clear that you actually mean "You know what trope I hate? Twinspeak. The only way to do it right is to not do it at all." That misunderstanding is your own fault.
