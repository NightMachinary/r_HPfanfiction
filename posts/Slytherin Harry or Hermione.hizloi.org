** For Slytherin Hermione, my personal favourite is Confectionary Chronicles. She gets pseudo-adopted by a Trickster God and learns how to levy 'just desserts' to the deserving.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
