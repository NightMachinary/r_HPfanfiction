:END:
I remember reading a fanfiction where Harry is essentially a wizard with godlike powers and at the end of the book the order tries to go to harrys castle to kill him at the same time as Voldemort and Harry easily defeats them both. I distinctly remember the epilogue being Harry the most powerful being in the world or something and he controls a ton of dark creatures and every few years or so Voldemort marches his army upon Harry's castle and Harry beats Voldemort and lets him retreat to give himself some fun

  In 1895, the last time he was defeated, Count Dracula made a prophecy. His legacy would live on in the boy of lightning... His four mistresses set out on a quest to find this boy, and finds him in the boy known as Harry Potter... Rated M for Gore later on. Vampire!Godlike!Harry
