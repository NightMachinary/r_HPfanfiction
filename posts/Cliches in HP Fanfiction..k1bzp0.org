** Lord Potter Black Peverell, the reincarnated Master of Death who in his last life was thrown in Azkaban after his twin (whom his parents favoured to the point where he was neglected) was proclaimed to be the Boy Who lived.

In his second life, his memories were bound by Death until his creature inheritance came into being.

Albus - too many names - Dumbledore had been found embezzling money from Hadrian's vaults by the Goblin Nation (who proclaimed Hadrian as Goblin Friend) for the greater good. The Order was horrified by his accusations, Remus calling him 'Pup' in disappointment. Dumbledore, ever calm, asked "Would you like a Lemon-drop Harry," his eyes twinkling like little stars.

His avada green eyes pierced the darkness, glowing with power as he found out that Molly was feeding him love potions to make him fall in love with Ginny.

(But in all honesty, not all of them are that bad lol)

** I've actually never heard the eyes like the killing curse. Of course the eyes have been described in hundreds of ways but I haven't seen that. I've easily read hundreds of fics as well. Very cool!

**** Isn't POS's intention to use and mock the regular HP fanfic cliches, while trying to subvert them? I remember reading somewhere thats what the author was trying to do, can't remember where for their of me.

***** From what I understand there was never any intention of mocking them. Subverting them, yeah, even if the author went about it in a weird day. Like, the first book is not much more than the typical Slytherin!Harry story, meaning many readers who want to see some actually subversion quit the story before second year, which is where the changes start

****** Fair enough, for some reason Ibthiught I remember reading a post along those lines but my memory is fuzzy. You're likely right it's intention is just to subvert the WBWL and Slytherin!Harry tropes. I liked the story but I feel recently its gotten a little out there and off the rails. It could be that I grasp and get immersed in stories was better when I can read them beginning to end unlike when I read ones not yet finished as they update. In this case though I also think the story has started to get bigger than itself and has lost grasp of the narrative in the process. Just IMO.

** Don't forget got magical core blocked before school and Harry is actually 5 gazillion times more powerful.

Also /insert character here/ read all the books before their first year so now know more than anyone in their grade and also probably anyone in school because magic is about memorization and practice and deeper level of understanding is meaningless I guess.

** There's that whole Magical Guardian thing, which I'm pretty sure is never mentioned anywhere in the books but in fanfiction it's universally Dumbledore for some reason.

I mean, I get it, but it's plausible that there's no evil scheme to keep Harry in the dark about his supposed great inheritance(that's also not really in the books), and Harry really is just an orphan who falls through the cracks because of non-existent child welfare offices in magic-land.
