I'd love more Bill Weasley as a mentor to Harry and/or Hermione fics. He has a interesting job and is in Britain, but doesn't come around. That's just a shame and needs fixed.


** Bill and Charlie are both terribly underused characters. Bill is essentially an older version of the twins that is more mellow. Charlie is just Arthur but his obsession is incredibly manly (dragons) as opposed to kind of geeky (muggle otaku).

I like to imagine that Bill and Charlie take more after their father and the Weasley line: they have their obsessions, they're calm and level-headed, slow to anger and easy to forgive, they have a natural emotional maturity. While the younger children all take after Molly and the Prewetts side of the family more. Emotional highs and lows, tempestuous tempers, quick to anger and they carry a long grudge. The Twins, Ron, and Ginny all seem to be Prewetts by nature, and they get the most screen-time by far.

We barely, by contrast, see much of the Weasley nature: Percy is clearly one, but he's barely involved in most things and ends up being something of an ass. The only other brothers besides Percy that take after Arthur and the Weasley side of the family are, of course, Bill and Charlie. Which is why I feel more stories should use them. They're both far more like Arthur, and Arthur is a great character.

*** This is the first time I have seen Arthur described as a muggle otaku. Now I kinda want to see a (crack)fic where he actually behaves like a stereotypical otaku but with an obsession for electronics instead of anime. Would he have a body pillow of Martin Miggs the mad muggle?

** This reminded me of Bungle in the Jungle by JBern. I recommend any if his works. But in short this is an AU to book six and seven, Harry runs off with Bill on a curse breaking adventure. It DOES take a little while to get used to the POV (2nd person) but it is a helluva ride.\\

** To me Bill and Charlie take after Percy and Ron respectively. Bill would lean more to the practical side, while Charlie is the blokey one.

I'm still not sure I've got the right mix of Bill's personality though, how much he'd be the responsible one, how much he'd be cool.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]] does this extremely well. It's probably one of my favourite fics because of all of the world-building. The first few chapters are terribly cliche, and some parts of the story aren't the best, but it's absolutely brilliant.

I also plan to write something similar two that where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna, Draco, and Astoria are sent back in time to their younger bodies. Harry, Ron, and Neville are Aurors (Neville is just doing it part-time as he does his apprenticeship with Professor Sprout), and Hermione, Draco, and Astoria are Unspeakables. Ginny and Luna kind of tend to drift around, Luna often going on Magizoology exhibitions when she's not helping them with ancient spells, and Ginny got seriously injured during a Holyhead Harpies game and so she looked to Bill, a Master Curse-Breaker, to teach her curse-breaking. She and Harry both became apprentices to him and they rekindled their relationship due to this.

I'm not sure when I plan to post the fic, or if I do, but it's definitely going to be fun to write. So many different point-of-views and different interests and all of the relationships!
