Basically, any story where the cast looks average and not like they were taken from a porn parody or the nearest modelling agency. I find it immersion breaking when Hogwarts suddenly is described as London Fashion show 2, so I want more stories akin to "Ice Princess" by Luan Mao, where Harry chooses an actual character over some /playboy bunny cutout/.

Fem!Harry is fine as long as the love interest is also female. Please no Death Eater revisionism/apologism and preferably no Ron/Hermione in the background


** I call it the Delacour-effect. Sirens are real, which means whoever Harry falls for has to be better.

That said, most h/l fics depict neither of them as particularly attractive.

There aren't many of those around, and most of them are abandoned.

*** Yes, that isn't stopping authors from making any love interest "smoking hot" however. And I am looking for stories where that isn't the case. Usually, there's going to be a line about puberty and how that gave Harry, Hermione and everyone else the body of someone who has been working out for a decade.

I'm just tired of reading about a ripped Harry with "hot abs", Hermione with a "D-Cup", Ginny and her athletic build and stories where the MC is suddenly 6'6" despite suffering from malnutrition for a decade.

Edit: Also, looks aren't everything. If you find someone interesting, the most mundane features can become attractive whereas a horrible personality can "ruin" a hot person.

***** The Quidditch body thing is a bit weird to me. How in shape would you really be? Like yeah, upper body strength for chasers and beaters, and probly some pretty good lower body strength for seekers (since they'd more likely need to ride hands-free) and keepers would likely be fairly flexible and strong all over, but that doesn't mean anyone would be particularly fit in general. They are still sitting on a broom and letting that do all the hard work.

****** A valid Muggle comparison is race car drivers: just because they can sit, doesn't mean they are not top fit. Chasers are pretty much like F1 drivers who have to make high-G tight turns and stay focused most of the time. Quidditch games can also last for a very long time since there is no guarantee when the Snitch will be caught.

********* You can work yourself to utter exhaustion without gaining a lot of muscles and the "nutrition" Harry got at the Dursleys would destroy any "gainz" each summer. Katie was in a coma/hospital and there was no Quidditch during the Tournament.

I mean, playing laser tag for a couple hours is utterly exhausting but not a good exercise.

********** A lot of this depends on how much work the magic of the broom is doing. We get very little information on how strenuous broom riding is, because JKR spent so much time focusing on how easily it came to Harry.

Because we know so little about it, we have to assume that there is a correlation between quidditch and the more mundane sports we know.

For your example of laser tag, if you're playing at least multiple times a week, for several hours each time, you'll get a decent work out from all the cardio you'll be doing. I expect quidditch to be more strenuous.

****** Resisting the G-Forces would build quite a bit of strength, but wouldn't make anyone look like they were seriously lifting. Also, Ginny only made the team in OotP, so there wouldn't be that much of an effect after ~7 months of training and a long break afterwards and there was no practice whatsoever in GoF either. (And Katie ends up in a hospital for like 4 months).

Overall, it's the same pseudo-explantation as Hermione having a great ass from walking all those stairs with her bag full of books.

No, it could make them really lean and fit though. Which is generally what's considered more attractive for girls.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
