I (and android user) love listening to fanfiction on my morning commute. I'm trying to get my friend (an iOS user) into HP fanfiction, too, but we just discovered how grating the iOS voice is.

Is there a way, on either platform, to change the voice? I've tried changing the voices in my Android settings, but it doesn't see to reflect in the FF.net app

Any recommendations are appreciated!


** Not there no, but I usually use ff2ebook.com to download the epub and then use Google Play Books to listen to it by Google's text to speech.

*** Thanks!

+Does that cost anything?

+Can that be used on iOS, too?

+Can I change the speed and voice type?

**** ff2ebook.com does not cost anything. Some TTS voices do cost something but all of Google's voices are free and frankly the best.

I am unaware if Google Play Books can be accessed on iOS honestly. It's quite unlikely too, though most ebook readers like FBReader and eReader Prestigio have TTS options. If they are not available either then I'd imagine whatever the most popular ebook reader on Apple is will have TTS.

Yeah, speed and voice type are changeable in all three of the readers I mentioned. That shouldn't be a problem.

** If your friend can, check out the alix voice.

I'm blind and use it every day with voiceover, the screen reader built into IOS.

** Just saying reasons/words I hate the voice:

Potions (uses short o - pahtions, like the O in Potter)

Dumbledore (dum ble uh dore)

Weasley (wheel-eye)

I'm sure I'm forgetting a few

Edit: add

Allll-bus.
