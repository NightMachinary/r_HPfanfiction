** Watched the video, you should put a summary here anyway, and in that context no the Philosopher's Stone isn't better than the Resurrection Stone.

The critical power that the Resurrection Stone has over the Philosopher's Stone in the context of the Deathly Hallows is that it can recall the soul's of those /already departed/. The Philosopher's Stone is only able keep someone from dying, it has no ability to return someone from death, even partially.

The reason why then, the Resurrection Stone is more fitting as a Deathly Hallow is because it brings back someone from beyond death, and thus masters that aspect of Death.
