In one of the HPF Discords, we've just been chatting about the first fanfics we ever read, and of course we've come onto talking about the weirdest smut we ever read... So of course I want to ask in here.

For me, the /first/ smut fic I ever read was this long thing with Voldemort having a daughter named Rowena, and this lass ended up fucking Walden MacNair. I still look back on the fic with a lot of amusement, just because it was completely consensual, but it was pretty realistic about the loss of virginity, as well as in MacNair being a little pudgy, having chest hair, etc. In all the years I've read fanfic, I don't think I've ever read a fic that was so realistic about a man not being a handsome, perfectly muscular individual, et cetera.

The /weirdest/ fic I ever read was one of those standard Gryffindor OC/Severus Snape fics where they just /have/ to bang in order for magic reasons. One scene involved Snape and Voldemort spit-roasting this girl (because of course the Dark Lord adores an Eiffel Tower), and then Voldemort, ever the prankster, put a mouse in her vagina. That Voldemort! What a strange sense of humour! The lass (understandably) responded with distaste, but wasn't exactly in a position to complain.

Ah, the world of Harry Potter smut... It's a strange one.

  Dumbledore, Harry and Ron sat in Dumbledore's office. "Well it seems everything's worked for the best." Dumbledore was once again eating jelly beans.

  "Yeah, everyone got shagged but me." Ron said selfishly.

  Dumbledore looked at Ron considering. "Harry, why don't you leave me and Ron alone for a minute?"

  Harry, confused, walked out of the office. He stood by the door listening and heard heavy panting.

  "Well I guess everyone has been shagged now but me."

  Snape leaned against the wall. "Potter! Come to the dungeons for detention."

  Harry smiled a little skip as he followed the potions master a little skip in his step.

  Valerie Powers, the girl who loved Headmaster Snape before he died. He loved her despite being so different from Lily. She is a spy for the Dark Lord. Warning: 'Punishment' themed. Angst, horror, action and romance. Tragic ending.

** I've read some weird shit over the years and it's all just kind of faded into the background to me.

One that stands out is one I beta'd when I was with Checkmated. The author insisted on calling the ladybits “kittie”.

I write a fair bit of sexytimes and I haven't really gotten any complaints, so I guess I'm doing all right. No spitroasts or Eiffel Towers!
