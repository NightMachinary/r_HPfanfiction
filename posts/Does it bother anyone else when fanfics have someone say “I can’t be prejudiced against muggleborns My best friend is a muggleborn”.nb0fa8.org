Disclaimer: I'm not saying the characters saying this are actually prejudiced

Idk it just really reminds me of how people say things like ‚ÄúI can't be racist, my best friend is POC‚Äù

And like, I especially can't stand it in fics where Harry uses Lily as a reason why he can't be prejudiced. It just really reminds me of how my white biological father would often use me (a dark skinned Latina) to justify how he couldn't be racist because ‚ÄúMy daughter is brown‚Äù

Is it weird that I can see this as a Tom Riddle origin story? A presumed Muggleborn in Slytherin house can't have gone down well. I imagine one way to avoid bullying (at least in the first years) is by becoming their token Muggleborn friend- this would very useful for the Purebloods in ideological debates, because if Tom is the one parroting their talking points then it's a lot harder to accuse him of being anti-Muggleborn.

**** I cannot believe this was actually upvoted. Every single time I see anyone claim that Adolf Hitler was anything less than a raving psychopath that killed on whim, tortured people without reason, poured milk before cereal, and advocated for pineapple on pizza.

It is the reason I get antsy when people call Death Eaters magical Nazis because that could not be more wrong. Tom Riddle and Adolf Hitler and nothing alike. Hitler was unnaturally charismatic. He could make even the most stubborn person fold on their lifetime beliefs with nothing more than a few honeyed words. He rekindled a nation, pulled it from a depression where most other leaders would have faltered. He lied to people, they knew he lied, and they still believed him for some reason because why not? He made people break treaties, made people do things they never would have. I mean, he even invaded a country and no one (besides that country) really cared. He made people believe his lies because he said the thing enough, even if the lie was disproven. Whether you look at this as charisma or whatever is debatable.

** I feel the version that can be justified is 'why would I believe purebloods are the best if my mother was muggleborn', as that makes him a half-blood. Otherwise, Snape's father was muggle and he grew up with a muggleborn best friend and he still was an eager Death Eater. Voldemort chose to support blood supremacy and he had a muggle father as well. Even in universe the argument is disproven.

He's a halfblood himself, and his best friend was Muggleborn. Not /a/ friend, but /best/. I always figured he didn't much care for blood supremacy but rather joined the Death Eaters as a way of gaining power and recognition, and to deal with Muggles, which he very much was prejudiced against.

It's never stated or shown that he bullied muggleborns, and when Lily asks him about what happened to Mary, it's about what his friends did to her as opposed to what he did. He didn't say that Lily was different from other muggleborns, she did. When he was trying to apologise and explain she kept stopping him from talking and putting words in his mouth.

As for Hermione, she was being a know-it-all in his first class, when he ignored her for waving her arm about. It had nothing to do with her blood, in fact she told the portrait of Phinneas Nigelus Black not to call her 'Mudblood'.

He went to Dumbledore and begged him to hide Lily and only Lily. And then when Dumbledore told him that he was disgusting, Snape told him to hide Harry and James too if he wanted.

Dumbledore said that he wanted something in exchange, and he told Snape to join the Order to help them spy on the Death Eaters. He left him no choice, it was either that or he was gonna report Snape to the Ministry. Snape didn't join the Order because "he believed in what's right üò©"

And for 20 years??? Snape didn't do shit until Harry came to Hogwarts and Dumbledore told him to spy on Quirrell. Voldemort was believed to be dead and Death Eaters had no one to turn to. He wasn't a spy until Voldemort's rise in the 4th book.

He didn't fight for the light for 20 years straight, he terrorized generations of students for 20 years just because he could.

****** The thing is that 'going through the motions to fit in' could justify Snape's actions in school, what happened afterwards discredits this. It is strongly implied that Snape is one of Voldemort's most trusted Death Eaters. He is one of the group who were invited to witness Voldemorts ressurection, even though he couldn't make it. His entire value as a spy predicates him having access to Voldemort and his decision making. In book 7 Voldemort trusted him to be the Headmaster of Hogwarts, an incredibly important and powerful position as it allowed Voldemort to effectively hold the nation's children hostage.

This is in spite of Snape being vouched for by Dumbledore at the end of the previous war as having switched sides and then spending a decade and a half working for Voldemort's nemesis. In addition, while he is skilled at potions and dark magic, Snape has no social standing that is valuable to the Death Eaters, as he grew up in the muggle world.

This suggests that Snape earned that trust by being an incredibly eager Death Eater, which would include going above and beyond when it came to hunting down and torturing to death muggleborn, rather than doing the bare minimum for appearances. Even his 'redemption' for wanting to save Lily was 'please kill her husband and child and give her for me to use'.

Also, its Voldermort who presumes he lusts after Lily, Snape never said that, he asked Dumbledore to save them all.

His redemption arc wasnt "wants to bone Lily Potter" it was "almost 20 years as a deep cover double agent, spying for the light, and ultimately helping then to win the war".

*** I never though he was racist it seemed more to me that he was interested in all the other aspects of the DE (the dark arts, friends within slytherin etc). I think that he called Lilly a mudblood not because he felt that she was inferior but just because well if you grow in an environment were the only people who accept you are racist with a single exception then well you internalize some of that. I feel like he is like a children repiting what his fathers said. Although his actions were racist, OK you know what you're absolutely right it doesn't matter if snape truly believed in blood purity or not what matters is that snape acted like a racist and that makes it as a more important example of racism than what I though.

** You are confusing your concepts.

Being a racist is something else than being a murdering madman. There were times and places where most of the population were racists: US South during the Jim Crow's times, most of the ‚Äúgood society‚Äù in UK and US before the Second World War was mildly antisemitic. It was bad, but still, it doesn't mean that blacks were mass-murdered in the South (lynching, however despicable, never made it into Holocaust size mass-murder) and I am quite sure that all those Chestertons, Churchills, Woodrow Wilsons etc. would oppose (and they did actually oppose) mass-murdering of Jews by Nazi Germany, and yet some of the things they said [[https://www.econtalk.org/thomas-leonard-on-race-eugenics-and-illiberal-reformers/][were quite horrible]].

Second thing is that you have to distinguish between racism as a state of mind, and attacking somebody because of his minority status. However bad it is despising anybody still it is not the same as actually attacking somebody. Moreover, there is no good evidence of anybody state of mind, but you can prove if somebody attacked somebody else.

So, yes, I would agree with your point if one was saying ‚ÄúI am not an antisemitic, because Kohns are my friends.‚Äù That doesn't make any sense, however many people tried to say that. However, it is something different from ‚ÄúI am not trying to kill Jews, see, my beloved mother was the one and my best friend is the one‚Äù, isn't it?

Quite apart from this really odd concept that calling anything short of holocaust racism counts as 'being confused' - there are very, very few circumstances in which it is helpful to point out that 'other people are more oppressed' - unless it's a teenager whining about not getting enough pocket money. Women complains of sexual harrassment? You're confused; women had it much worse 50 years ago. Company only employs white people? Stop complaining, people have it much worse in the States.
