** If the Ravenclaws were as adventurous as the Gryffindors.....

"Alright, let's find this 'Heir'! Team Alpha, research the legend of the chamber of secrets! Team Beta, ask around to find who wasn't at the Halloween feast! Team Gamma, research potential candidates for what the Horror inside could be! Team Delta, research genealogies and find any families claiming to be descendants of Slytherin!"

2 days later...

"Team Gamma reporting in, we interviewed the monster specialist Rubeus Hagrid, he mentioned that he was framed for opening the chamber 50 years ago, a girl called Myrtle was apparently killed. Also, roosters have been found dead and spiders are more nervous around the castle."

"Wait, Myrtle? As in the ghost of the second floor bathroom?"

1 day later...

"Team Alpha reporting in, after what Gamma found about a previous incident we interviewed Myrtle's ghost and found what appears to be an entrance to the chamber. Also, the monster has big yellow eyes and can kill. We further investigated the previous incident, Hagrid was falsely reported as perpetrator by a Tom Marvolo Riddle, although we don't yet know if that was a mistake or malicious."

"Marvolo? As in Marvolo Gaunt? From the Gaunt family of parselmouths who claimed to be the Heirs of Slytherin? We in Delta dismissed that family since it's supposed to be extinct, but if Tom's related to them he could be the Heir."

"Big yellow eyes that kill... Probably a snake... Roosters dead and spiders nervous... The monster can't possibly be a Basilisk, right? We in Gamma dismissed the King of Serpents as too dangerous to put in a school but all the evidence seems to point in that way."

"Damnit, can you in Beta speed up with figuring out who was at the feast and who wasn't? If a Basilisk is in the castle the situation is way more serious than we assumed!"

"We've been asking around subtly to avoid notifying the Heir, and we've narrowed it down to just a few students who weren't seen at the feast. None are known for hating muggleborns."

"Could the Heir be using Imperius? If he's letting loose a freaking Basilisk in the school he probably has no problem using unforgivables."

"Alright, Team Beta, find ways to investigate further. Alpha, place a trap at the suspected entrance. Gamma, research the Basilisk more and see if you can find any good counters. Delta, research this Tom Riddle more."

2 days later, Ginny found herself tied to a chair in a unused classroom full of Ravenclaws after being found unconscious in Team Alpha's trap, dosed with the Veritaserum that Team Beta had stolen from Snape's office and interrogated by Team Delta about Tom Riddle. The Roosters ordered by Team Gamma had just been delivered and the castle was full of them.

One hour later, Dumbledore was surprised by twenty Ravenclaws and one scared looking Gryffindor presenting him a part of Voldemort's soul.

**** How you achieve your goals without a plan though? And backup plans, since, you know, "any means necessary"?

***** Ravenclaws are the ones with the plans, while Slytherins are the more Ambitious ones. They would be the ones to observe and watch all the other Houses and then copy them to win.

****** I'm really confused as to how you're supposed to be ambitious without a plan. Or why being the former would preclude the latter.

******* Because a plan is not required for Ambition. Ambition is required for Ambition. Not all Ambitious people have plans, they simply want to get there at all cost with a plan or no plan.
