So, we've got Quidditch and Quodpot, Exploding Snap and Gobstones, and Wizarding Chess. That's... not really a lot of games. I was curious if anyone had created any more (or if there were any in canon that I'm missing). So, any fics with people playing or inventing magical games besides those, or any theories on what kind of games they might play? Do we think they'd play ancient games like Go, or variations of Muggle games like Solitaire and Poker? Or would they have original games of their own? Or hell, do they just prefer arena-based blood sports and tend towards putting magical creatures in fighting rings?


** I've used 'Full Contact Tiddlywinks' as a throwaway joke in a couple of fics, referring to it as a horror to be avoided:

From Inspected by No 13:

"And that," Barty Crouch Senior said with a sigh, "is the status of our current funding."

"Well," Albus said, clearly distressed by his drab garb, "this is disheartening news. Are you sure?"

"Quite sure," Barty confirmed. "We are no longer in a position to carry through with our original plans for the third task."

"Surely, it could not cost that much," Madame Olympe Maxime suggested, her usual jewelry noticeable in its absence. "It is only a maze."

"I hadn't thought so either, and then I checked Ludo's books," Crouch sighed. "The sphinx alone was going to cost us more than a thousand Galleons, she is evidently highly sought after. Getting the Ministry of Magic's Landscaping Herbologist Union involved was more than 5000 Galleons just to grow the hedgerows, and don't get me started on what the Acromantula's time is worth."

"Hagrid intended to donate some of his creatures pro bono, but without the maze..." Albus left his thought incomplete.

"None of this would have happened if the Tournament was held at Durmstrang," Karkaroff sneered.

"We wanted to hold it at Durmstrang Igor," Albus pointed out, "but you refused to tell any of us where your school is located."

"Security," the man smirked, his trademark furs exchanged for a blue and white cardigan. "Plus it guaranteed a Drumstrang victory, so also strategy."

"Yes, as diabolically clever as that plot may have been," Barty Crouch interjected, "we still need to determine what will make up the new, vastly less expensive, third task."

"How about a double elimination, one on one Quidditch Tournament?" Ludo Bagman asked.

"You're proposing a Quidditch tournament between three seekers and someone who plays keeper in the odd pickup game?" Olympe sniffed, not failing to notice that Bagman was the only member of the Committee now showing signs of impending poverty. "I think not."

"Besides," Albus said shaking his head, "That could take weeks, and we don't have that kind of time left to us."

"Well," Bagman temporized, "what about a broom race?"

"Then the race is between Krum and Potter," Albus pointed out. "As they are the only ones with professional-level brooms."

"We could supply brooms selected randomly from the Hogwarts flying class, so everyone is on the same level," the Ministry man suggested.

"I have seen those so-called brooms in use," Karkaroff snarled. "I will not risk my student on such trash. If we are to do this we will need top of the line racing brooms."

"Which returns us to the original issue," Barty sighed. "We don't have the funds."

"The third task is traditionally a kind of race," Albus noted.

"Usually, but not always," Barty agreed.

"Given the unfortunate attention of the Department of Magical Inspections, we have to make the third task spectator friendly. What if we were to build an obstacle course," the Hogwarts Headmaster stroked his beard in thought, "one over large pools of water..."

"Or mud," Karkaroff agreed.

"Or mud," Albus nodded. "The obstacle course would have features that rotated, and went up and down, and sprayed slippery liquids to make footing unsure. The Champions would have to scramble to make it through, and then we could, from a safe distance, ridicule their efforts to the audience."

"That would be popular with the audience," Bagman agreed.

"We still fall back onto to the whole how do we pay for it question," Barty pointed out. "Much of your 'obstacle course' could be conjured, of course, but much of it could not, and our budget is nonexistent."

"True," Albus conceded, deflating a bit.

"I have heard good things about Full Contact Tiddlywinks," Karkaroff suggested.

"No, just no," Olympe said, pinching the bridge of her nose. "We hosted one of those tournaments two years ago. Dozens died, and they're still scrubbing the blood off the ceiling of my dining hall. What about Gobstones?"

"The International Gobstones Federation would never allow it," Bagman objected. "Those IGF lads play rough."

*** Heh. You certainly have. I'd forgotten about that one. A true classic. Thank you for reminding me. :)

...I think Imma go reread your fics again now.

** Dueling is mentioned in canon. I picture it as a formalized sport with tournaments, national champions and all that. I want to read a fic about Flitwick earning his title of dueling champion.

*** True. I've never quite seen a fic that captured the fencing-esque/strategic catch and flip vibe that I saw dueling have, except maybe that one where Harry sets up a proper formal duel with Dumbledore to take the Elder Wand from him. That got close to the "He throws fire at me, I put up a water shield then use an air spell to blow the boiling steam back at him, which he transfigures into tear gas and blasts back at me" etc etc vibe that I think dueling would probably have.

**** If you want canon examples of how a high level duel should go, just look at the confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of OotP.

***** Indeed. That sort of back-and-forth is what I'm looking for, only in fanfiction. One scene is great and all, but it's only one scene and I want to see some fanfiction takes on it.

*** Heh. Yep. It is basically just gladiatorial combat with a PvE element attached, so the descriptor seemed appropriate. :)

** I believe linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) invents one.

Edit: I was right, but it's in chapter 107. You can probably just read that chapter without reading the rest of the story, though, and search the page for "a new sport" to skip to the section if you don't want spoilers.
