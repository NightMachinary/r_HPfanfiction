I've been starting to venture into twin fics, and whilst the premise intrigues me, all of the ones I've read seem to be angsty, with neglectful James and Lily elements. If possible, I'd like to read some twin fics where Harry and his twin are more like the weasley twins. Fun loving, rambunctious, etc. not necessarily pranksters.


** I know one that sort of has the elements you seek.

It's a collection of short stories only known as "Common sense", where the author gives a spin to certain cliches in fanfiction.

The specific chapters you are looking for are called "A father's Love" parts 1, 2 and 3. This deals with James Potter and his twin sons and how he should deal with one of them being the boy-who-lived.

The whole thing can be found here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/1/Common-Sense]]

I really recommend a full read though since every short story is pretty good by itself.

*** Eeeh. It started off well, but sure enough... after they get to Hogwarts it falls back on the same old clich√© of Harry being a lonely nobody compared to his famous brother.

***** After he goes to Durmstrang? I don't want to read a story of a different Harry Potter going to a different magical school with OC's up the wazoo, and that's what it seems to be keying towards.

****** His best friend ends up being Krum, and his other friend is the daughter of a British Death Eater family. Sure, he fleshes out the school with OC's, but it's done well; you aren't overwhelmed or inundated with it obnoxiously.

If you can't handle that, then Jesus I'd hate to be with you when you pick up any novel in the bookstore and have to put in effort to learn new characters.

******* There's a difference between wanting to read a */Harry Potter/* story and a new story.

As far as I'm concerned, if there are less actual Harry Potter characters than there are OC's, then it doesn't really qualify as a /Harry Potter/ story. I read fanfics because I like to see how people can adapt a character to a different scenario without changing them fundamentally. I read new books because I want to learn of new worlds with different people and how it all works for them. I don't read fanfics to see the author attempt to mix the two.
