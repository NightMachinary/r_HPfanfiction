When drunk, Harry can do things with magic that were previously thought impossible. Like bringing people back to life with a reparo, freeze time with aresto momentum, and invent spells that somehow work just by changing their names (like, expelliknowledgeus).

If Harry uses something like LSD, he can outright warp reality.

Different drugs give him different powers.


** I'm not good at this, so sorry for the poor writing.

Harry, drugged out of his skull, was very irritated with the typical Scotland freezing winter. "Bloody hell, it's so fucking cold, man!" He complained to Ron and Hermione as they were walking through the grounds of Hogwarts toward one of the greenhouses for their Herbology class. Well, Ron and Hermione were walking. Harry, on the other hand, was staggering along with bloodshot eyes.

"L-l-language, Harry." Hermione said, her teeth chattering.

"I wish we were in Australia. " Ron said, feeling cold like the other two. "I remember Bill once saying that their seasons are the other way around. So right now it's probably summer their."

"Great idea Ron!" Harry shouted excitedly. "I know how to solve this."

"No, Harry!" Hermione screamed as he pulled out his wand, knowing how Harry's magic was when he was under influence.

But it was too late. "Gotoaustralius!" Harry yelled waving his wand randomly around.

There was a deafening rumbling sound and the castle started to shake, its sound mixing with the screams of the castle's terrified inhabitants.

The moving of a huge magical castle along with a large lake and a vast magical forest from Scotland to Australia by a 15 years old wizard high on some muggle drug would remain one of the biggest mysteries for magical scholars worldwide for eons to come.

And although future historians would find "the great move" a mysterious event indeed, but for them the bigger mystery would be the defeat of Lord Voldemort and his large army by the Australian wildlife when they attacked the now Australian school of magic, Hogwarts, two years after the great move to kill Harry Potter.

Records show that after Australian aurors were dispatched to the area they found only some chewed upon bits and pieces of the people who had followed Lord Voldemort into the battle. Evidence shows that before even being able to get close to the school, they were attacked by many deadly mundane and magical creatures of Australia and none of the people present came out of the attack alive. The body of Lord Voldemort himself was found in the stomach of a saltwater crocodile who was very disagreeable about giving up his half-digested food.
