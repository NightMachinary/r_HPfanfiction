You can throw around as many dark curses as you want, in the end it's nothing compared to the power of money.

Maybe Voldemort succeeded in taking over magical Britain and learns the hard way that managing the economy of a country that just suffered the biggest brain drain in the history of magic is a bloody nightmare?


** I think a huge part of Harry Potter is magical power as well. Instead of just economic power, Voldemort's magical power would play a huge part in foreign relations as well. Sure, France might be laughing at the state of Britain's economy, but they won't be laughing when Voldemort threatens to personally attack their people unless they pay Britain "reparations". What is France going to do with their extra money? Hire untrained citizens to die?

*** That's one way to piss off all other countries. France might decide to pay a bit, but that won't be enough to fix Britain's economy, not after most of the highly talented non-purebloods who would have no problem getting a good job somewhere else decided that staying in a country ruled by a dark wizard isn't worth it and left. He might ask other countries for money too, but that can only go so far until the other countries decide that enough is enough and invade Britain. Voldemort is powerful but I doubt he could singlehandedly defeat all the world's best fighting wizards.

**** And if every country formed a coalition against the US, the US would be smoldering embers. Yet that will never happen. Voldemort can slowly take over one country at a time, as the rest wait around hoping he'll stop. Hitler did fine pissing off other countries without trouble and Hitler couldn't take on entire militaries by himself. And it seems like if they did, chances still would be good for Voldemort. There were massive international coalitions to hunt down Grindelwald and Grindelwald still managed fine.

Grindelwald did fine against in an unideal situation against at least 20 aurors, the elites of magical combat. Dumbledore beat him and Voldemort equaled Dumbledore. At a certain point, the number of bodies one can throw at a problem start hindering one another, not helping.

Swap the US for Russia for China for Iran for Voldemort. There are reasons as to why countries ruled by dictators remain in power.

Not to mention, you overestimate how much money is needed for Britain to function. Money is pretty much spent on food and luxury goods as well as paying for services you yourself are unable to pay for in Harry Potter. Infrastructure isn't as expensive when you can force labor or transfigure a street yourself.

Now that I think about it, I have my doubts as to how damaged Britain's economy would even be. Voldemort didn't exactly do that much damage to the ministry and he seemed seemed to do just fine paying for bounty hunters, expending resources on surveillance, prosecuting muggleborns and creating a new secure way to enter the ministry.

***** Exactly, It's one thing to pay for an army up to fighting strength. Another beast entirely, to just kill everything yourself, and save the expense.

**** Yeah, that'll be effective against an immortal who can enchant his clothing, fly, teleport, and heal himself. /s

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] is a pretty good one, not Voldemort but still relatively centered around economic power
