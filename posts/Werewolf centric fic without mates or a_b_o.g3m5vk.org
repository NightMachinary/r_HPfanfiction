I'm looking for fics where lycanthropy is actually a horrible scary thing or at least has a good/okay depiction of werewolves. where Lycanthropy is a horrible affliction and being a werewolf is not a just furry little problem. (I get that it's a way to cheer up Remus, but I can't help but feel like saying it's just bad hair day to someone with cancer and be blase about the whole ordeal. Then people bash Remus for caught up in his lifelong illness he was ostracized about.)

I don't want werewolf fic that's essentially smut, or being werewolf just means turning into a rough animalistic f@ckboy, Wolf knot d!cks or 'soulmate'. (where did it go wrong? Werewolf used to be scary)

*** alpha/beta/omega, I assume. It seems quite popular in fanfic to assign these roles to people for the purposes of smut.

***** Gamma is the third letter, but that's not the intent. Omega is the last letter, so in such stories, it represents the bottom of the pack, the lowest position. Alpha is the leader, Beta is usually the alpha's primary mate and second in charge, then normal members, then Omegas, or in some stories which are pure smut, Alpha are dominant, Beta are switch, Omega are submissive.

***** It is. Omega is the last letter and I understand the premise is omegas are "bottom".

Wait, WHAT???

Well, that was a rollercoaster of emotions for just one sentence. Now I'm even more glad I was away at uni when our dog got pregnant and gave birth.

** If you don't mind tragically short and abandoned fics A Ballad of Wolves and Serpents is a great "Harry gets bitten as a young child and raised by Lupin fic." Only 11 chapters and ends soon after Harry arrives at Hogwarts.

  At the tender age of 1, Harry Potter was cursed and survived. Five years later, he is once again cursed, and this one may have far deeper consequences. Now an outcast in the wizarding world and stripped of protection, he must learn to harness his weaknesses to become a sword and shield against the serpents in the shadows, and find new allies among the forsaken of society.

** While sadly dead, the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Were's Harry?]] has a young (pre-Hogwarts) Harry bitten by a Werewolf. However, the Werewolf curse reacts oddly with the Scarcrux, resulting in something more...
