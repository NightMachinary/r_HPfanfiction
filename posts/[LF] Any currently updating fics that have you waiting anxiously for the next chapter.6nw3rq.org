  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing.

**** It's a next gen fic. The main character Harry Lawrence (Halo) Wiggins. Starts Hogwart the same year as Albus and Rose. Lily Potter keeps having visions of the sky being on fire. She comes up with a plan to get to Hogwarts to warn her brother and cousin. Halo's involved along with a girl named Clymenstria and several other people. There's a lot more that happens. The author has a better summary of the story on their profile page. I would suggest reading that.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** I am anxiously awaiting an update to "A Father's Courage" by FatherSnape, in which a grieving Harry (post GoF) gets drunk and has sex with a muggle, only to come back to the Dursleys the following summer (post OotP) and have a baby thrust in his arms. The mother abandoned the baby on the Dursleys' doorstep and Harry refuses to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Mentor Snape. So far a gen!fic. Decently written with good characterizations. The latest chapter ended on a cliffhanger that's left me dying for the next update. Thankfully the author has been updating frequently, so I have hope that I'll soon find out whether a certain character lives or dies or... [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8798512/chapters/20171170]]

I am eagerly awaiting the next chapter to "Freedom Found In Defiance" by Sensiblytainted". It's a sequel to "Freedom Bound In Chains". So many stories cheapen abuse and rape by throwing everything they can at Harry to give him the most miserable childhood ever and then don't realistically deal with the consequences. This series stands out from the rest by sensitively and thoughtfully looking at the effects of abuse and rape. It also creates a rich wizarding world with ancient traditions. In the first story Harry and Draco are sold into child slavery. The beginning is horridly depressing and a huge wake up call to a serious problem we have in the real world. It's balanced by some good fluff once the boys find each other and escape. Now in the sequel they're finally going to Hogwarts. Slash. Dom/sub done right.

Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
