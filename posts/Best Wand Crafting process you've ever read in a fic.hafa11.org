I'm currently reading linkffn(Harry potter and the Shadow phoenix by DMC1155). And the Wand crafting method described was.. meh.

Have you ever read a fic in which the process that the author describes makes you imagine everything clearly, and it sounds plausible?

Links if possible please.


** If you are interested in the wand making you certainly have to read [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]]. Slightly too long to my taste (which fanfic isn't?), but with some truly delicious parts.

** Thank you for the glowing description of my wand crafting process. I mean... I tried, but I completely agree with you. It is my first fic, but I think I could have done slightly better, though I think my process at least sounded plausible.

**** I know, looking back on the earliest chapters makes me wince at times. I can see my improvement and am proud of it and the story. But still, I think I could probably come up with a better wandmaking process.
