Just finished watching the first movie, and one thing I've always wondered about quidditch and specifically the rules regarding the golden snitch is what happens if someone other than the seeker catches the snitch. Like what if one of the chasers was throwing a pass to his/her teammate and that player while reaching for the quaffle just so happens to catch the snitch as it goes by? Does the catch count, do they reset the game. Does the chaser get points?

** Any player other than the Seeker touching or catching the Golden Snitch is a foul known as Snitchnip, per /Quidditch Through the Ages/, page 30.\\
I would assume that if such a foul were to occur, the opposing team would be awarded a penalty shot, as described on page 27 of the same book, "The Chaser taking the penalty will fly from the central circle towards the scoring area. All players other than the opposing Keeper must keep well back while the penalty is taken"

*** My copy of QTtA must be an older print as that rule doesn't appear anywhere in my book. Would you be so kind as to direct me to the most updated version of the copy my good sir/madam?

**** This particular rule is in the 2001 edition, from the "From the Library of Hogwarts" collection, in chapter six "Changes in Quidditch Since the Fourteenth Century," under the subsection "Rules." If you can't find the reference in your copy, please let me know, I'd be happy to post a picture for you.

Edit: in the 2017 edition, the foul is described on page 57

*** The only issue with this is the Snitch's flesh memory, do they have a reset option? If so why wasn't it used on the Snitch in DH? If not, will they really use a new Snitch every time a Snitchnip occurs? Aside from the printing press in DH there's no real evidence of mass produced items in the Wizarding World, let alone obviously heavily enchanted ones.

**** I guess it depends on the prevalence and use of the Snitch's flesh memory. Is it a common magical effect that is important to the game? Assuming that gold cannot be created magically, except through exceptional means such as the Philosopher's Stone (notable for the ability to turn other metals into gold), then I would assume Snitches are regularly reused, as gold is a finite resource. In this case, then, perhaps Hogwarts uses a new one each year (if I recall correctly, the game that the Snitch in question comes from was the first game of the year).

***** According to Scrimgeour himself, snitches aren't even touched by the person who made them without gloves on. So from that it seems they are entirely crafted, and enchanted, by hand, and that the flesh memory is used as standard for quidditch use without a reset option. But I imagine the practice snitches that they make wouldn't, otherwise they'd be fairly useless. And on the topic of gold, the Geminio charm, or curse in the case of the Lestrange vault, is seemingly capable of duplicating, but not transmuting, gold for a reasonable workaround. And from what I've managed to find its permanent until countered, so maybe they use that to get around the issue.

****** That all makes sense. In that case, I would guess that they have backup Snitches on hand in the case of snitchnipping. That also works towards explaining why it would be a notable foul (QttA says there are somewhere over 700 fouls, all of which were committed in the first World Cup in the 1430s, and that the full list is not available to the public in case people “get ideas”). If the process for creating a Snitch is relatively involved, they're likely expensive, and it would be frowned upon to snitchnip

******* Makes you wonder why it's not punished even more than a single throw, it's a 150 point ball that can't be reused. Then again, Quidditch isn't the most sensible game to start with I suppose

******** And that's the kicker. Quidditch is a game for an already backwards society. The snitch wasn't even a part of the original game.

***** But isn't the snitch in DH, specifically the one in which the resurrection stone is hidden, the first snitch he ever caught? I think I remember them describing it in the book as the first snitch.

****** Right, but it responded to him because Snitches have special flesh memory where they remember the first person that ever caught them. It may have been the first snitch he caught, so it was special to Harry, but Harry was special to the snitch as the first person who ever caught it.

** I've wondered something similar - could one of the other players prevent the opposing seeker from getting the snitch by hitting it off course with a quaffle or bludger?
