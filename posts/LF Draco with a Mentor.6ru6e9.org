Hey all,

I'm in the mood for a fic with Draco reconsidering what he has been taught by his family and the pure-blood fanatic community. Or maybe he's already reconsidered but is still learning how not to be an ass to the general population which usually involves some sort of Mentor to smack him on the head when he's being a little too sarcastic. I don't mind who the mentor is, Snape, Lupin, Dumbledore, etc but the less mainstream the better: think Kingsley Shacklebolt, Tonks, a talking portrait, etc. I'd rather the mentor relationship be platonic, would prefer no slash, and I like my Draco on the sarcastic side. The longer the better!

One of my favorite stories is Discomfort and Joy by Aduro linkffn(5611653) which features a young Auror Malfoy who is partnered with Shacklebolt. Something similar would be great!

Thanks in advance!

ps. also if you know of a good story that doesn't involve a mentor and he contemplates the things he's been taught by himself - I'm up for those too!

Edit: words :/


** linkao3(A Year Like None Other) would fit your tastes I think. One of my favorite fic, definitely

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

***** The third one is called A Family Like None Other and you can read it via Skyhawk (Google it and it should come up), but I don't think it's been updated in a couple years. I don't like it as much as I like the others, though if you like the series I still recommend it. The series is one of my favorite Harry/Snape mentor pieces and one of the few whose Draco I like.

****** How far is that sequel? Because at that point, I'd just like a closure. One of my favorite story, and it always felt kind of disgruntling to not have any end

******* It's been awhile since I read it- I think it's in January or February. Unfortunately there's not much closure as far as the story goes.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I kind of hesitated with this one, since it's long since been abandoned, but [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][Mirror of Maybe]] is really good. The Draco-mentorship isn't the main focus, but it's a large part of it.\\
Personally, I'm wondering if someone didn't try to rewrite it. I came across a fic...might have been through here...that starts out almost word for word on the intro, but eventually goes elsewhere after the first few paragraphs.
