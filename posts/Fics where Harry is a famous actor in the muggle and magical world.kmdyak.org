** There was a fic where a wizard recognizes 4 year old Harry in a muggle supermarket, and gets Vernon to agree to put Harry in wizarding advertisements. They both make insane amounts of money with the Dursley's moving into a huge mansion. Harry is kept in his own room in a separate wing of the house away from the Dursleys, is still neglected

He has is homeschooled with tutors, gets a mean wizarding tutor I think. Aurors eventually shut everything down, the wizard flees with his half of the gold, goblins send Vernon and petunia to debtors prison and I think dudley goes to live with his aunt. Harry is adopted by a wizarding family.

It's been a few years
