Then I remember that it's my story, so the only way I'll see the next chapter is to finish writing it.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom. linkffn(3766574). Greatest AU ever written.

Seven chapters into the seventh and last book, and the author just disappears from the planet. This story, and a few other outstanding authors that have finishing issues, are why I refuse to read a story that isn't complete, with almost no exceptions.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** For the last three fanfics mentioned, I developed an unwanted obsession predicting all the possible ways of how each story ended.

Luna/Rolf fanfic! Post-DH By Kreeblim Sabs Title: Spectacular Adventures linkffn(12309529) This writer might still be updating! It is currently unfinished.

The fanfics below are only recommended for Harry/Ginny shippers pre-HBP: By holden107 Title: Backfire URL: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/holden107/backfire.html]] This Ginny fears she might become the next dark lord. There's talk of prominent families in relation to politics and power. Self-labeled Good Slytherins. A multitude of more than one-dimensional characters. The only dislike I have is that the author gives a lot of depth to her OC's, but then makes Hermione and Ron into static, shallow characters. There is some serious Hermione bashing.

By Casca Title: Seeking Ginny (Original Incomplete Version) URL: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/casca/SG.html]] I've seen reactions of indifference or praise over Casca's completed version. I'm on the praise to the point of reverence side for both versions.

By deadwoodpecker Title: Yellow Submarine linkffn(4464089) The beginning is whacked. I really would've appreciated one more chapter to see how it all unfolds.

By Serendipity Title: That Muted Sort of Longing URL: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=16]] It's been a very long time since I've read this. I don't remember much apart from checking for updates monthly over a span of like...five years. It became a rote routine.
