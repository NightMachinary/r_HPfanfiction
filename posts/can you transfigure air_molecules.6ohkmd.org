ok think about this logically, imagine a muggleborn with a knowledge of science comes to hogwarts. they hear about transfiguration and wonder 'can i transfigure the air molecules into something else' imagine the possibilities. transfiguring millions of air particles into bullets and needles to banish at another wizard/witch. If anyone has a fanfiction recommendation that has this concept in it i wanna read it.


** For a good indication of whether you can do something or not with magic (in canon!) you should always consult [[/u/taure]]'s [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][Headcanon]].\\
It's the best study of canon-magic and its limitations that I know of, and it has basically all examples from the book where we learn something about magic listed.

About your question: I don't think there is anything that says it's /impossble/, however:

#+begin_quote
  Relative factors affecting the difficulty of a transfiguration are those factors which concern the relative similarity of the two objects. The more similar the objects, the easier the transfiguration (subject to absolute factors). Relative factors include: relative size, relative shape, relative appearance and texture, and even similarities in name
#+end_quote

Transfiguration becomes easier if things are similar in shape, material, size, name, ... - and air, being a compressible gas is quite dissimilar to bullets. Air molecules are tiny compared to bullets. Weapons are used to hurt people, air usually isn't. They are basically apart in every sense.

There is also the fact that 'Protego' blocks solid objects, so yeah. If the blocking of such object is easier than the creation than it's rather... useless.

Anyways, besides that we also know that you can conjure things out of thin air - however, these objects don't last. Doesn't really matter for weapons though. And other drawback is that conjuration is supposedly hard.

I do not know of any fic where individual molecules are transfigured.

**** We are not talking about bullets being fired from a gun. We are talking about transfiguring them from air.

And then I'll just throw an expelliarmus at you while you do your bullet-rain-dance.

***** Either summons or teleports nearby water into a stream. Power requirement increases as a function of the distance to the water. If source is not liquid (only nearby water that is not part of something (e.g. you)), pulls water vapor out of air, (water must be condensed) or from ice and snow (which needs to be melted) - which takes more energy.

Spell fails if you can't supply enough energy to get water (like if you cast it deep in space).

I prefer this formulation because I prefer to understand Transfiguration as being inherently impermanent (Transfiguration consumes the magic used up to perform it, reverts when it runs out).

And IIRC there is at least one point in canon where someone drinks Aguamenti-water.

I then interpret Gamp's Laws as being "Don't do this" instead of "This is physically impossible" (the wording in canon is "can't", which lends to either interpretation. (So you don't transfigure wood into food, as random molecules in your body turning to wood will kill you).

****** Well, that's okay for your headcanon I guess, but keep in mind that this is not canon because of the books and - even more directly - word of god. JKR literally said that she considers transfiguration permanent.

Harry for example uses a refill-spell for something drinkable.

** I can't remember which story, but I once read a fic in which there was a battle tactic of transfiguring the air in someone's lungs into methane or something else unbreathable. Or maybe something explosive? I can't remember.

*** At that point, you might as well transfigure a bit of the blood in their brain into fat, which is much easier, and is instant lethal stroke.

Or transfigure the air into a chemical weapon, then Finite it afterward to avoid poisoning the land.

Or, my personal favorite, transfiguring antimatter from a very great distance.

** I would think to the backwards people of magic this would be considered conjuration. You cant really create something from nothing so i would think it would be transfiguration of the air/water that around you. To the wizirding world it would be "look what i have created" but to Muggleborn, they would maybe experement.
