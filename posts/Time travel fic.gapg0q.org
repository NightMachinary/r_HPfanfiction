:END:
I don't remember anything about it except that someone went back in time, i think Harry? And somehow Cedric didn't die (but that's not super important to the story) and Luna talked to Cedric and said something like of Harry didn't do this you would have died Sorry that's not a lot to go off of but it's been driving me crazy for day's trying to find it again


** I just read that story a few months ago. But I don't remember which one it was. I'll try to find it.

*** Was it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10504085/1/Toast-to-Tomorrow][/Toast to Tomorrow/]]? That's the only one I know of that has Cedric and Harry at odds, because Amos went and got himself killed fighting death eaters at the Quidditch World Cup, and that had a drastic effect on Cedric's personality. It's the reason Cho doesn't join Harry's secret study group that time around.

**** It's not Toast to Tomorrow. And Cedric and Harry were not at odds. Luna just explains to Cedric that he was supposed to die, but whatever Harry did changed it and so he did not die.

** Did Harry have siblings in it? Did Amos die instead of Cedric? What was Hermione's role in the story?

*** I'm kinda nervous now. I heard the author went back and rewrote it and edited it, so it should be a better quality now. Though I'm dubious on that. There were some interesting points in there, but some parts felt a bit eh.

Edit:

[[/u/obscuredolphin][u/obscuredolphin]] don't let that discouraged you, however. It's been years since I first read it, so my memory could be off.
