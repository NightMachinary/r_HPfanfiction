If a witch is an animagus, can their animal form be a male and vice versa?

James was a male deer, a stag, but could there have been the possibility of him being a doe, a female deer? (for an example, not actually asking)


** It's a magical animal so if you want to be a female doe instead of a stag then go be a doe, what's stopping you? Animagi are supposed to be reflections of you soul, personality. So if that most closely resembles an animal of a different sex/gender to you I don't see why it wouldn't be that? What's stopping it from being that?

Though I am not remotely close to being an expert on or even having an opinion on gender so I honestly couldn't tell you. But I figure, animagus's are a magical idea so exploit it to do the thing that most fits you üòä.

** We don't know of many cases in which a person both is an animagus and can cast a patronus, but in those cases, the animagus form and patronus form match. Snape's patronus is a doe. That suggests that if he were an animagus, his form would be a doe.

*** That's a good point. Thank you. You're the first person (I've posted this on other places too) to actually say that it's a possibility and not give me a flat out "no".

**** Who the heck is giving you a flat-out definitive answer about any aspect of a fantasy world? (At least any aspect that hasn't already been set in canon.) That's just silly.

*** I mean there's nothing to suggest causation between patronus and animagus. Iirc in canon an animagus' patronus will be their animagus form, but that doesn't mean that the inverse has to be true.

**** Yeah, canon says nothing about this, so we're free to interpret it however we want.

** Animagus should show the substance of a person, so it should follow gender of the person as well. Of course, all transgender business may get in the way, but otherwise I think the gender of animagus should be just same as gender of the person.

*** Animals don't have gender like people do. And what would it even mean to have the same gender as, say, a seahorse (which would suck as an animagus form, but whatever)? Male seahorses are the ones that give birth.

Edited to add: And what if your animagus form was a clownfish? You'd start out male when you were young, and then if you were the dominant male in your group, you'd change to a female if the female leader of your group died.

**** And what if you are animagus which has clearly defined gender (e.g., cat)? Yes, we all know that animagus Flobberworm is unfortunate situation (or something similar if animagi are limited just to non-magical animals), but they are certainly not the rule.

***** Cats have sexes. Gender is cultural, so only animals with cultures (which generally means humans) can have gender.

The sexes of other animals don't necessarily correspond to human genders anyway. What if you like wearing bright colors and dancing? In my culture, these things are considered female these days. If you were a bird animagus, for most species of birds, you'd be a male bird.

******* I recommend that you look up the definition of the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù before you embarrass yourself further. It's not a synonym for biological sex.
