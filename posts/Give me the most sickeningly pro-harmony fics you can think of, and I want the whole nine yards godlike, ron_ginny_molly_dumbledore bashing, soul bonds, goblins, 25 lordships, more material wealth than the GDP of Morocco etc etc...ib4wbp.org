I understand I'll probably get some hate for asking for this, but I genuinely like the pairing, and want to see the really exaggerated fics. I'd appreciate if they are complete, and the longer the better.

Cheers.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
