I really love Ron and hermione they are my favorite characters. So I want some good fics to show just how badass they are. I like them as a couple but that's not really necessary. Minimal Harry I would like it to focus mainly on Ron and Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** If you're up for post canon, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4749314/chapters/10856321][Australia]] is set immediately after DH and is one of my favorite Harry Potter fanfics ever.

Here's the summary: “While grieving the loss of his brother and trying to figure out life after the war, Ron and Hermione go on a journey to Australia to find Hermione's parents.”

More a romance than badass thing, but have been reading stuff like that to improve my crappy romance subplots and characterization and premise are good

  “Once upon a time there once was an idiot who was desperately in love with his best friend, but he never acted on the feelings that he had for her because he was a f***in' insecure coward. Then, one day when he least expected her to do so, she kissed him! She kissed him and he was bloody over the moon about it, he had never felt happier than he did in that moment. And then, she died.”Nobody said a word.
