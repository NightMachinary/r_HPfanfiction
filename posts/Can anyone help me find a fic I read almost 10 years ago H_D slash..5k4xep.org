I am looking for a fic I read in back in high school. It was so well written and I'd like to find it again as I'm feeling nostalgic and haven't been able to find it since. Description: Harry/Draco slash, pretty long, post-war, at Hogwarts. Plot, as much as I can remember: Harry comes back to Hogwarts to teach (I think?) and finds Draco and Neville working there as professors. They have all matured. A reluctant romance develops between Harry and Draco.

That's all I can remember. I know it's not very specific but if anyone remembers it I'd be quite happy.


** Could it possibly be The Shadow of His Wings by Mirabella? That one was quite good and had a Harry/Draco teaching at Hogwarts, although it's been forever since I read it so I can't remember if Neville was there too.

The website that it was hosted on is long gone, but wayback machine was able to find the fic, if you wanted to give it a peek. [[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204045909/http://theguestroom.houseofhobbits.com/hp/sohw_prologue.html][The Shadow of his Wings]]

Remember that it IS unfinished and short of a Christmas miracle will remain unfinished. Mirabella reappeared a few years back and started to archive her fics on Dreamwidth but then abruptly disappeared again, which makes me worry something may have happened.

*** No, that one was definitely finished. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll probably check it out.

** I recently tripped upon a pretty big bookmark list of HP/DM fic over on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks?bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=99&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&page=1&utf8=%E2%9C%93][Ao3]] that includes non-AO3 fics. Quite a number of HP/DM stuff I read ages ago is on there, so maybe what you're looking for is on there?

I agree with the other poster that The Shadow of His Wings could be it... but I wouldn't characterize the romance between Harry and Draco as reluctant. Draco is under some sort of curse from his father to produce an heir, so as much as he's enjoying their relationship, he will break up with Harry at some point, which Harry knows and hates.

The Shadow of His Wings is one of a very few fics I would pay money to see completed. Mirabella was such a good writer.

** I'm on mobile so I don't have a link for you, but possibly Transfigurations by resonant8? Privately hosted so not bot linkable.

CORRECTION: Found on AO3, backdated to 2003. linkao3(Transfigurations by Resonant). Even if it's not the fic you're looking for, it's a classic and highly recommended.

*** I don't think Neville is a professor in that one but I could be wrong. Good fic though but I thought the changes from canon were a little jarring. It was written before the end of the series though so it's clear why it's like that.

** I'm not sure if Neville is in this but another fic where they are professors is *All Life is Yours to Miss*. You can try that one as well.

Edit to add: Looks like it was published just a few years ago so it's definitely not it. It's a pretty good story though!
