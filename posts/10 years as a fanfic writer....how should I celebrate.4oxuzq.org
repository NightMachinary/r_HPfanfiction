Hi weird and wonderful fanfic lovers. I am sorry I don't post too often; my real job overtakes my obsession with HP and fanfic :/

This year, I am celebrating ten years as a fanfic writer. It's been a huge decade. I started in my early teens and am now in my early twenties. I wrote total shit (whether I still do is debatable!), did every cliche thing under the sun, and have emerged many years later feeling like I have surrounded myself in great literature (it's either that or I wasted many years of my life...).

So how should I celebrate? A shot of Firewhiskey? Knit myself a jumper? Get a hand-me-down Weasley watch? I am open to hilarious and inappropriate suggestions.

Also, how long has everyone else's tenure been? :)

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.

** Drink all the alcohol in sight and commiserate with yourself.

But really, congrats! A decade's a long time. For me, I think I'm about seven years in thus far, having started with the worst of the worst fanfic at age 12.

The best thing we can celebrate is always the extent of our improvement.
