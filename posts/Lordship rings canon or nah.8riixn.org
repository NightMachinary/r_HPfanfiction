I recently got back into the fandom after visiting Wizarding World in Osaka (I know I sound like a bandwagonner huhu) and've been reading lots of fanfiction as of late. One common theme I encounter is Harry/Sirius putting on the Potter/Black "lordship rings" in order to gain access to the Potter/Black Gringotts vaults. Can someone tell me if this is canon or not? I tried googling it but only got LoTRxHP fics as search results lmao; but also, there's a Black family ring Sirius threw out in OoP. Are these the same rings in fanfics??


** Short answer: No, not at all.

Long answer: All the "Lords and Ladys" stuff seems to have come about as a combination of a couple of things:

1. The name Sirius uses "The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" as well as the general high-minded and aristocratic setup that the Blacks seem to have believed they were a part of.
2. There is no aristocracy (apparently) in the wizarding world, at least in Britain. However, Malfoy and possibly some other purebloods behave in an elitist snobbish manner that is often a part of very class-oriented societies.

Some fics try to rationalize the classism depicted in the HP series. "Sure they are jerks and thugs, but it has some basis in truth, they are part of the 'nobility' and have 'special privileges.'"

A LOT of fics really use this as a way of shortcutting Harry (or occasionally others) to new wealth/power/status/personality (these fics also disproportionately seem to include the shopping trip and manipulative Dumbledore tropes as well).

And other fics do is a straight up mockery of the anachronistic nature of the wizarding world, which is fair when you think about it.

If you want examples of these, just ask for any of them: there are FAR TOO MANY of these fics as it is.

** It's absolutely not, since there are no such thing as Lordships in canon. The Lordship Rings are based on the Black family ring, sure, but the Blacks' "noble and most ancient" nonsense and pretentions of nobility are just that: pretentions. They're a family of rich wackos who /pretend/ they're an aristocracy /even though Wizarding Britain is an elected democracy that doesn't have a nobility/. Thus, "Lordship Rings" with actual political value make no sense.

  The Minister for Magic is democratically elected, although there have been times of crisis in which the post has simply been offered to an individual without a public vote (Albus Dumbledore was made such an offer, and turned it down repeatedly).
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic]]

And the same thing was basically already stated in books, though less directly.

#+begin_quote
  Occasionally, a Potter made it all the way to London, and a member of the family has twice sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter, who was a member from 1612-1652, and who was a great supporter of the Statute of Secrecy (as opposed to declaring war on the Muggles, as more militant members wished to do) and Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), who was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913-1921.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-potter-family]]

So we can see that Wizengamot seats aren't inherited.

***** Yeah that's the other thing in those fics!! Harry gets all these lordships and then he suddenly has like 8 seats in the Wizengamot b/c he inherited them. Thank you for clearing that up!

***** There is no democratical election in the books. It would have been a big deal, there would have been different parties, an election campaign visible in the newspapers (yes, plural, because each party would make sure they'd have a sympathetic newspaper) youth outreach programs etc. (demos = the people in a state btw.).

Given that was not the case, it is far more likely that the Wizengamot works like the House of Lords that then elects a Minister of Magic (aristocracy).

****** The election of Fudge was before the books started, and Scrimgeour was almost certainly "times of crisis" case. Thus there were no elections we could see. Also, I question if actual parties would exist in society this small.

***** The election would be true for the post of Minister, but the Minister is a separate office of the Wizengamot as I understand it. Granted, I don't remember (probably because it wasn't there) any mention in canon of Lords or Ladies being a part of it. But because it isn't explicitly stated, it allows for some creative license.

**** One of the Malfoys courted Queen Elizabeth I according to Pottermore. That means that he was nobility. And I really don't think that the Malfoys simply abandoned their titles after the SoS went into effect - nor that the wizards suddenly abolished all nobility in 1692.

******* Nobility doesn't really exist without a monarchy. The wizarding world doesn't have any monarchs, so it's not gonna have any nobility either. They can't be part of a class to which they cannot claim nor exercise the privileges of. Anyway, I was just parroting Pottermore so I think this is pretty open-shut.

  Until the imposition of the Statute of Secrecy in 1692, the Malfoy family was active within high-born Muggle circles, and it is said that their fervent opposition to the imposition of the Statute was due, in part, to the fact that they would have to withdraw from this enjoyable sphere of social life.

  passed into law the Malfoys ceased fraternising with Muggles, however well-born, and accepted that further opposition and protests could only distance them from the new heart of power: the newly created Ministry of Magic

******** Nobility works without royalty. There were several German states without a king which were led by an aristocrat. The Roman Republic had an aristocracy despite not having a king either. Also, modern Germany still has nobles even though they haven't had a king or Emperor for 100 years now. The point is that they had nobles, and those nobles don't disappear that easily.
