I'm aware Thanfiction apparently is a bit... out there. And possibly a cult leader, among other things. I'm not interested in starting a debate about this guy.

I still remember enjoying their works before they were taken down. It wasn't phenomenal writing, but it was entertaining.

So far, I've been able to locate downloads for the main three fics of the DAYDverse. There were though many one-shots and/or side stories written to go along with the story, and I haven't been able to find any surviving copies. If anyone has any, please share!
