All I can remember about it is Bill sets wards around the burrow that turn it into a tomb and because of this the wards are super nasty, attacking and killing death eaters. Dumbledore and Bill have to remove the sarcophagus before the Aurors arrive and the burrow is eventually destroyed. Thats all I can remember sorry.


** That's my story "Divided and Entwined". Though technically, the sarcophagus was placed there to turn it into a tomb, so the nastiest conditional curses of the old Egyptians could be used to turn it into a trap.

*** Well I'm an idiot, I just read the latest chapter and completely forgot the details of earlier chapters. I know the general gist of the story but because I just read the chapters as they come out I usually forget the small details. Really love the fic btw and your other stories too.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
