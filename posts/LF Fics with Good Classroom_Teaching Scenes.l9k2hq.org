I don't mind whether it's muggle or magical, proper class-style or one-to-one apprentice teaching, I'm not bothered whether the topic is practical magic or muggle academics, and I don't mind who the teacher is. I'm also indifferent to whatever the rest of the fic is about - I'm just looking for teaching and/or classroom scenes.

O-o¬O-o_O-o-O

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** A few oneshots spring to mind that I thought were really good.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042771]]) - Remus teaching Susan about a boggart

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125]]) - Remus calibrating the Boggart for a class.

linkao3(Of A Linear Circle) has some really epic class scenes with fantastic character development and story and mystery but its a small part of a much bigger plot. Excellent fic though. (I spent the last 10 minutes trying to find the excellent fight scene in the RoR during defence classes but ive no idea where it is... story is too big =P)

linkao3(All the Young Dudes) also has some great class scenes even if theyre not the focus. Most of the story takes place in Hogwarts same as the HP series. This story has some of the best character development ive ever seen. It is a pairing story but its not smutty or sticky romantic. Sirius and Remus are way too stubborn and.. i dont know the word, troubled? Theyre really quite rough characters its great to see them grow and mature in what they learn and who they are. There isnt any smut for you to skip.

​

If you want more info on any just ask =)

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

*** No questions, just thanks for a bunch of good recommendations and an observation that your first rec didn't get put in the bot list.

But yes, thank you! I've only read All the Young Dudes on your list, but I have read some other stuff by The Divine Comedian, so I think I'll like the first two as well. :)

If you wanna search a fic for a specific thing, you can do so through google and the the URL (just include the fic ID and not any chapter identification). Put any terms you're sure of in Speech marks and any you aren't outside them. eg.

DADA "Requirement" site:[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494]]

I do think you've got the wrong fic for that though - I scanned through and they don't mention the Room of Requirement or 'RoR' once in any chapter.

** Well, my fic has teaching/classroom scenes but... I can't say whether or not they're good since it's my fic. But I definitely have scenes! You can find them in chapters 4, 5, 7, 10, 11 (sort of), 13, and 14.

Also the whole premise of the fic is that Tom Riddle becomes the DADA teacher, so... yeah. School. Rated T so nothing beyond that level.

** linkffn(13677583)

It is admittedly not the main focus of the fic, but Elune's Pebble has some at least decent teaching scenes. Harry learns a new style of magic, all the students learn elemental spells in a way I haven't seen done before, and a DA where the D is /not/ Dumbledore.

There's a few adult scenes, (two so far in 202,000 words) read it on [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com]] if you want them in context, FFN has them editited out, and on Ao3 I'm in the process of moving them to a separate fic. No real plot/character development occurs during the smut. (Just the reveal that one character has submissive tendencies and another likes to be in charge.)

The pairing is Harry/Hermione/?. (No spoilers!)

I actually made the mistake of dumping most of the back story into chapter 5, but I tried to make it interesting, the story as told by the drakes from their perspective.
