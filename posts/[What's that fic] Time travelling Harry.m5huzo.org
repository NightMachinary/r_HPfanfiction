Hello everyone, this is my first post here so formatting issues may happen.

I'm looking for a fic (i think fanfiction.net) where young Harry (1st or 2nd year) goes back in time to Tom riddle's time but i can't remember how. Dumbledore and the headmaster know that Harry has time traveled and are working getting him back. Harry is a horcrux (but doesn't know it) and therefore trusts tom riddle (same for Tom- like a little brother). Harry is told not to tell anyone that he time traveled but he tells tom riddle because he trusts him.

Thanks a lot

first year harry trips over as he enters hogwarts and magic takes him back to tom riddle's first(?) year.

maybe? i've never read it but i always see it in my searches. it's on AO3 though, so it might not be the one you're looking for.

either way, i hope you find the one you're looking for!!
