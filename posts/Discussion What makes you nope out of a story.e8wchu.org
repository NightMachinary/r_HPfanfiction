It can be spelling, a way the character acts, a pairing, the way they do the plot, rehash stories with very little change, or a variety.

What makes you say no to a story?

I've pretty much made it my mission to say no to a story that mentions Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing, those get so old, and are pretty much the same, with very little changes to

it, that they're not fun like they used to be (for a guilty pleasure story).

Rehashes also tend to get rather old, even there's new stuff added to it, but that just depends.

So yeah, I tend to say no to those, personally. It's fine if you like them, not hating on what someone else likes, those just don't interest me anymore.

So, what about you? What makes you nope out of a story?


** A wall of text like serious you couldn't have space everything out a bit into manageable 1to4 sentence paragraphs?

This is me being finicky but if the title and summary don't have a single capitalize letter it just elludes to the fact that your story will irk me with horribly terrible grammar and spelling problems

Harems, like max I will go is a threesome and only if it's written well anymore than that is just the fact that you need to tell everyone that your MC has a big dick then it gets repetitive with the story only going along as the MC acquires more people into the harem

If the tags can't fit on my screen you have a problem I understand putting the relationships and stuff but honestly if there aren't super relevant to the story you can leave it out and same with people who tag literal sentences just why?

Stories where everyone is bashed like I'm good if you need to bash a few people for plot sake but if you bash over half the character then the story gets boring and repetitive

***** I think the Hadrian/ Lordships thing is generally a sign of a fic from a certain era. Would not nope out just because of it, but I'm very careful with fics from before mid 2007, the publication of the last book in Canon. They tend to include a lot of heavy revenge on Snape by Harry etc.

They became very popular around 2005ish from what I've seen, until about 2013.

My problem with them is they are mostly edgelord fics written by teenagers, so the standard of writing is shit. There are some decent Lord fics around, but mostly the ones where they don't make Harry a Lord himself, for example Delenda Est by Lord Silvere is a good fic in my opinion, because it takes a lot of the tropes from that era and inverts them, so it has time travel, but it focuses on Bellatrix Black, not Tom Riddle or the Marauders, it has Lordships, but Harry is just a normal teacher at Hogwarts with no title . The sequel to it is just powerwanking crap though.

** Over powered Gringotts. Why can goblins put seven drops of blood on a piece of parchment and tell you every little thing about you. Name, Parents, Titles, Assets, Magical abilities, Animagus forms, Magic effecting you(compelling charms, blocks, love potions, loyalty potions, hate potions.) It's a cop out to give everybody everything and it takes away the discovery in the story. It would be so much better if the characters don't learn they each have three animagus forms until they spend months practicing. If you wanna get Harry off the potions then send him away for the summer with Sirius sonhe can't be fed them and watch as he slowly doubts his relationships with people. Removing a block on his magic, have him struggle on something he really shouldn't and the block be discovered or better yet put him in a dangerous position and forcefully destroy it. Have him slowly search through his history amd meet people with information or find ancient lost artifacts to make him the heir to a hundred houses. Finds the sword and becomes the heir of Gryffindor, gathers the hallows and becomes heir Peverell. Sirius' will shows he is heir Black, his great grandfathers portrait teaches him all about his family history and what it means to be a Potter.

An stupid Gringotts means all the characters are just given everything and all struggles are removed because HaRrY iSnT HaViNg HiS mAGiC bLoCKeD. Now he can do everything.

** When the author has overused the thesaurus. Badly. Eyes are eyes, not orbs or optics (yes, I read an otherwise good story that as far as I can tell, used find and replace to all instances of "eyes" with "optics"). People breathe, they don't respirate, or respire.

This often goes hand-in-hand with making sentences extra long and convoluted for some reason. Not every utrerance and term that you set down on the page is required to be an ostentatious lexeme. It is often tiresome and befuddling for many a reader who would be otherwise sympathetic to your tale.

Also, homonyms. One or two slips are fine (like "pour over a book" instead of "pore over"), if it continuously mixes up past/passed, or peak/peek (pique gets a pass, it's trickier) or something like that shows up frequently, my brain gets twitchy.

** English isn't my first language so usually I'm pretty lenient on spelling. One thing that does bother me is long paragraphs. You know, when the author just forgets to start a new paragraph and creates a wall of text. It makes reading more difficult because the lines sometimes start blurring.

Story- wise: Pairing the good guys with Death Eater scum makes me nope out pretty quickly. Draco and Snape are somewhat redeemable, I suppose. With *lots* of work. And this work needs to be done by the author, mind you, to convince their readers. Far too many stories just have canon Draco and Snape without even an attempt at redeeming them. But Bellatrix and Voldemort in any sort of romantical or sexual situation? No thanks.

Romance and/ or sex can be pretty boring when the story is centered around them. There is plenty of smut and cheesy romance novels out there. I read Harry Potter for the cool, out of this world stuff like magic, battles, flying, magical creatures, etc. Romance and sex can be boring compared to that since most people can and do experience them in their day to day lives. And the worst thing someone can do is write about boring day to day stuff. I want the interesting stuff that I can't experience- space flight, combat, aliens, wizards, lasers, wands, etc. Compared to that romance is just- meh.

Oh, evil Harry is a big no-no for me as well. Dark is okay if it's done well and he still fights Death Eaters and Voldemort.

I'm also not a huge fan of stories about the kids from the epilogue. Partly because I don't want to acknowledge the epilogue, but mostly because I can't be arsed to remember all their stupid names. I probably would remember them if they were somewhat original but all the kids are named after already existing characters and it can get confusing real quick.

I dropped Harry Potter's Discovery at chapter 3 or 4. The grammar I could put up with, but the whole Will thing just got under my skin.
- Poor Bashing. If you're going to bash a character, at least make it believable. Pick a direction and stay with it.
- Dumbledore setting. Greater Good Dumbledore is only believable for me if he is senile or crazy. Evil Dumbledore is entertaining in its own way, but his reasoning for being that way has to be shown. Canon Dumbledore is boring to me unless you add some flavoring to it. Dumbledore didn't know about the Dursely abuse? Snape was drugging him or Figg. Canon Dumbledore is boring as hell and makes him looks incompetent or downright not caring of the crap he piled up on Harry. Don't even get me started with Book 6/7 and the 2.7 thousand chances evil people get, but Harry is going Dark if he doesn't eat his vegetables.

I hate stories where Harry and or Hermione(Ron is not in the list because he rarely has this trope written about him. The only one i read was where fate intervined and made Hermione and Harry get together for a small amount of time so that he would get hurt andleave to train for the power. It was a fun read as you could see the characters really hating themselves for cheating on Ron, and how the story actually resolves.) become God level powerful for no reason at all. I mean come on who likes to read a story where the main protagonist doesnt face any challenge or growth at all?

Lordship fics are also a no for me because of these reasons. Suddenly Harry is Lord Potter and Black and owns half the magical community.

Dramione - Most of these fics have Weasley bashing in order for the 2 of them to get together. I mean seriously everything Draco did is ok as he didnt identify them once, and everything Ron did is bad because he left the group because he was under the influence of the horcrux. Nope cant agree to that.

Harmione - I just dont like this pairing. Somwhow it never feels right. Though it might be my bias based on their characters.

Super hidden pedigree(Tom riddle is related to slytherin), Throw money around make problems go away (Lucius Malfoy), im Lord such-and-such therefore respect me (any rich pureblood), Power is everything and I know obscure magic, im curb stomping everyone(Tom riddle), becomes extremely prejudiced about something.

Gringott and Goblins solve all his problems by thowing money or being nice to them(I mean sure Brits arent Canadians but I swear they are the most polite if not sarcasticly so that ive met)

Harry gets new powers with no particular purpose just to add on the fact he gets special powers.

Harems because he can and the girls end up as minions to do his bidding, with no characterization or anything just Harry is so Awesome so we decided to share and help whatever plan he has making little comment to show we are part of the planning.

No self consistency.

The story heading to one direction and goes elsewhere. (looking at you partial kissed heroes, I like the fae and stuff so I pushed through but you just have to time travel to 'save Harrys parents' and mess around.)

More importantly Wife Husbandry or raising someone who end ups with them because they are not blood related so its fine to raise or help raise someone to be the ideal lover. (this killed a lot of time travel Harry, Harry raises TMR or Harry is raised by someone for me)

Most of that stuff makes me burn inside, if there is no guarantee of a fix to the situation or an improvement soon by means of an author's note or a chapter comment, I tend to quit the fic for a while or forever to “cool off.” I have issues with emotions such as intense jealousy or fury and find reading things that evoke them in me to be hazardous to my health and well-being.

** I just noped out of two stories that I saw rec'd on this site today.

1) linkffn(13191902) A fic called: Crushing News. I was really wanting a short best friends turn to lovers fic, with all sorts of tension, but had to Nope this one due to the writing style. Grammar and punctuation were all good. Words were used correctly. But it was written like a Downtown Abby episode, and I just couldn't take it. Harry called himself a "flagrant recidivist" at one point (he's a teenager in the nineties). Other people might like this sort of thing though?

And at least there was dialogue unlike this second Noper:

2) linkffn(13318951) This one is called the Archeologist, by Racke. The idea was so unique and I really wanted to like it. But it's just not really a story, and once I realized it, I had to Nope it. It's the very epitome of "Telling" not "Showing". I wasn't drawn in at all. I don't think there was a single instant of dialogue. The author clearly has a lot of potential (clear by the fact that they wrote so many words, put together a unique plot, and once again the grammar and spelling were great).

But here is my question: Do you normally review fics that you've Noped? I try to review anything that gets me past the first chapter. These two didn't, but the authors have potential. I want to encourage the authors, but it can be difficult to offer constructive criticism (especially on the second one, where I wanted to write something like: "This is a lovely idea, but you didn't write a story, you wrote an outline for a story. Please try again because I would love to actually read this story.") because I think it can easily be construed as flames--or hurt someone's feelings--or worst of all, make them want to stop writing altogether.

Anyone non-Slytherin and Draco. He's an ineffectual, cowardly, bigot. I can't see anyone on the anti-Voldemort side giving him the time of day. There's no sign he's learned anything by the end of the series. I've never seen anyone write a convincing redemption arc.

Anyone with anyone old enough to be their parent. At least not until the youngest party is at least 30.

Pureblood culture - there's no sign of it in canon and outside of canon all you get is a lot of weird etiquette, the sort that's famous the world over as a method of keeping out the plebs while not actually providing any positive benefit. Besides, everybody who writes it just copies off everyone else - Heir Longbottom anyone? Weird how pureblood culture never seems to include pureblood Mozart or Shakespeare.

Weird sex - A/B/O, Littles, pedophile relationships, soul marks, harems.

Anyone and Snape - he's spent over a decade obsessing over a dead woman. There isn't room for a real relationship, espectially not with a boy litterally young enough to be his son.

bad English: bad spelling, grammar, punctuation, whatever or at least English at a lower level than mine (what I don't know is a mistake can't bother me XD). It works also for other languages, but there just aren't enough fics for me to read in my mother's language - so English it is...

Consistency: keep your plot in check, don't let it contradict itself, don't change the history mid-story. I'm binge-reading. I'll know.

Bad English - I'll be gone in a chapter at most. Many inconsistentancies - I won't bother finishing it.

** I've come across a few fics whose authors were so lazy, half the story was a literal word for word rewrite of the books. Like they only bothered to write a few 'filler' scenes in most chapters. It was as annoying as it was insulting.

Mostly my gripes are when the characters, canon or oc, are so cookie-cutter basic and asinine that it's as though written by a twelve year old. This sadly seems to happen more then it should. I get that its fanfiction and fun and all, but it makes seeking out quality fics a chore sometimes.

** Bad writing, of course.

Lord and Lady whoever, especially if their last name is something really very non-noble like Potter or Smith. I'm sorry, I just can't see it.

Any fic where little 11 year old Slytherins act like 37 year old politicians instead of 11 year olds. I don't care how ambitious they are, they're still little kids.

This one is rather niche - any fic where Hermione and Draco accidentally bond over their mutual fondness for Jane Austen. I'm sorry, I just don't see it. I don't see Draco being a secret fan of Muggle fiction, and honestly? I don't think Hermione reads that much fiction either, even if she could somehow find the time in between redoing her homework, knitting SPEW hats, studying, cramming, haring off on adventures with the boys, nagging at the boys to study, reading ahead in the curriculum, and worrying about her test results. If she DOES have any extra time in the day for reading she probably spends it on catching up on useful subjects Hogwarts doesn't seem to teach, like advanced mathematics. If Hermione read fiction she probably would've caught on to Beedle the Bard a bit faster, because she would've read that instead of Hogwarts, a History for the zillionth time. I know /we/ all like fiction, and everybody loves the obvious connection between Dramione and Pride and Prejudice, but it just doesn't work.

Any fic where Snape is paired with one of his students. He is literally old enough to be all of their fathers. And he's their teacher for 7 years. I don't care if they are all consenting adults, I don't like it.

People calling Hermione 'Mione. I don't nope out just for that, but it makes me very wary.

MPreg. If you don't have a uterus or ovaries, no amount of buttsex can make you pregnant. (It's okay if they DO have the requisite parts.)

Soulmates, magical cores, the vast majority of crossovers.

Any story where it turns out that there's no objection to Hermione dating the bigoted pureblood of her choice because actually their parents are very nice and anyway she was always secretly a pureblood.

I think that's doable, I read one fic that did it really well, it's just that too often turning Draco into a sympathetic character = Draco in leather trousers, have him be some kind of creature, make Harry his mate/Hermione crap.

The fic that did it really well, think it was a one or twoshot, long forgot it's name, where Draco had a squib sister who was sent into the muggle world by his mother to save her from LM, Harry meets her and gets her pregnant while he's at the Dursleys for a summer, and Draco helps Harry raise his nephew (not slash). Obviously its totally OOC, but it has to be to make Draco not a scumbag, but its credible OOC because his upbringing is totally changed by the knowledge of a sister in the muggle world.

** 2 annoying things for me are, 1, when everyone is obsessed with Harry and basically worship him, like omg you're the best quidditch player ever and the strongest wizard ever and you have the biggest dick ever, like take it easy, I get it Harry is incredible, the endless rambling just makes me want to stop reading.

2, when authors write stupid meta shit, like Harry's thinking and he's like wow wouldn't it be crazy if they wrote a book about this and how would anyone believe all the amazing things I've done? And they keep beating that point dead summarizing books and past/future events

** Things that are extremely unrealistic are the biggest reason I stop a fic. Now before someone says it's a world about wizards that's not realistic, I mean unrealistic in the world that they exist.

I was reading a fic the other day where 10yr old Harry was more independent than a 20yr old. I just wish the author had said I'm aging up my characters rather than have 10yr olds acting like their full-grown adults. To me that's unrealistic it ruins the story for me because it doesn't fit the situation presented. I'm sure it was a good fic, and I'm sure plenty of people liked it, but things like that ruin it for me. Other small things that break the rules of magic, "The Weasleys just magic'd themselves some galleons and weren't poor anymore." also are a nope for me.

I'm fine with character bashings(I'm all in on the bash train), I'm fine with harems, I'm fine with blood adoption and soul contracts, lordships, etc. as long as it logically fits the narrative presented and is cohesive.

Also certain pairings, Harry/Ginny and Draco/Hermione are stories I'll never even begin to read.

** -when they make Hernione a main character or just make her seem like a mary sue. She's not my favorite but seriously I'm tired of seeing her portrayed as being so perfect. I blame the movies for that one

- plots like soul mates/ marriage law/ getting married to stop the war/ I'm kinda iffy on time travel because they're usually alike

- Harry with a different name and/or living with the Malfoys

- OCs

** First person perspective. Keep trying to get over it but just can't.

Any time that Snape is made out to be a misunderstood angel. He's a bullying ass with severe issues, and people make him out to be this paragon of good. Oh and anything that pairs Snape with anyone as the main plot point - cause it's usually Harry or Hermione.

Goblins can solve all your problems as long as you say “please/may you skull fuck your enemies while making a shit ton of gold” or some similar garbage.

This is one that sometimes I can get past if the fic is short and the premise is good - all the characters talk the same way. They all have the same cadence to their lines, to the point where if the name isn't mentioned it's hard to tell who's talking.
