Thousand thanks to anyone who can point me to this specific fic... It's a post-war forced marriage type fic with the premise that a person from each side of the war needs to get married. Initially it's Ginny that has to marry some death eater. Toward the top of the story Narcissa meets with Harry to suggest Harry marry Draco instead. Then it centers on Harry / Draco preparing for the wedding, spending a lot of time in Grimmauld Place...

EDIT: Some more specific (and disjointed) scenes/details I remember... When Draco visits Harry's home for the first time, Molly Weasley answers the door as a mother/matriarch figure for Harry. Traditionally Draco has to greet Harry within a certain time frame but he gets sidetracked by some old lady so Harry sends Hermione over to distract the old lady. Harry then pulls Draco into another room (library?) to see if Draco is truly willing to go through with the marriage. Another time, Harry/Draco are discussing flower arrangements for the wedding and Draco volunteers to take care of it, even though it would be traditionally decided by Harry's family.

Thanks!


** [[/r/HPSlashFic/]] is probably your best bet for help
