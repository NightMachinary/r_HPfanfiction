** Hmm...there's no real point-of-divergence in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/3/Almost-a-Squib][Almost A Squib]], it's basically just comedy snippets of how a Harry with almost no magic would go through the canon plot of the books.

It does technically have Harry and Hermione going back in time even further to ensure Lupin ends up getting his potion (and fakes not having taken it), though.

  Not much would make an Azkaban escape become second page news among the Wizards of the United Kingdom, but the freeing of the Monsters under Mount Ebott would do it. And thus Frisk becomes one of Hogwart's newest, first year, students...
