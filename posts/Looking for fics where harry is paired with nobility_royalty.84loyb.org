*** Doubtful, seeing as she is not an actual royalty.

Unless you're speaking about Elsa from Frozen.

** There's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Princess/Princess/][Princess by Jeconais]] which is pretty cute but also unfinished.

If you're familiar with Jeconais, you'll know what to expect but just in case: Be aware that this is very cute and lovey dovey, there isn't much conflict and Harry is a Mary Sue. That said, Jeconais knows how to write this kind of stuff and I go back every time I want to read something fluffy.

  (Based on whitetigerwolf's 'Tamaran Contract' challenge) Harry doesn't know it, but his grandmother wasn't human. He also doesn't know that he has a marriage contract to the deposed princess of another world. But secrets will be exposed, and Harry will gain new allies, and new powers in the fight against Voldemort. But will it be enough?
