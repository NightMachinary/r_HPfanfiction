I'm 20 something person trying to make sense of the world these days so what do I do? I go back and reread some cozy Harry Potter fanfic that I love.

But it's GONE!

I swear I've reread it sometime in the last few years. I'm so devastated. It was beautifully written and the story/character development was just /chef kiss/

It was called “Even the Stars Can Be Moved” and it was written by Vasilisa23 over on ff. It had 35 chapters so it was definitely up there in terms of reviews.

Does anybody happen know what happened to it? Or has anybody read this one too? This thing was written in around 2010 or something like that.

The only thing I've found is [[https://wheretheworldscollide.tumblr.com/post/123255411656/my-tomione-fic-rec-list][my own old tumblr post recommending the fic]]


** I just google searched it and was able to find the first 12 chapters on this site: [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/vasilisa/ETSCBM.html]]
