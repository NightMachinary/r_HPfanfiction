Been trying to find a story that I read ages ago and never finished! Don't remember it fully, but Ginny was Slytherin, and with Malfoy (although not entirely willingly I think). Harry was put in an alternate dimension.

Things I do remember about it: 1. coming back from Hogsmeade harry had a duel with Malfoy. 2. James Potter, Lucius, Harry and Malfoy had some conversation regarding it at a Hogwarts board meeting. 3. Harry and Ginny had a brief talk up in the astronomy tower

Any help would be greatly appreciated

#+begin_quote
  The war in his world is over: Harry Potter, tired of fighting, uses a spell that will take him to a new world, where his parents, and friends are alive, but where he died as a baby. Is this new start too good to be true?
