** The question, I suppose, is whether it's good enough to be worth reading all of that.

If you do want a really really long fic to read, I can recommend With This Ring, which is also over 3 million words, and updates daily (I don't know how the author does it). It's a Young Justice fanfic, but where canon has a five year time skip between seasons one and two, this story is covering the whole thing in detail.

*** Im not saying that it's the best fic ever, but it's ok. I kinda just read it when I don't have anything else to read.

** It may well be. The longest on FF.Net is 3.3 million: "Harry Potter - After the Epilogue" by PotterFanSteve.

Though that author also has another fic at 1.3 million words.

** I think the longest HP fanfic is /When Hermione Fights --/ over 4 million words and it seems to have been completed a few weeks ago. It's a German fanfic, but it's currently being translated into English. You couldn't pay me to read it though.
