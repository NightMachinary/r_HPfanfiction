Since Harry is not a boy anymore when he saves the wizarding world from Lord Voldemort, the title of Boy-Who-Lived is no longer applicable. Now this would mean that Harry gets a new hyphenated title post war (why hyphenated? Because wizards). So what would the a good title for a post war Harry? Man-Who-Lived? Man-Who-Conquered? Guy-Who-Yeets-Wands? Perhaps something else?

** Actually it would still apply. The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice since he survived a second Killing curse.

So how about The-Boy-Who-Lived-Twice-and-The-Man-Who-Saved-Us-All.

Depends on where you grew up. 17 is usually not considered a man until 21. However with that said. The combo title can work.
