** Oh?? I have something close?

Swung By Serafim by Flamethrower is a story where Harry loses all memory and in the process of getting it back, becomes less stupid. The detail into magic and prejudices are brilliant. They redeem the Slytherin house along with all the other stupid plot holes in the books. Snape actually has justifications for his actions as opposed to bring a dickhead for no reason.

I don't remember exactly how it ends. I don't think Harry is headmaster but he certainly plays a big role in school teaching a life after the fact. It's amazing how they restructure the school to make it an actual realistic, decent place to teach kids ðŸ˜Š.
