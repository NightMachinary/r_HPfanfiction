Hi all.

I'd to try out fics that has Harry (1) absorb the horcrux and/or (2) interact, work and learn from the horcrux.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Cheers.

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

** Can't go past this, and it's sequel, for all that the sequel is incomplete. They're still well worth the read.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better.

  It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  There are more similarities between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle than most people think. The voice in Harry's head only confirms that. A more competent Harry with Voldemort in his head comes to Hogwarts. Smart!Harry, Riddlesque!Harry, NoBashing!, NoSlash!

Imaginary Fiend by Jaygwen23

Not complete but updates regularly.

Harry's Horcrux appears as a sort of imaginary friend that only he can see and interact with.

*** Ohhhh, I already love the idea. I was recently playing "Tales from the Borderlands" where only the protagonist sees an AI (a replica of a sadistic and narcissistic (charming yet very deadly) head of a big corporation who can control his mechanic parts or even him sometimes) with his electronic eye.

So, I was playing it and I thought "I want a HP fic like this".

Hopefully, my wish has just been fulfilled. Thank you.
