Let's try this again. I accidentally deleted my post while I was checking on mobile. I'm bad at Reddit, apparently.

I'm looking for a specific fic where Harry and Ron are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They get tricked into working for magical MI6. Hermionie was working directly for Minister Shacklebolt, and was considered to be the future of the Wizarding World. There was an assassination attempt on Hermione at some sort of conference, possibly in Germany.

Harry was very reckless and cavalier in dangerous situations. I really enjoyed this characterization of him, and I want to use it as a basis for my next DnD character.


** Oh geez, I really, really, really wish I knew the name of this fic. Commenting sorely for the notifications.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
