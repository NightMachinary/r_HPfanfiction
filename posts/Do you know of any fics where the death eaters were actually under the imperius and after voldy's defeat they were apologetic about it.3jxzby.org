I always thought it was interesting that the death eaters (like Malfoy) claimed to be under the imperius curse buy never acted apologetic about it (raising his child to become a death eater.) It would be neat to read a story about them actually seeing some repercussions and actually making an effort at making reparations.

 

I haven't read a whole lot of fics /yet/, but if you know any good ones about redeeming the death eaters, do share. :)


** I'm now laughing at the idea that every single Death Eater and synpathiser was actually under Voldemort's imperius. Just one huge web of mind control with Voldemort at the centre.

It's even possible within the HP magic system: we know from the Malfoy-Rosmerta-Katie situation that it's possible to chain the imperius (i.e. have an imperius victim cast the imperius on another).

And you can totally see Voldemort putting everyone under the imperius, even his faithful followers, just to have that extra level of control and security.

Would really up his "Dark Lord" potential. That's Sauron-level shit.

And would also be a convenient way for Death Eaters to claim imperius if caught. The're not even lying. It just so happens they would have been following Voldemort anyway.

*** What a way to sow division in society but I don't think it would work in cannon. Barty crouch junior and senior managed to become sort of immune or resistant to the imperius after prolonged exposure to the curse.

** I've seen the idea that they were put on the imperius, just to be able to truthfully answering that they had been imperiused, but not usually with actual remorse added in.

** It's canon that Harry is completely immune to the imperius or at least very close. I imagine that resistance training to it was a serious thing because the unforgivable's didn't achieve that status until 1717.

The curse fades in potency very fast if the intent isn't behind it and I doubt that chaining the spell would carry the intent forward well.
