I remember reading this fic a couple of years ago on [[https://Fanfiction.Net][Fanfiction.Net]], have not been able to find it at all since. It was either a oneshot or a twoshot I think.

Basically Draco has a squib sister, who was hidden in the muggle world by Narcissa to prevent Lucius killing her, who Harry meets during the summer before the 7th year, and begins a relationship with and gets pregnant, she dies during childbirth, Draco finds out and is actually not terrible about the kid (not a slash fic) and acts relatively decently for him


** No sorry but lots of Buffy crossovers have this as a premise, you might like some of them
