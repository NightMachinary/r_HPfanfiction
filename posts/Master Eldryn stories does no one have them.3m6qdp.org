** If you read [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=821][this forum thread on DLP (I'm not a DLPer)]] you find out that the writer you're asking about basically fell off the face of the earth but not before cursing anyone who ever tried to read any of stories ever again. The thread also contains a list of his works and their descriptions. If you so choose to find these fics, just google search some of the story names from the thread. Do it at your own peril, and consider whether or not you should respect the author's wishes. Personally, I won't, but you can make your own decisions. Hopefully Master Eldryn isn't standing right behind me about to exact revenge for giving you some pointers...
