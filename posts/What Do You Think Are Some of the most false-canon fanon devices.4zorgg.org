Like notice-me-nots (to be fair, I myself didn't know until this year that wasn't a canon thing) and patroni being impossible to duplicate (thus allowing anyone who claims to be someone automatically being accepted as legit), what do you think has been spread so far through fanfiction the line between it being canon and fanon have blurred to near indecipherability?

** The effect of the polyjuice potion lasting exactly one hour. It is canon that, depending on the skill of the brewer, it can last from a few minutes to many hours. It's noteworthy because so many people wonder nowadays---and make weird-arse justifications for it---how Junior could have gone through a day without anyone noticing if the potion he had to take needed to be taken every hour and he slept for more.

Also, the pepperup potion being something akin to an energy drink that provides energy, rather than a cure for common cold with the side-effect of making the one drinking it feel warmer for a few hours (which it is in canon).

Which ... well, I will not argue against whatever people have to say on that issue (because I am not addressing that), but the whole thing had started with fanon perception of the duration that this potion works and I am speaking about that.

Also, it having a variable time of effect can serve to enhance some stories as it can make for an interesting problem or solution to one, which is why I though it good to note it. In general I think that potions as an enabling or disabling plot device are terribly underused (and let me say that I adore what Steelbadger with them in “The Shadow of Angmar”).

** There is a very common fanon misconception that Dumbledore kept Harry incommunicado in the Summer in OotP, and, in particular, that he ordered Ron and Hermione not to write to him, and they complied. This feeds not one but /three/ types of bashing: Manipulative!Dumbledore, AuthorityWorshipping!Hermione, and FairWeatherFriend!Ron.

What he actually did do was to ask them --- as well as Sirius and others who wrote to Harry during that period --- not to discuss Order and Order-related business. This, naturally, frustrated Harry to no end.

One can debate the merits of Dumbledore's decision, but given what he knew at the time, it was probably one of the less bad options, since Harry had Ministry looking for excuses to expel him from Hogwarts and even imprison him, as well as a magical and spiritual link of unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive.

She is good at regurgitating facts and following procedure, but lacks creativity. She is a hard worker rather than an outright genius. I think we all knew people like that in highschool. As for fighting skills, during the DA she beats Ron most of the time in the duels, but later Harry notices Ron and Hermione winning about 50% of the time each.

#+end_quote

The novelty of her idea is the implementation, not the mere use of the Protean Charm. The purpose of the charm is to link objects, not to link objects /to secretly communicate meeting times through what looks like a serial number/.

I suppose that Rowling never shows the reader the process by which Hermione came up with this idea. So we don't have direct textual evidence than Hermione didn't find a book in the library titled /Spy Spells and Cryptographic Magic/ which explains in detail how the Protean Charm can be used with fake galleons to communicate via serial numbers. But such a book would be entirely fanon.

Yes. This is what creative problem solving looks like: taking knowledge you have in one context and applying it in a new way to solve an entirely different problem.

But if you want to communicate magically, the first thought will be to link objects together magically (the oft-used fanon linked parchments), and the Protean Charm is the obvious piece of magic for that. The only innovation is the choice of a coin rather than, say, a parchment. Which isn't really magical creativity so much as tactical thinking.

The fact of the narrative is, Hermione was the one who came up with the solution. If her solution were the obvious first thought anyone would have, then why didn't other members of the DA also come up with it? The Protean Charm is taught in the upper years at Hogwarts, so at least some of the DA would already know about it and how it works.

#+begin_quote
  Which isn't really magical creativity so much as tactical thinking.
#+end_quote

As I said, her creativity was in the implementation. I don't think that Hermione's creativity here was in using new or obscure spells (though it must be noted, the Protean Charm is at least somewhat obscure for 5th year students at Hogwarts since it isn't taught until NEWT level). Indeed, it seems pretty clear that while she is intellectually creative, she isn't magically creative. Hermione is portrayed in canon as knowing more spells than Ron and Harry, but she's never portrayed as inventing her own spells or anything like that.

Anyway, regardless of whether we think her solution employed actual creativity, the narrative presents it that way:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. [...]

  [Hermione explained her solution.]

  A blank silence greeted Hermione's words. She looked around at all the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted.

  "Well---I thought it was a good idea," she said uncertainly, "I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there's nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But... well, if you don't want to use them..."

  "You can do a Protean Charm?" said Terry Boot. [...] "But that's... that's N.E.W.T standard, that is," he said weakly. [...] "How come you're not in Ravenclaw?" he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. "With brains like yours?" (/Order of the Phoenix/, pages 398--399)
#+end_quote

The reader is clearly supposed to think that Hermione is smart and clever for this idea. Some of this, as witnessed by Boot's dialogue, is because of her casting a spell above her grade level. Beyond that, the narrative explicitly calls her solution "very clever" ("clever" having connotations of being resourceful or creative, and not merely smart). It seems that Rowling's intention was to have Hermione come up with a creative solution and if it in fact isn't creative, it's because Rowling bungled.

#+begin_quote
  Except in this case it's entirely the same problem and largely the same solution.
#+end_quote

Oh of course. I forgot that scene at the end of GoF where Voldemort touches Pettigrew's Dark Mark and makes "6pm, 30 June, Riddle Mansion" appear beneath the skull so that the Death Eaters will know when/where to meet. I also forgot that Voldemort wanted plausible deniability for his Death Eaters if they were ever caught, which is why he gave them innocuous items like coins rather than marking them with a tattoo. *rolls eyes*

No, that would probably not be the first thought for most people. Most people --- especially those used to sending and receiving letters by courier or owl or maybe a Patronus --- would think of the problem in terms of sending a letter securely, and they would attempt to emulate the process of dispatching and receiving a message.

Enchanting one object to mirror changes to properties of another and using it to communicate is, in fact, a creative solution.

****** Hmm ... I don't remember right now, it was one of the discussions about the renaming of the spell to “Rennervate” and while there were some sources it was quite a long time ago. Still, even with the renaming, it is a charm that only counters the stunner (or at least originally did so) so there are some funny interactions between those two.

Honestly though, the original point was that this spell proves that wizards are capable of having spells with a simple effect. While I do not disagree with this particular notion, and indeed the notion it has been set to counter (that a wizard would encase themselves in a block of ice to keep themselves cool) is a bit unbelievable in itself, I believe the issue to be not one of simplicity versus complexity but rather one of minute precision versus lack of it: most spells we see in canon are mostly incapable of producing sustained and precise, toned down, effects; this is why the stunning spell, which is all about power and not at all about precision, does not actually count as a valid counter-point to that particular issue (though it does counter the silliness that is blocks of ice, yes, but I do not believe that one even needs a counter).

But honestly, that explanation is about as convincing and realistic as "computers and smartphones went out of fashion. People went back to abacuses." Fashion rarely manages to overcome convenience and efficiency - and fire loses out on all fronts.

Plus using fire to warm yourself instead of magic seems a muggle thing.

**** My headcanon is that a practical warming charm is actually harder than it looks:

1. If one wants to be able to do other things while being warmed, one must be able to maintain it without constant attention like Disillusionment, as opposed to, say, Levitation.
2. The Charm must "know", without constant attention from the caster, to warm just the right area by just the right amount, with the area being as complex and constantly changing as the space between one's clothes and one's skin, and the amount being not too hot and not too cold, under constantly changing external environment, and different for different parts of the body.

***** You could apply that "it's actually harder than it looks" to many, many spells, especially charms. I'd say "It's easy - the charm simply targets the body, and keeps it at a nice warm temperature as if it was 20 degrees outside. Clothes don't matter."
