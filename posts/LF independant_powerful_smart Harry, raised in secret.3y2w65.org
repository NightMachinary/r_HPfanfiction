  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

#+begin_quote
  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

**** Fuck. I just read it all

It was amazing.

The humor was sharp and on point,\\
while the writing was effective and concise

The line amount totally not doing mafia stuff was great. Especially if read in Sterling Archer's voice.

5/7 would read again

**** If for some reason you haven't read it, the same applies to Denarian Renegade by Shezza. I don't know anything about Dresden Files but the books were easy to follow and are fantastic, to be honest I like them even more than A Fallen God.
