** I would totally love to see a fic with this premise, maybe not with them being best buds, but with the mutual understanding that /both/ of them wouldn't lose her lol

I dunno, now I'm sorta picturing Snape in Sirius' place as best buddy... It would be a stretch, but less of a leap than some things

**** I could see this. Lots of people have that quiet sarcastic acerbic friend. I could see Snape serving that role.

** I saw this a while ago... It might work as a funny one-shot, but anything beyond that...

I hate to go all SJW on people, but /come on!/ You basically have two men decide that a certain woman's "love" (in scare-quotes, because the more accurate word is NSFW) belongs to them, so they will, without her knowledge or permission, use deception and violence hurt anyone who presumes to ask her out on a date, serving to isolate that woman until she goes with one of them?

*** It's as romantic as sneaking into a girl's bedroom and staring at her while she sleeps!

*** I've seen fics in other fandoms that are scarily close to this. Usually it involves the batshit crazy overprotective brother, father, friend/surrogate brother, etc...
