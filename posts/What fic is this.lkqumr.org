I'm looking for a fic where the Slytherin common room and dorms flood due to whatever reason and... I remember that Blaise's younger sibling was in it and the younger students had to be carry out. Idr the pairing, could've been drarry not sure.


** I don't know the fic you're talking about (and this should be tagged "What's that fic?" if you're looking for a specific one) but it's very easy to flood the Slytherin dorms, what with that huge window into the lake right there in their common room.
