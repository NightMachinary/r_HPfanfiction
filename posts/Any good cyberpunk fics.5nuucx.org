Decker!Harry, perhaps? Or just any fics set in a cyberpunk-ish Shadowrun-like world.

I've read both The Star Empire and linkffn(Culture Shock) (which is /really/ good, I recommend it wholeheartedly), which both have some cyberpunk elements, but they aren't really... cyberpunk. Just sci-fi at best.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** Hmm, the closest I know to that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12066162/3/Braindump-Ideas-un-edited-unfiltered-and-available-for-anyone-to-use][my own drivel]].

The only thing I found is linkffn(Enter the Dragon by Doghead Thirteen). Though I don't even know if it's good. Its a Shadowrun crossover with a endorsement by Tsu Doh Nimh (who wrote a continuation it seems).

Anyway, that's the best I have right now.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

** I have no idea what Decker is (do you mean Dexter? I'd love to read about a Dexter!Harry, or a Jimmy Neutron!Harry for that matter), but the description makes me think of linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist), and its sequel, linkffn(Madness at the Gate) (sadly the next sequel is IMHO too much of a time skip).

*** "Decker" in cyberpunk slang usually means "hacker" - often the sort of hacker that might be extensively augmented, mentally linking into "the grid" itself when hacking.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race.
