*** There are plenty of good reasons to hate Lupin, from him abandoning his pregnant wife and his general "victim attitude" where he lets the lycanthropy define him instead of trying to live his life, up to him never caring enough about Harry to even write a fucking letter and yet playing "best friend" when it came to giving Harry the responsibility for Teddy.

He nearly kills/infects Harry, Ron and Hermione in PoA, gives Harry a lecture where he says that his parents would be ashamed but then doesn't mention Sirius animagus ability or that he knew the secret passages. Harry even laments that Lupin didn't write after the DoM battle.

Honestly, I am surprised that he isn't bashed more because there is a lot more to work with than for example with Ginny.

**** What really gets me is when he's written as the mature responsible one in comparison to Sirius. I have no strong feelings about Lupin either way but one of his most defining traits is abandoning his responsibilities and being generally spineless. Sirius escaped Azkaban for Harry and proved that he would move heaven and earth for him while Remus didn't bother checking up on him even once in 13 years, and the only reason he got to know Harry in third year is because Dumbledore asked him to be the DADA teacher.

Yeah I totally don't get that either. He has a very serious disease and just forgets to take his potion or lock himself safely away. He seems pretty irresponsible... he just talks a big game.

***** Mostly agree, but did Lupin even know where Harry was before Hogwarts? I mean, Dumbledore didn't check up on Harry either, so I was under the impression that aside from the Ministry, McGonagall and Hagrid, he never told anyone where Harry lived until later.

****** Right, fine, but what about his silence between /actually meeting Harry/ and then confessing he knew his parents?

What about the silence during year four, when Harry is very publically risking death?

'Oh hey, you got me, I guess I was a friend of your dad's.... hey, people know I'm a werewolf because I didn't take my meds (because I procrastinate it every time) and now gotta go... no, not gonna write, that would be hard!'

**** He's just about my least favourite character. The most cowardly Gryffindor. I mean, even Pettigrew went out and /did something/ even if it was evil and self-serving. Lupin just... mopes.

**** Not only that! This coward never visited Harry once (hell, he probably never asked Dumbledore how he is doing! He was busy hiding from the world, despite the fact that he could probably have worked in the muggle world (as long as he is "ill" during the full moon!) and made a decent living that way!), not even after 3rd year (where he ran away...damned! Fucking coward stay and fight! If they throw you out? Ok, but at least you didn't run like a kicked puppy dog! No wounder your inner wolf tries to hurt you! It is probably trying to bully you into standing up for yourself!)!

This guy doesn't deserve Tonks IMHO! In fact nobody IMHO deserves to be saddled with this guy and his baggage (the man needs therapy, badly! Or someone to beat some sense into him (verbally...though physically might work, too!))

** I really wish I could remember the story I read with this on ffn. Basically Lupin was characterized as a “time sink”; one of those people who focuses in on a person and kind of hogs the time and attention. Not necessarily romantic but in an attention seeking sort of way. Hope that makes sense.

Anyway it was in the time when the Marauders were still attending school and he did this sort of taking up time & attention thing to Lily. It had original characters too but that's all I remember. I really like it because it was a great example of how Remus could be very flawed and still interesting.

** linkffn(Spheres of Influence) He got Neutered/Castrated as a werewolf.

linkffn(Faery Heroes) Harry gives Tonks a "The Reason He Sucks Speech" about Lupin.

linkffn(11779002) Invincible; Harry is mad at Lupin for his complete lack of contact during the Triwizard Tournament.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

** It's a Harry/Tonks, but no actual bashing is involved. It's slow, believable, and doesn't detract from lupin's faults, and everything else. i'd say while it isn't bashing, the faults of lupin are pointed out(multiple times), and there is bashing, but deserved bashing.

Edit: Sorry, I had no sleep the night before, and was pretty busy when I posted this.
