Some new stories on the whole pagan theme would be awesome, definitely in the mood for this sort of fic... But I remember reading one a while ago that involved a darker version of the world, and one scene in particular of a novice/learning Harry being 'overtaken' by a thunderstorm with the DL going out to find him laying naked outside once the weather had stopped (in a non-crack sort of way!). Fairly sure this was also the one that had the DL teaching him various rituals and playing as Harry's guide, and may also have had the pair visiting werewolves during some sort of celebratory full moon. I remember odd scenes but I can't for the life of me think of the possible title. Most likely was a mature fic but I can't be sure! Bit specific but if anyone can find it I'd be very grateful.

*** You're fantastic! Thank you, I've had the odd scene from this in my head for a long time so I'm glad to have found it again.

******* I don't mind at all! I tend to alternate between 'easy reading' stories and more complex ones, so will definitely pop these on my list (when I eventually get enough time - I love long fics but they can take a while to get through around work). Huge thanks again, great to know others that like similar stories :)
