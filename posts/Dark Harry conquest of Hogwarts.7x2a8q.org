I am looking for a fanfiction for a long time. It was horror/Crime genre. One shot.

Plot - Harry comes to Hogwarts after conquering it. He speaks to Dumbledore. He showcases various deeds he did. How he stole many magical objects. Like each founders object is great in its own way. I forgot what power each gets. I know that Helga's Cup has the power to give the the drinker the magical properties till its eliminated by body. A fountain of youth if u will. Etc. Harry explains how he created a new race with house elf and dementors. I forgot rest of the story. Read this a long time ago.

It was taken down from fanfiction.net. I forgot its name too. If anyone has any idea. Please help

  What would have happened if Merlin had never been healed magically after the Dorocha attack? I find it a little convenient that Lancelot manages to set Merlin down by a river where some kind of spirit (Villia) is able to emerge in a bubble and heal him. So, I wrote what might have happened if Merlin had never been healed by magic at all. Warning: Angst may ensue.
