So, I'm looking for good fics that involve music in the narrative somehow. Harry could be in a band (a la Have Chrome Will Travel and that fic on Fanfictionauthors that I forget where Harry performs on stage) or he could be a bard that casts magic with music as in Bard of Hogwarts and Birth of Bardic Magic. Either work. Music just has to be present in the narrative somehow.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

** i havent read all of it, but in Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance, nocturnes are mentioned allot, its been a while so i've forgotten if their important to the plot somehow, but from what i remember, it involved conducting magic through one's wand to make notes and was seen as a sign of mastery or something

** I'm pretty sure linkffn(vox corporis repost) has songs that you should listen to while reading it, at certain moments they fit perfectly with the storyline

Edit: the list is at the end

  I DO NOT OWN THIS STORY. This story was removed due to some reasons and its one of my favourite stories. So i thought i should share with everyone. One chapter a day Reposted. Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

*** Huh. I don't actually know if scoring a fic counts for my own prompt or not. I have read Vox Corporis though and it was great, so I think it might be time for a reread. Thanks for the rec. :)

*** A Harry-Snape romance where they bond over Classical Music is certainly not an idea I've seen before. Thanks for the rec!
