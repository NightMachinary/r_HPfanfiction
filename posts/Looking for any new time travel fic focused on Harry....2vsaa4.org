I'm a time traveler junkie. I just love the trope. Any time travel fic that's Harry centric and is new (maybe written in 2014-2015) would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any dimension travel fic, that would be great as well. If you have any classic time travel or dimension travel fic that you just love, I'd like to hear it just in case I haven't read it yet.

Thank you!

** I love this story, it so deep and engrossing, and there are actually three parts I believe, but the first is my absolute favorite. It is the first fanfic to draw me in as completely as the original books did.

Its been complete for a while, so you might have read it, but I thought I'd mention it just in case! :)

*** I've read both and I didn't like Temporal Bacon, it was too convoluted and complicated for it's own good.

The World Without Me is great, a solid story with good characterization and plot development, 4/5!
