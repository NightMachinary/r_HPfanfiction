I've been trying to find stories where Harry has multiple lovers. Which there's plenty of Harry is with Daphne Greengrass, and Hermione, and Ginny. But I can't find any where Harry has both male and female partners, I don't care who he is with. Please no crossover if the other fandom is important to understanding the fanfiction. If anyone has read something like this I'd love to read it too. Please help!
