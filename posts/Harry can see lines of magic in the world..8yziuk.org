There was a fic I read a while ago where Harry could see these lines of magic in the world and interact with them to manipulate stuff, such as destroying structures by throwing things at them. I think it was explained as he could see the end of everything or something, and Luna had the opposite power, to see the beginning. It really interested me and I would like to read it again if anyone knows it.


** This one?

  Death. It's all around us. It's the natural answer to Life. The End. Anything that has a beginning, has an End. Harry Potter can see the End. And through his new sight, not only will Tommy be beaten...but Harry will finally Live. it's a friggn AU.
