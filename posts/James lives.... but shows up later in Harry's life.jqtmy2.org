So reading i won't just survive (no you will see me thrive) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/EclipseWing/pseuds/EclipseWing][EclipseWing]] and it has James waking up in a muggle hospital 14 years later and him assuming a different name and working his way back into the wizarding world and Harrys life. I freaking love this idea. Does anyone know any others?? Can be Lily as well.

Now I prefer slash pairing, not saying I don't want James and Lily, it could be Harry/Draco (or others) or Remus/Sirius or even James eventually falling in love again. I'd also really like James going off on Dumbledore for all the shit that's gone on in Harrys life. Could just be canon stuff or bad/manipulative/evil Dumbledore.

Thanks :)


** I believe linkao3(34283562) has this, though this version is a rewritten second version and I've only read the original as of yet. Warning that his reason for being missing is pretty fucked up - heed the warnings in the tags. Also, it says it's the third in the series (second discounting a short prequel), but in the original version, this was the first one, so do with that what you will.

**** Whoops, no problem! [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/34283562?show_comments=true][This link]] should work but if not, it's called For the Price of a Soul by silvercookiedust.
