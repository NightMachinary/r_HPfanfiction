I've been looking for a fic I read years ago, for, well, years. But I can't find it anywhere!

It was set before half blood prince, so no horcruxes and it focussed on a soul bond between Harry and Ginny which was 'the power he knows not'. They were connected by lay lines and it was described as hen they closed their eyes they could see ribbons connecting them together.

The final battle went down at stone henge. It was on mugglenet I believe and for years was the longest and more followed story.

Any help, please!


** This must be a pretty rare H/G soulbond, since I thought I read them all. I can tell you that it's probably not on SIYE, and most definitely not on FFN, and might even be deleted.

*** That's what I'm thinking too. I've searched everything I can. Giving up hope to be honest! But thanks for the reply

**** I think it might be Ancient Magic, with the sequel Blood of the Heart, by kjpzak. Although that might have been a blood bond instead of a soul bond? Their bond presented itself as a weave of different colored ribbons. The one I believe you're thinking of is the sequel, Blood of the Heart.
