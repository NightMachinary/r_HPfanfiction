:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
But hey, can't hurt to try asking.

The fic was posted on the Veritaserum forums, if anyone remembers that fossil. It was a Harry/Ginny in fourth or fifth year, that was a bit more well paced than the rest of fics at that time, with Ginny rejecting Harry at first, or at least not immediately jumping his bones.

What I remember was that Harry was experiencing surges in his power that made his spells stronger. A scene that illustrated that was when he was supposed to de-gnome the garden and he accidentaly squashed the thing with a banisher. He was pretty shook up about it.

The only other thing I remember was the last scene I read; Harry had been kidnapped or tricked into falling in a pitch black dungeon or hole with a creature inside that would kill him if he used Lumos; Lucius and Draco were there waiting for him and were using a variant of the Lumos spell to see. I remember the incantation translated to 'dark light' in Latin or something like that.

I honestly doubt anyone read or remembers this, and it's probably not that great a fic to begin with, but I'm just so damn curious if it still exists. I believe it's the first fanfic I ever read. Regardless, thanks in advance.
