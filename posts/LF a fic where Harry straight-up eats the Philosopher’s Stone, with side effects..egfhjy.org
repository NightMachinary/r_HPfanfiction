I think he was trying to make sure Quirrell didn't get it, and what better way than just eating it? There's another fic where part of it becomes imbedded in his eye, also with side effects, that I would appreciate a link to.

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.
