Most fics you will see Harry completely embracing the Wizarding world with all it's flaws and archaic structures. Are there any where Harry uses guns, explosives, or other things combined with magic?

It seems always weird to me where you have a dark Harry only using magic whereas sometime technology would be extremely helpful.


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has plenty of technological advancement in it. Harry is certainly no saint in it, either.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens) is perhaps a bit outside of the scope of you want, but it definitely fits with "morally ambiguous tech-using HP."

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
