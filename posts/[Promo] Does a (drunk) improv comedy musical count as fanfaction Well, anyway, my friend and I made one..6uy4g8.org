The original tracks for most of these were done in a weekend (and were, indeed, improvised drunken antics), and then we went back and added additional voices and sound effects and stuff. It kind of got out of control after a while, but we've finally put out the first two years (of four total...I know, don't ask haha).

Anyway if this isn't the place for this, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, grab a butterbeer and saddle up.


** I don't know if this is the place for it but please keep them coming!

*** Just out of curiosity, do you know of any place or community where this might be more relevant? We mostly did it for fun, but it'd be nice to have other places to share it too.

*** That's the goal! We're about to start work on passing over the third and final years, so hopefully it won't be too long before it's all out there.
