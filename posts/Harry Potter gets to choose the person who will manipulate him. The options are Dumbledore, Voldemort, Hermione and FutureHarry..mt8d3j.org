Dumbledore is canon Dumbledore, and he will manipulate Harry to kill Voldemort, leaving him free to live his life after that.

Voldemort is a AU version who found out Harry is his Horcrux. He will manipulate Harry into being a person of his taste. Harry gains immortality but he might never be free from Voldemort's control.

Hermione is Hermione. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/msmdfe/hermione_granger_was_wrong_and_it_had_left_a_deep/guu2sg6/][Having faith in rules until she has to break them.]] Harry is pretty sure he can handle her.

Future!Harry is Harry from a future that has yet to pass. He and Harry are the same yet they are very, very different (like your 15 year old self differs from your 25 year old self). Apart from being more or less unrecognizable to Present!Harry, he seems to look down upon the present Harry, hating him for being naive and idealistic.

Now who is Harry's best option?


** Future!harry by far.

While Future!harry might know there is a duty to do and a prophecy to fulfill, and would make sure it happened, Future!harry would at least be more honest with Harry and give him more information, given Future!Harry knows how much he hates not knowing stuff.

Plus he has Harry's best interest in mind, given he is Harry as well. He would likely aim to do things like saving Sirius and various others.

Only worry is that Harry has never been... subtle, so it is much less a manipulator-role he will take, and more a 'I will teach you and get you ready, and try to prevent the worst things from happening' and be really blunt about it.

*** Future!Harry is quite good at manipulating Harry, after all who knows you better than yourself?

That said, Harry can't ever imagine himself being a manipulative person. That's why he is more or less unrecognizable to Present!Harry, to the point of him seeming like a different person. Future!Harry also looks down upon the present Harry, hating him for being naive and idealistic.

*** What do you mean? Harry is a pretty good manipulator as shown in the scene when he gets the memory from Slughorn (I know he is under the influence of Felix Felicis but as stated later, Felix Felicis just creates the optimum conditions for you to do what you could also do under normal circumstances). Also Future!Harry would still have to refrain from telling Harry that he has to willingly walk to his death in order for him not to die and also manipulate the situation so that everything happens accordingly. Otherwise Future!Harry would cease to exist as well.

** I'm going to say that Harry should stick to the Devil he knows. Dumbledore would get him killed maybe, but it would only be after he exhausted all options to keep him alive. Dumbledore hasn't followed a Greater Good mentality for at least 50 years, so at the very least, he can be assured that he wouldn't be used for evil. Assuming we are talking about canon Harry, he would be more concerned about doing the right thing than keeping himself alive.

The rest of the options are much riskier because they are much more likely to go further than Dumbledore would and are also likely to be much more cavalier about Harry's life and well-being.

*** The Greater Good mentality is just essentially â€˜the ends justify the means'. Him allowing Harry to die in order to render Voldemort mortal is subscribing to the ideology to the Greater Good. The difference is that Dumbledore's interpretation of what the Greater Good was is not the same as Grindelwald's. I'm not saying that Dumbledore's a bad person or made the wrong decision, but just that he did follow the Greater Good ideology to some extent.

** Is there anyone on earth who wouldn't pick their older self? Anyone at all? Cause I'd pick that in a heartbeat. I'd pick that over not having anyone manipulate me at all, which is everyone's natural inclination.

*** Oh, I realized I didn't put any counterpoints for Future!Harry. Let's see...

Future!Harry is more or less unrecognizable to Present!Harry. Also he seems to look down upon the present Harry, hating him for being naive and idealistic.

** If I were in Harry's shoes --- definitely Hermione. She's his friend, she'll try to keep him away from danger, and, as you said, "Harry is pretty sure he can handle her".

And I know that's not the question you asked, but to be fair, looking from the reader's perspective, I'd chose the Voldemort option.
