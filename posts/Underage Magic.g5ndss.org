Okay so i just realised. At the start of prisoner of azkaban (in the movie) harry uses underage magic, okay yes he's doing his homework and he's doing the LUMOS MAXIA spell (or however you spell it) and it goes unnoticed but in chamber of secrets when dobby does magic harry gets a warning. And it's said in the books that they get homework but because of the no use of magic if ur underaged law how are they supposed to do it?? or is they're something saying that you can do magic as long it's homework, and if there was that would DEFINITELY be abused. Just saying i don't really understand haha


** In the books, Harry does use lumos during the summer, but not to do homework, he uses it to see in the dark after he runs away from the Dursleys after blowing up Aunt Marge. The ministry does detect his magic, but lets him off because they were worried about Sirius Black getting to him and are just glad he's safe.

  “Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my punishment?” Fudge blinked.

  “Punishment?”

  “I broke the law!” Harry said. “The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!”

  “Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like that!” cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. “It was an accident! We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!”

  But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the Ministry of Magic. “Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle's house!” he told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!"

  Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward. “Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?”

  “Of course I don't,” said Harry.

  “Well then, what's all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge. “Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you.”

** That's the film. Unfortunately, particularly in these small things, they lost much of the consistency of the HP world there. Just forget it ever happened.

** Well i have a question then if underage magic detection is a "thing", then why didn't Hermione get in trouble. As she clearly stated on the train to Hogwarts in the first book after Ron's joke spell from the twins that

"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me....."

It all falls down to how magic is detected (we know the can detect accidental magic as if it's strong enough they send a squad out. So that is pre-wand. Hence it leads to the belief (fanfic) that the trace (which canon doesn't specify) is placed on the wand and because the wand connects to the wizard's core it can detect when the wizard is 17.

But if that is the case Hermione should have received warnings for the underage use of magic.

*** maybe she did receive warnings? anyways maybe they got ‘notified' that she used it but were able to know that she was just around wizards, still doesn't explain it. but the movies were never as detailed as the books so we'll never know, they missed a lot of details which really annoys me and probably everyone.

**** The quote was actually from the first book. Now the books never say where she lived but the impression was there were no wizards nearby. And more importantly she was the only magical in the house so based on the Harry violation before 2nd year. Since magic was performed in the house it's assumed that Hermione did it. Which therefore is a violation.

And you're right that we don't know if she did get a warning but with her initial authority "worship" you would think she would mention that she got warned and didn't know she wasn't allowed to do magic at home. And the mention would be because she wouldn't want others to "break the rules".

Basically it's just another inconsistency/ unexplained event in the story.

*** JKR didn't think of the trace until after that book was published?

** The lumos spell also makes a noise in the movies for whatever reason.

Honestly, I never liked the atmosphere they show to begin with. Everything looks so dirty and grungy all the time.

** Definitely a movie thing that messes up the consistency of canon.
