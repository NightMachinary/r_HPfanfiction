Hi! I have written my first fic. Would like to know your views. Up for any kind of reviews. Please be critical. Here is the link- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12927442/1/]])


** Since you want critical reviews...

- The OC is not properly introduced. We don't know what she looks like and yet Harry wants to bang her.

- It is way too short for a chapter and most people won't bother with anything below 1 or 2 thousand words.

- The conversation, while accurate for a pair of teenage boys, sounds off. Especially since "Dude", the first word spoken, is not British. Neither of the speakers reads like a Harry Potter character.

- Due to the short length, not much happens -> it is not very interesting.

- You seem to have forgotten the Yule Ball, which kinda cancelled the Christmas holidays and most students will stay over the holidays.

- The "no sex" rule would be unenforceable. There are around 15 adults, hundreds of students and an enormous castle. The students have little after hour activities and casual sex would, therefore, be rampant.

- Also, no Muggleborn has ever smuggled a Playboy or Hustler in? No lewd photographs? Seems very odd.

And those are just the things I noticed when glancing over it.

Has any of your male friends ever commented on a visible errection with "Dude, we got to do something about that" (forget the Dude)? Maybe my friends are all stuck-up prudes, but we really don't discuss each other's boners.

**** Actually yes, at least with certain friends (of both sexes) I am/was quite open about the subject. Or with the mother of a friend (insert joke about our atrocious German porn here).

I mean, when you compare your porn tastes or hear about their trip to Amsterdam's Red Light district, the topic of sex tends to make an appearance.

****** I mean, I remember the class trips during my teens, and at each one, everyone was talking about sex, boobs and stuff, so it is not even limited to friends. One girl was offering handjobs for fifty Euros (no one took her up for that rate), porn clips were being swapped via Bluetooth... And that was at a middle/ upper-class school.

Oh we did that too. One of my friends bought one of the first CD burners when they became available for consumers. He quickly made his money back.

We just never talked about each others dicks or masturbation techniques...

******** Considering that a girl (the one who later offered the 50 bucks handjobs) was quite interested in that and asked me and a couple of friends how we masturbated with condoms (no one used them) since she couldn't imagine what happened with the cum otherwise, I'd say that I have that topic covered. Perhaps it is all a cultural thing (insert another joke about German porn here).

*** I agree with pretty much everything you said especially the length.

However the premise of a no sex Hogwarts could be rather comical if done well. Considering how many marriage law Fics there are in the fandom, the realistic nature of a no sex Hogwarts may be completely ridiculous but would still be fun to read about.

Reality shouldn't hamper our creativity :)

**** I would agree if the story wouldn't show that both Harry and Ron are horny as hell.

Also, marriage laws were a horror not even Hitler or Stalin dared to inflict upon their countries and shouldn't be considered a good standard.

Edit: Although it would be fun to read a Muggleborn's PoV where they are all merrily shagging each other while those raised in the magical world are clueless about the other sex and clearly suffering from blue balls.

While true, marriage law fics can cover certain topics that, at least Hitler, /inflicted/ upon Nazi Germany. For example, I'm writing a marriage law story right now (no hate!) in which something similar to the Cross of Honour of the German Mother is given to women who bear a certain number of children. Of course, the whole idea of a marriage law (and Cross of Honour) is just ridiculous but after reading relentless Charlie/Hermione marriage law fics, I couldn't resist taking a dab at it on my own.

*** Hey! This is really extensive and helpful. I will work on all the things you pointed out. Since I'm new to writing fiction i agree that I didn't develop my characters properly. Will work on the OC. regarding the characters not sounding like HP I don't want to keep them same. But yes I agree I need to think about why hasn't a muggle born ever smuggled a porn magazine. I was thinking on the line that since Rowling's series has no reference to anything related to sex therefore I assumed that Hogwarts is porn-free.

** As others have said, way too short, also Broomdick is a terrible name (unless it's a gay mag). If this is supposed to happen in 4th year, how are the twins producing a porn magazine while still in school anyway? Who are the models?

The ASOIAF crossover/cameo is really weird. Is this supposed a crack fic? For that it isn't funny enough...

Pay Tonks to buy a Playboy, meet her at Hogsmeade, smuggle it in, transfigure the cover, multiply them with magic, sell them for a horrendous price and make a fat profit.

** First and foremost I encourage you to keep writing. Everyone's first fic is a struggle, my own included. That being said in publishing and writing we grow and learn from our mistakes.

The first thing that I want to ask you is why so early? Set the scene a bit here, don't feel like too much has to happen too soon. 300 words in and Harry already wants to get with this OC. Unless you want this to be a pure smut fic, things have to be developed.

What sort of character is Harry? Almost always Harry is portrayed OOC compared to his canon counterpart. Your fic seems to be doing this as well. Harry was never up front with girls, always a bit shy. Yule ball is a good example of this. Make sure this is preserved in his interactions.

The next thing I noticed is the lack of magic. Magic should be a central part of any HP fanfic, after all the universe is /magical/. That's something I would be sure to include.

The last thing is vision. Are you outlining? Do you have a clear path with an end goal? I don't know where you intend to take this, but before writing and publishing its important to always have the future in mind.

I've dropped a follow and encourage you to keep writing. It only gets easier and your writing will improve as you go.

*** Thank you for your support! It means a lot! I feel encouraged even though my fic is badly written and lacks storyline. I will rework my fiction. I think this was a unforgivable mistake- not to include magic in a HP fic! I already feel embarrassed. Will keep working on the outlining. I do have a rough draft in my mind but don't have a detailed plan.
