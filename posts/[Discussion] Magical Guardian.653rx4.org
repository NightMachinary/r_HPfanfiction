** entirely fanon.

it is never brought up in the books. we do know is that the Dursleys are considered Harry's guardians, which is why he need either Petunia or Vernon's signatures on his Hogsmeade form.

However, in the Muggle world we have the concept of /in loco parentis/, the legal principle giving schools/teachers the ability to act in a child's best interests in the absence of that child's parents. This principle, or something similar, is kinda necessary for a school to be able to run, especially a boarding school. So while Hogwarts students are at school, it's likely that the school has partial parental rights with respect to the children.
