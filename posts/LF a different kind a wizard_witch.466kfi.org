Looking for fics that have a whole different level of wizard/witches. Be they powerful magical Lords, battle mages or grand sorcerers. These wizarding levels can be born into or earned they just have to be unique from the common witch or wizard. Giving the status of the fic (WIP, abandoned, completed) is always appreciated.


** Again and Again linkffn(8149841) is a great powerful Harry fic, because his knowledge and skills are logically where he would be at considering, well, his age haha. It hasn't been updated in a while, but there's plenty of story already written :)

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Hmm... I guess I can self-plug... sort of lol: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome)

In this AU, wand magic is really hard and expensive to learn, so only the wealthier, smarter etc. wizards go to boarding schools. Even at Hogwarts, where Sorcery (spellcasting) is the focus, classes like Artificing and Theurgy are core subjects, because many wizards are more suited to assuming the role of an ingenious craftsman or devout cleric, rather than a spell-slinging warlock.

Speaking of warlocks... some wizards are only good for smashing things, so they only learn Hexes and how to use Blasting Rods. It's all pretty Hogwarts-focused at the moment, but the other magical disciplines will become more prominent as the story goes on.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.
