** Well, I may be being a smart-arse, but according to the summary, it's Harry/Hermione/Fleur. Or is that not what you wanted?

** It's not a Harry multi, but an eventual poly, between Harry/Hermione and Fleur. It's one of my absolute favourite fics. Fair warning, the pacing is kind of slow, and it is really quite bloated at times and could have been 200k words shorter.

Still, I love it and the characterisation is great, especially Dumbledore. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this fic has the best Dumbledore of any I've read.

**** Well, I don't mind the multi trope. Hell, I'm writing one. It's just too bad how for most authors it's just a smut fest, and they're either not willing or capable of giving each person of the group their time in the sun, so to speak.

Anyway, the dynamic between the three main characters in Heart and Soul is very interesting, and how the writer goes about it is somewhat realistic, I think.

***** Nice. And yeah you're right about how most authors write multi fics for smut and the ones that really are good get mostly abandoned or get an abrupt ending
