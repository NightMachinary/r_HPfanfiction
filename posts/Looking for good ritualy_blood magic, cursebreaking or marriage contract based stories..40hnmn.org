I'm looking for stories that feature Harry using ritual or blood magic or just using magic that is different than what is expressed in Harry potter. Some of the stories I've enjoyed are With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat, The Gift of Memories and sequels by The Engulfing Silence, and Miranda Flairgold's Akren Series.

I'm also looking for contract based stories. Preferably not harem, but stories where Harry is pulled into a contract with someone. I enjoy The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie, as well as The Legacy by StorytellerSPw.

As far as cursebreaking, I've enjoyed Jbern's stories and Mountain907's A Cursed Summer.

I would prefer complete or at least updated regularly, but I understand that's not always possible. I don't have any pairing preferences except I'm not fond of slash. I'm completely fine with some bashing as long as it's done with a purpose not just needless.

  The Legacy by StorytellerSPw.
#+end_quote

Is this one finally over now or is it still going on? This story has to be the most unnecessarily bloated thing I've ever read.

That said, good-ish marriage contact: linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-Dude). Extra chapter at DLP WbA.

linkffn(Enveloped in Darkness) has a lot of ritual stuff. Good if you have a boner for evil OP Harry.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] is a really good curse breaking fic. Long abandoned through.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

**** I second Contractual Invalidation. It's humorous and very well-written, with a twist to the Marriage Contract trope. I found it a very refreshing read after all the bad marriage contract stories out there.

*** The Legacy is still going, I'll admit it's bloated, but I've still found it an enjoyable read.

I'm going to have to check out Contractual Invalidation and I've already read Enveloped in Darkness and its sequel.

I primarily stick with ffn because the app I use will pull from it and will narrate to me while driving at work.

  100 years ago, The Malfoy Heirs were cursed by only enabling them to provide just one heir for each generation after. That is until two people fool around, after having consumed too much alcohol. Drama, Romance, EWE. Rated M for Mature.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
