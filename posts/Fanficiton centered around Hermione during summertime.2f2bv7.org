I'm trying to find this fanfic that I read back in 2006-2007ish on FictionAlley that was about Snape coming over to watch Hermione at her parents house during the summer. (I think her parents went on their own vacation somewhere.) I forgot what it was about but I know there were a few chapters where Hermione was wearing a two-piece bathing suit and Snape tells her to cover herself and put on some clothes (because he doesn't know that it's a bathing suit) and she gets irritated at him and she pushes him in the pool.


** Do British people have pools? I figured if they don't have AC then they probably wouldn't have pools. Now I'm curious.

*** It's certainly far from common, other than paddling pools. We don't really have the weather for outside pools either, they'd be in use maybe 3 weeks a year. I'm sure there are people out there with them but I'd imagine they'd be indoor or covered pools.

*** It's not very common to be honest. And you wouldn't be able to use it much either, given the weather. Summer in the UK lasts like 2 days.

*** Of course they do. It is not as prevalent as in the states, and certainly not as popular in London where space is expensive.

It is interesting though, that most, if not all, stories that have Harry going to Hermione's house, she has a pool.

*** I"m guessing the middle class and rich would have pools in their backyards. Since Hermione's parents are dentists, they probably make a decent amount of money to afford a home with a pool.

**** They could do, but people tend not to have a pool - I don't know where you'd put one. You'd have to have a huge house with a room inside built for one.

***** Or it could be an outdoor above ground pool.
