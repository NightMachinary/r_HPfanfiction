Normally the canon world character(s) goes to an AU, but I'd like to see the opposite here.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Anyone can be the main character. It can be on any site. Would rather be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Would rather not have character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is normally a no go. Though if it's believable enough for the in universe, I suppose it's fine. (Though I'd rather not have Weasley bashing, if possible).
