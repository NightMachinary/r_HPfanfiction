** Northumbrian, the author of Strangers has lots of stories that will fill that time period if you didn't already know. How dedicated to cannon and the epilogue are you? If you're not a great fan of the epilogue check out linkffn(11816264/1) or linkffn(10728064) a sort of halfway house between cannon and not is linkffn(11111990) which is becoming quite popular. If you didn't know, and honestly I'm not sure how good it is you can filter fanfiction.net to search only post-Hogwarts using the worlds drop down selection.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
