We all know the three common types

#+begin_quote
  Inheritances, Black family stuff, Bellatrix or Narcissa as love interest, mostly "politics" and action sequences
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Meet the Marauders, befriend them, play pranks, get rid of Pettigrew, set up Lily/James and optionally bang Sirius, Remus or both of them (mostly when Hermione is the traveller)
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  save Snape and bang him/set him up with Lily
#+end_quote

But what would you like to see in a story set in the 70s (be it with the Marauders at Hogwarts or outside of it)? Plots, concepts, love interests/pairings, characterisations, anything really.


** I'd love to see fics that seriously look at the stressors of war. The quote from Sirius in GoF - paraphrased - you're too young to understand but everyone was scared for themselves, their family, their friends. What did that actually do to the friendship? How did Sirius come to suspect Lupin? What was it like when James learned his family was targeted? More Lily doing anything Lily; we know so little about her, there's so much to develop. How did they come to work for the order?

Another quote from OotP - Harry has dealt with as much, if not more, than most in the Order. Can we take that to mean fights with Voldemort were a guarantee? Death Eaters? I'd love detailed fight scenes like the June battles in canon.

** A general thing in time travel scenarios: I like it when the time traveler is really daring and doesn't put any effort into preserving the timeline. When it comes to Voldemort and the Marauder's era the motto should be *different is good* (it seems really arrogant to focus all efforts on affecting one specific change, putting all your eggs in one basket):

Try to install a different headmaster in Hogwarts (maybe Albus would like to do something more productive), change the Ministry and its hierarchy, assassinate Walburga and destroy any hopes of a Black marrying a Malfoy, push Pettigrew in front of a train, make friends with Regulus and give him a better plan, salt the earth in the Little Hangleton graveyard, etc.

Just identify all the things that will mess up the time line, list them in order of their potential impact and try to get them done. Throw in a bit of altruism and "fixing" things along the way when possible.

** I do like the ones where they DON'T end up going to Hogwarts. 169 (I think? Hermione has 169 days to fix things) is sooo damn good. I like ones where the whole timeline keeping is left aside. Either by moving to a time after the part that needs to be preserved (eg. 1st of November 1981) or simply because they're going back for the express purpose of changing things.

Although a good stomping of Voldemort by whoever goes back can be a good read, it often isn't. I also don't understand why Sirius of all people is so often suspicious and ultra antagonistic with whoever traveled.

I don't like it when the timetravel gets revealed, either too soon or at all. Best it stays secret for as many people as possible.

** 1. There's no evidence for Sirius/Remus (in fact, there's anti-evidence). I personally love James/Lily, but don't force it if it's going to happen. Pairings are not a must for the story. In fact, they often ruin it.
2. Try to keep people in character. Snape is unforgiving, condescending, jealous, possessive and a willing member of Hitler's Youth. Lily is independent, fights for the right cause, uncompromising on her morals, and dislikes being told what to do. Remus is compassionate, but he has a tendency to act like a victim/martyr. James is courageous, confident, openly honest, and unfortunately short-tempered and impulsive. Sirius is a good friend but distrusting and violent.
3. People tend to pair Hermione with Remus. They say it's because he's bookish (he's trying to study in the pensieve scene). He also shares quite a few similarities with Ron.
4. ... I like Sirius/Narcissa... It also gets rid of Draco...

** - Fun banter between Snape and the Marauders, him pranking them back using the jinxes he designed. He's not just a silent victim.

- Instead of getting rid of Pettigrew, the time-traveler sees in the young Wormtail the same qualities that made the other Marauders become friends with him in the first place. They question the ethics of breaking apart his friendship with the others over something he hasn't even thought of doing yet.

- Dumbledore already on his way to becoming a good friend for James (one imagines a relationship not unlike Harry's with Lupin).

Also, a fun Defence Professor OC or two. Please.

#+end_quote

"Fun banter" and "using the jinxes he designed on them" are two different items. Firstly, Snape is beautifully snarky and the Marauders are a quatuor jokers, hence I demand witty banter. /Secondly/, he should be seen fighting back.

And don't seel jinxes short. The spell on the Defence Professorship that killed and maimed many of the Professors is a jinx, as was the spell used to animate an entire forest into murderous monsters. (Yes, Rowling has defined jinxes as "mildly annoying curses", but the Patronus also has no business being called a charm by her definition of a charm, etc. You shouldn't put too much credit in her idea of spell clarification.)

More seriously, I should think he didn't start out using Sectumsempra on people. He'd get expelled, for one thing. I think he may well have /designed/ Sectumsempra while fantasizing about using it on James or Sirius, but he would have stuck to less dangerous/illegal stuff until they were out of school.

No canon evidence either way, so it's a judgement call based on the history of your world. I think the main question which you need to ask is the extent to which Christianity played a part in the development of the magical world as opposed to pre-Christian Rome or other ancient cultures, i.e. how early a soft separation of the magical and mundane worlds began to develop. Homosexual marriage existed in pre-Christian Rome as well as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, and both polyandry and polygyny were recognized in the Celtic tribes which inhabited Britannia (not sure about homosexual marriage, but both are examples of sanctioned non-‘standard' unions), so if you have magicals at least selectively ignoring nonmagical law as of 342 CE it seems unlikely that gay marriage ever would have been even looked down on. Personally, I can't imagine a witch or wizard even remotely caring to let someone they could crush with a flick of a wand dictate their personal life, but it's up to the author.

***** I could see homosexuality in the Wizarding World treated in much the same way as it was by Medieval Nobility: very much kept behind closed doors and not spoken about in polite society, and as long as the individual in question is able to 'do their duty' and produce an heir to continue the family line, then all the better.

****** Given the social demographics suggested in canon, in which the wealthiest families that care about bloodlines are the most prejudiced against muggles (and making the assumption that Christianity as described in the Bible is at least initially a nonmagical creation, which I think we're forced to do without reimagining the religion), I think it's somewhat unlikely that there would be a stigma attached to the homosexuality itself and instead it would simply be the fact that there are affairs that is not spoken of.

**** Snape's a canon bully, while he was a student. All those fights he got into with the marauders, well he gave as good as he got. That one scene we saw, well, we never saw the scenes where he's bullying others, and canonically that happened, as well as him fighting.

So he's not actually a bully victim, as much as a bully who clashed with people who didn't like him. It's like calling the Nazis a bunch of bully victims, because the Allies declared war on them, and beat them down.

****** Hang on a second, singled Snape out? You read some other series by J K Rowling that covered the Era of the Marauders then? Saying the marauders didn't do something, when we've no evidence one way or the other about it, is just making shit up, or referencing a series no-one else seems to have read.

Because we know very little about what they did at school, beyond Snape bullying muggleborns according to Lily, him giving as good as he got, according to Hagrid, and creating curses to carve into peoples flesh, according to his own potions book.

According to Rowling:

#+begin_quote
  Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying.

  Snape was a bully who loved the goodness he sensed in Lily without being able to emulate her. That was his tragedy.

  Snape didn't die for 'ideals'. He died in an attempt to expiate his own guilt. He could have broken cover at any time to save himself 1/2

  but he chose not to tell Voldemort that the latter was making a fatal error in targeting Harry. Snape's silence ensured Harry's victory. 2/2
#+end_quote

Snape was a prick. He was a vindictive and bullying prick who died for his one sided crush. Now, you might have been bullied at school and want to see yourself in this monster who attacked small children, just because he was bullied and you share something in common with him, but is is that really that much that you share in common with him?

Are you also an adult who insults and belittles children? Do you go around calling back people racist slurs?

Because these are his known qualities.

And as for them Hexing people, [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hex][these are the known hex's]] most of them aren't that bad in a world of easily reversable magic. Especially when they themselves can retaliate.

** Harry is at Hogwarts but not the same age as the marauders. Maybe he's in seventh year while the marauders are in third.

Harry goes back in time and forms a small group that knows how bad things get and can help him. Exclude Dumbledore for some reason. Make it something like Kingsley, Arthur, and Pandora Lovegood. Unexpected people with unique interests/skills.

Harry and Sirius go back together.

A badly-performed curse sends Harry back into the body of his father. It's irreversible. The other marauders finds out.

The Dursleys get sent back in time with Harry. Like, they walk out of their house one day and they - and their house - are in the 70s.

Something like the movie Frequency where they're not really time-traveling but able to communicate with people in the 70s. Maybe use the mirror.

Post-HBP, Harry and Ginny get trapped in the past and decide to start hunting the horcruxes then and there. Cue them running afoul of the ministry, the Order, and the Gringott's goblins.

Harry saves Regulus in the cave. Harry and Regulus hunt down horcruxes. Maybe Sirius gets roped in too.

Harry switches places with himself so that baby Harry is in the future being cared for by Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. Adult Harry appears in the nursery.

** I have a very different plot for a Harry and Hermione time travel to Marauder Era. Assume they can from a very dystopian future and the time travel is not accidental:

- Since they have only limited knowledge of this time (for example Horcrux locations are mostly unknown). perhaps it makes sense to keep the timeline intact until maybe around 1980.
- As a result, they will completely remove themselves from Britain. He/She will instead use their advance knowledge to make some good money in Muggle stock markets, preferably in America. They might occasionally evacuate certain people from Britain though.
- They can use this competitive advantage to build up a powerful business and private army, made up of Muggleborns fleeing from Death Eaters in Britain.
- Of course, events in Magical Britain should still be followed closely. By late 1970s, it's probably a good time to send an anonymous tip to Dumbledore about Voldemort's Horcruxes and his Death Eaters.
- Once this step has been taken, it means timeline has been disrupted, and their active involvement becomes necessary. One key action they must take is to ‘persuade' the Marauders (including Peter) to leave Britain. I actually have written some excerpts about their encounter.
- Give Dumbledore and his Order some time, and only intervene if they still suck as much as in canon.
- If they successfully defeat Voldemort, egg Barty Crouch on (bribe him with a small fraction of your now massive fortune, and send pieces of his Jr back to him whom they kidnapped a few months ago) to go totally merciless on any remaining Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to your knowledge.
- Once Death Eaters have been removed, try their best to incite another civil war between Dumbledore and the crazed Barty Crouch. Watching “fire burning across from the river” can be very satisfying.
- The end result should be pretty much the destruction of Magical Britain's traditional establishment, and now they can move in as the ‘savior'.
