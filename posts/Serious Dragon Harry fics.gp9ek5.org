No slash no bashing no fem Harry no hinny I like the idea of Harry being a dragon without being OP and the story being treated semi seriously

These are the fics that I have read and liked with the premise Linkffn(The dragon and the sleeping beauty; Breath of the inferno; Green eyed beast)


** I still love the idea of Harry being a dragon animagus, but instead of being an OP massive rage dragon he becomes toothless from how to train your dragon. Cat like personality and all.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** I tried it before and I am not a fan It's a good fic but I just don't like it and it's more a parody than a serious fic

** I think half the point of having Harry as a dragon, in fics that turn him into one, /is/ him being crazy overpowered - unless we go by the old adage "if everything's overpowered, nothing is" and give literally everyone else a power boost as well, which is hard to pull off convincingly.

The only fic I can think of that fits most of your criteria while being actually /good/ is Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay, which has already been linked in this thread - and it's a self admitted crackfic.

*** Honestly I don't think I've read any “Harry is a dragon” fic that doesn't make him OP and is at least a little crack. The premise does not lend itself to being read seriously.

  'I'm cold' was the only thing she could think. Only after she met him it changed to 'Mmh, he's so warm'. Humour/Fluff mostly. Icy Daphne, but in a very different way ;)

  [Development Hell] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  James and Sirius decide just trusting Dumbledore has its own flaws, so they decide to give Harry an edge up on the matter. The Hogwarts motto has never been more accurate. Parings to be determined. Rating may go up
