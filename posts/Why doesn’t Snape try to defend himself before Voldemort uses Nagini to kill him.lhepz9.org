He just kind of stands there and lets it happen


** He attempts to by asking for permission to look for Harry but once Voldemort says that he needs to kill him I always kind of assumed he freezes. The general consensus is that if Voldemort tells you he wants to kill you, you are pretty much dead (except if you're Harry).

*** Harry: gets a scar

Everyone else: gets a grave

And people think that Dumbledore plays favorites. Voldemort clearly favors Harry more

** Because otherwise he wouldn't of been able to give Harry his memories. Think about it like this, Snape fights Voldemort, gets absolutely mollywhooped and dies without “crying” his memories out (how does that even work in the book?) or he dies slowly from the snake and can give Harry the memories he needs to kill voldie

** He did make the attempt. He managed to get his wand out, which I admit I didn't know until this moment. However, Voldemort dropped Nagini's sphere on him after a "split second." Think of it like the bathroom scene between Harry and Draco, but on steroids. Voldemort was just too quick.

**** I mean if it's really bothering you... how about he just froze? Like a deer in the headlights. Though I don't know that I'd buy that nonsense. You spy on the Dark Lord who snuffs people on a whim, you should probably expect to get it yourself.

** Maybe he was very done with everything at that point? He likely didn't plan to survive the war. It would have been very bad to survive, actually. Azkaban doesn't seem like a nice retirement plan.

*** He was going to die no matter what. If Harry failed, he would've failed Lily, causing him to probably end everything. If Harry succeeded, he was going to die in order to make sure Harry learned the truth. Snape, for all his flaws, understood that dying was a way to at least give Harry a chance

**** Even if the whole killing Dumbledore thing could've been explained (not sure how well pensive memories do for defence), he was very deep in Voldemort's ranks and workings, and the wizarding public tends to be in for blood. Snape isn't rich and people generally hated him even before Voldemort's reign so to the gallows with him!

Unless Harry Potter's word counts for enough to release him.

****** I suppose I feel quite negatively towards the sense of justice on wizardkind. It's also possible that Snape needed to do other questionable things than just killing Dumbledore to reach his position. I don't say he would deserve Azkaban but to me, it just seems like the most possible outcome.

******** Not personally, but I think the general public in wizarding world would see it differently, seeing how prone they are to turn against everyone the media points fingers at and Snape has proven himself to look like a villain before even that he wasn't.

***** The curse in his hand? Because Bill Weasley isn't a healer. Nor is there any indication that he's better with a wand than Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, which also works if you meant the DADA curse.
