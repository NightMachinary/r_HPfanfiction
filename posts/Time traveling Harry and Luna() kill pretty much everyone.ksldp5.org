:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this probably three or four years ago, but that was when I was just starting to read HP fanfics, so it could easily have been several years older than that. I think it was on AO3, but it could have been FFN. I am almost certain that it was complete.

Basically, Harry somehow ends up back in his younger body. I'm pretty sure that Luna was his girlfriend, though it could have been someone else. I think that Luna didn't come back with Harry, but I could be wrong about that. Either way, they get together again in the past and spend most of the story killing everyone who ever wronged them, which is pretty much every named character in the books. And of course, they did it without anyone knowing who was behind all the deaths.

Neville was one of the few people that neither of them planned to kill, but he overheard them talking about the murders and confronted Luna about it. Luna, naturally, just kills him in response. Neither she nor Harry felt particularly bad about this.

And no, it's not Reunion by Rorschach's Blot. That one has some similar ideas, but it has more time travelers and a much more comedic tone. The story I'm thinking of was definitely just Harry and maybe Luna traveling and wasn't trying to be funny.


** I literally just read this I'll edit this in a bit

Edit: it's Harry Potter and the Dark Lord Sidious

Fair warning: it shows it's age in terms of bashing and whatnot

*** That's the one! Thank you very much.

I wasn't expecting it to actually be very good, as bashing and dark!Harry stories usually aren't. But looking over it again, I think it's even worse than I expected. But it was bothering me that I couldn't remember it.

*** That does sound very familiar. Unfortunately, adding "Darth Sidious" as a search term just makes a bunch of Star Wars crossovers show up.
