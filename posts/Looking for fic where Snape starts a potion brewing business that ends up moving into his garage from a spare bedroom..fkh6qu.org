:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the specifics, it was either a Snape/Hermione fic or a Snape/Fem!Harry fic. But with her help Snape started selling potions from home that he brewed in his guest room. As the business took off they ended up having to move and set up brewing in their garage. I think, but I'm not certain that the logo for their company was based on some sort of insect (butterfly I think). Hopefully this is enough for someone to be able to help me out. Thank you ahead of time.


** I don't think it's the one you're looking for, but linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) has Snape running a potions business.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
