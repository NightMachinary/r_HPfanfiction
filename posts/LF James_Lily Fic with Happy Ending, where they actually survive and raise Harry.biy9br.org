Just read sunshine in my eyes by monroeslittle and it was lovely. I'm looking something similar, a fic where we get to see their relationship develop and they deal with the threat of Voldemort, but in a SMARTER way so that they end up actually surviving. Bonus points if we actually get to see them raising Harry (not nearly enough of those fics). It sucks bc James/Lily is probably my favorite ship in the fandom but I can't read most of the works when I know they'll end up dead damn. (I just want them to live and be happy TT)

For example, I read a fic where James realizes that nothing matters more than family, not the Order or Dumbledore, and hightails it out of Britain, taking his family to safety. Other fics where they actually had a back up plan and didn't stay like sitting ducks waiting for Good Old Tom to knock on there door. Another work by the same author "And the Wolves All Cry" is a great example.

Any recs?

EDIT: To make it clear, I'm not looking for Harry centric fics, but James/Lily centric!


** The problem with having them raise Harry is that it's boring. If everything turned out alright in the end then there is nothing to see. No drama means, generally, no interest.

*** Yes, I agree...but I don't want a normal "Harry is raised by his parents, lets rehash canon events!" fic. I want it to be James and Lily centric, THEIR journey, and THEIR hopefully happy ending. Doesn't matter if it ends when Harry's like 3 years old, just with some cute family moments and some hope at the end.

And the fics I referenced in my OP did that very well, they were tense and kept me on edge, with James and Lily fighting in the war and for their lives. Nothing boring about that imo

** It doesn't quite fit your criteria but linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst) has Harry being raised by his parents. And yes it's robst but at least this one doesn't pretend to have lots of conflict in it.

And linkffn(The Last Casualties by muggledad) also doesn't quite fit the request but also has Harry raised by his parents. Sort of. I haven't read this one in ages but the review I left was pretty effusive so hopefully it's not too bad.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

**** Yeah I just skimmed the first couple of chapters again and it's slower than I remember. I seem to recall it speeds up but it's definitely not as good as I remember in any case.

** I wish I had a recommendation, :(. I've read a few "James and Lily live" fics but they all seem to focus on Harry. It's a weirdly uncommon prompt. I will say that [[/u/rpeh]] 's suggestion of "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]]" is a really sweet and lighthearted fic. Very cute.

*** Yes, it is strange that it's uncommon. I know that there must be lot of Jily fics but they all follow canon. I just want an AU where they get a happy ending :(

I have read A Different Halloween, and if you do remember few "James and Lily live" fics even if the focus on Harry, I wouldnt mind the recs!

**** Of course! I'm on mobile so forgive any formatting issues... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4489910/1/A-Different-Beginning][A Different Beginning]] is a cute series. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite][The Darkness Within]] is not so sweet but I think it has a happy ending. Full disclosure- Lily and James live but Harry is kidnapped and raised by Voldemort.

I can't find anymore but I'm not great about remembering to favorite stories.
