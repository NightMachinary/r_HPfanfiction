I personally would love a companion piece, sequel, or prequel for realignment. It's my personal favorite and I think it's the best fic out there by far, aside from some mechanical aspects. The grammar picks up though and the combat and plot are unrivaled in my mind. It's got a lot of ambiguity on purpose, it shows and avoids telling, and I would love for Puzzle to explore the world more.


** That implies the fics I love are finished. My Favs/Watch list is a graveyard of beautiful but brief stories.

** Puzzle is great, and they also have a great SW fic as well as a Dresden Files/ASoIaF cross (on Ao3), though if I had the power to wish a sequel/prequel I'd probably wish for a fic to be finished instead.

For the HP side of me, I'll have to go with an actual Denarian IV (Apocalypse), though if that's a bit too crossovery then I'd wish for I'm Still Here to be finished.

That said, for non-HP fics I'm once again wishing for a fic to be finished, this time either “A Demon Among Devils” (a Persona 3 and High School DxD cross) or “Beyond the Outer Gates Lies...” (a Dresden Files and DxD cross) though the latter has a sorta-sequel with a fan made continuation which is also pretty good.

** I'd like a fic like Petrification Proliferation with adults acting sensibly for every year. Year One McGonagall takes Harry seriously and resolves the issue. Year 3 Harry gets done body guards and Lupin/Snape don't play games with the werewolf thing. Year 4 involves lawyers. Lots and lots of lawyers Year five a parental lynch mob after the blood quill.

** I want an alternate ending/sequel to Starfox5's Marriage Law Revolution where the war on the continent despite initial successes goes badly, and fears of invasion lead to a coup installing a respected, ambitious, and strategically brilliant general as a military dictator. I want to see him turn the war around, I want to see him slowly consolidate power, I want to see him crowned emperor, I want to see a hubristic invasion of a major foreign power, and I want to see him finally deposed. Basically I want Ron as Napoleon, presented as an antivillain with good intentions slowly descending into despotism over the course of the story.

** I'd quite like a sequel to this linkffn(12118690).

Especially considering the premise and since I like powerful!Harry fics.

In case the link doesn't work: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118690/1/Draco-Malfoy-and-the-Trip-to-the-Past]["Draco malfoy and the trip to the past" by Priya Ashok]] on ffnet

** [A BIT OF SELF-PROMOTION]

Don't wish into existence anything, just sit down and write it. My two last stories (very much unpublishable pre-alpha drafts so far) are such, and I could very much use some opinion on what I am doing there:

- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/prayers_another_take.html][Prayers --- another take]] is a prequel to linkffn(6494461) (warning: yes, I am a Christian, and it talks about Bible, faith, prayers, and such; don't read if you cannot stand it), and

- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][Brother and Sister]] includes (among other things) a kind of sequel to linkffn(12551744), which is a very nice story, but it feels abandoned although it is marked as Completed.

Any opinions on where those stories should go? The first probably will stay as this one shot, Hermione will leave and we can continue with DH as if nothing happened (I wonder whether she even tells the truth about this to Harry & Ron), well the completely idiotic Battle of Seven Potters wouldn't happen, and good riddance. With the second, I don't know: it misses some overarching plot and story, it is so far just an amalgamation of various headcannons thrown together. Any ideas?
