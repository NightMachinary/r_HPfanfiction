:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember everyone is given a number and not allowed to meet their parents until they are an adult, everyone is raised in government buildings. Harry is told his parents died, they did not but lily divorced James, I can't remember why. It has 7 books and it is complete. Edit, found it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12895184/1/Harry-No-5-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone]] Edit, good thing I linked it because I lost it again. That fic really does have a general wrong feeling throughout, harry blindly trusting authority because it's how everyone is tought being an example.


** Looks interesting. Can you tell us some more things about it? Does Voldemort still exist? What's the situation with muggleborns and the statute? What's your opinion on the story, is it worth reading?

*** So so late but... Voldemort still exists and so does the statute. It is especially depressing that by the epilogue, nothing has changed. It makes it feel overall kind of grim.
