** This is one thing that really bugs me in a lot of fanfics that deviate prior to first year. When Harry makes his own way to the station or goes really early/late. He should NOT coincidently get there at the same time as the Weasleys.

*** Yep, though you could add that to the part of "weird happenings", they just happen to get there and loudly exclaim about muggles, and what is the platform number even though she went there herself and her own children have too.

**** I sort of thought of it as a way Molly might be used to keeping the younger kids entertained/engaged when out doing various tasks (though certainly by 10 and 11 it might be overkill). I know when I am out and about with my nieces and nephew, asking constant questions as we went ("where was that turn again?" "what were the 3 things we needed from the grocery store?" "what section did we park the car in again?") kept them engaged.

**** He also talked with Draco in Madame Malkin's shop, and didn't like him. Along with Draco spouting Slytherin pride in that conversation, that might have already put Harry off of Slytherin. Meeting Ron and Draco's actions on the train just cemented it, I think.
