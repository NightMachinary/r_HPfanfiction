**** I don't think I've /ever/ seen a fic which pairs Harry with a Ravenclaw boy so maybe you could consider that

**** I would also suggest slash here. Because at the point Susan, Padma, hell even Su, is there overused. Try Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, Micheal Corner or maybe some Hufflepuffs.

***** He needn't be paired with someone in the same year, either. There's a few named but barely used characters within two years of Harry. Marcus Belby, for example

***** Huh. Thanks for your input. Any advice on how to write slash? I've never done it so that's why I was leaning towards a boy/girl pairing

****** It's honestly the same thing. I think a lot of people trip over it because they think it's different but it's really not.

Take a het ship, let's say Hinny. They're spending some time together and Harry gives a transfigured rose. It's the same thing in slash. They give each other gifts, flowers, and chocolates. Naturally it depends on the personality but it's generally the same thing.

As for never having written slash....well there's a first time for everything!

****** The key difference is that you shouldn't put them in male/female boxes. Either modify the relationship moments to be equal (split pay for the date) or let them take turns (one person invites to Hogsmeade, the other plans a picnic by the lake). Since you'll probably be focusing on a plot rather than the relationship just be clear in your narration that they are equals. Leave the more complex dynamics for when you're more experienced.

You seem to want the LI to be independent as well, so make sure that they have their own motivation for the relationship as well.

** I think Tracy Davis can have her own story. You can play the good old "She is a half blood in a house full of blood purists etc" But add the fact that she's talented and knows how to stand her ground so she is /grudgingly/ accepted.

I know what I wrote just now sounds super cringe, in the end I think Tracy Davis is the one OC character who's underused and has a good potential for a story.

Another one I can think of is Katie Bell. Another underused character with some potential.
