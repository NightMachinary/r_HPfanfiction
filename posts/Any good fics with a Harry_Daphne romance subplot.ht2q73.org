Looking for a fic that the romance isn't the main aspect of the story but it's still there. I read fics that a really good relationship building but they can be boring. Hopefully looking for a fic that has a bit of adventure preferably complete.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.
