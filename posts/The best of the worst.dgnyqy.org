There are the types of fics you hate on principle never touched it never will.

But then theres the second kind. The kind you grew to hate over time. The ones you actually read alot of before you got sick of it. Sometimes you wonder if its really that bad and you go back . For a while its good. Then you remember why you hate it.

But even if you do you know there are some of that type of fic thats good you dont hate reading it at leasy not entirely.

So thats the rec i want

The best fic about your least favorite ship, or least favorite type of story, or least favorite character etc.


** The popularity of Harry-Snape bonding fics (let alone fics where Snape is Harry's biological father) has always been utterly baffling to me, because Harry has so many /actual/ psudeo-parents - Sirius, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Lupin, even McGonagall - and yet fandom chose the one adult other than the Dursleys that Harry can't stand as the most popular mentor/father figure. I just... why fandom, why?

But I have a massive soft spot for found family as a trope, which means I've read more of these types of fics than I really want to admit to. Of all of them, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278297][The Guiltless]] linkao3(278297) and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278303][The Poor of God]] linkao3(278303) are probably the only ones I would rec without reservation. (I'm actually kind of annoyed by how good they are, because I'd give quite a lot to have a fic of similar caliber with a more logical choice of parental figure.)

** Anything by Robst on FFnet.

You may know him as the author of "Harry Crow."

I liked how simple his stories were, until I began reading more and more to the point that if I saw a sentence he had written, I probably would have recognised it. Not because I have learnt his stories by heart, but because all his sentences are so identical. He has no idea how to diversify his writing.

I could never read past chapter 2 of Harry Crow, but I did like some of his other stories. Until I tried again. And couldn't go beyond the initial chapter or two.

Guess he is one of those authors you can only enjoy in small doses.

** HPMOR is #1 for me. I was pulled into the hype, as it was recommended as the best of HP fanfic, best for readers looking to get a start into fanfic. I liked the /idea/ of Smart Harry who uses his magic and magical tools (Invisibility Cloak, Time Turners) effectively. But I eventually lost my like of it because I realized that the premise was dumb, the characters' unlikeability overruled their effectiveness to the point I didn't care how smart they were when I couldn't stand reading about them, and a lot of the writing was smarmy and wank.

I tried re-reading it and I... just couldn't. In hindsight, I hadn't realized how silly it was that Harry (JPEV, pbuh) was so rational because Petunia drank a potion that made her hot, and that won her a science professor husband. What the hell.

To this day, I am reluctant to read fics that market themselves as "rational", even though I liked them once upon a time, and binged on the HPMOR spinoffs and lookalikes. There can be stories with logical characters and plots, but if the author makes a point of putting it in the summary ("Smart!Harry") I probably won't read it because I have turned away from Smug Harry for good.

  Draco's rape comment for Hermione (I think) and Harry's determination to befriend this person.
#+end_quote

That is a complete misreading of that chapter. Harry isn't impressed by Draco's plan; he's horrified. He spends the next several seconds trying to cough up the drink he just choked on. However, once he's able to speak, his next few questions confirm that the court system is easily cheated with mind magic, doesn't use things like DNA evidence, and the Malfoys basically own enough of it to get themselves out of trouble and destroy their accuser. At this point, Harry's internal monologue is considering how to either take over magical Britain or simply tear it down; he even considers whether the flaws in the French Revolution were something fixable. He doesn't yet have the power to do anything substantial, though.

Steering Draco into a better path is more of a backup plan, a way to protect Luna (not Hermione btw) a few years down the track. And it's a long, difficult, and sometimes extremely painful road, but Harry perseveres and does manage to open Draco's eyes to the fact that people who are different from you are still people.

Without testing it or other verification. He accepts the word of a rapist-to-be and wants his friendship while a few moments ago rejecting Ron as somehow unworthy of existence. And that's usually the extent of Harry and his attempts at scientific exploration of magic

#+end_quote

There's not much sign of this in the chapter. Harry never thinks to himself that if he makes a fuss, he might lose a friend.

What we do see is internal monologue like:

#+begin_quote
  /I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms./
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  /if Draco doesn't change his mind about wanting revenge, and I don't throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry some poor crazy girl, then all I've just bought is time, and not too much of it.../

  For one girl. Not for others.

  /I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top blood purists and kill them./
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  /Aren't we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and already coaxing your prey from hiding.../

  Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon.
#+end_quote

After which he proceeds to challenge Draco's assumptions and undermine his worldview, showing him things like the moon landing (Draco had no idea Muggles were capable of such things - wizards haven't been to the moon - and he's taken aback).

*** Well, there is more divergence than just the potion, really. But, you don't need to like it.

Possibly the best take I've seen on making a story rational, without turning the characters into arrogant and unlikeable prodigies, would be linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species). It's slow paced and far from complete, but updates steadily, first day of each month.

Summary: The Dark Lord has fallen, but an even more terrible force has arisen to take over the Ministry of Magic -- the Pink Lord. Ruling with an abundance of ruffles and terrifyingly sharp stiletto heels, Umbridge's Think Pink Brigade terrorizes a populace grown weary of decrees designed to enforce sweetness.
