It's alright. I think the chapter is too short for how much information you packed into it. We're barely introduced to who Harry is at this point in time when you already dive into exposition and banter. We're introduced to Gabrielle and then he drinks some potion we know nothing about and then he's on some battlefield and I just found myself asking "What... what just happened? Why? Who?"

Which is also why I almost didn't finish it. I don't like not knowing so much. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and assumed that was just part of the ride.

As of now, I'd withhold much more critique. Your writing is solid, so I'd give the next chapter a look before deciding if I'll read it or not.
