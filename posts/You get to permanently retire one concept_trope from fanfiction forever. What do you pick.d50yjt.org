** The smirk. Oh my god, the smirk. Why does every male love interest never know how to move his mouth in any other way? Do people even know what a smirk actually is? Why do they do it when they're trying to be sexy or alluring?? I'm reminded of that quote from The Princess Bride "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." every single time. Inconceivable!

**** Oh I'm positive it is, and a smirk really doesn't mean flirtatious so I'm left going ??? Unless of course they're being a jerk or flirting in a horrible way, but I see it during romantic exchanges too when it has no business being there. It's the extensive overuse that always leads to it being used incorrectly, and it's always a character who's a "player" or a "badass". My own personal rule is if you've used the word smirk more than once for a single character in a scene... could be time to cut back. And a classic "teasing/flirtatious/entertained quirk/curl/tug of the lips" can go a long way.

Well...his upbringing probably /does/ have a lot to do with it. Especially in such an insular culture. Doesn't mean he shouldn't face consequences, but IMO a well-executed redemption arc is plausible. My personal favorites on that front are linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and sequels for a serious (but long) version, and linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) for a lighthearted one.

******* > Innocent features an alternate Gryffindor Draco who hasn't actually done anything wrong

You mean that when his parents deliberately conditioned him to cultivate Gryffindor traits so he could make useful contacts for them within Gryffindor, since they already had another son to send to Slytherin, it worked? Bearing in mind that they /never told their sons what they were doing/, just left Draco to get confused and isolated from his older brother and land in Gryffindor against all his expectations?

I think that strengthens my point about "Draco's evil was in large measure due to his upbringing" rather than undermining it.

**** The only one I've bothered reading is linkffn(The Green in the Grey)

The intial premise for separating them makes sense, both brothers are damaged when Voldemort attacks them, Charlie's (Harry's younger brother) magical ability was damaged due to the dark magic of the Horcrux ritual, and the Horcrux in Harry's scar would have severely harmed him. So Harry needed to grow up separated from him in order to not hurt his brother.

Harry's magic and the Horcrux were bound (not to make him super OP later on, just because the Horcrux would possess him otherwise) so Harry needed to grow up in a non-magical environment as to not disturb the binding. Thus Harry went to the Dursleys.

The thing that really screws up this set up is that the author created a second option that was promptly ignored by Dumbledore, and then the Potters. For some reason Dumbledore needs Harry to go to the Dursleys, even when Sirius says he can wear magical suppressors, live like a Muggle, and raise Harry that way. Nobody says the suppressors wouldn't work, and it's not like Dumbledore needs Harry to be abused to fulfill the prophecy or anything like that (he doesn't even think he'll be mistreated there), he just wants to send him to the Dursleys for no real reason when Sirius could raise him.

So he basically obliviates Sirius and compulses him to go on a trip around the world, then convinces the Potters to send Harry to the Dursleys. Harry is abused, and the Black family ends up taking in Harry after Sirius's memory charms are broken. The Potters regret their decision almost immediately, Dumbledore manipulates them and memory charms them to think they're visiting Harry (this part isn't actually that poorly written, it's an in too deep scenario after Harry's been taken by Sirius and he's trying to cover things up), and the Potters aren't bashed. But still a pretty retarded set up, and Dumbledore doesn't really receive any kind of comeuppance when all of this is revealed.

Other than that rocky start though, it's pretty good and at least makes some sense as to how everything happened, other than the contrived Dumbledore shit.

He's kind of presented as an everyman in canon, yet he's the youngest Seeker in a century, the chosen one, a Parselmouth, can see Thestrals, can produce a corporeal Patronus at 13, has rare wand components and a rare combination, is the master of Death, stinking rich with multiple other rare shinies in his life. He has plenty already without being more powerful than Merlin, gaining several titles and wizengamot seats, plus several more vaults, having a massive harem lusting after him, etc. It's absurd.

Two Hallows were literally given to him by Dumbledore, and the third he took from Voldemort's dead body. Because Voldemort was carrying the idiot ball and tried to attack him directly, after Harry explained exactly why that wouldn't work.

Well, in comparison to the Weasleys, yes. It's never clear in canon just how his wealth compares to the world in general, and he never really exploits it. Not much of a source of OP-ness.

I don't think canon Harry is especially overpowered. I dislike OP-Harry stories simply because it's usually poor writing, not because I think he's already OP enough.

Seriously, if you don't want Ron to be a major character in your fic, then that's fine, but for the love of gods, find a way to take him out of the picture that doesn't involve turning him into a red-headed Malfoy.

And as for Dumbledore, if you want to make him into an antagonist, then by all means, go ahead, but if you do so, give him more complexity than being obsessed with the prophecy and controlling Harry. Not to mention that every single manipulative Dumbledore just ends up floundering once indy!Harry escapes his control, even though Dumbledore is far older and supposedly has decades of experience manipulating people.

** If Frodo gets a lightsaber, Sauron gets the Death Star. My problem with this trope is that it is often misused, or used in such a horrible way to make the story unpleasant to read. Many authors just give random powers to Voldemort without much explanation why or reasoning. HPMOR is an example where the author did it right.

**** *Brownie (folklore)*

A brownie or broonie (Scots), also known as a brùnaidh or gruagach (Scottish Gaelic), is a household spirit from British folklore that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other offering for the brownie, usually by the hearth. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants.

No, you don't need to have every spell bolded, italicized, and written in all caps. Also, Latin doesn't have soft Cs, so it's actually pronounced "in-ken-dee-oh," not "in-cen-dee-oh."

** Slow burn. I completely understand that romance doesn't happen in a month. But holy hell, Soul Scars is great but so fucking slow that its only mid fourth year I believe and past like 900k words.

*** /Unfinished/ slow burn. If you read a satisfying slow burn story that's completed or regularly updated you can enjoy it. But if you're halfway through and suddenly you're at the last chapter, from 2015, and no life sign of the author ever since, then slow burn romance is one of the most frustrating genres.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
