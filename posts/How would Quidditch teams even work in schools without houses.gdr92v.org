For example, would Beauxb√¢tons make a team for each country it accepts students from or would they just be clubs? Would those schools even have Quidditch teams? Can someone help this poor little nerd who abhors sports but still asks himself existential questions about them?


** one thing I find weird is, wizarding britian has a dozen or so quidditch teams on the professional level

but hogwarts only has four teams, which means oliver wood has no reason to panic, as he would be picked up by a team due to the lack of options anyway

*** Perhaps professional teams recruit a lot of foreign players, like the Premier League does!

***** Maybe smaller countries don't have a league that is as high standard / well paid so their very good players go countries with competitive leagues, Perhaps some countries are too small to have a league, or maybe not many people play quidditch in that country.

*** Wizards age slower and stay reasonably fit into high age, even Dumbledore weakened by poison was able to keep up with Harry on a broom and was even slightly faster than him.

I could honestly believe that once a professional quidditch team accepted someone, it can take decades for that position to become free again.

Linkffn(Loose Cannon)

It's a really good fic that takes that question into account.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** You could have a club(s) with upper years as captains picking their teams.

My idea for Durmstrang was that each student was assigned an advisory professor and each professor had their own team, so there ended up being like eight teams.

** I'd like to imagine clubs could have Junior teams sponsored at school, and you'd try and play for your local one but could go to a more popular one if they asked you, kinda like football in England at the moment. Could be an interesting mechanic to see 'played out' in a fanfic.

** I find the Hogwarts method of intra-school teams that only play 3 games a year to be extremely unrealistic to then immediately jump into a professional season with weekly games. My headcanon is that there exists some kind of inter-school conference since there's no issue with distance. In the summers there could be a league as well made from local clubs and each pro team would have a youth developmental academy.
