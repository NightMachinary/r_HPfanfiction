:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read about a year ago on FF.net,

It was an after the war fic, Hermione centric. Draco and Hermione were working together and being friendly. Harry has disappeared and Draco was working on becoming a potions master and rehabilitating himself into society?


** This is flaired incorrectly. "What's That Fic?" would be more appropriate.

**** Don't worry about it - easy mistake! A flair is the text in the grey box below the title by the way.
