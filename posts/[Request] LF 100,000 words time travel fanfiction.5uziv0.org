I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord]] a few years ago, and I couldn't help but think that the author had done a commendable job of writing an exemplary piece of fanfiction. Sure, it could have a lot of cliches, but he's taken the basic spirit of fanfiction -- take an author's work and world, and build on top of it -- and made it great.

The sequel is incomplete and quite disappointing, so I wondered if there were any such fanfictions like it out there, where it's not just a basic rehashing of canon. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time To Spare by EmySabath]] is a great timetravel fanfiction as well that doesn't rehash canon.

No slash, OC pairings are fine -- but no Mary Sues

Thanks in advance! :)


** My favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]. The time travel is really really well written and the characters are great. It's one of my all time favorites. The pairing is Sirius/Hermione eventually but it isn't graphic at all or a main part of the story. linkao3(1124404)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]], linkffn(7525570), is how time-turner-travel should be done. Hermione and Ginny's romance was also well written. I especially like the part about the consequence of their relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717), is different than most time travels, but highly interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is an interesting time travel. It doesn't focus so much on time traveler's primary objective (defeating Voldemort and his supporters), but more on the traveler's reintegration into the new reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is a great 'timeline, what timeline' curb-stomp time travel. Harry finished off most of his enemies well before he entered Hogwarts, and the rest is really more about him having fun with his girls.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** linkffn(Pride of Time) and its companion linkffn(Divide of Time) are my favorite SSHG time travel fics. Due to a Time Turner incident in her 5th year, Hermione is sent back into the 1970s and has to live her life until it is 1995 again. Pride of Time is a canon rehash, but the companion Divide of Time picks off at a certain point and diverges fully from canon.

  Begins at chapter 31 of Pride-of-Time. Hermione does not de-age herself- not everything can be fixed in time, and sometimes the only solution is to move forward with what you have...
