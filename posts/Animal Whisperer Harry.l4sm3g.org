Any storys where harry is really in tune with animals (not just snakes but all animals) maybe not to the point of talking (like snakes) but just KNOWING what they want or need?


** This is Harry/Voldemort but it's an AU. He's not evil and Harry's parents are still alive.

  The Dark Lord wanted a consort and had decided to host a competition that involved nearly everyone in Britain. If they thought they were good enough, they could enter to compete in a certain amount of tasks set by the Lord of the lands himself. Only the victor would have the skills necessary to become Voldemort's consort. Harry unfortunately nabs the Dark Lord's attention. Voldemort does as he pleases.Hermione enters to win, Bellatrix takes interest in certain people, and of course there's the villain causing trouble.A/N: SLASH/Harrymort/AU. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how this sounds like Harry is a slave. Please do so. Nothing at all would suggest it. How about we don't assume that because the word "consort" is involved, it must *obviously* be about slavery. Does anyone actually know what a consort is?

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
