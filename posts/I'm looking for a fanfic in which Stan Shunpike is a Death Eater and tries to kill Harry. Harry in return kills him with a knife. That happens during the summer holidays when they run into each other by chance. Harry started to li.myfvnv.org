#+TITLE: I'm looking for a fanfic in which Stan Shunpike is a Death Eater and tries to kill Harry. Harry in return kills him with a knife. That happens during the summer holidays when they run into each other by chance. Harry started to live with Sirius after year 3 and he might be a Ravenclaw.

It's been a while since I read this fanfiction. The Stan Shunpike killing scene is the only detail I'm sure of. I'm also pretty sure that it's on AO3. Anyone knows which one it is?
