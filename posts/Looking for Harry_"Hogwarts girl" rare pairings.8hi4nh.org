Do you know any somewhat decent (or at least guilty pleasure quality) stories where Harry, during his Hogwarts time, get's together with another girl he is rarely shipped with? Preferably a romantic relationship, but I'd take something casual as well, as long as it is outside of a harem.

And with rarely shipped I mean characters like Leanne, Penelope Clearwater or Hestia Carrow, NOT Susan Bones or Daphne Greengrass.

Obviously no slash and please no absurd bashing fics.


** a pretty good Harry/Angelina one from about a decade ago. it was never finished but it advances the relationship pretty far, enough to satisfy. afaik its only available on archive.org now

** I've got a Neville/Pansy and a Neville/OC that both take place at Hogwarts. Isn't exactly what you described but they are both rather well written. I can link them if you'd like.

**** linkffn(9738656)

In my opinion the best romance in the fandom. Neville/Graces Malfoy. Slow build up, believable interactions, and a look behind the scenes at how Death Eaters live. Very well done. WIP. I don't see this fic recced much and its a shame because its so damn good.

linkffn(7414595)

Heart warming. Tolerable writing and a rather well constructed story. Neville/Pansy. Complete.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

  If you look into the broken pieces and cannot find your reflection, the magic of seven years bad luck will take effect. In the spring of '91, Neville Longbottom broke a mirror. And in their 8th year, Pansy Parkinson broke one too. Neville/Pansy

  During the summer after his fourth year, after Uncle Vernon beats Harry, the only thing that keeps him going is thinking about Hermione's kiss at the train station. But once the authorities intervene, he is sent to live among the Muggles, where he learns about life and love. But will this help him win Hermione's heart?

That does not sound like a Parvati ship.
