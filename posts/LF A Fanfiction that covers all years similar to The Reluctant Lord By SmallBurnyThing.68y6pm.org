I'm looking for a fan-fiction where Harry isn't lazy. He has to take every useful class he can. I would prefer he be on par eventually with dumbledore and voldemort. Essentially, I want a Harry with his own minions, taken to the extreme. I want the pairing to be Harry/Hermione preferred. Luna is also good. And most of all, it should cover 1st to 7th year. I also don't want Ron to be a close friend.

*** I am up to date on that story, and while it is good, I'm looking for a serious one, with a Harry that's not really in Slytherin. Always thought that sorting was weird.

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Five years of intense study and trying to survive has come to its inevitable conclusion and everything's gone to hell in a handcart. A smut fic that got a little too much plot for its own good. AU. - Discontinued -
