Are there any fics that take place completely outside of Britannia with no bullshit gotta go to Hogwarts or stop Mr.scared of death. because honestly why would Harry stay in Britain.


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup]]) has Harry leaving Hogwarts so he won't have to compete in the triwizard tournament. And then leaving Britain altogether.

It's been a while since I read it though. I can't remember how good it was.

It was still set partly in Britain.

  Harry never put his name in the cup. No one would believe him, so he leaves Hogwarts searching for a way to fight the wizarding contract, using the thing that holds him to it; the law.

** There is an old DrT story where Harry was adopted and went o America called Tabitha to the rescue. There is the Bobmin356 that kinda fits called Power of the Press. And if you are in the mood for a crossover, there is a fic called Invincible TechnoMage that is a Marvel comics cross-over where Harry is adopted by Tony Stark.
