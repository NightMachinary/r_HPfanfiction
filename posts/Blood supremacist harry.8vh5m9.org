** Not /quite/ what you're looking for, but close. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has Harry viscerally disliking Muggles (for believable reasons), but no issue with Muggleborns and no belief in blood purity. He's also close friends with Hermione :\

Edit: Switched "understandable" to "believable" because I can't really agree with his views, but I can understand why he has them.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
