I read this fiction long ago and really liked it. Recently in a post someone suggested this and I tried to reread it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't after a couple of chapters. If it was a crack fic like Reunion, I suppose I could finish it. But as it is, I couldn't read past idiot Ron, idiotic Sirius, glorifying Snape and Malfoys, bad guy Dumbledore, etc.

Does anyone else feel similar about while rereading a fiction that one previously liked?


** Yes! I recently rediscovered linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4816968/1/Do-Not-Meddle-In-The-Affairs-Of-Wizards]]) which I loved ten years ago, it was my favourite 'Harry is betrayed/goes to Azkaban' fic by /far/.

I found it again around Christmas I think and OMG... So cringy, so awful... Every single time Dumbledore is mentioned it's 'Dumbledork'...

Yep

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

** Bashing doesn't seem to age well. It seems to tip over into melodrama easily.

And it might be my preference speaking, but to me, gen ages better than shippy stories.

** I'm reading it now (for the first time) but I don't think I'm going to finish it. I was able to read it for a while just because I wanted to get to the part where harry and tom get together, but I agree with you that it's quite full of tropes. Now that they've gotten together, and now that they have, that tension is pretty much gone for me. And its abandoned, so I'm not sure I can justify reading the whole 300k just to have an unfinished ending.

** Yeah, A Cadmean Victory, it was my favorite fanfiction back in the day, it was like the best thing since sliced bread, I read it today and is not awful, just kinda meh

about " *Again and Again",* imo it has its moments, I love the "first" meeting between Harry and Dumbledore and when Harry reveals to Snape what he is. Unfortunately, I don't really like slash so I stopped reading when the focus started to shift in that direction
