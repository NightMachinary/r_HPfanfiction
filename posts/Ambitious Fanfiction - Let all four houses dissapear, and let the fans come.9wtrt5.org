** Hundreds of students suddenly develop an unhealthy interest in Harry's love life and clumsily attempt to get him together with the witch of their choice. Fights break out between proponents of Hermione, Ginny, and Daphne, with the latter being rather mystified by it all as she had never spoke a single word to Potter in her life.

Gringotts is swamped with requests for inheritance tests and suggestions of "clever" moneymaking schemes.

Snape hands out detentions by the dozen to students too cool and independent to keep their head down. A few hours of scrubbing cauldrons by hand, and things quickly return to normal in his class. Well, save for a large part of female population making eyes at him for some inexplicable reason.

There's that one guy who won't shut up about scoring some Gillyweed and taking a dip in the Black Lake. One day he disappears only to come back with a punctured butt cheek. Rumor has it the Merchieftainess stabbed him with a trident for molesting her daughter.
