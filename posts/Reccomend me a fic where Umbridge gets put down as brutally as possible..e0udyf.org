Basically what the title says. I want to see a fic where people don't take Umbirdge's shit and put her down like the rabid bitch she is. Preferably slowly, painfully, and publicly. Must include torture or public execution.

*** Let's be honest, out of everyone in the show it's between her and bellatrix for who deserves it the most, with Riddle in third

**** I think that riddle only goes after bellatrix because we spend so much time trying to understand voldie. That much time focused on understanding subtly starts building empathy.

I can't remember the exact quote, but in THBP Dumbledore calls harry out for this exact thing during their investigation into Tom's origin.

I put voldie above because of his sanity.

Bellatrix is just rabid. Tom still chooses to.

****** Though calling her insane can absolve her of her actions.

I think it's more apt to call Voldemort a psychopath, indifferent to the suffering of others. By contrast, Bellatrix and Umbridge are sadists who get off on it.

...Alright, what about making her sign a binding magical contract to be a menial labor slave?\\

Um, see if a giant wants to pulverize her?\\
*"Me no like being stereotyped as a dumb violent brute."*\\
What about cleaning up dragon dung for Gringotts?\\
"That stuff's valuable as fertilizer and we don't want that cretin anywhere near our customer's vaults!"\\
...Feed her to dementors?\\

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-196/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] does not quite end with her dead, but it has a serious humiliation conga. And bear in mind that it's an AU without magic, so she can't easily fix any of what happens to her. >! She gets dumped in a septic tank when she tries to take over the Headmaster's office, and the press is there to film it; the twins dose her with substances that make her stink like dead fish, but take away her own sense of smell so she doesn't realise it for days; she crosses the wrong teacher (an original character) and is forced at knife point to soil herself in apology; she's repeatedly caught out in her extralegal attempts to interrogate the Golden Trio, leading to her eventual removal from the school in disgrace; her house is blown up and evidence is planted to make it look like a meth lab; and she is exposed to enough radiation that by the end of the story she's had a double mastectomy and is on chemo and is in hiding from the woman who made her soil herself!<. And as the icing, throughout all of this, Hermione has Umbridge convinced that Hermione is entirely loyal to her and a useful ally, when half the time Hermione is the one sticking the knife in and the other half she's twisting it.

** Chapter 12 had them dealing with Umbridge.

Sick, twisted, perverse---that would be Severus Snape. And yet, his blindly obedient little soldier boy ran away, and to guess who? (Features abused!Harry, creature!Harry, sadistic!Harry.)
