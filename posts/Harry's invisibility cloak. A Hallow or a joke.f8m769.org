In the tales of the three brothers, it is said that the youngest brother Ignotus peverell asked for a cloak that would make him invisible to everyone, even hide from death itself.

Then what good is the deathly hallow- the invisibility cloak , if Harry cannot hide from the likes of Dumbledore. Even Moody's magical eye was able to see through Harry's cloak. If the Elder wand was so 'unbeatable', then how did Dumbledore defeat Gellert Grindelwald and take the Elder wand from him.

I think that the deathly hallows are complete shite and are nothing special. And there cannot be a master of death, it is just a figment of creative imagination by superstitious wizards. The deathly hallows are only some magical artifacts made by three brilliant and powerful wizards.

What do you think? If you believe in the power of hallows then convince me.


** It was made obvious in the book that the story of the brothers and the master of death thing is BS.

*** I imagine they are all masively powerful artifacts.

the elder wand was a powerful wand that got more powerful as it was constantly used instead of being only used by one wizard

I imagine the three hallows together might give the user some power as grindalwald and young dumbledore wanted to assemble them.

but then young dumbledore could have belived in the legends of the hallows while older dumbledore is more dismissive of them

** I mean, in a strict canon sense, you're right. It's just a story attached to some old doodads that're vaguely more powerful than most others of their kind.

It is a lot more interesting if the Master of Death title actually means something though. Having it just be a hollow (heh) story is quite dull, especially with the breadth of English Historical Literature and Mythology that plays with powerful items in highly interesting ways.

**** Heh. Yep, it certainly does. Well, half my name. The other is the death year of Gustav II Adolph in Lutzen.

** They were given by Death as a trick and in turn Death being tricked. Whether they unlock a great power when united is a matter of question, but they proved to be powerful things and also tricky ones, trying to catch those who wish the to cheat death. They are cursed objects.

The Elder wand made the wielder a braggart and he should be always anticipate attack on his person from someone who wants The Elder wand, for him Death becomes a liberation.

The Resurrection Stone is a suicidal aid, it made people forget living and yearn for the death.

Then there is The Invisibility Cloak, it made the wearer reckless, invincible, yet it always failed to protect him when he needed it. It was not there at all.

Harry was not a expert user of the Cloak, People cannot see, but perspective people like Dumbledore., Moody/Crouch Jr can always look into those things that does not want to be seen.

** My headcanon is that Dumbledore and Moody can't see through the cloak but they can see... sense?... magic and they see the absolute void that the cloak leaves. And they then deduce that the empty space must be Harry under the cloak.

​

...

​

That or Dumbledore put a tracking charm on it and Moody can't see the cloak but he can see the charm attached to it.

*** Actually the empty void devoid of any magic, in a school full of ambient magic makes sense.

** I think they're neither. But if anyone wants to convince themselves that, Hallows are real deal, they can do so by coming up with explanation such as, Hallows only work as intended, (in full power) for the one who becomes MoD

** As far as we know, it's a really good invisibility cloak. I guess that Dumbledore probably put a tracking charm on it while he had it that allowed him to detect it even if he couldn't see through it.

*** I think the invisibility cloak was just that in the beginning. It didn:t became a hallow unto Rowling needed that. I mean it is really weak for a hallow and even James and Co. Map could see thought it

** Yes. But my question is to those people who believe in Hallows and think that harry is master of death. There are lots of fics with harry as the master of death and use the hallows for some otherworldly magic.
