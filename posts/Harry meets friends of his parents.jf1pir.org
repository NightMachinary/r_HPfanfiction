I just got finished reading All The Young Dudes on AO3, and I am now completely obsessed with the idea of Harry meeting friends of his parents, outside of Sirius and Remus.

Form my understanding, in ATYD Mary McDonald lives and has a kid a few years younger than Harry. Are there any fics with this in mind? Doesn't have to be a raising Harry fic!

I just need serotonin.

Edit: Adding this request, does anyone have any fics in the ATYD universe?

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** Not in the All The Young Dudes universe, but linkffn(To Become a Muggle by lifebitten) has Harry meeting one of Lily's friends. It happens pretty late in the story, though.
