I know I'm usually one of the go-to people on this sub for giving Harry/Luna recs (at least, I feel like I am), so it's a bit embarrassing to admit that I can't remember this one fic for the life of me.

I'm 90% certain that I read it on FFN rather than AO3. Other than that, the only detail I remember is that Harry was furious about Luna not receiving any recognition for her part in the battle at the Ministry, so he wrote a letter to /The Daily Prophet/ demanding that she receive credit for her bravery.

I'm pretty sure that the story took place while they were still at Hogwarts, but it may also have taken place during a post-Hogwarts reunion. If this rings a bell with anyone, please let me know.


** Sounds like "Ravenclaw Cutie."

Of course, there could be any number of Harry/Luna fanfics with this storyline, but that's the one I remember.

*** That's the one! Thanks!

(Not the highest-quality story, tbh, but still glad to have found it again.)
