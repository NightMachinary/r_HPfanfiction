** The best SI fanfic I can think of, and it's being updated regularly (as in, about once a week) is the very appropriately-named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/1/Why-Time-Travel-Should-Be-Illegal-and-Other-Morals][Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals]] written by [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]].

**** I'm not sure that matters, really. It's not as if the author hid that from anyone, or brought it in from out of nowhere. He lets the reader know from the start what he believes.

***** I tried to read the fic too, but the way the Autor wrote about the MCs faith turned me off rather quick. Even though it's not a main focus of the story, those monologues break the emersion and feel general unnatural because they don't drive the plot. Instead it makes it feel like someone's trying to "subtly" convert you by endlessly praising that lifestyle whereas whenever there should be related plot and religious conflict (e. g. Christianity denouncing Magic; historic witch hunts in relation to modern wizardry) the author just skips it over without explanations or even a mention of possible conflict.

A more differentiated take on the magic-religion relation would have made that story awesome but the chosen path just makes me cringe.
