Looking for fics where harry and ginny got together before hbp or earlier in hbp than canon, and they're longer than one chapter.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter Happily Ever After by PotterFanSteve) a very fluffy and long fanfic. It's very much perfectly happy after the war and there's a sequel too. If you're looking for something easy to read but easy to put away for a while too, this may be it.

  HEA follows Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and their family and friends from the day after the war through to the Deathly Hallows Epilogue. The New Marauders picks up this story from the end of HEA, and continues the storyline with their kids and friends.

** Do they need to be complete? I rather liked linkffn(You Can Go With Harry, And I'll Just), where Ginny didn't already agree to go to the ball with Neville, and ends up going with Harry, but it hasn't updated in a while.

On the other hand, linkffn(A Friend Indeed by kb0) is decent albeit quite short. Ginny steps up to help Harry during fourth year when Ron is giving him the cold shoulder.

If you're okay with really old fics, linkffn(Carpe Diem by Imogen) was published before Order of the Phoenix, so it's highly divergent. Perhaps less fluffy than some, but it has some interesting ideas.

  What if Ginny hadn't already agreed to go to the Yule Ball with Neville?

  During Harry's fourth year, what if Ginny had asked Harry how he was feeling when her brother turned his back on Harry? What if she had tried to befriend him then? How would that have affected Harry and his other friends? To cover Harry's fourth year.

  Why is Harry using the Imperius Curse on Ginny? What is Voldemort up to this time? The fifth year at Hogwarts, and a time of changing relationships amongst the characters.
