So unless i'm going completely mad I'm almost certain that the very common "glamour charm for disguising myself at the drop of a hat" with all the associated pros and cons (easily dispelled, can pretty much disguise you as anyone) not only isn't a canon spell but also violates a huge amount of what we see in canon when it comes to disguising yourself magically of which I remember 3 main methods

1. Polyjuice potion -the immediate obvious answer, described as highly complex, a preparation time of a month, locked away in the restricted section and also needing ready access to whoever you choose to disguise yourself as. With this, the fanon detectable/dispellable glamour completely (a) makes polyjuice useless and (b) completely goes against the ethos of that bit of worldbuilding to begin with

2. Human transfiguration - We see this briefly mentioned in HBP meaning it is NEWT level magic, newt level transfiguration no less and again throughout canon it is emphasised that transfiguration is one of the hardest subjects (an easy glamour doesnt fit in there) and also isnt easily dispelled, Harry goes to the slug club party with a yellow eyebrow. If its that hard to simply change the colour of one body part (hair at that!) changing the multiple subtle features on a face would be easily outside of any students skillset (marauders excluded)

3. Being a metamorphmagus - Again a bit of a gimme on the arguments here but I'll summarise, its an inheritable trait only, though presumably was originally a form of very skilled wandless transfiguration that either naturally or intentionally was made into bloodline ability. Furthermore it is extremely rare with only two cited characters in text and is also heavily implied to predominantly appear in just one family.

Thats more or less my initial thoughts on the matter, a quick and dirty counter argument i would make is, sometimes you just need a magical disguise mcguffin for your plot to work and you use the glamour spell as effective substitution for the above. Finally I wanted to say, this is by no means an exhaustive list so please point out anything I may have missed.

*** The thing is, they do affect the user's appearance. While this does delve a bit deeper into fanfic than a canon-centric discussion, I read rather good fanfic that explored how objects are enchanted. It turned out that the metamorph-medals weren't fakes; they were only really underpowered. The enchantment was there; it was just too weak to do much of anything. Pity I can't remember it; I'd like to reread it. Does anyone have a link?

** In a system with more difficult, harder-to-detect methods of disguise, I usually look at Glamour Charms as the really shite version - basically the magical equivalent of using the longer parts of your hair to pretend you have a beard.

Anyone with a brain will notice you're using one, but if you have a good plan and can distract them from paying full attention to you, you can pass unrecognised. Equally, if you're really good with them, you can use a lot of them to change your appearance considerably (but most people aren't that good - people like that internet woman who turned herself into Jack Sparrow are rare indeed).

** I fail to see from your description how it "violates a huge amount of what we see in canon when it comes to disguising yourself magically".

It is extremely easy to justify the existence of glamours in a canon/canon-adjacent work, while still having the three main methods you describe as the primary ones used. How? Simple, by looking at the first point of glamours you describe... that they're easily dispellable.

In my mind, glamours fit fairly well within charms already. There's a color changing charm, concealment charms, disillusion... Why not a glamour, then? Illusion magic doesn't seem out of place in the Harry Potter world, and having it be a more temporary/easier to detect or dispell type of magic explains enough of why it's not used too commonly.

Also to note on human transfiguration, that is likely not the only way to use magic to change hair color - its difficulty doesn't mean that a color-changing charm, for instance, would be as difficult. Simply that the method for human transfiguration is much more difficult. Harry was supposed to use it in his Charm OWL to change a rat's color, so we know it can be used on living creatures.

** I think the only example in canon of someone using a non-polyjuice disguise is whatever Hermione did to Ron when they broke into Gringotts. It was probably a form of human transfiguration though.

I like the idea of glamours being essentially the magical equivalent of makeup. You can make some small changes to how you look (adding or changing colors, hiding blemishes and wrinkles, small alterations to facial structure, and so on), but you can't really disguise yourself. Or at least not any better than a muggle stage makeup artist could, which might be good enough, depending on what you need to do.

**** Sure, but it will take them a lot of time, effort, and skill to actually make you unrecognizable. And if that's also true for glamours, that's fine by me. Besides, if all you want is to not be recognized, you could just put on (or magically grow) a fake beard and some glasses and maybe change your hairstyle.

But makeup artists will still have a lot of trouble making you look exactly like a specific person, and there's even less they can do about height, weight, posture, voice, and so on. So makeup and/or glamours still shouldn't be a replacement for polyjuice.

** From all the fics I've read, glamour charms:

1. Are only an illusion- they just make your appearance seem a particular way- they don't change your appearance.

   1. Wear off pretty soon. Characters have to reapply them several times.

2. Are easily detectable. They're often described as 'shimmery', and I'm sure than if a character was focused enough, they could probably deduce that our character was wearing a glamour.

Also, most fics just show the person wearing a glamour to simply cover up a scar or something.

-Polyjuice turns your body + voice into someone else's. Not the same thing as a glamour, that just simply changes a small part of your appearance.

-Human Transfiguration gives you that particular characteristic- For example, if you want to make your eyebrows green, the transfiguration actually /makes/ your eyebrows green, unlike glamours, that just make your eyebrows /seem/ green. They also wear of pretty soon, I think.

Metamorphmagus abilities, I'm pretty sure, are just human transfiguration skills minus the 'wearing off soon' part. Not exactly like a glamour.

** Counterpoint: We have the Disillusionment Charm that sounds very much like a glamour, or Anti-Muggle charms, or even the Fidelius and Expansion charms might be qualified as elaborate glamours. Glamours are just the kind of cool old faerie magic that I like seeing in my fiction, and the author can give them all sorts of believable negative side effects that make the above options more appealing (and it also helps explain how magic is hidden from the rest of the world).

1. Glamours might require something like constant or frequent concentration.
2. Glamours only work if the people you are disguised from /believe/ it's working, similar to a Bogart's reliance on your fear. Someone like Moody would see right through the disguise and render it useless.
3. Short effect or limited changes. Glamour can only do so much, like change your hair, eye, or skin color but can't do much more.
4. They could be inordinately difficult to cast.

I like my magic systems having big flaws that often cause more problems than they solve, like a character using a glamour only to be overconfident and they get caught anyway. I have no problem with anything people come up with in FF as long as it doesn't become a "get out of trouble free" card.

TL;DR I think it's all about how it is implemented.

*** Disillusionment I could see, but expansion charms and the fidelius? Not at all, for expansion charms we know for a fact that they are actually bigger on the inside, not they are that big but just look small. And for the fidelius it isnt that the charm disguises the building from anyone not in on the Secret, it is literally that they do not know that building is there, which is a weirdly subtle difference but an important one imo.

Overall I think they serve a purpose, but should be nerfed so that only extremely powerful wizards can pull them off to disguise themselves convincingly, like Dumbledore level powerful. Below that power level, so for that majority of magicals, they should mainly just be used to hide a scar or make someone look less pale, etc in my opinion

** I usually use "glamour" as a name for the field of magical disguise at large rather than one specific spell for this exact reason.

So for example, using a touch of polyjuice to shift your features, then changing the color of your eyes via illusion and transfiguring your hair into an intricately spelled braid would be a valid process to apply the word "glamour" to.

There's also three "categories" which glamour spells will usually exploit:

- Perception, which is the use of magic for illusion of the senses of others. The strength of illusions is their unbreakability, as you don't /actually/ disguise yourself, rendering it immune to enchantments like the thief's downfall and all manner of counterspell. Conversely, their weakness is that users of the mind arts can recognize illusions and see through them with ease.

- Reality, which is the use of magic to shift the physical matter of your body into a desired form. Its strength is the ability to withstand the mind arts and all things that rely on exposing perceptual inconsistencies, but its weakness is that it can be countered with magic. Hitting someone with a general counterspell is very taboo however, as lots of people use magic to hold their clothes together.

- Metamorphosis, which is all manners of shapeshifting. I usually hc shapeshifting to be the ability to bring the soul and the body into unison, which shifts the body as the soul does. Its strength is that if the metorph is good, they can fool basically anything. Even dementors can't see through a shapeshift, as for all intents and purposes, the shapeshiftee /becomes/ what they are, body and soul. Its weakness is that the process of becoming a shapeshifter is extremely dangerous to the body and soul alike.

I really like grouping things into the trinity of Body-Mind-Soul.

Or Fred and George making several sweets that alter the body's characteristics?

The truth of the matter is that having "Glamours" or Charms to alter one or more things about appearances(most of them are just changing eye and hair color, perhaps hair length) is completely in line with what we see in the series, and don't go against canon at all.

Polyjuice is very, very powerful, it makes someone look exactly like other person, scars, voice and all.

Methamorphmagus is also incredibly powerful.

Most "Glamour" Charms we see in fandom are completely believable color changes with some added stuff like changing hair length style, I really don`t see how this is against canon.
