I got the idea about a female Harry (whether she is a girl since birth or tansformed into one doesnt matter) and a more likeable Draco than in Canon. Possible slytherin/canon traits are possible. Well, i thought that Draco would become the subject to some girls because of his good lookings and perhaps his social status. I had in mind that in any case fem!harry would be attracted to him (well, its more teasing stuff, that she would do. She likes teasing and seducting him, she is playing with him more than being serious, but she wouldnt reject him on certain times either) and possibly Hermione and Ginny too. No love, just attraction. I dont mind if Pansy or some other female also get to him.

However it can also be like Draco gets attracted to fem!harry (if he transformed harry for bad reasons, his goal would backfire, because he gets attracted to her).

So Draco has several lovers, but he would get intim with just 2 of them tops. Although i dont mind a harem scene, but i would like a clear happening.

I leave the option about a female Draco, as i dont have any expectations about that. Maybe the same as one female Harry.

With "Unintentional Harem" i meant, that Draco gets the attraction of the females, without doing much stuff. so no boasting about who he is and such things.

The whole fic itself can be AU and i would also expecting it to be, but im not rejected to Canon stuff. (slight) OoC is fine.
