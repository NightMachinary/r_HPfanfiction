** I particularly like when we're in the classroom and we can listen to the teacher's lecture because it's shown rather than told. It can really up the world building, if it's done right.

I also like a well-written scene from Voldemort's PoV, where he isn't flanderized into a complete murderhobo.

***** I've read too many fics and they all tend to blend together, so the only one that I can remember enough to recommend (because it's one of my very favorite stories) is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]]. It's really written well, and throughout the entire story there's lots of little details about magic that I thought were really clever. Lupin is the DADA teacher, and how the author uses the class and its homework assignments in a few places to world build and move the plot along is very well done.

** I like well written, immersive battle scenes. Complete with adrenaline, death, angst, actual reactions. I really liked the two-chapter Battle of Hogwarts in "The Last Spy" for that reason.

I don't care if it's a Death Eater attack, the end of the war, an Order skirmish, or Auror training. These scenes, when done right, are just so much /fun/ to read.

** I like scenes that highlight character traits in unique ways. Show - don't tell - that Harry has trouble focusing on his schoolwork. Demonstrate that Ron is a Quidditch fanatic with a genuine love of the game. Hint in subtle but consistent ways that Hermione is motivated by praise and values learning.

Even the best world-building falls flat if the characters are just hollow concepts without depth.

*** This so much. So many people love saying that 'this is a really powerful/strong/smart/whatever character' and I just want to go where in the story do they ever show that. The character doesn't do anything but soak up praise about how powerful/strong/smart/whatever they are.

** my all time favorite scenes are scenes in which Harry (normally in a different dimension) gets bored vindictive or is an asshole. The best example I can think of is from A Black Comedy where Harry threatens to punish Kreacher...in a unique way. Of course...he makes other people do the punishment as well...

*** I'll read a good attempt, but I really love a good sex scene that includes a bit of in-scene comedy. It's tricky to maintain or recapture the feeling of intimacy or lustfulness when you have the main character flub an otherwise awesome seduction line or trip gracelessly into the hottub rather than slink in like a porn star.

Also, sex that's sexy between older characters without trying to fetishize the physical shortcomings of age is a rare treat.

** I have a guilty pleasure for stories of length that are HG/HP where you get to see romance blossom until, in the final battle, one of them dies or leading up to the final battle one of them dies. That Scene, the harrowing pain they must go through really gets me.

Also love a good fluffy scene, declaration of love, Harry finding out for the first time he's a powerful wizard in his own right, Duelling scenes that are well written.

I particularly like it when time is taken to introduce new spells rather than "lumos" with Maxima or ultima used to amplify the effect. I'm yet to find a good HP/HG fic where he goes "Dark" unless anybody has a good suggestion?

** I like fluffy romantic stuff where the characters are already in a relationship. The parts from "To fight the oncoming darkness" where Harry and Susan talk about intentionally forgeting flowers so they can have a pointless argument, scenes showing why Ron and Hermione could actually be a good couple, people cuddling, stuff like that. This is probably on of the reasons why I have a higher tolerance for soulbonds and other stupid shit, because they are plot devices that let you somewhat skip to that part immidatly.

Also, battle-scenes where characters actually act like wizards would in a world where almost everyone has the power of instant teleportation. I.e. lots of hand to hand combat, apparition and shit.

** People freaking out over Hermione dating Draco/Snape, followed by her putting them in their place. It gets even better when it's an actual major story line, finding a way to be together despite everyone else's objections.

I absolutely hated DH (and wasn't a big fan of HBP), so I appreciate any story that disregards those or at least heavily changes them, particularly Hermione being attracted to Ron (Because the brightest witch in her year would be attracted to the whiny self-centered idiot who dismisses almost everything she does all the time, and actually think it could work as a relationship), Harry being a Horcrux (seriously, Quirrel couldn't even touch him, how would a piece of Voldemort's soul survive on Harry with the blood protection still intact?) and the concept of a 'taboo' (If that is possible, why didn't the ministry use it in regards to unforgivables?).

Silent casting, the phrase can still be written down, people can refer to it without actually casting it. Also, it's only illegal to use it against actual humans, and it could be quite usefully used in the garden to get rid of unwanted +muggles+ weeds.

**** Draco never pretended to be her friend and he wasn't her housemate. Draco was taught his entire life to hate everything she was, you can't blame a child for that. Draco also cares about his mother, not just himself. He definitely needs redeeming by the fanfic author (just like Snape does), but it's possible without completely ignoring how the character was in the books. That, and dark pasts make for good romance.

Ron is weak-willed (look at book four where he can't throw of the suggestion of the imperius even after he's released from the spell), a bully, self-centered, lazy, and an idiot. I can think of no redeeming qualities for Ron as a character. I hate that his patronus is a dog because I can't think of a less loyal character than him.

****** On two occasions? He abandons them whenever he doesn't get his way. I'm not talking about courage (it's not brave to do dangerous things if you're too stupid to realize the danger it brings), I'm talking about him always placing himself and his needs first. The only reason for his being friends with Harry seems to be the hope that Harry's fame will rub off on him.

To be a friend you have to have regard for their feelings as well, not just your own.

** My favorite scene is from my favorite fanfic, [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]], it's the scene where Harry finally reveals to everyone (the Weasleys, Hermione, etc) what exactly he has been doing the entire summer.

It's just so fucking funny. I love the twins and Ginny, I love the behavior from the Malfoys and Snape, it's just lovely. I seriously love that fic waaaay too much. I keep re-reading it.

I think I just love it when Harry is actually portrayed as smart/strategic/willing to give even his most hated enemy (aside from Voldy) a chance. Plus, you know, Drarry.
