Forgive me if this is fully stated in the books, it's been a while!

What are average meals at hogwarts like? They can't all be massive feasts!

If it's not in canon fully, headcanons would be cool!


** My headcanon is that all the things they have at the feasts are all the regular meals all at once. Like, hey, its a feast today, so everyone can have their favorite things!

** My thoughts on meals at Hogwarts are loosely inspired by my days living in a university dorm. I think it's laid out buffet style for each meal. Breakfast is always the same with the type of foods you'd expect to see at a continental breakfast (cereal, toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc). For lunch and dinner I imagine the options change each day and there's a variety of stuff to choose from. At least one option is vegetarian. I imagine there's always chicken prepared in some manner, potatoes prepared in some manner, a couple soups/salads and 2-3 other dishes at each meal. So for example one night they might have curry and shepherds pie, the next they might have pasta and salmon. Feasts are just a larger version of dinner.

** Why on Earth /wouldn't/ they all be massive feasts? Magic means no such thing as scarcity, and the Elves are always happy to do their best. I think that most any meal at Hogwarts would be as much, much more plentiful and varied than the average of a Muggle boarding school --- the holiday feasts are /slightly/ more massive than the average, but it's the difference between "main course is a roast boar with onion sauce" and "main course is ten roast dromedaries with caviar sauce".

**** Magic, m'dear. Sprinkle the food with a weight-controlling potion, or something.

Or more simply: all that food's /available/; doesn't mean students eat very large /portions/ of it.

Or the bazillion steps they have to climb every single day to get to class.

** I imagine at the feasts there's probably more desserts and holiday type dishes (like stuffed Turkey or whatever the Wizard world considers as holiday dishes).

** I think it's just an all-you-can-eat buffet every time. Maybe with more variation on foods available during feasts.
