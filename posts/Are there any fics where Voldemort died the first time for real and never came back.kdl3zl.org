It can be that they prevent his resurrection and destroy his horcruxes, or that he never made any, or anything in between. I'd be curious to see how such a fic would go. The main thing would be that Voldemort is gone for good and never makes an appearance(nor can he).

â€‹

If that's too much to ask for, I'd appreciate any fic that significantly diverges from canon from the get-go, so either no horcruxes, or that they're not a big part of the story, or no deathly hollows or the same, etc. Where Harry and co go through their years at Hogwarts and they experience completely different things than the ones in the story that keeps getting repeated from the books. I'm just a bit surprised that every single author seems to want to repeat the same basic formula over and over again, and nobody seems to want to completely diverge from canon in very significant ways.


** Try linkffn(*The House of Potter Rebuilt*). I think that checks most of the boxes you wanted.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** /How Like Home/ linkao3(22810651) - canon Harry is transplanted to a universe like this, where Tom Riddle never went dark. His parents, born a full generation after the last war ended, have no idea what he's talking about.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

** It doesn't cover Hogwarts (it takes place after that), but linkffn(The Commoner Queen by pilargirl) has a premise where Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Harry's grandparents all died at the end of the war and stayed that way. It's really good imo, and features a significant divergence from canon.

  AU. A 1000 years ago, a plague extinguished 3/4 of Britain's magical population, including 3 of the 4 founders; Godric Gryffindor remained and founded a new world, with a monarchy that would last for years to come. Now, Ginny Weasley is the Holyhead Harpies' star Chaser and a simple commoner, but Harry James Potter of Evans and Gryffindor, Prince of Wales, has his eye on her.
