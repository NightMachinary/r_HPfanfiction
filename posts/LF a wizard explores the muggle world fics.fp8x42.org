Could be Draco being persona non grata in the wizarding world and struggling to figure out traffic lights, could be Arthur just spending his free time walking around and being amazed at muggle inventions, could be a muggle studies class trip, could be dark!Hermione having a fellow dark witch of her coven visit her at her home, anything where the strange muggle world full of electricity and machines is seen from the perspective of someone who grew up with magic and not technology.

"The moving stairs move you up instead of constantly changing direction? That's actually pretty practical!"

"What do you mean, power that isn't magic?"

"Nuclear WHAT?"

"Why would anyone need ten million calculations every second?"

"That Concorde looks really sleek! ..how fast did you say it is again?"

"FIVE AND A HALF BILLION PEOPLE?"

Fics I already read that have some of this: Linkffn(Exile by bennybear; Coven by Naidhe)


** In terms of literal exploring rather than seriously living in the muggle world...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][This one]] has the great concept of Muggle Touring in a "Hermione travels back in time to try and raise Tom Riddle to not be Voldemort" plot. Unfinished, still updating. Obviously, it's pure bloods experiencing early 20th Century upper class society but the basic grain of what you want is there.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14136162/chapters/32576292][This one]] features a post-epilogue Draco who divorces Astoria and through a series of events ends up in close contact with the muggle world. I don't think chapters three or four have any of this since they focus on Ron and Lorcan respectively. It's hilarious and written as a series of journal/correspondence entries which may not be for everyone but is a fantastic genre. This is, therefore, a pure blood encountering late 2010/early 2020s Britain.

**** It's basically a complete story but I'll just say you kind of want to see what Lorcan does after he finishes Hogwarts (his chapter... and they're long chapters... is set in his 7th year). Apparently the author had some other concepts they wanted to explore (unless all of the intended three/four other chapters were about Lorcan) but I think on the whole it's all wrapped up.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)
