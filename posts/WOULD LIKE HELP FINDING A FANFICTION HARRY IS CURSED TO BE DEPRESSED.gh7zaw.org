EDIT: I FOUND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSE OF GUILT

​

Harry gets cursed during like a battle or something and goes to Hogwarts and is really shameful and guilty and depressed and stuff, because of the curse, but nobody knows. I remember there was a scene where Hagrid casually said something along the lines of, "You didn't come to my hut today" and Harry almost bursts out in tears. At the end he's super depressed and all these little things are massive to him so he goes to the really tall tower, or whatever it's called, and Dumbledore is alerted. He goes up and tries to reason with Harry. I think some lines are cut out but I was enthralled so I kept reading. Harry jumps off, and the curse breaks and he's like "Oh No!" then Dumbledore casts a cushioning charm and he lives.
