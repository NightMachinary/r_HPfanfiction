I'll take anything but I'd prefer something with in depth magical creatures or obscure magic fields (enchanting, alchemy, etc.) No slash.

Thanks

Lots of stuff on both creatures and magic and Harry trying his damnedest to survive in a hostile enviroment.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memory]] is heavy on alchemy. I stopped reading the 2nd book in the series because it was getting a bit too, I guess sexual, for my taste, but it's worth a look.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] gets its obligatory mention for introducing totally new types of magic and integrating it well with its world building. The author expands on stuff like Legimency and Occulmency, while adding in new stuff like Wild Magic and (now) Wu Xi Do.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] features a young Harry living by himself in the woods, learning how to enchant things. It's pretty light hearted, but I really enjoyed it.
