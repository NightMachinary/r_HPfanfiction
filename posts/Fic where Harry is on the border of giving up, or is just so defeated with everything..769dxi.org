This one, One Blink, is a good example. Harry's just so tired and jaded, and all that.

I'd prefer it if it was during Hogwarts times


** linkffn(Stages of Hope) is then probably the right fic for you.

It isn't really during Hogwarts, buy it is shortly after. It isn't only Harry who is on the verge of giving up.

It is imo one of the better stories in this fandom.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** Yeah, but this seems different to what he's asking for. After all that only happens right at the beginning while(correct me if i'm wrong) I think he's looking for it as more of a central part of the story, the driving force.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.
