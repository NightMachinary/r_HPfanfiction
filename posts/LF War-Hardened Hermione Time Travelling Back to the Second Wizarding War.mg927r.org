Just something where maybe she has to stay at Grimmauld Place or something and sneak around her younger self!

I'd prefer a pairing involved, any pairings are fine, but I prefer longer fics that are completed or currently updating!

Thank you!


** This is my favorite Hermione time travel fic, it's definitely different than most others but in an awesome way.

*** Eh. Time travel can get rid of the age gap concerns, but I still have trouble imagining SS in a relationship with anyone.

I don't like him being bashed, and I believe he earned his redemption, but there's almost nothing about his personality I could see anyone being /attracted/ to.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort.(It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers... HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect.)

** linkao3(4475078)

This is one of my favourites! I'm not sure if it fits exactly what you wanted with her sneaking around her younger self because in this version Hermione wakes up AS her younger self with her older selves conscience.

But it's definitely perfect for the war-hardened Hermione you're looking for! It's been a few months since the war ended and she's still battling through the trauma and griefs of war when she gets transported back to just before the second war starts. Does a good job of showing how she's been affected by the war, and how it's changed her personality and goals.

The pairing is Fred/Hermione and it's completed!

** Linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel) This one is good. Short but complete. I don't think Hermione was super war-hardened, but I like everything by this author, so it's definitely worth a read!

I've also found a couple in a FFN community called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Hermione-Kicks-A/98007/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Hermione Kicks A**]]. My computer shows that I've at least opened several of those, which I'll link even though I don't remember them very well. Check out the rest though, there are some other promising looking ones.

Linkffn(The Remains by jbirdpuff) I don't remember reading this, but it looks promising, I might have to give it another go!

Linkffn(Live Again by Sophie733) When all is lost, Hermione goes back in time to 1996 and Draco is accidentally pulled with her. I remember starting this one, but I never got into it. I wasn't a fan of the early plotline where Hermione is captured and ends up swearing an unbreakable vow to kill Dumbledore. It might be good, but it wasn't for me.

I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone else links!

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
