:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading this fic and lost it and have been going CRAZY trying to find it! Hermione and Bill weasley are exchanging letters while she's at Hogwarts (but somehow they don't really know each other that well/she doesn't know he's Ginny's brother?). The only thing that really stands out in my memory is that Hr tells Bill that Ginny used to steal her brothers' brooms in the middle of the night when she was seven and he's very shocked.

You'd think that I'd have found it by now bc it's not a very common cast of characters but alas.

Any help appreciated!


** If it's a Hermione/Bill romance fic, try checking the multiple Hermione-centric Facebook groups. They're usually on top of this kind of stuff.
