There was a part where hermione says she put a spell on Ron to never speak of a conversation they had or he would die and eventually hermione makes up with harry and can't really remember the if the spell she put on Ron was real. I can't really remember more but I would love 8f someone could tell me the name of it thanks

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
