** I was amused that he addressed the pedophile complaint people have directly through one of the characters. Well, /tried/ -- for people who are put-off by it I doubt it'll help but hey.

**** Charlie directly calls him out on it. Response is basically a combo of I and my body are partially or mostly 11, there was no one else after she died, and she knows about it.

** I Wish he focused more on Team 8 than NOFP.

NOFP is good, but it didn't age well, and there are better fics out there that are literally the same story, I have yet to find a Naruto fanfic that i don't drop after the first chapter

Edit: Just to clarify NOFP was one of the first fics I read and I know is famous because it set some of the tropes for the peggy-sue genere in HPFF but compared with the newest stories it had a lot of stuff in it that would have made me drop in an instant now.

- Friendly Goblins
- Magical Cores
- Powerful Harry
- Training Martial Arts
- evil!snape
- abusive!dursleys (handwaved)

But apart from all that star'kan is a good writer and does a lot of things right with his story It's just that I consider that Team 8 is the superior of his both stories. maybe because i'm not as invested into the Naruto fandom

*** I started NOFP late, and I didn't understand why people liked it until I realized how old it was.

In my opinion, backwards with purpose is better.

**** I'm actually also reading that one right now and i can't get past the fact that they are going to try to keep the time line as close to canon as posible (even allowing Ginny to be possessed again?)

*** NOFP started solidly, yes. I still plan on finish reading it (eventually). At the very least it's an amusing story.
