** He passes it to his son James Potter, named after his father. His wife, the french goddess, Fleur just would not let him name any of their children something as ridiculous as Albus or Severus or any possible combination involving the two names. Sirius as a name would have been fine, she remined him but she also wanted her children to have names from her side of the family. And no, Lily Fleur was also not an acceptable name.

*** I'm sorry to say every time I read a harry /fleur pairing . I imagine Bill Weasley on the warpath with an army of vengeful goblin and the Curse breaker being out for blood. Simply because I think Bill and Fleur are insanely happy together in cannon. But if Harry's relationship with Fleur happens before she meets Bill I can enjoy the fic.
