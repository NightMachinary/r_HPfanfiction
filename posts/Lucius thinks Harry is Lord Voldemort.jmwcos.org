In the bookshop before 2nd year, when Lucius shakes Harry's hand, his Dark Mark burns which leads him to assume that Harry is actually Voldemort undercover. From hereon he dedicates himself to Harry's service, treating his every wish and whim as a Command and orders Draco to do the same.

(not sure if handshake happens in the books or it is movie only thing, but lets assume it does happen)

** Lucius - the smooth talker that he is - gradually convinces all his (not-so-) former Death Eater pals that Harry is the Dark Lord reborn. Him being the (supposed) Heir of Slytherin definitely helps, too.

Then all DEs get summoned through their Dark Marks, arrive at the Little Hangleton cemetery, and see their (new) master tied to a statue by some creepy snake creature - which they promptly blast to smithereens. Wormtail is confused as hell, but there's nothing he can do but try to go with the flow and pretend this was the plan all along.

Voldie is so astonished by all this that he simply stops trying anymore, and just chills out in ghost form until Dumbledore destroys all the Horcruxes.

Harry eventually becomes the youngest Minister in the last several centuries, mainly because he is the only candidate every side likes (with Lucius still convinced that him being pro-Muggleborn and generally Light is all an elaborate act; even if he has his suspicions, the pride of a Malfoy won't let him admit that he was wrong).

  Between Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban, a renewed effort at recruiting more minions, and avoiding the suspiciously friendly pack of Aurors sent to defend Hogwarts, Harry's second school year is shaping up to be even more action-packed than his first. But with the help of his friends, Harry is quite sure that he'll be able to make it through another year relatively unscathed.Oh, and then there's the impending dark resurrection of the high-pitched voice in his head, of course. But that can probably wait until his homework is done.Sequel to The Devil You Know.

Harry finally reveals that he is, in fact, not the Dark Lord. ‚ÄòCourse Draco being Draco thinks it's a test at first. Harry goes to lengths to prove he's just Harry. Finally Draco believes Harry. Shit happens. Draco helps take the Dark Lord down. People are very confused when there's a mutiny in the Death Eaters ranks.

My point is that there are so many ways to take this; instead of thinking of it at face value. Imagination is a wonderful gift, magic in its purest form.
