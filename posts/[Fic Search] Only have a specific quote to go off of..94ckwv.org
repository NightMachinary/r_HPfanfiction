Harry is confronting Dumbledore and says something like the following. "The problem Headmaster is that forgiveness begins with an admission of wrongdoing. You want to skip that step. Even the bible gets that right." or something similar to that. If someone can help me find the fic, or better yet that specific scene I would be grateful.

I don't know anything else about it unfortunately, whether it was terrible or not.

Thanks, Shadowed Malice

  I always liked Harry's response to Dumbledore in Three to Backstep:

  "You also speak of forgiveness, Headmaster. Well, before you can have forgiveness there must first be recognition by the perpetrator they did something wrong; /and/ be sorry for doing it. That's remorse. Next is repentance. They must, more or less, vow not to do it again. Thirdly, they must face atonement. In part, that's punishment. Then, once they feel genuine remorse, have accepted they've done wrong, repented and made a promise to fix their ways... and been properly punished for it... then, and only then, can forgiveness be considered. Not before. Even the /Holy Bible/ recognises that. You seem to just want to skip the important steps and get right to the forgiveness part. /That. Does. Not. Work./"
