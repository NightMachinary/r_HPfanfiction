What are some fics that are just... Special. Ones with crazy or cool quirks, something that separates it from most of the others. I really want to read something that is different from all these popular fics. I don't mean something that started a trend, so no Nightmare of Future Past.\\
Just... something special.\\
And with good writing, preferably.


** I feel like Havoc Side of the Force is an interesting story, and might hit what you're looking for. It's blatant super Harry wank, but dresses it up with conflict that is interesting. It also gives valid reasons for characters to know each other, which I like.

The whole Harry bumbling into trouble and then blasting his way out has been done to death, but this story does it well. It just feels different, no other hp/star wars crossover comes close.

** My favourite weird HP fic would be linkao3(3412346) DSS Requirement, which is a crossover with Stargate (but no knowledge of Stargate is necessary, I knew nothing and could follow the fic easily). Basically, people mess around with the room of requirement in Harry's 5th year and get a real spaceship. It's a very calm and peaceful fic, with no real plot. Most of it is people exploring the ship and the impact it has on their lives. The writing is pretty good too, and some characters you wouldn't normally consider important (like Marietta Edgecombe) get their 5 minutes.

** Linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery)

A Venetian AU with Harry Potter. Holy deal that's unique and it's actually really well done. Highly recommend.

Linkffn(Speak Softly, Love by Silens Cursor)

This is a one shot about Antonin Dolohov. I love it as it makes him more than a villain by focusing on the path he lived and the forces that made him become what he was. Well written and only 20k works worth a read.

Linkffn(Hell Eyes by Jezaray)

Weird. Well written but weird, it's an AU that kind of goes all over the place but the world is honestly pretty cool and the stuff with Cursed and the Silent is awesome. Strong and creative AU, but it's kind of out there.

** The Sacrifices Arc is, without a doubt, my favorite piece of HP fiction. Lightning on the Wave creates a MASSIVE AU of the entire series (7 books, 548 chapters, 3.69 million words) complete with a partner one-shot of 6,000 words. LotW also didn't just write to write words - I really feel that every chapter serves a purpose.

It contains Dumbledore bashing, Slytherin!Harry, and Harry/Draco, but I love it for its characterization of lots of background characters and the depth it gives to Wizarding World politics and Noble House stuff. It explores a lot of neat concepts regarding how magic works, and appeals to a large variety of genres. It's not very romance focused and instead focuses on the interpersonal relationships, action, intrigue, and maybe a smidge of drama.

Here's the entire series. I've read it twice. It's infinitely worth it, in my book.

** White Squirrel's "The Arithmancer" and its sequel have replaced a lot of canon in my head, I'm somewhat sad to say (which just means I'm overdue for a reread!). I love how deeply he delves into the magic system, and shows how much can learn about/question the magical world from a curious outsider's perspective.

I also loved "The Life and Times" by Jewels5 as a solid, era-appropriate, world building Marauder's era fic, but it hasn't updated in years.

** The one that sticks with me is Reverse by Lady Moonglow. Still in progress, but the premise is awesome and the world building is amazing linkffn(4025300)

** Have you read The Boy in the Bookshelf by ShayaLonnie? It makes Peter a likeable character.
