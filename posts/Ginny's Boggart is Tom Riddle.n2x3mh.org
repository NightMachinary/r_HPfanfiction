It's kind of horribly hilarious that Lupin steps in front of Harry for fear his Boggart will be Voldemort, when he should be stepping in front of Ginny so the rest of the class doesn't see 16 year old Tom Riddle.

So, everyone's seen what Voldemort used to look like. Assuming, of course, that Lupin used the Boggart for multiple classes (outside of just third years).

What do you think Tom would say to Ginny? I'm leaning towards: vague but terrifying in context.

  "Did you think I was gone, lost in the Chamber forever? I know you hear me at night, /whispering/ in your ear. You still dream of me, don't you? We'll never be parted, I left something of myself inside you down in the chamber. Do you miss me, Ginny? Do you feel hollow without my presence...

** I'm more interested in knowing what form Ginny makes her boggart turn to. I think she might anticipate it being Tom, so she'd be prepared enough to shut him up quickly before he says much. I just want to know what he turns into.

Does he turn back to a diary? Does he change into a clown suit? Does she dress him in drag like Neville did to Snape?

** Ginny wasn't in Harry's class, as she was a year younger. We don't know if any students other than third years got to face the boggart.

In Calibration by TheDivineComedian, we see Lupin training the boggart to keep it child-friendly, which doesn't exactly fit with his canon fear of Harry turning it into Voldemort, but would have been a nice thing to do.

But, I'm not sure I buy the idea of Lupin somehow training the boggart to keep it child friendly, like you said, that doesn't seem to square with canon

** Ginny's Boggart was never shown in Canon, but I personally don't think that it would truly take the appearance of a Young Tom Riddle.

First of all, even if Ginny's worst fear being likely to be linked to the events of the Chamber of Secrets, it is not confirmed and children can sometimes have irrational fear. By the time they were confronted with their Boggart, both Ron and Hermione had lived very traumatic experiences (the Troll, Fluffy, Ron's sacrifice, the Whipping Willow . . .), and yet both of their worst fear were pretty . . . trivial in comparison. Hermione was just afraid to fail her exams (though some theories say that it was a representation of her wear to not be good enough, to never fit in the magical world), and Ron was afraid of spider (not even because he ended up in the middle of an Acromantula den the year before, but because of a stupid jokes his brother did years prior).\\
Ginny might as well a completely different "worst fear", like an Hag just because some cousin told her a very scary story when she was 3 or 4.

I am also not sure that Ginny ever saw the true appearance of Tom Riddle. I don't think Tom had any reason to show her a memory like he did with Harry, and in the Chamber he only got a physical body after Ginny was unconscious. So even if Ginny's worst fear was truly linked with the Chamber, I believe her Boggart would take a different appearance.\\
I could see her Boggart taking her own appearance. just like she was possessed. Or maybe the cabinet would open, only to reveal a simple black notebook.

And concerning Lupin's actions during the class, of only stepping in when it was Harry's turn, I think it was (kinda) justified.\\
From the start I am not convinced that showing everyone worst fear is really a good idea. I get that it's important to teach children how to fight their fears but kid are also little shit that could try to use this knowledge against each other. But in every case Harry Potter is a special case.\\
In Fanon, it's common to present Theodore Nott as an abused child, whose worst fear in his own father. But even if it would be very embarassing for Theodore to have his fear revealed, it would only affect him. And the same things would apply to everyone else. If Ginny's boggart was Tom Riddle, the other children would see an attractive teen goes out of the cabinet and be confused. In comparaison, Harry's worst fear was (believed to be) Voldemort. Voldemort going out the closet would have meant and terrified class with a lot of teens trying to escape, it would probably have been a lot worse than any other fear, no matter what people may have thought of the class.

Definitely agree. We see this in canon even with both teachers and students. Apparently Snape is even more vicious towards Neville after that class, and Malfoy was already taunting Harry over his fear of the Dementors.

Exposing a classroom of 13 year olds to the thing they're most terrified of seems like a bad idea full stop. A recipe for a classroom of traumatized 13 year olds

** honestly, the more I think about it, the more Lupin's boggart just seems irresponsible. Yeah, sure, I mean everybody loved it... but it's like a bit of an invasion of privacy to have your deepest fears shown to everybody in class.

And it's not like Harry is the only kid with cause to be traumatized. Just the year before, the basilisk attacked at least two third years. Hermione of course conveniently wasn't traumatized by the basilisk...but what about Justin? In hindsight, the fact that Neville fears Snape more than being tortured to insanity by Bellatrix and her posse was probably lucky for Lupin. And then there are all these death eater kids... who I'm not saying they necessarily suffered any trauma from that, but if they know about it, would it be so farfetched, to assume, that their biggest fear would be for their parent's death eater activities to come to light...so they probably wouldn't want that to be seen by everybody in the entire class.

*** Oh it completely seems irresponsible! Harry's class is the first class not born during a full scale war, they lived during the aftermath. What does he imagine the greatest fears of some of the older 7th years are? Their parents dead/tortured? Themselves?

Like you said, it just seems lucky that Neville was more afraid of Snape than being tortured to insanity by Lestrange.

Even as a normal, untraumatized child facing my greatest fear is not something I could handle at 13. The logical outcome seems to be a classroom of terrified, sobbing children that couldn't make their deepest fears funny on command.

**** No I meant when you said

/'Lupin steps in front of Harry for fear his Boggart will be Voldemort, when he should be stepping in front of Ginny so the rest of the class doesn't see 16 year old Tom Riddle'/

Harry would be expected to see Voldemort, and if we take the fact Ginny'll see Tom, then I get why Lupin shielded Harry. To the class, Voldemort is far scarier than Tom Riddle (especially since they didn't know who he was)
