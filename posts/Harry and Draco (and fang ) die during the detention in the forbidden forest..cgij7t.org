I mean it was such a good idea to send students into the murder forest, especially when they are supposed to actually look for a dark creature that that kills unicorns and doesn't belong there.

Also I'm pretty sure Dumbledore knew about Aragog.


** I think there was one called The Boy Who Died A Lot, which has Harry die in all sort of manners, and Snape has to use a time turner to go back and save him repeatedly. Harry's first Death is notably the situation you've mentioned. It's a Harry/Snape fic, be warned. And it's long as hell but a decent enough read.

No thanks.

Sucks, could have been a funny and endearing fic without the completely unnecessary addition of a pedophilic adult homosexual relationship.

**** Yeah. Well, it's the closest thing to what matched the prompt so it was worth mentioning
