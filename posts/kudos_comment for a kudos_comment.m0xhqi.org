** Comments are okay, I guess, but exchanging kudos seems kind of like cheating, but that may just be me.

**** I'm not saying that you can't do it, I'm just saying it kind of feels wrong to me.

Exchanging comments and critique is good, it can help you improve. Kudos though is like you saying "You say my story is good and I'll say yours is good" without even reading them first. Maybe one of the stories is bad or just doesn't feel like kudos material for one of the parts, but already feels obliged to give them because the other person already gave kudos to you. It just feels odd.

****** How is it motivating to get kudos knowing they were only in trade for you giving them kudos? The person giving you kudos may not have even read your story.
