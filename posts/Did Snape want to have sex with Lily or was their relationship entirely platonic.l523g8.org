** I think that he wanted her, but his interest wasn't purely sexual. He seemed to have put her on a pedestal, and idolised her, rather than seeing her as a real human being with faults and foibles.

** Book canon doesn't actually explicitly state that he was in love with her. However, it is strongly implied, and explicitly stated by JKR outside the books (in fact, she once mentioned /Lily/ having feelings for Severus at one point even if it didn't lead anywhere due to his fixation on the Dark Arts). My headcanon on this is yes, he loved her that way, which I think is what most people believe. However I also think that they could have legitimately worked out, if he ever got his shit together and left the dark path he was heading towards, which I know is a far less popular view.

However, I don't think his love for her was very physical in nature -- I mean, yeah, he was a teenage boy at one point and I'd be surprised if he didn't fantasize about her like that. But I always figured that, with how long they had been friends, that he loved her emotionally much more than physically. So yeah, as a teenage boy he likely wanted to have sex with her eventually, but just simply the idea of them being together romantically was far more important.

** I think he wanted her. Snape wanted a life with her but the path he was on was a dark one. Snape was surrounded by too many Slytherins whispering about blood purity and was a half-blood with a muggle surname. He would have had a difficult time in Slytherin especially with Voldemort rising. There was a part of him torn between the purebloods and wanting to fit in and the muggleborn girl he loved. Snape was already broken but he had no idea how to fix himself or move on.

To me it was always platonic on Lily's end.

*** Snape already fit in with the purebloods when he got to Hogwarts. He is shown to be disdainful towards Muggles (eg. his reaction to Lily telling him of her argument with Petunia). He fit in right with the Slytherin (Lily was an exception).

** He wanted to, but couldn't, since a prank gone wrong had early on turned Snape's in penis into a small honking trumpet.

** There's no book-canonical answer. Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) does a very good portrayal of a Severus Snape whose love for Lily was decidedly platonic.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
