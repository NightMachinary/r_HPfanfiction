Does anyone know any stories that...

a) Feature Harry with Katie Bell as a pairing?

b) Have Harry help Ginny recover after CoS?

c) Feature an overhauled Hogwarts (new teachers, subjects, etcetera)?

d) Are set after Voldemort wins the Battle of Hogwarts?

Any one of them would be great, but if there's a fic that contains more than one of them that would be amazing. Thank you in advance!


** For (c), Lily's Changes. It's where Prongslet, Padfoot and Co. team up with Quirrellmort to nuke Dumbledore and change the world for the better.

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.
