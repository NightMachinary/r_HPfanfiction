So, I have been following this sub for some time now and I often see that people dont want to read about Ocs. And i do not understand why, but that being said when I read a fic about Harry in Slytherin paired with Daphne, I have atleast one character thats an Oc in all but name, that being Daphne, and Harry that might or might not come close to his canon personality.

Yet if I were to make a fic that would pair Harry with someone from Slytherin thats female but not named OC I'd get a lot less people willing to look into it. I get that people who want to read as close to canon as possible wouldnt want either, but I've seen some Harry/Daphne fans that couldnt get over someone writing a female character not named Daphne, even if its very similar in Story and setting.

Thoughts?


** Functionally, Daphne, Astoria, and Tracey are OC's. They have barely anything but a name, baked-in house designation, and certain expectations built around that, based on their being Slytherins who must value ambition and pragmatism, and in Daphne and Astoria's case, purebloods whose families care somewhat about blood status, if they haven't mixed with Muggles/half-bloods in generations. What it really comes down to is the fact that they are canon, if you take Pottermore and JKR's post-HP commentary as canon, which many people do.

On the other hand, the reason why OC's get very little love is because there are zero expectations around them. It's a full-on mystery bag, and that's not what fanfiction readers want to read. They want fanfiction, which is seeing familiar characters and familiar settings. If they wanted original stuff, they'd be reading original fiction.

Something worth considering is how the reputation and image of OC's has been tainted in fandom culture since the beginning, from young teens starting out writing by churning out fics featuring Mary Sue/Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasies. Ebony Darkn'ness from My Immortal, or all the Sonic and Pony recolours on DeviantArt are prominent examples (the craziness of the Sonic OC fandom is where the "Nothing Personnel" meme came from). With so much fanfiction around, readers would rather pick a familiar name than risk wasting their time on a coinflip.

*** Interesting. So it depends on what you want from Fanfiction when it comes down to Oc's? Because for me, if it has either some characters that I like or the unique Magic that comes with HP, I will atleast consider reading it. And now that I think of it, that can all be found in original fiction. Maybe I should start reading original Fiction more. Thanks for you view

*** Because they are pureblood, they must be blood purists? Weasleys were one of the purest families until Hermione.

**** Because Daphne and Astoria are pureblood, their /families/ care about blood. I didn't say that /they/ were supremacists themselves. If their recent ancestors cared nothing about blood status, Daphne and Astoria would be halfbloods and their family name wouldn't appear on the Sacred 28 pureblood list.

Arthur and Molly aren't purists, but their family members were. Ignatius Prewett, Molly's uncle, married Lucretia Black, whose name wasn't cut out of the family tapestry. It seems pretty logical to assume that purebloods in the modern era are still pure because someone up the line made sure to marry the right person.

** OC's are generally disregarded because they and SI's will be used to change things without really explaining why, just accept it god damned it. This is also why I generally dislike any sort of forgotten Potter/Black family member comes to Harry's rescue. They will avoid at all costs any sort of explanation as to why Harry ends up with them or if they do end up doing it it'll be a small titbit added to a chapter instead of being a chapter in itself.

â€‹

As far as Pairing characters. That comes down a lot more to as [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]]: Expectations. Which I feel I've said some about already. There are just so many bad connotation people have with them that it's generally difficult to have them be used and for me if I read trough 5 chapters of pre-Hogwarts Fanfiction and all I hear is how amazing these OC's are. I'm likely to drop it. It'll be OC focused and OC-heavy and I don't care for that.

*** u/ForumWarrior:
#+begin_quote
  forgotten Potter/Black family member
#+end_quote

something about this makes me think of discovering petrified people in the chamber of secrets. any black family member in there would likely become head of the black house after being unpretrified. this could also be used to resurrect dead houses.

** I generally avoid stories where OC's take centre stage, but I have read a few that are very well done. It's just hard to make a good, believable OC that fits well into canon, doesn't exhibit SI-level awareness of the plot (unless they are an SI) and does not act as a Mary Sue. For settings that have a lot of cultural differences from the modern west (i.e. GoT) then the OC also shouldn't carry around the author's morals and ethics.

** I know it exists but I don't understand the logic behind the resistance to OCs. There are seven books in the original canon. Each one of them introduces new characters and expands on the universe introduced in the previous books. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that fanfiction would do the same. If every book in canon used only the characters introduced in the first book, I could understand it: but it doesn't, so . . . the fandom has always been a mystery to me and I can't see that changing.

*** The issues with OC's is one I have everywhere. No matter the fandom. OC's can be good. But 90% of the time they are more of a Deux Ex Machina in a person. A Character that is introduced primarily to change the story at a fundamental level even though the same thing could be achieved by utilising characters that already exists. Take a Naruto fic I read a year back, an OC made Academy Naruto into a top tier Genin. So I'm guessing nobody from canon could do that? None whatsoever.

The same thing happens a lot with the few Harry Potter fics I've read that are OC heavy or utilise an OC character to get something to happen. The same thing could quite often be achieved by a canon character. And as I said in my other post. OC's are rarely given a proper explanation for why or how they manage to change things up as much as they do. It is often a small paragraph instead of at least a chapter.Now disregarding characters that would change the story at a fundamental level.

We'll still end up with a character that will have their characterisation/character traits told to us a lot instead of simply letting them be shown. Put quite simply more often than not OC's are used by lazier/unexperienced writers. Does that mean that all OC's are inherently bad? No. If it's and AU I don't have any issues with a Large Potter family or Black Family. Etc. etc. But it's What is the purpose of the character? Did you make a new character simply to make a new character? If so, why is it there. I've personally made an OC for HP but I've not utilised it simply because it's too OP. Family was Cursed to be a Dog animagus that fits their personality. Family tradition of using two wands etc .etc.

So. To conclude, an OC needs a purpose in the story, preferably one that can't be done by another. I'm not saying that if Harry ends up living with somebody else it needs to be a character that already exists. But the reason for living with that specific family should be more than: "He gonna bone their daughter." And yes, parent OC's get much more of a pass because we weren't introduced to a lot/any of the characters parents except the Weasley's.

**** But you are talking about the shortcomings of the writer not the intrinsic merits or drawbacks of original characters themselves. In any case, to be fair, a writer who can't make a well rounded OC will almost certainly make a dog's breakfast of the CCs as well.

****** But if the writer doesn't feel that an existing canon character fits the role they need to fill, it's their prerogative to create a new character who does. Just because you don't care for it doesn't make it wrong, it just means you aren't the target audience.

*** I think the large cast of characters in the books is the main reason I dislike OCs so much in this fandom. (Also true in NCIS, which is the fandom most of my fics are in.) There are so many minor characters who can be developed while still staying in the canon sandbox, why go outside that? When I want to write my own characters, I write original fic.

**** There are quite a few named Hogwarts students, but even that isn't the whole school complement. Are the only teachers the ones who are named in canon? What about Aurors, Death Eaters, Ministry officials, giants, werewolves, centaurs, Muggles . . . ? I think you are making Rowling's world smaller than it needs to be.

***** There are actually a lot of those who make an appearance or are mentioned by name at least once during the series. Well, maybe not giants or werewolves. But in general, there are a lot of names or references to people that can be used.

Also, to clarify, I'm not saying no OCs ever. But if there's a character who plays any sort of significant role in the fanfic, I want them to either be somebody who already existed in canon or there to be a really good reason we haven't met them before.

For example, if you're setting a story at Charlie's dragon sanctuary, yes, you will have OCs because we've never met any of those people. But if you're looking to have Harry interacting with a student in his class at Hogwarts, pick one that was named at some point, even if it was just by the Sorting Hat in Book 1 and never again. Especially if that classmate plays a big role in the story.
