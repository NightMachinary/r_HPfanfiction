Alright, so, I wanted to know if there are any fics that have

A) Magic known to everyone

B) Set in medieval times

C) Magic extremely rare

Basically what I want it Harry being one of the few that can use magic in this Medieval world. Hopefully I can get some good recs for this.

Bonus points for complex magic systems.

Over 70k+ words!


** Probably not even close but: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] is set in 1590. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3013068/1/Medieval-Magic][Medieval Magic]] is RW/HG and is set in not historically accurate medieval times. There is a couple of regency fics out there too, most are heavily romance fics.

The problem is there is almost no 'magic is known' fics in a non-completely AU (like set in Game of Thrones/LoTRs, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11421858/1/More-Precious-than-Rubies][very]] fairy-tale [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5656012/1/][like]] or something). There are some where magic becomes known over the course of the story like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] where Harry and Ginny are caught dueling on CCTV. There are also a few founders times fics ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3233631/1/Founding-Hogwarts][Founding Hogwarts]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/166415][What's Past is Prologue]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=275890][Legendary]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/844334/1/][Amulet of Time 1: The Age of the Founders]]) with or without Harry.

#+begin_quote
  The night before Quidditch try-outs in the Trio's fifth year, a mysterious magical accident takes place in the Gryffindor common room, transporting Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny back over a thousand years in time to a century of discord, persecution and tumult, where they lose their memories of their own time and become the Founders of Hogwarts.When another such occurrence returns them to a time they can no longer think of as their own, Godric, Helga, Salazar and Rowena must defeat Voldemort and overcome the divisions within the school they founded, while simultaneously trying to uncover the reason for their time-travel.Some elements have been borrowed, with permission, from the work of Wicked Witch of the North on fanfiction.net, who has since closed her account.

  AU. The Founders of Hogwarts were brave, witty, loyal and cunning. They were also drunk, besotted, sarcastic, proud, lustful, jealous, conceited, baffled, cursed -- and on speaking terms with an inebriated Glaswegian hat. Read the bits history missed out.
