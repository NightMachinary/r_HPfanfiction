Exactly as the title asks - if there were a massive, sprawling park where all of Rowling's creations were remade (full Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, St Mungos, etc) all in some fields somewhere, and lighting and technical trickery could make magic appear real, where you could do or be whatever you liked, would you go? If so, why? If not, why not? What kind of things would you want to do there? (ie. be a Pureblood Lord, a Muggleborn, go own a shop, join the Aurors, etc). Would you prefer it to be based on fanon or canon?

Or would you prefer something like Spy Ventures in Castle (the TV Show) where they simulate it as a holiday within the 'real world', rather than off in some park somewhere? So, y'know, pretend to be an auror and get a simulated Patronus to go to some shop set on a back alley where the shopkeeper is an actor that you've got to intimidate for information, etc.


** I watched the show and dont want to be murdered when they go crazy

but nah its too risky to do evil shit because afterall its just a game

** Yes absolutely in a heartbeat, and one of the first things I would do is become a dark lord. Granted I would do everything if I had infinite money. But here's a list of the immediate things: Be a half-blood or pure blood Go to Privet Drive and Crucio some Dursleys Join Slytherin obviously Play Quidditch Wizards Chess Hang out with the goblins Ride a thestral Unleash a Basilisk Break prisoners out of Azkaban Conquer the Ministry You know the normal stuff

**** I've always seen Westworld as a 3-d Version of Skyrim basically or GTA. May as well have some fun with it and jump into the character lol. It's really fun to think about the potential questlines for a Harry Potter themed Westworld. It could just be normal everyday wizard life stuff or could be super adventurous stuff the possibilities are endless.\\

*** Many reasons. Remember, this park would be filled with robots that believe themselves to be people and that their world is real. That concept could make some people uncomfortable. Or just plain social anxiety, etc.

When you put it like that, I'd be opposed to such a park existing. That would be deeply unethical to create sentient minds only to trap them in a gilded cage for our entertainment.

I'd much prefer your second option of LARPing with paid actors, even if it turns out to be less immersive. But nowadays, with VR headsets and phone games like Pokemon GO, immersive "altered reality" games are a possibility that's just over the horizon. I think that would be a lot more fun that visiting a theme park where the fantasy is kept separate from everyday, limited to within the borders of the park itself.

***** Not necessarily sentient, but at the very least with the appearance of sentience. Chinese Room kind of a deal, perhaps? Would that change your mind, if they weren't actually sentient or sapient and only appeared that way?

****** Definitely, I wouldn't have a problem with such a park if the robots lacked true consciousness and just /seemed/ like they had personalities because of advanced conversation algorithms.

**** If there are enough people protesting for animal rights, imagine how many will fight for intelligent robots.

Don't forget Americans fought the biggest war in their history over freeing slaves.

I think based on our current ethics, places like Westworld will be NOT legalized, but will exist as illegal forms of entertainment such as prostitutions and narcotics today.

***** the problem was the westworld robots where largely to belived to not be intelligent just following complex scripts

with them being able to go off script happening decades after the parks opening

***** Equally, half of them fought that war over keeping slaves. And there are more than a few who think slavery was a good thing. I don't actually know whether it'd happen in America or not, come to think of it - the conflict between Religious Folks crying about playing God and the capitalists crying about Free Markets and Second Amendment-type arguments about Government Regulation doesn't really have any clear winner in my opinion.

I can see your point happening though, illegal bot-shops popping up as underground entertainment. Probably closer to a Fight Club tone, I'd guess.
