Do you think he resembled the snake-like man that came out of the cauldron in ‘95?

Or was Riddle more like when he stole Smith's cup? Changed but not “inhuman” during the 1st War?


** We see him in a pensieve memory the second time he asks for the DADA position (and likely when he drops off the diadem):

#+begin_quote
  “And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn's memory for us. *Ten years separates Hokey's memory and this one*, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. ...”

  [...]

  Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.

  [...]

  Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort's eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.

*** Thank you! For some reason I was thinking those memories were really close in time. But 10 years is definitely significant. That's got to be around the 60s right?

**** It could've happened anytime between 1964-ish and the summer of 1971 afaik. In PoA in the Shrieking Shack, Lupin implies that Dumbledore became Headmaster after he was bitten. Dippet had retired by the time that memory takes place.

  “Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me.

  “But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school. ...”

** I think he looked weirder and weirder, but then 1995 ritual made a huge step towards weirdness. I think before he was still more or less normal human (with red eyes and some other changes), but the recreated Voldemort lost some serious human characteristics (e.g., nose). That represents also the fact that post-1995 Voldemort didn't have true human body, but what he had was an alchemic construct created by two wizards not very qualified in the human anatomy and medicine. Which is one another reason why I don't believe that post-1995 Voldemort [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html#voldemort-father][was able to sire a child]].

*** I agree, it's seems like a slow progression and the ritual really was the breaking point. And I remember there being references in GOF to Voldemort sustaining himself with Nagini's milk? Which is... odd, since she's a reptile and I don't think reptiles produce milk like mammals.

I've always imagined her contribution to the ritual is what enhanced his snake like features

I love your notes alchemical construct by the way!

**** Snakes are milked for their venom. A cup has a film placed over it that the snake bites into, injecting the venom into the cup.

** I think we can theorise that with each soul split or horcrux, his physical apparence showed the damage. Now we can also add that the snakelike apparence is the cause of the ritual.

*** I don't think that the Horcrux caused the changes - Dumbledore would almost certainly be suspicious if he came back to Hogwarts exhibiting signs of making a Horcrux

**** It isn't a sign of making of a Horcrux, it is just a sign of damage to the soul. In my theory anything that would damage the soul would have those signs. And even if we don't take it, Dumbledore would need to know about Horcruxes beforehand.

***** Even if he didn't know about Horcruxes then, Dumbledore would have proof Tom was meddling in soul magic. Besides, Tom was still looking completely normal when he visited Hepzibah Smith, and that was well after he turned the Diary into a Horcrux.

*** I agree, it sees like each splitting gradually changed him into something unrecognizable as human. It's a cool idea- internal spiritual changes taking on physical form!
