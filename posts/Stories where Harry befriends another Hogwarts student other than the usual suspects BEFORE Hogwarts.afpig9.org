There are plenty of stories where someone, mostly Lupin or Sirius, raises Harry and he grows up with the Weasleys, Neville, Malfoy or Daphne/Tracy as best friends. Alternatively, some run in with Hermione and queue the shipping.

But are there some stories where Harry befriends, let's say Justin FF because they went to the same school? Or Harry runs into Parvati and Padma for some reason and they become friends? Maybe Penelope Clearwater or Katie Bell? What about Demelza Robins? Or even the Creevys.

The only examples of "unusual" childhood friends I can think of are de-aged Tonks in the R-Series and a few stories where either Polkins' sister or some muggleborn OC neighbour are involved, but what about some other background characters?

No m/m, no Death Eaters and preferably as little of Lupin and the Weasleys as possible.

has Harry grow up with Padfoot on the run from the ministry. After the trial, he goes to muggle primary school where he meets Blaise and Hermione, who both go to Hogwarts later, but because they all think that the other ones are muggles they constantly try to convince each other that magic isn't real. It's WIP, so far finished until 4th year, but it's already longer than canon. I highly recommend it, it's one of the best fics I've read, with tons of great characters (Auror trainee Tonks hunting Sirius, McKinnon's character arc, Blaise Zabini vs Benson, Draco vs Hydrus Malfoy, Narcissa's scheming with Severus to protect Draco, etc)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) has something similar to what you're looking for. Harry is raised in a facility by some kind muggle doctors who try to help him control his “condition.” He meets Hermione when she's dropped off there for the same thing but they later become close friends with Dean Thomas and once they find out about Hogwarts they get to know some muggleborn students that I rarely see stories ever mention let alone spend time on. It's a WIP and hasn't been updated in a while but definitely worth a read imo.

*** Seconded. A great story, it's a shame it's seemingly on hiatus.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
