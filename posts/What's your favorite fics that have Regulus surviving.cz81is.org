I just found out about these stories last night. I read like three >100k ones last night. Please help fuel my new-found addiction.

What I read yesterday:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]

I stumbled across these stories in the Horcrux Hunting tag, after I realized this was a kick-ass concept, I searched the Sirius & Regulus tag for more. (Note: Not to be confused with the Sirius/Regulus, I'm not interested in any of those)

If anyone knows some from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] let me know, I'll be looking there today.

** The writers of Renascentia also wrote another Regulus lives fic linkao3(16375733) which you might enjoy too if you haven't read it yet.

My own favourite fic is The Black Sheep Dog series by izzythehutt linkao3(14800721) linkao3(15457248) which I first discovered when looking for Regulus survives fics.

  In the thick of the first war with Voldemort, Regulus steals the locket Horcrux; and pulled from the grip of its trials, he survives the cave. What follows is a tale of espionage, blood politics, and accidental vigilantism. Welcome to 1979.

Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** I quite like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/Things-in-Common][Things in Common]] linkffn(12473874). I mean, it does have some issues and Regulus being alive really isn't a major focus (and tbh it's not quite clear to me how he even survived / why he changed his actions from canon.) but hey, I found the relationship between Tom and Ginny (not in a romantic way) really interesting. I certainly haven't read another story with diary!Tom being handled as he is in here. :)

Besides that I only have some time travel stories that have Regulus in a more central role though - but obviously they are set before there is anything he can survive, so I'm not sure if they count.
