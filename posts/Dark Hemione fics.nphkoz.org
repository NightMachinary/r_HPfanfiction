:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read a whole lot of HP fanfiction lately and I'm looking for a femslash or no romance dark Hemione fic. So far I've found non that were good.


** She's a bit dark in New Blood. Mostly just accumulates power and influence. Arithmancer maybe? I haven't read it in a while so idk for sure if she's dark in that one or not. Seconding Hermione Granger, Demonologist, that one is excellent and she's quite dark in it.

*** The second you recommended has a hermione/Theodore nott pairing

I was excited about basically every tag and then you hit me with the F/M despite OP asking for femslash :/

**** I'm surprised by the tags. I read Coven on FF.net, and I'd interpreted it as super strongly Hermione/Pansy.

Just [[/r/Sapphoandherfriend][r/Sapphoandherfriend]], I guess.

***** In fact, there's a disclaimer specifically stating that the story is not hermione/pansy and will never be

****** Maybe the author is trying to say that it's not the endgame pairing? (Spoilerfail, argh, help) even if it's not the endgame pairing.

**** I love coven! Unfortunately it's unfinished and at the point it was left, the Hermione/Theo tag hadn't panned out yet. He's an ally at best. And there are Hermione/Pansy femslash scenes even if their relationship ends up being platonic. And considering there's the Luna/Pansy tag too, that does fulfil the femslash requirements.
