Does anyone know of any fics like this, where the person being obeyed is just as uncomfortable with the situation as the cursed one? Non-sexual slavery fics would count too, I suppose.

**** I'd highly recommend linkao3(Lessons in Grace and Decorum) then! Draco is bonded to Harry as an alternative to Azkaban after the war. Harry has a lot of power over him but he would never abuse it and he feels very reluctant about the whole thing. Lots of angst but a happy ending.

  In Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy gives Draco lessons in how to manipulate people into loving him. When Draco is released on the condition that he is bonded to Harry as his prisoner, he finally has a chance to put his newfound skills into practice. Forced bonding, eighth year (eventually), a Draco driven slightly mad by grief, a furious, self-destructive Harry, a whole lot of angst and a proportionate amount of comfort.Inspired by an excellent story called Unexpected Consequences by Lauren3210.

** What if it's not slavery, but more like compulsory service for a life debt? I have a story where Remus Lupin has to work for the Blacks (clerical work but dealing with dark secrets & mysteries) but they treat him like a coworker (Sirius) or a minion (Bellatrix).
