You know the old characters reading the Harry Potter books to change things? I want something like that but I want it as the characters reading long fanfictions as if the fanfiction is canon or the fanfiction is from another parallel universe or whatever.

Something like: (Reading Backward with Purpose) by Kriish or something like that similar thing. So not the characters reading the books, just fanfiction like that.


** Not exactly that but in linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) things do get changed after the whole entire school reading debacle.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** "Hermione Granger's Guide to Gender Flip Fanfiction" isn't a fic where the characters read fanfcition, but they do discuss common tropes and those actually become canon...er, kind of. It makes sense in context.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.
