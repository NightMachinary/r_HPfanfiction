I recently read Across the universe and I really enjoyed it. I was wondering if there were any other fuvs that handled Harry dimension traveling and meeting his parents in a similar way. It doesn't have to be a one-shot, I'm more than happy to feed my fanfic addiction with a longer story


** The two best and closest to Across the Universe that I can think of are both abandoned, largely before too much happens, though I retain hope (ridiculous as that is).

In /A Place Past Loss,/ a very depressed and suicidal post-war Harry (who, in this story, lost Hermione and Ron in the war) travels to a new dimension and ends up staying with a James whose own Harry died young. I was really jazzed for this one, because it features one of the few believable set-ups for an actual James and Snape friendship. linkffn(10621216).

/Fortune Favours the Damned/ has a depressed post-war Harry summoned to a similar dimension (he's /not/ summoned by the Order). I very much enjoyed this one, and still reread it every so often, despite the fact that it leaves off on /the worst cliff-hanger possible/. So be warned. ffn(4929285).

I'll throw in a few others in case you would enjoy them.

/The Mirror of Possibilities/ (again, sadly abandoned) features a post-war Harry who's doing pretty well coming to a parallel dimension where his counterpart died as a baby. Some interesting family interactions and real character-building. The younger brother in this fic reminds me of the younger brother in Across the Universe. linkffn(5502136).

/A Second Chance: The Rewrite/ (also abandoned) is similar. I don't actually remember this one well. linkffn(2681873).

/Dimension Father/ (complete!) has Harry travel at the end of the Department of Mysteries battle. This one I really liked when I was younger. It's much harder for me to read it now. You can tell it's written by a young person (but well-plotted for a young person!), and the grammar /hurts/. (I think it may be an ESL author). linkffn(4144226)

/Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/ (complete!) is one of those dimension travel classics, like /Across the Universe./ It's quite different, but you may like it. linkffn(2477819).

/Too Far From Home/ has Harry transported to an AU during the summer before his fifth year. There is lots of Potter family drama, and the characters are /really/ imperfect while Harry is ridden with all the angst. I really like it though. It's very sporadically updated. I don't think there's been a new chapter in more than a year or two. Hope remains. linkffn(5757945).

/Love and Love Again,/ is an AU wherein everyone thought Harry died the night of V's attack, and the Potter's lived. At times the tone and family elements are similar. Throwing it in, just in case it appeals to you. Also another abandoned one. linkffn(7624618).

I'll also throw in /The Second String./ It's not terribly like Across the Universe, but it's a great and well-plotted time-travel AU fic, and the family relationship between Harry and Aberfoth Dumbledore is extremely well done. James and Lily are characters, though they do very little until the last quarter. Complete except for an epilogue. If you don't like slash, I'll note that the relationship isn't a main focus. linkao3(15465966)
