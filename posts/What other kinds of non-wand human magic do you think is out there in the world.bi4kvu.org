In the first book, Ollivander states that wizards and witches can channel their magic through almost anything (then states, as a biased wandmaker, that wands are the best foci for magic). But wands are a European/Roman invention. Surely the native peoples of North/South America, Africa, Asia, India, and Australia all had their own styles of magic. It can't all be just potions.

The books don't do a very good job of explaining this. They're very Europe/UK-centered. So, rather than asking details from cannon, I'm leaving this as an open ended discussion question: given what we know about wizards, what sort of powers and abilities could the various wizards around the world show? Especially given their cultures and mythos?

Also, what legendary figures could make for examples of "he was actually a wizard"? Like, Jesus is a mediwizard,, Anubis was an ancient Egyptian necromancer, Zeus was electrokinetic, Amaterasu pioneered sun magic, Quetzalcoatl was a feathered dinosaur animagus, etc. If you have any relevant fics, feel free to post them, but mostly I want to discuss.


** I remember someone talking about a Pottermore article that explained that the students of the African Wizarding School (Ugandu?) did not use wands and rather learnt Wandless Magic.

For the other, I guess anything can be a foci, but you can maybe to join it with local lore :

America seem to have been really influenced by the colonization (since, in the Fantastic Beast, we see them all use wands), but maybe that the Natives of North America used some kinds of ritual magic, as well as the one from Central/ South America even if they were more focused on blood magic there.

I also really like another idea I saw about how weapon could be made into foci, so Asian witches and wizards used weapon (like sword or saber) to deflect spells and send their own.

And another foci is the staff I guess. Considering the Celtic religion with its druid, it was probably used in at least some place of Europe (Great Brittain, Ireland, actual France and . . .), before the Roman Invasions. But did it completely disepear or is there some country where staffes are still a common focus (even though is may cause a problem with Statute of secrecy).

** I always saw wands as enabling the weakest of wizards/witches. In other parts of the world where wands didn't catch on, there are probably fewer spellcasters, but they are more powerful on average. I do agree that those seen as divine were probably powerful wizards.

In other places you'll probably see more in the way of rituals, staves, or items (necklaces, rings, swords, etc.) Less effective because they were something else modified to channel magic as opposed to wands being made to channel magic in totality.

** Staves were used before wands. They required a lot of focus to use correctly otherwise they could overpower the spell. Even after the advent of wands some wizards and witches still used staves during wars since they could create far more devastating results than wands could. After the Statute of Secrecy however, staves greatly fell out of favour due to their conspicuous nature.

Other cultures might use carved pieces of bone, rings, necklaces, talismans of all sorts and feathered headdresses using feathers from magical creatures. These things all work but are nowhere near as precise and as elegant as wands. Think of a wand as the nozzle on a garden hose, it adjusts the flow of the water coming out and without the nozzle the water comes out far more chaotically and forcefully. So other, lesser foci extract more magic out of a person than a wand would. Casting a simple /Lumos/ with an inferior foci would take as much effort as casting a /Reducto/ would with a wand.

At least, that's my headcanon.

** Well there's chi, Qigong or chakra in East Asia.

It's more of body arts, augmenting abilities etc.

Also if you've seen Jianshi movies, you'll see Taoist Magic or in some Asian films Shinto magic. These have mirrors, swords, talismans, amulet, that feung shui hexagonal mirror thingy, preyed beads, sutras. Heck I've seen a Chinese vampire (in lore) that they cannot step over a blessed white rice line.

Just look at Wuxia or Xianxia diction and you'll see that there's an emphasis on mastering the inner energy before affecting the outside... So basically it is learning to saturate he body with magic that you can easily call it to surface. While this might limited the number of practitioners it does ensure the best is the best. Though one tends to focus on affinities.

If I were to think of Western magic on the other hand, I imagine shamanism. Like bokors in Africa or Houdoo in Louisiana or spirit animal in Indians... So I imagine is that it leavens towards more to Evocation or transformation. A entity medium be it spirit guide or a Loa will act as a medium of sort. Thus what ever object the entity is tied with acts as it's medium.. That's the main difference...

The rest of the dorms of magic will be similar like rituals, enchantments, Runic/Character magic, blood magic etc. Each has theirs own version, just the basic is different.

** [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]] introduces what it calls "Doggerel Verse", a verbal wandless practice which involves making up a rhyme describing the caster's intent while focusing (Doggerel Verse is used by children who can't perform proper magic).

There are also traditional Native American practices, but those are spoilers (explored in book 2), and the Majokai (a Japanese magical society that I haven't read much about). Neither are explored much in the first book, because the American Wizarding Confederation is a bunch of imperialist dicks that require a Cultural Exemption just to learn about other forms of magic.

There are good reasons to prefer Wanded magic over Doggerel Verse (the latter is unreliable and slower), but it sometimes still sees use in desperate situations.

It actually appears to be inspired by the "spell" that Ron's brothers gave him in Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone:

** I think the established canon is that all or most magical societies require a focus or some kind. Technically wandless magic is impossible, right? But Voldemort(when he breathes fire he cups his hand under his mouth), Dumbledore(uses his hand next to his want to better control the water spray when Voldemort breaths fire), and Grindelwald(I can't remember it exactly but he has definitely done some sort of wandless magic) are shown to do wandless magic as a secondary bit in their duels and demonstrations in the movies. I don't know if that's what the books say or if it was a stylistic move to add spectacle to the movies.

I think that some think that you could definitely incorporate mythology into it. Skinwalking from the native Americans could be a type of advanced animagus transformation, that lets them use different magically cured animal skins to transform? kind of like the faceless men magic from a game of thrones. Or you could have staffs as channeling objects for true battlefield magics that involve chanting and large area of effect spells. Or special sword techniques were following a specific set of movements creates a specific spell to add some elemental effect to the swing of their blade.

Wands also existed in ancient Egypt, didn't they? at least the magicians in Rick Riordan's books have those boomerang looking wands.

In general, you could easily say that all mythological gods in the harry potter world could just be strong wizards that the muggles knew about.

That reminds me: those hand signs you see in Naruto? They're based on meditative/prayer hand signs used by real shinobi. But in the wizarding world, maybe they can work as a focus alternative? Hands as the focus (or perhaps something worn on the hands), sign as the wand movement equivalent, and jutsu name as an incantation.

I wonder what other religious symbols would work as good foci. Crosses? Prayer beads? Ceremonial body paint? Maybe there's a potion or drug that can temporarily grant the ability to use true wandless magic.

**** Well, now that you bring it up in the anime Blue Exorcist they use a few different religious objects as a way to channel magic for exorcisms, like the prayer beads you mentioned. Runic tattoos maybe could be used, Sirius's wand has runes right? So if it's not simply stylistic the runes on his wand help control the flow of magic, if you tattoo that on your arm or fingers could your whole arm become equivalent to a wand? I don't see why people would use wands over wandless magic unless there was a large enough benefit. Is wandless magic harder to use? Is wood infused with a magical creature the best focus material and the wand is just a staff that is easier to maneuver with?

***** Honestly, Rowling didn't make an actual magic system (The transfiguration formula is the most prominant example of this), so I ended up warping the magic of Harry Potter into a magic system that is as close to canon as possible, although I removed the restriction on transfiguring gold since it really doesn't make sense. Anyways, to answer why counterfeiting isn't a thing in the Wizarding World, there is a version of the Trace setup to detect magical counterfeiting.

Starting off with my explanations to your questions, I will mention ahead of time that I will go with "Slightly eldritch and incomprehensible" before I go with "Magic is Silly and shouldn't be questioned as unrealistic, it's magic!"

As for why people use Wands, I think it is "just easier" if you used a "wand quality wood" with different wand woods simply being better for certain areas such as transfiguration or charms. The real power of a wand comes from the Wand Core, which gives a decent power boost over Wandless Magic, as well as makes learning to use your own magic with that Wand a fairly individual process. As for how the Wand chooses the Wizard? The Wizard chooses the Wand type they have the greatest affinity with, it is why Olivander can say variations of strong and weak "No's".

I should probably explain this with a few examples.

Harry Potter's Wand Wood is Holly, and Wand Core is a Phoenix Feather. Holly is one of the rarer wand woods, it is one of the woods that varies most drastically depending on the wand wood, and is strongest with a Phoenix feather wand core, although that combination doesn't have a lot of perfect matches. Phoenix Feather is fairly reactive to the user's innate desires. What this actually means is that on it's own it is a fairly normal wand wood, but it poorly restrains the power of it's wand core, being even more volatile with the Phoenix feather core, however, if someone is actually suited to this combination, then they will be able to bring most of that Wand and their own potential to the forefront.

Hermione's Wand Wood is Vine, and Wand Core is Dragon Heartstring. There really isn't much information on Vine wood beyond them being best suited for someone that seeks a greater purpose, have a vision beyond the ordinary and who frequently astound those who think they know them best. I think this may respond best to someone whose magic is constantly "preparing" in response to these ambitions. Given that divination exists and seems to be the antithesis to that sort of preparation, and that Hermione was said to have no divinatory talent, I am giving this a pass on being silly, and putting it more under Eldritch. Moving onto Hermione's core, Dragon Heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and thus are capable of the most flamboyant spells. They are also easiest to learn magic with, with them being noted as being able to learn more quickly than other types of Wands, as well as being able to change allegiance fairly easily, and able to "easily turn to the Dark Arts, although won't of it's own accord". It is also the most prone to accidents between the Phoenix feather, Unicorn hair, and itself as a core, since I don't have any canonical examples to draw on for the bit about accidents, I will just note it as a thing that happens.

Ron's second wand, the wand that "chose" him, has a Wand Wood of Willow and a Core of Unicorn Hair. It should be noted that his previous Wand was inherited, and was a Ash/Unicorn Hair wand. Ash as a wood was noted to lose most of it's power if it is inherited.

Moving on, wands of Willow are noted to be an uncommon Wand Wood with healing power (never shown in canon by Ron), are best suited "for those with the greatest potential" rather than "those who have little to learn". This doesn't guarantee that wizards like Ron actually met their potential. Unicorn wands generally produce the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages, although "are the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts", and an extremely faithful wand. They also don't make the most powerful wand, relying on the Wand Wood. I take this to mean that Unicorn hairs are a fairly standard, if potentially optimized, Wand core across the board, with the quirk of difficulty in "Dark Magic". So, taking Ron's wand, I envision a Wand that isn't that great in combat short of either the Wand Wood being surprisingly good, or Ron actually going a surprisingly long way with it.

As for your idea of a "Runic tattoo", I imagine that would be fairly dangerous in actual usage. If you used something magical like Unicorn hair to string throughout the tattoo, or some form of biological liquid from magical animals for ink, it could boost your power with Wandless magic, but it would also strain your control without the Wand Wood restricting it. It would be like trying to cast spells with a Wand Core alone, so it would be technically feasible, but liable to blow yourself up.

As for other people mentioning other types of focuses, I imagine most of them would be feasible, but fairly limited compared to a Wand, if more powerful in their respective focuses. I imagine that Wand Users adapt their Wand Skill to Wandless magic, thus not using other techniques as much. The Handsigns someone mentioned earlier could be a practical Wandless Magic technique for building power or/and doing more complicated spells, with the more skill that is developed, the less Handsigns needed.

****** Anyways, under that same magic system, it is plausible for other forms of Wandless magic that enhance your physical abilities to be a thing, but it wouldn't be on the levels of something like the Naruto anime.

Ninja in Naruto have City Block class level durability, and High Hypersonic speed.

Wizards in Harry Potter have Wall Level durability without enhancement from spells, and the Protego spell has Large Building Level Durability, so presumably there are ways to enhance your personal durability to a close leve with Wandless magic. It would follow that you could enhance your speed as well. Since Harry Potter has subsonic reactions as a seeker, I imagine that Wizards can train themselves to move at subsonic speed.

That is actually faster than the Eye, but it is a 25th of how fast rookie Naruto Genin can move at the maximum.

Wizards in Harry Potter could probably also increase their punches strength to break through walls (spells have been calculated to this strength), but not much more.

Wizards could probably also use Wandless magic to lift weights that weigh about the same as a car consistently, but not much more.

**** The precise description was this:

#+begin_quote
  Uagadou graduates are especially well versed in Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration.

  The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures. This gives Uagadou students a sturdy line of defence when accused of breaking the International Statute of Secrecy (‚ÄòI was only waving, I never meant his chin to fall off').
#+end_quote

It doesn't sound like Uagadou graduates are going around shooting stunners from their hands etc. Rather, when they are said to practice wandless magic, it is rather that they are specialists in magics which do not involve a wand in the first place (Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration).

This is emphasised by the section on the wand as it related to North America:

#+begin_quote
  The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe. The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.

  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

** I've always thought of staves as an older version of wands, functional in so far as they let you cast proper spells rather than 'wandless' (really focus-less) magic, they've mostly fallen out of use as the secrets of wandmaking spread though. The fact is that wands are not only more convenient to carry and less likely to get caught on things if used in tight spaces, but far far easier to make precise gestures with making complicated spells much easier to cast with one.

Wandless magic is certainly possible, being essentially a deliberate version of the accidental magic all wizards display as children, but it's extremely hard to use even for simple tasks. Perhaps even more important than any difficulty of use is simply that it's far harder to learn, unlike focus based magic there's no spells with associated incantations and gestures, so not only is it harder to describe what one must do, but it's extremely difficult to tell what someone is doing wrong (I also think that is why silent casting isn't taught earlier, hearing the incantation helps professors know whether students are using the right one). It's not strictly speaking weaker than wanded magic, indeed as accidental magic shows it is not limited by the user's knowledge of spells or the existance of an appropriate spell at all and may accomplish almost anything possible, but the difficulty of both learning and use mean that few wizards could ever approach the same mastery of it as they do of wanded magic.

Other foci have seen use in various parts of the world, the most effective typically sharing the magical core in a mundane shell of wands, but in modern times wands are almost ubiquitous, the combination of convenient size, reliability and ease of use suiting the modern world well.

** Sympathetic magic from linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) is fantastic. It allows spells to be cast on something by maniplulating a very accurate replica or specifically imbued symbolic representation of the thing, and works over arbitrary distance. I like the idea of wizards not being constrained by line of sight, and also the idea that leaving bits of his soul lying around for anyone to pick up, was a totally retarded thing for Voldemort to do.

Also I imagine Azkaban has dementors not just for senseless cruelty, but because it's practically impossible to contain a sufficiently skilled wizard without breaking his spirit. Tie up Minerva McGonagall and lock her in a plain cell, and she'd tap out a rhythm with her pinky toe that'd have the ropes and the lock tumblers dancing along, and a conga line of cockroaches carrying off the night guard's tea leaves.

** I'm not particularly enamoured of the drive to make all cultures equal - historically, in real life, and at various points in history, certain cultures have held strategic advantages over others due to their inventions. Sometimes those strategic advantages have been extremely significant.

So I'm completely okay with the European wand having gone global because it's simply the better way to use magic, having displaced various more primitive means of magical action. It's reminiscent of the way in which the entire world has adopted the methods of the European industrial revolution.

The Chinese sphere would probably have stuff like magic talismans, imbuing instruments & weapons with magic, and mind & body cultivation training(taichi, kungfu etc). The body, mind and most instruments & weapons can be used as conductors of magic. Chinese fantasy xianxia novels have a lot of this kind of usage of energy, although it isn't exactly called 'magic' but cultivation. A lot of the cultivation aspect would be based on Taoism and Buddhism.

** Ritual magic is canon. Chanting long sentences instead of short incantations and sacrificing things to achieve the result.
