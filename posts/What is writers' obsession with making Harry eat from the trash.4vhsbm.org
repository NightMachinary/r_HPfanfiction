I don't get it. One minute I'm reading a perfectly passable fic, next the author is going on about how Harry only knows the taste of cold half-eaten pizza he stole from the trash and he can only dream of how it would taste hot. In the books, to the best of my knowledge, he:

1) eats at the table (more often than not)

2) raids the fridge

3) has food pushed through a catflap (wtf, Dursleys)

He does not

1) eat trash

It's gross. Why does this even exist and why is it so prevalent? There are other ways to show a child isn't being given enough food! (again, see above with the books)

/rant


** Fanon Dursleys are usually cartoonishly abusive.

Forcing a child to cook food and then not letting him eat it, thereby forcing him to scrounge for scraps, is more abusive than forcing a child to cook food and then letting him eat it at the same table as them.

There are plenty of other examples of fanon being an exaggerated form of canon. What's hard to understand about it?

*** I'm ranting :P

Beyond that, it gets really tiring after the 1643rd time or so, a mark writers passed long ago. Get a bit creative with it if you want to go down that path, is all I'm asking. Like, I don't know, feeding him cold soup through a catflap.

***** Dumbledore has Harry under the Imperius Curse and is making him eat garbage so that when he gets to Hogwarts he'll love and appreciate the food, thus making Harry see Dumbledore as a better saviour.

I figured it out, guys.

****** I thought it was Petunia who kept him under the Imperius and Vernon who conjured the trash so that it would be even less nutritious. And they were only pretending to be muggles because the goblins threatened to help Harry get emancipated which would stop them from stealing money from his seventy bajilion vaults if they didn't.

** I've definitely seen this a fair amount. I think it's used a lot because it emphasizes the wastefulness of the Dursleys and shows them as actively neglecting Harry, not just "oh no there isn't enough food" but "we're going to throw this out so you can't have it" instead. It's not canon, obviously, but it's definitely not as far off from canon as some things I've seen (although that can be said of pretty much anything in fanon, ha).

Plus, while trash is gross, many people have different tolerance levels. Food sitting on top of a relatively clean trashcan is very different than food at the bottom of a dumpster that hasn't been emptied in a month.

It is definitely something of a trope though.

**** Well, kind of. In canon, they are arseholes who made some bad decisions and aren't willing to understand and are emotionally abusive because of the whole neglect thing. But in some stories, they are pretty much in it for money (rather than, you know, their convictions, however misplaced those are) and bribing every bureaucrat ever so that their exaggerated abuse would go unnoticed which ends up costing them more than they gain and thus makes them into fools. As ignorant and spiteful as they are, they are not fools.

So yeah, you can bash them. It pales in comparison with how they normally are, but if you are an author that cra...I mean, if you try really hard, then you can.

*** If I remember correctly the writer of "A Child Called It" was based on the writers childhood. I don't think it is that far of a stretch for a hungry child to eat from the trash. When my husband was homeless as a teen, he survived off of burger kings trash. It was the items that had been under the heat light too long, so they were in a wrap, but when you are hungry you will look past a lot of things. We know that Harry was fed most of the time, but he was still scrawny and short. The book is from Harry's perspective, and an abused child will be the first one to say something along the lines of "I was hungry, but they didn't starve me." Anyway, I didn't realize that it was becoming a thing. I have seen it in a few stories, but not enough to be annoyed by it. Maybe its a way to show desperation more than "not being fed enough"

** I've seen this maybe once or twice, always in combination with the abuse Harry suffers in canon exaggerated by a fair amount.

I only ever saw this in fics where Harry snaps and goes the path of evil.
