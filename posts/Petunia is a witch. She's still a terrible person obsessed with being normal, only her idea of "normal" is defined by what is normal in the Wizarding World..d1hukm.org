** Personally, I've always thought that a big part of Petunia's obsession with 'being normal' came from the rejection she had to face from the Wizarding World; it would have been the only way for her to stand out, like her sister stood out for being magical, you know what I mean?

  When the letter arrives, Lily is almost as excited as Petunia. She writes Albus Dumbledore to ask if she can go too, and if she cries a little when the answer comes back no she doesn't tell anyone. Lily waves from the train platform, writes diligently, and listens with excitement whenever her big sister deigns to share stories of magic. --Anonymous asked for "what if Petunia was a witch and Lily a Muggle?"

** I don't think she'd be obsessed with being normal (that came from her not having magic in the first place) as much as with appearing successful, being a "proper witch". If not for the first war with Voldemort, I'd say she'd try to marry up and act more pureblood than actual purebloods, but with the climate of that time, it's hard to say how she'd end up.

I've got a oneshot about witch Petunia where she, among other things, tried really hard to marry Frank Longbottom, which was the main reason she joined the Order.
