** Nah. However unbelievable I may find it, Canon makes it clear she was attracted to Ron. Now JKR seems to have done so; I seem to recall an interview where she said her decision to have them end up together was at least partly because she stubbornly wanted to follow through with what she had planned from the beginning.

dito. She was clearly heads over heels for the guy. I just find that to be a huge stretch. And even if she felt some physical attraction "my" (headcanon) version of Hermione would fight that with her rational mind: "I don't want a serious relationship with Ron and a one-night stand is out of the question and might ruin our friendship. I'll get over it."

**** Yea, I think even JKR recognized this in the end. It didn't really annoy me until years later, when I had actually been in a few relationships, that the pairing in question was just silly. Like, people who fight all the time don't change once they get together. That's just stupid.
