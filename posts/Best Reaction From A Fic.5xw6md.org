** Does immediately closing a story and purging it from your memory after the author drives the story off a cliff count? Because I can probably make a list 100 stories long.

*** The "never forget, never forgive" line from Caedmean Victory sticks out to me. It had its faults but I thought it had potential. As soon as that happened I knew the author wasn't going to develop any characters at all.

**** To be fair, in the movies, Voldemort says an altered version of that. It's so cliche, I know, but it is such a villain thing to say.

On mobile so I don't know if that worked, but the fic Unsung Hero had the absolute worst ending for a fic I can recall. The funny thing is I don't remember how it ended per se, but I remember being so angry that I stopped reading fanfic for a while after that.

** In the HP fandom:

Delenda Est had a cliffhanger in the middle of the story (when they get sent forward) and I freaked out because of all the possibilities. That was as good that story got.

Any updates to the Rigel Black series get me giddy and jittery because each chapter is tens of thousands of words long with so much content. The last chapter for the second year was ~ 72,000 words. I was very happy.

I was straight up sobbing when A Difference in the Family ended. The last chapter was beautifully written.

Other fandom:

There was a mash up between ATLA and Hunger Games (The Black Games) and one of the characters did something so unexpected to what I imagined that I may or may not have shrieked a bit.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
