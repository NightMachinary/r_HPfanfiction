I was watching the Pincess Bride last night and thought it has so much potential for hpfanfiction.

You could have Sirius running around "You killed my brother, prepare to die" with Lupin keeping him out of drunk trouble. Harry being "as you wish" 6yr with Gin and 7yr being the year as a pirate, mostly dead, and grand end of shame for Tom.

Or you could have Harry running around being like "you killed my parents, prepare to die." Sirius could have some kind of oc relationship and come back after his 12yr and be mostly but not all dead with DOM battle ect.

There are so many ways to do this, I just thought it would be awesome.


** And who does Snape stand in for? The Sicillian?

*** I'm having too much fun with this. Picturing Alan Rickman saying "In--conceivable, Potter." And that would be pretty ironic to have Snape killed by iocane powder, one of the more deadly poisons

**** Hm, Dumbledore is definitely the Billy Crystal character... but is that McGonagall with him? I think I could imagine McGonagall saying, "Have fun storming the castle, boys!". Also, I'm thinking this might be a James and Lily story... James is the pirate and Lily is the princess.
