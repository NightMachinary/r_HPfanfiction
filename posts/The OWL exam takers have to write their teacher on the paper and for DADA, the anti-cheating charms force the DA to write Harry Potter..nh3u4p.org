It was a fairly popular fic and I remember it being on FFN.

*** I don't have any of the top of my mind, but I took some time to find these on old request threads. I haven't read all of these, so I can't speak for quality.

*Incomplete:*\\
Some of the fics I found were abandoned, unfortunately.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief). Abandoned and I never reached the part where Harry teaches, but it's a fresh take on Professor Harry. He teaches Divination, not DADA.

linkao3(Sine Qua Non by AzarDarkstar). Another one I haven't read. Time Travel Fix-It where travelling Harry becomes a teacher. Also on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11244373/1/][FFN]].

linkao3(C'est La Vie by cywscross). Harry is an assistant professor in this, but still a teacher.

linkao3(The Prince and the Professor by the_supreme_mugwump). Another Time Travel Fix-It in Marauders Era. Also on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8764417/1/The-Prince-and-the-Professor][FFN]].

linkao3(Blackboards and Broomsticks by Glisseo). Last updated a year ago, so it might not be completely abandoned, but it is incomplete for the time being.

linkao3(Strive by Mister-Tom-A-Dildo-Lover). A Tomarry fic last updated in early 2020. I haven't read this one. Also on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12663755/1/Strive][FFN]].

linkffn(Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky). Another Tommary fic I haven't read. Told in slightly crackish drabbles. Harry is the Divination Professor. Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7034761/chapters/16005613][AO3]].

linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London by AppoApples). This isn't abandoned, it's still being updated. The last update atm was late April. Harry and Teddy travel to another world where they end up in the Marauders' Era.

*Complete:*\\
linkffn(Delenda Est). Harry teaches Potions in the Marauders time, but it wasn't a major part of the fic and was only for a short part. It's been ages since I read it though, so I might be wrong. Be warned, Harry/Bellatrix pairing.

linkffn(Wind Shear by chilord). A great Time Travel fic besides the teaching and well worth a read if you haven't read it yet.

linkffn(A Good Teacher by Nia_River). Adult Harry goes back in time and teaches kid Harry in muggle school. One of my favourites. Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4065484][AO3]].

linkffn(Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense by dunuelos), Part of a greater 'Harry travelling between dimensions' universe (in which Harry later becomes some kind of deity) and set in the Marauders' Era. Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20283685/chapters/48082918][AO3]].

linkao3(Hogwarts, to welcome you home by gedsparrowhawk). One of my favourite post-war fics.

linkffn(I Need You by chem prof). This fits very loosely, if I'm remembering the fic correctly. The focus is on Harry/Hermione romance, but Harry is a professor at Hogwarts. Also on [[https://chemprof.fanficauthors.net/I_Need_You/index/][FFA]].

The same author who wrote the fic this post was about also wrote linkffn(Take no Umbridge I: As Umbridge Sees It) and its sequel linkffn(Take no Umbridge II: Taking Defense).

linkffn(Harry Potter and Merlin's Castle by Great Ace). Much bashing and OP Harry. He teaches DADA and helps out with Potions.

linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly by tkepner). Harry is sent back in time by Death, who wants to be free from its 'Master'. He ends up in Lockhart's body the year he is to teach at Hogwarts and decides to make the most of it.

linkao3(Non-Linear Temporal Relocation by Windturtle). Drarry fic where Harry teaches DADA and Draco Potions. Another one that I haven't read.

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Honeychurch Institute of Magic by darkmoore). This one's pretty old and I haven't read this either, but I saw it recced multiple times and people seemed to enjoy it.

linkffn(California Dreamin' by jenorama). Part of a long universe of fics with a Hinny romance focus, but Harry does teach in this one, in the States. Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7919536/chapters/18096517][AO3]].

linkffn(How Harry Turned Hogwarts Around by White Angel of Auralon). As with many of this author's work, you can expect some bashing and cliche tropes, but it's a good read regardless.

linkao3(Professor Potter and his Magical Menagerie by dracogotgame). A Drarry oneshot with Care of Magical Creatures Professor Harry and Potions Teacher Draco. Also on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12234199/1/Professor-Potter-and-his-Magical-Menagerie][FFN]].

linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker). Sensitive themes and Harry/Ginny. I haven't read this one.

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer). Sensitive themes in the first few chapters and fem!Harry. WBWL and bad!Dumbledore for a while, but iirc, that changes after a bit. She teaches Transfiguration.

linkffn(Putting the 'M' in Mystery by missy mee). Harry and Ginny both travel back to Marauders' Era. Haven't read this one either.

linkffn(Princeps by Lomonaaeren). Unspeakable Harry Time Travel to Marauders' Era. Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806/chapters/51317527][AO3]].

IIRC, Harry also taught in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin). Also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18179480/chapters/42997484][AO3]].

Hope the bot can handle all of these.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

**** Incomplete: Some of the fics I found were abandoned, unfortunately.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief). Abandoned and I never reached the part where Harry teaches, but it's a fresh take on Professor Harry. He teaches Divination, not DADA.

linkao3(Sine Qua Non by AzarDarkstar). Another one I haven't read. Time Travel Fix-It where travelling Harry becomes a teacher. Also on FFN.

linkao3(C'est La Vie by cywscross). Harry is an assistant professor in this, but still a teacher.

linkao3(The Prince and the Professor by the_supreme_mugwump). Another Time Travel Fix-It in Marauders Era. Also on FFN.

linkao3(Blackboards and Broomsticks by Glisseo). Last updated a year ago, so it might not be completely abandoned, but it is incomplete for the time being.

linkao3(Strive by Mister-Tom-A-Dildo-Lover). A Tomarry fic last updated in early 2020. I haven't read this one. Also on FFN.

linkffn(Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky). Another Tommary fic I haven't read. Told in slightly crackish drabbles. Harry is the Divination Professor. Also on AO3.

linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London by AppoApples). This isn't abandoned, it's still being updated. The last update atm was late April. Harry and Teddy travel to another world where they end up in the Marauders' Era.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

  Gen, AU. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. Surely nothing can go too wrong. COMPLETE.

**** Complete cont'd:

linkffn(Harry Potter and Merlin's Castle by Great Ace). Much bashing and OP Harry. He teaches DADA and helps out with Potions.

linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly by tkepner). Harry is sent back in time by Death, who wants to be free from its 'Master'. He ends up in Lockhart's body the year he is to teach at Hogwarts and decides to make the most of it.

linkao3(Non-Linear Temporal Relocation by Windturtle). Drarry fic where Harry teaches DADA and Draco Potions. Another one that I haven't read.

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Honeychurch Institute of Magic by darkmoore). This one's pretty old and I haven't read this either, but I saw it recced multiple times and people seemed to enjoy it.

linkffn(California Dreamin' by jenorama). Part of a long universe of fics with a Hinny romance focus, but Harry does teach in this one, in the States. Also on AO3.

linkffn(How Harry Turned Hogwarts Around by White Angel of Auralon). As with many of this author's work, you can expect some bashing and cliche tropes, but it's a good read regardless.

linkao3(Professor Potter and his Magical Menagerie by dracogotgame). A Drarry oneshot with Care of Magical Creatures Professor Harry and Potions Teacher Draco. Also on FFN.

linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker). Sensitive themes and Harry/Ginny. I haven't read this one.

** Also in linkffn(The Archeologist by Racke), Harry gets himself banished from reality in a lost city where he was trying to break the wards. He wakes up in the grave of the female version of himself, solos a cursed city, etc. She teaches History>! after banishing Binns into the afterlife and dueling McGonagall across the castle and on the roof. !<It was insane. This story has a really good explanation of curse breaking and Magical History.
