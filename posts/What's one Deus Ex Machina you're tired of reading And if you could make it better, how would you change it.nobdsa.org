Personally, I get so tired of seeing Harry somehow achieve everything in a fucking coma for who the hell knows how long, then is somehow about to replicate exactly what he did in a coma half a minute after he wakes up.

Just... let's be real here... if Harry's been stuck in a coma for a while he would literally struggle to walk, not turn into a fucking phoenix, dragon, AND gryffin in the same day.


** Gringotts. It can remove soul fragments, act as DNA tests, lawyers, overrule the magical government and knows way more about wand magic than humans who actually practice it. Oh, and also as a diplomatic center for arbitrage between hostile parties, because why not.

I'd make it better by it just being a bank, with upper management that may or may not refer you to other goblin businesses if they believe you're worth their time.

For example any pureblood that goes to jail, if gringotts didn't care, the ministry could just waltz up and say this family are potential criminals and all their vaults belong to the ministry until further notice. For now transfer all contents to our own vaults and suspend their activities.

Who would deal with gringotts if the wizards are sorting out ownership. Just because their goblins doesn't mean they shouldn't care.

******* The key is not identification of the person, just the vault. The reason why so many fics will say something in a gringotts topic, "have you never recieved notices about your vault",is because in the books it's been shown multiple times it doesn't matter who has the key. Anyone can go to a vault if you have a key. The only other way to prove identification would be some manner of blood identification on the vault itself. Which we've seen there's some level of that there.

Gringotts wouldnt be the safest place to store your money if wizards deal with disputes. It's a terrible business practice. For example two wizards are disputing claim of a vault of say slytherin. Nothing to identify them to such an old vault. By your logic, goblins wouldn't care, so let's make up a key that the goblins in fact have in their possession. Gee that's a big claim these two are making and a potential finders fee. So how do you prove who's potentially who. Well if bloods not an option and goblins don't care. One guy can just outright kill the other right then and there and take possession of key. Goblins get paid either way. Bad.

Or let's say 1 guy had a key already. That ends claim? Lol no nothing stopping other wizard from killing him right then and there and taking they key. Goblins wouldn't care either way. Who the hell is storing their money with fickle creatures like this.

If they care that little. I could just bribe them and say this guy is not the guy, when he shows up kill him, and I'll give you 50% of contents in the vault your choice.

Goblins care in the same way a bank cares. Good business is continuing business. No one banks when you don't trust the bank. Hence why banks will wind up failing, cause everyone pulls there money out. Gringotts cares because they have to care. Just good business

That still only tells them you have a /claim/, it can't resolve the issue of whether you're the person to inherit. There could be other people out there with better claims (closer relationships); or maybe you only inherited a share. A blood test can't figure out any of that

Remember that these same fics almost always show James and Lily having this detailed will. Everyone else in the (often centuries-old) line of descent will have also had their own will, detailing exactly what goes to whom. Why are we looking at blood instead of that?

And, of course, there's the fact that everyone else in the line of descent would presumably have also done the same blood test and received the inheritance. By the time Harry gets there, it'll all just be in the name of James or Lily Potter, not some mystical ancient families.

*** The only disagreement I have with your statement is that it makes sense for Gringott's to administer lineage tests - but only because the society they need to operate within places a paramount importance on a witch or wizard's lineage. When the vaults are coded to open by virtue of lineage, their own security - and not getting swindled - relies upon them having accurate means with which to ascertain a positive lineage.

It's a necessary security measure.

Unless the Gringott's you're portraying in your story has them as hands-off space renters, not responsible for security or caring if anyone fraudulently accesses another's vault. That is of course an option.

**** I look at it this way. In the real world, banks also have to make sure they're only allowing authorized people access to accounts and safe deposit boxes so they do have to confirm that the person trying to access those things are who they say they are. They do that by verifying information and ID documents the access-seeker presents to them, but they don't issue those documents. That's for courts or whatever agency issues the documentation in questions to handle.

In the case of inherited vaults, if I go in to a back and say, "My grandma had a safe deposit box here. Gimme.", the bank is going to say, "She didn't put your name on that box. No." If she's dead, they're going to need a death certificate, at least, and probably something that says I'm the one with the authority to access her safe deposit box as opposed to some other relative. They don't have my complete family tree on their computer.

Furthermore, I'm not going to walk into a bank, tell them my name, and then find out that I have inherited all these accounts and safe deposit boxes from ancestors I had no idea I even had.

I, for one, imagine the Wizarding World to have at least as much shitfuckery with regards to vaults, estates, and inheritance. The fact that Harry is left only with a pile of gold after 10 years is probably evidence for this.

#+end_quote

The way I see it, Gringott is only responsible to make sure only the "authorized" person can enter Gringott, and they could not care less about the circumstances the person gained this entry.

As an example, in GoF Molly took some money from Harry's vault (to buy his supplies while he was at the World Cup). Because she had Harry's key, the Goblin let her enter the vault, but they would have done the same thing if Molly (or anyone else) had stollen the key to steal. Their reasoning is "/We use the key as a mean of authentication and whoever has it can enter the vault. If someone had stollen your key, you should have come to us and we would have changed the lock for a fee. Since you didn't, Gringott is in no way responsible for the theft, and it is your problem the your vault was emptied. Since your vault is empty, I would also ask you how you plan to pay the maintenance fee, in the case you can't, your account with us will be cancelled, wizard/".

This would also apply in the case of bastards. Goblin wouldn't care about the genealogy of a wizard, and only if the owner of the vault would have authorized them access. Let's take an AU where Voldemort won, and Delphini grows up (officially) as Delphini Lestrange. Goblins don't care that she is Voldemort's daughter and doesn't have any Lestrange blood, Rodolphus gave her access, so access she has. On the contrary, let's say that Rabastan got a child, after messing around with a Muggle (or raping her). Goblins don't care the he is the son of a Lestrange, the Lestranges never recognized him, or gave him access to the vault, so the Goblins won't let him enter.

Unless the son somehow manages to acquire a key, or all living Lerstranges "perish in a tragic accident"?

Indeed, what would you say happens in case the current vault owner does not designate a beneficiary? Do they freeze the contents until a valid heir appears? Do they try to locate one? Or do they simply deny access to all and just take the fees from the vault contents until fully depleted and they can reposses it?

****** First of all, I'm not sure that the death of all the Lestrange would give the child any right over the Vault. The problem would not be that the child can't prove any blood tie (I never liked the whole "Magic can trace someone's DNA idea), but the fact that he is an illegitimate Child. While it vary depending of the country, the right of Illegitimate Children to inherit their father's estate is generally a relatively new concept (mid XXth century), so I'm not sure the Magical World would have an equivalent law.

Concerning the inheritance in itself, I believe it would follow a similar path to a Muggle one :

- In the case the deceased made a Will, his estate would go to the beneficiary of the will (depending of the country, there are some concept like being forced to leave a part for the children, but let's ignore it in this case).
- In the absence of a Will, the inheritance would go to the next of a kin, said next of a kin may be pretty far on the family tree since Pureblood seems to have some care for genealogy.While not important for this discussion, this is one of the reason why I believe the Potter did not necessarly made a will. Since everything would have gone to Harry if he survived anyways.
- If a next of a kin can't be located, or refuse the inheritance (one of the reason is that the inheritance tax is more expensive the farther you go from the deceased), then the estate would be seized by the State (or the Ministry in this case I guess).

I think the Goblin would not do anything.

Since we are talking about a subject that is not treated in Canon, everyone is free to have his own opinion, but the way I see it, everything related to inheritance is handled by the Ministry.

It's the Ministry that search the Next of a kin thanks to their archives that contain centuries of legal documents (on that note, things like wall rug do not count as legal document, we are more talking about things like birth certificate, marriage certificate, or even Hogwart's registration . . .).

Even if they have a rocky relation with the Ministry, Goblin would still obey to them because it is to their advantage. They don't have to make any research, and in the case of a fraud (someone that managed to forge documents to leach into another family), they have official documents from the Ministry that make their the sole responsible for it.

​

The way I see it, Goblin from Gringott deal in security, and only security. Their job is to make sure that only an authorized person can enter a vault, but they are not the one deciding "who" is authorized, and don't care about it.

In DH, I am convinced that the Trio plan did not perfectly work for only 2 reasons:

1. The Lestrange's vault was one of the deeper Vault of the bank, and was treated as a VIP. Nobody would have batted an eye if they had done the same thing from the Vault 398 in the middle levels.
2. Judging by their reaction, Gringott probably received instructions about the Lestrange's vault beforehand. Something like "/the Fugitives stole Bellatrix Lestrange wand, do not let enter anyone with it/".

Because they don't know Harry's or Sirius' Vault N°, the broom store employee can be forgiven. But Gringott received a letter signed by Harry Potter, who asked them to collect money from Sirius Black vault (who, to their knowledge is currently trying to murder him, while also being the most wanted man in Britain), and they just rolled with it. Goblins just don't care.

​

Concerning Harry's key, I think the situation was kinda justified? While Dumbledore keeping Harry's key for year is not really normal, I would guess that the normal procedure would be to give it to his guardians. And I would never give the Dursley any ammount of control over Harry's money, (Dumbledore also had the power to ignore the normal procedure).

Hagrid was only a messenger, tasked to give Harry his key when he brought him to Gringott. Once again, not really what I would consider the normal procedure, but Dumbledore trusted Hagrid and Hagrid proved himself worthy of this trust.

As for Molly, that's the most easily justifiable of all. First of all, Rowling made her buy Harry things because, unlike with the previous years, GoF shopping trip would have been completely useless to write.\\
I also think that Harry and Molly talked about it "off-camera" (there must have been a moment when the key went from Harry's pocket to Molly's, and I doubt she stole from him).\\
Finally, Harry know Molly wouldn't steal from him. I mean, they wouldn't even have to steal from him, the only reason he can't share his Vault with them is because he know they wouldn't accept. So Molly and Arthur would have his full trust to go to his vault.

***** Well, this is making some assumptions about the wizarding world's views on bastardy. It's very likely that an illegitimate child would not automatically inherit anything from the father unless prior arrangements were made, but we don't know that for certain. It's also entirely believable that they have a way to determine someone's biological relationship to someone else. Like someone commented before there was a blood test on Bellatrix's vault.

It would make sense if there was some department in the Ministry or some private company that offered some kind of 'inheritance test', and it would make even more sense if there needed to be samples from both individuals to determine a relationship, like DNA tests.

After humans kept abducting and exsanguinating artisans, Gringotts formed as a protection agency and negotiated a deal to provide ancestry testing for a price. Most "goblin wars" consist of goblins hunting down someone "doing things the old way". Gringotts provides scholarships and apprenticeships for goblins in exchange for blood, as well as business connections. The stereotype about goblin greed stems from humans not realizing that the goblin they're meeting with isn't a member of Gringotts proper - they pay the goblin they're doing business with, along with paying the headhunting agency.

The vaults for humans arose when a particularly enterprising goblin realized they already have a fiercely guarded area and inheritance testing. Gringotts later began offering proper banking services, but those are entirely separate from the vault services. Most of the finance department finds the insistence on keeping all your money physically in a vault hilarious. Muggleborn families are read in after the first term of blood supremacy.

** Soul bonds.

"Hey, so, we've met once or twice, but now I can read your mind and your feelings, lets tackle all of our insecurities and become a dream team no-one can beat. Oh, and while we're at it, we'll think through all of the plot points and crack them, two heads better than one."

Honestly, the concept of a soul bond isn't inherently bad, but there needs to be some kind of struggle with it, some unease with privacy or loss of freedom. The two people in it can't just start dating before the day is over and go on a horcrux hunt within a month because there's nothing else to do and 'love conquers all'.

And if we're talking about improving it, let the soul bond have progress, development. Start as attraction, that heightened awareness of one another, some little trickling of emotions... And have backtracks - holding a mental link with someone would not be romantic at first, it would be pretty fricking disturbing.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

The only way I can wrap my head around giving a teenager a time machine is if the Time Turner literally doesn't allow for paradoxes. You can be in two places at the same time, but once something has been /observed/ by the universe, it is set. The easiest way to prevent a paradox is to go back in time, tell yourself to go back in time, and then get on with what you were going to do.

I'd say any version of events that causes a paradox or doesn't close the loop is a universe that simply winks out of existence, or explodes violently, or whatever. The Time Turner exists outside of 3D space, so it can apparently just look ahead.

Now, /other/ versions of being sent back in time might not have this restriction, because it's a god or Death or a big magic ritual doing the work.

** Goblins revealing that Dumbledore stole Harry's money (like he really needs it) and hid the will, which inevitably makes Harry rich and Powerful upon reading, owner of some god forsaken Manor with overblown protections (I mean, why would they live in a regular house in a village and use nothing but a pesky Fidelius (in those fics it's /always/ more of a pesky nuisance instead of what it is canonically)?)

I'd fix it by taking a leaf out of /The Liar by Stephen Fry/: the Goblins pick one or two naive kids to have fun with. They have bets on how long it takes before they figure it out. They happily admit this when confronted, but when Dumbledore (by now thoroughly pissed of at having to prove himself every two years or so) forbids them from lying and forging papers, it starts a war. Meaning no-one can get Gringots in or out, for starters.

I'd make the Manor a simple ruin; interesting in its own sake, but not particularly helpful, except as a possible hide-out.

The War has 3 factions now. Voldemort is cut off a couple of Horcruxes (Hogwarts and Gringots), but the Goblins are a sufficient hindrance for both that that doesn't matter a lot.

** The simplest solution to most Deus Ex Machinas (Deuses Ex Machina? - what the heck is the plural there?) is to make the thing a source of conflict as well as help.

Super Helpful Goblins make Harry rich and solve all his problems? - Goblins are utterly reviled by the entire magical world and people only interact with them under protest, so Harry is basically viewed in the same way (IRL) Prince Harry would be if he went and joined a Mass-Murdering Gang and he basically has to be Ride-or-Die for the Goblins.

Harry learns everything in a Magical Coma? - He keeps the skills, but the new abundance of Procedural Memories slowly start eating away at his Episodic and Autobiographical Memories and he basically develops Magical Korsakoff's Syndrome. Still has his amazing abilities of magic though.

It's not a universal solution, but it works for a lot of stuff. Take the Good Things and twist them to give them a bad edge. Imagine a Superhero with Super Strength who's terrified of breaking a nail and will avoid punching wherever possible because skulls are hard things. That kind of idea.

(Especially if it only has blank spaces for muggle marriages) So much of the magical world is defined by “we have a spell for that” and it's deeply entrenched by what family you belong to, it seems almost implausible that Tom Riddle never did one.

Certainly not ones that tell all sorts of information about characters, but tests to determine paternity (like you mention) seem a great idea in principle (if not in execution).

The idea of young Tom Riddle finding out the possibility of such blood tests only to discover that they're- exorbitantly expensive, considered blood magic (or even illegal), and are regulated- completely out of his reach would be devastating.

Maybe he got his job in Knockturn as a teen and got roped into a contract he wiggled his way out of as an adult? No shortage of scurrilous figures to wax demonic about coming through that shop.

****** Love this comment! I've thought the same thing, that Tom most likely found references to Herpo the Foul and Horcruxes but the information was vague. So, he did outside research like you said in Room of Requirement or even in the Black Family Library (iffy).

Do you think he got into Borgin and Burke's to have a place to live during those summers after he was 14? The idea of him making contacts and learning about dark artifacts in that store is so tantalizing!

******* Yes, I think it makes the most sense that he started working the shop at 14 and couldn't just hide away in Hogwarts all summer. It gives his access to Dark artefacts and Dark peoples.

It also explains why the Brilliant and Charming Tom Marvolo Riddle aka Lord Voldemort worked at a 2nd-hand shop in the seedy part of town when, by all accounts, he could have gotten a cushy Ministry job that let him travel and do research and murder lots of people while also letting him cover it up /and/ giving him a pathway to his ultimate goal of lording over magical Britain. Lord Voldemort the Unspeakable makes more sense.

The only other explanation I've given some serious thought to is that Slughorn, after the whole Horcrux conversation, uses all his political and social prowess to blackball young Tom from getting anything somewhat legitimate. Or it could be both, who knows.

Edit:

The Black Family Library trope is one I like to avoid at all costs. The Blacks being a "dark" family is totally fine, in my eyes, but "dark" is just an umbrella term I like to see that means "up to no good." Sirius learns his Marauder's Oath as part of some family ritual, and being the rebellious prankster that he is, uses it as a password on a map. Old families like the Blacks wouldn't hoard dangerous and Dark materials or books their enemies could against them, they'd teach their /children/ to be dangerous and Dark. Voldemort didn't recruit any Blacks until Bellatrix, as far as I can recall, even if the family was politically or financially supporting him from the sidelines.

I'm not sure of any other library mentioned in text (other than the Hogwarts library or the room of requirement). But I would absolutely believe that families had small collections of books that only their blood relatives were allowed access to.

The only solution I've thought of, is that Borgin's was all he could swing at 14, when no one else would hire a child who couldn't perform magic outside school (which isn't exactly historically accurate) and it's another reason for him to be resentful of Dumbledore (in addition to being sent back into London post Blitz)

********** I think it's a situation that's been borne out of Rowling's lack of research, honestly. Because orphanages back in the 40s wouldn't allow kids to stay past 14, they'd assign/be put in jobs and have to make their own way.

When Tom was 13-14 the Blitz/Battle of Britain was happening, and all the school children that age should have been evacuated.

So, him asking Dumbledore to stay at Hogwarts during the summer takes on a /whole new context/ because he literally had no place to go.

The Borgin solution (as I think of it lol) would involve Borgin taking advantage of Tom's situation, which emphasizes Tom's current vulnerability while also leaving open an Avenue for character growth. It's a built in mentor figure/potential antagonist, a temporary home, a source of shame/embarrassment (because he, unlike anyone else his age, is forced to contend with poverty or living magicless and homeless in the muggle world).

#+begin_quote
  swears magically
#+end_quote

I think an understanding/contract without magical consequences might be even more effective narratively.

Because it would make Tom feel almost beholden or complicit in his own humiliation- he's been forced into this position, and he almost has the means to violently relieve himself from it, and yet he stays.

Why? The dark artifacts, contacts, things hes learning, a place to sleep (since he'd never think of it as home, Hogwarts is his home)?

All of it? None of it? Either way, it would make Tom /hate himself/ just a little bit for being /weak/ or being taken advantage of, and worse /knowing, yet having no choice/.

That was long lol! Hope it answered :)

Potentially valuable antiques- sure, but artifacts from the founders seem outside Borgin's area and Knockturn Alley's price point. It seems like a dark pawn shop- a place Malfoy can unload things no questions asked.

It seems reasonable that many valuable artifacts are owned by private collectors or passed down, like Smith, and may still belong to the original families descendants. It seems like (from what canon has told us) older families keep collections either in their homes or in their vaults. If the Malfoys, Blacks, and Lestranges are anything to go by.

**** Magic is a bunch of things wrapped up in one word in the HP universe:

Skill, Intent, Will, and maybe some wonky stuff with emotions and love and all that. Magic might also be partially sentient on its own.

A lot of fics do an excellent job of boiling this down into a somewhat "hard" (or hard/er/ by HP standards) system while still fitting with the canon depiction of magic. Two fics I can name off the top of my head would be the /Alexandra Quick/ series and Taure's /Victoria Potter./ Each does an excellent job in keeping with canon's magic system while fleshing out gritty details with a minimal amount of handwavium to make it fit.

Magic still has rules and limits and requires practice. Have you ever been exhausted after a particularly difficult exam? Well, your brain is eating tons of calories and /exercising/ your brain is also hard work. Magical exhaustion could also be explained by the after-effects of /performing/ magic, which we know affects the caster. Something like a Patronus makes the caster and anyone nearby giddy with delight, combat magic could have a similar aftereffect, and we also know that 'Dark Curses' and the like will corrupt the caster, so trying to something big or complicated with magic still leaves the caster out of it without having to introduce Magical Cores in the mix.

The cores thing, I find, just opens up the story to all sorts of apologisms and thinly veiled racism.

Part of that comes about because the reasoning is generally pretty arbitrary, the Death Hollows are the ones that would make the most sense, but even then I have my reservations with how it ends up happening. For me the Nope! Point is when the divinity chooses to help Harry cause he is (the one with the crappiest lot in life ever), even ignoring just how the godly being came to such a conclusion and why it cares like, what? Now primordial forces of the universe were promoted to Fairly OddParents and go around helping whoever is the least happy kid in the world? This kind of thing is so cringe I just can't even read past that point, and then we have the totally inconsistent powers and perspective of such beings, one example of this would be they considering Voldemort a threat to all life and to solve it they decide to send Harry back in time with all sort of op powers and gear... if they can just casually do this why in hell is Voldemort any sort of threat at all? If he absolutely must die and for some reason they can't just make an anvil fall on his head upon birth despite it not being even close to how op they've just made Harry then why can't they just send Dumbledore back to /misfile/ Voldemort's acceptance letter, or Mrs. Cole to /accidentally/ throw baby Voldemort in the closest fireplace, or even sidestep the whole issue completely by having Tom Riddle Sr. Be sent back in time with instructions on how to not be caught with Merope's love potion? Or even immunity to such potions since it is a recurring power given to Harry?

The way I see to make it somewhat better is to make it so the divinity interfering has neither stakes on the war nor an human outlook at all, “Death Hallowed” and “Lesser Sadness” (could also be “Lesser evil”, not sure) manage it by having the entities appearing with no care at all for Voldemort or the war, in one it showed up because of a deal while in the other the whole point of their help is that it was an experiment they were conducting and Harry just happened to be a prime candidate as their lab-rat. Other way is to play it for laughs or as a plot-device for a non-Voldemort-centric plot, like in the one where Harry was adopted by death and fate. Having it be a more Lovecraftian sort of thing with humans taking advantage of the powers of a godly being that is just so outside humanities comprehension that it won't ever notice would also be far more to my tastes.

*** The snake at the zoo in canon seemed pretty freaking intelligent though. It could hold a short, civilized conversation with Harry, and knew how to nod or shake its head to questions like humans do. It also knew what its plaque read and that Brazil was a country. Heck, it even knew one word in Spanish. Granted, a very common one, but it knew what amigo meant. It also showed excitement and mischief, showing emotions snakes in our world would never show. ((It also had eyelids somehow, which real snakes don't have, so I don't think JK did much research for that scene...)) I doubt it would know anything about the wizarding world though.

Runespoors too have showed (some) level of intelligence and their heads can plan, dream, and criticize, but they're also stupid as the heads often attack each other. So I think HP snakes have more intelligence than real snakes, though intelligence levels probably vary from snake to snake. And a Venom like snake would be fun!
