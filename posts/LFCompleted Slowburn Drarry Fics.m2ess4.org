I'm looking for good completed Drarry fics that have me screaming at the pining. I want to bang my head against a wall at those two idiots taking forever to admit that they like each other. Enemies to Lovers is preferred but not necessary. I'd prefer if it takes place during Hogwarts years.


** I would try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] for Drarry recommendations if you dont get responses here! i'm more of a fan of post-Hogwarts Drarry but below are some 8th year recs.
