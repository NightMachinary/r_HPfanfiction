Are there any good stories where after the war Hermione looks for her parents in Australia?

Any rating is fine, I prefer stories without bashing or characters replaced by new ones (so no Hermione/Draco).

I know about linkffn(7562379)

  Hermione goes to Australia to bring her parent home and gets a big surprise. It turns out her Memory Charm wasn't enough to fill the hole in their lives. Now, she has a new sister who will be starting at Hogwarts as she returns for her seventh year and deals with the aftermath of the war. Epilogue-compliant.

** Probably Australia by MsBinns, though it is from Ron's POV just in case you were looking for one from Hermione's POV.
