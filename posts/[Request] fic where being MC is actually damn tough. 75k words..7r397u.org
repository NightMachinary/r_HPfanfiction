Recently was ill and re-watched the movies - was reminded of the dark and desperate tone of the original source material, especially in later books/movies and so here I am returning to HP fanfiction after many years of absence and wanting something that strikes a similiar kind of tone to later movies.

In retrospect I stopped reading HP fanfiction after too many fics where Harry and/or friends were just ridiculously overpowered compared to the bad guys.

So here is trying to avoid those now and focus on stories where I can root for the underdog and root for MC and it's the same thing.

Some more details of request:

- No slash please (secondary characters, quick mention, no details would be fine)

- slow starts are okay

- Want more desperate struggle, maybe grim-dark war, but not teen angst and edge for sake of edge - ie.if MC's problems were to be jotted down on a list, stuff like being depressed or difficulty with conflicting teenage emotions shouldn't be making front page of said list.

- life is hard and the struggle is desperate because the bad guys are actually serious and credible threats as compared to good guys power level, not because the good guys are just complete morons or unable to find time for a chat and pass along vital info.

- romantic side plot quite desirable

- MC doesn't have to be Harry - but needs to be a guy


** In /Champion/ by OctaviusOwl, Voldemort won the war and Harry's existence is only grudgingly tolerated by the regime. Life is very hard for him, but he's stubborn and a fighter.

It's a pretty brilliant AU, but unfortunately incomplete and it seems recently removed from FFN for some reason.

** You should re-read canon. The last three movies mis-represent large parts of Harry's character. Harry at his core, has always been the underdog. He's constantly facing challenges that punch above his weight level, but still routinely chooses to do the right thing, rather than the easy one.

For a good piece of fanfiction, I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is a good. If the large-scale alternate universe isn't your flavor, try linkffn(On The Way to Greatness).

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** linkffn(The Legacy)

The Legacy follows canon more closely than TFTCD, they even go to Grimauld in their 7th, it has the addition of the contract and the fact that this Harry isn't as lazy as in canon, but he isn't a genius or anything like that. There isn't any form of bash either, except maybe a couple of DE. Also, Dumbledore is a good guy (as well as he could, considering he did abandon Harry to Durskaban and is sort of responsible for Sirius's death.) This is also in my top 3 Daphne/Harry story, mostly because this Daphne isn't the "Ice queen" cuz she doesn't want unwanted advances and is mellow on the inside and all that jaazz, she's different from the usual, which is breath of fresh air in the fanon.

linkffn(To fight the coming Darkness)

Except the fact that this Harry is a bit darker and a lot more competent, i don't remember much of this story, except that Voldy is great, and if I remember correctly, Wormtail is hilarious.

** Linkffn(What it Comes Down To)

MC is Harry. First few chapters are pretty dark as they take place at Malfoy Manor. It's rather well written afterwards as he is mentally all over the place. It isn't really edgey more of just struggling to regain control of his mind. Overall a decent read I'd give it a 6/10. The Slash really isn't that bad/prominent.

When i first got into fanfics, I got super excited cuz ppl wrote a shitload of different things for a bunch of different tastes and prefferences and mostly without prejudice. Don't be a dick, instead of being condescending, ask him WHY he doesn't like reading stories without a male MC. Maybe there's a story behind that. Who knows.
