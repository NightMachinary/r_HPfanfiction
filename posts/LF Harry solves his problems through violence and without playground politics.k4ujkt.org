It's kind of tiring seeing every single method of conflict resolution that isn't against Voldemort being "I'll use Politics!" when an 11-17 year old unless they're literally raised that way has no chance of out-politicking someone like "EVUL DUMBLEDORE" or whatever the enemy of the fic is. Maybe someone like Umbridge, but her racist obsessions could have been used against her. "There's no one out there after you" "What about Werewolves?" that sort of thing.

So many fics have Harry pretend to play along, and then politically backstab someone and get them arrested. If Harry has to deal with Evil Dumbledore, well, Dumbledore has to sleep some time, and he wouldn't be able to react to being assassinated in his sleep. If Malfoy (the younger one) is the problem, just insult his pride til he fires first then kick his ass in a duel so badly that he never tries again.

It's always "We can't kill him, he's too important to the public even if he's evil" instead of "Oh look, enemy guard is down, free kill"


** I suppose it's because you're less likely to be thrown in Azkaban for exposing their “evils” and having everyone else do the work for you, then being thrown in Azkaban for life because you murdered someone in their sleep. It's pretty hard to explain that away, “Judge, I murdered ‘x' because he did ‘y'” and then the judge would respond, “why didn't you bring this evidence to the courts and let justice decide”, etc.

Also I feel it would be pretty anti-climatic, “man Dumbledore's been doing this, this, and this?! He must be stopped.” The next day... “He's been dealt with.” Story over, haha

*** Doesn't have to be known that it was you. And the violence doesn't have to be killing, as I said. Maybe Harry learned from School, maybe he somehow beat the crap out of Dudley (Accidental Magic Fate Reinforcement style) and Dudley stopped bullying him, so when Malfoy tries to bully him, Harry beats the shit out of Malfoy.

There are fics where Harry has an Assassin Class Servant (With a capital S, from the Fate series) and has to deal with evil Dumbledore and does it politically, rather than "Assassin, by this command spell, kill Albus Dumbledore in a way that leaves no evidence and makes it look like he died of old age" idiot plot going too far for the sake of the story, basically.

*** You assume he will he caught anx also assume it would be easy.

For example a totally sociophatic Harry can poison Malfoys pumpkin juice with hemlock and throw the blame on the kitchen elves. Later he would send an anonymous letter to Lucius saying this was retribution for diary or something.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** With sufficient, scandalous proof, you can bring down most politicians these days. This does not necessarily mean that Harry is better at politics.

Look at stories like former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. A hotel maid sued him for sexual assault. The case was dropped, since the credibility of the maid had suffered after she lied repeatedly over her different statements. But it was enough to force him to resign. Now Strauss-Kahn was involved in several sex scandals and adultery resulting in a secret love child, he hardly is a role model. Still, all it took was a maid accusing him of assault. And Harry's case against such Dumbledores is usually much more severe than some secret affair.

What it really comes down to is that when people want to write a fic where Harry literally kills some evil guy, they are probably going to choose Voldemort first. Dumbledore is not a violent character, so a morally superior protagonist (as people like to write them) will be hesitant to resort to violence as long as they are not forced.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  An inkling arises within Pansy, she'd be a fool if she hadn't figured it out by now. The dwindling, the sudden spike in his treat addiction, and the smell - from when Blaise had said he smelled good... She'd seen this before from many of her relatives, ones that present as Omegas.However, there is the matter of the fact that the Malfoy bloodline has only ever consisted of Alphas. So for Draco to present as an Omega would be uncanny. But with how the evidence is coming to be, there is a possibility that this line - that they take pride in - may dip.

** Well, I've written a crack fic in which Harry brutally murders everyone that stands in his way? Not sure if that's what you're looking for but here it is.

There's no politics in it at all. As per the title, the magical government is demolished to create a pure anarchy state, because even Voldemort can't be bothered to politic.
