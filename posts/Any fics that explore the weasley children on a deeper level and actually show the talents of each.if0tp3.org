A fic that shows each of the weasley's talent, maybe give Ron an interest as well.


** One of my favorite fics that I'm re-reading at the moment, although it's still ongoing, is called 'Percy Take the Wheel' by Kitty Smith on ffn. It's the only fic that I've read that really goes into depth into Percy's psyche, and makes him an incredibly sympathetic character that he often is not in fanfiction. I love this story, as it really explores the familial relationships between the Weasley siblings, in addition to exploring and developing magic in new and inventive ways. I really cannot recommend enough. Must warn you of major character death right from the get-go though. It's what sets up the premise for the whole story.

The first chapter can be found here; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel]]

** There is one fic that I'm currently reading called The Chess Master. It's on FFN (I forget the author), and this fic really showcases Ron's skills at chess in it. It's still in progress, but it's my favorite Ron-centric fic as it really show him as a strong character..

Edit: I just looked up the fic that I was referring to, and I got the name completely wrong. The specific fic I was thinking of is called Fate by TheTrueSpartan.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

**** Fate is an amazing Fic. Very long, nearly 3mil words, and while it does have it's complicated bits it's not so hard to keep track of. There is a bit of mindscrew in there, a bit of Chessmaster Ron, and a nice deepdive into some of the dynamics of the Weasley family that is frankly more accurate than what the books series touches on. It's a realistic look into the workings of Family Dynamics and shows good motivation for individual members of the family even outside of the world of this particular fanfic.

I have a MUCH better understanding of that particular family after reading this. I wonder if the author works in the field of Psychology?

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay)

We get to see Charlie do his job, to start, Ron gains an interest to be the first wizard to go to space, Fred and George are on peak form, Percy pulls off some really cool moments that come out of nowhere, Ginny gets to show off in quidditch, and Bill... is same as canon, cool as heck.

Secondly, there's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][my flair]], where Ginny becomes the secondary protagonist, Ron shows some great loyalty, Fred and George are again in peak form, and Percy gets a lot more exploration. And the story's premise of a Hinny soul-bond creates a lot of Weasley family conflict, and it is really well written and allows characters to grow and change.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** the Prince of Slytherin series. not so much in the first book, but the second and third delve into Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, and on a lesser level Percy. it's a trope subversion fic, and most of the first book appears to be very trope-y, but most of that gets overturned later. there's more of a focus on Ron than the others, but Ginny and the twins get quite a bit of screen time and i've really enjoyed reading their interactions.
