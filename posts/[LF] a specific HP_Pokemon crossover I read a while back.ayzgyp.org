I honestly can't seem to find this fic again, and was hoping someone could help me look for it.

It was an H/Hr fic where both Harry and Hermione were pulled into the Pokemon world by Arceus, who asks them to help out his Chosen One, Ash Ketchum. In exchange, he grants them the childhoods they never had by having Harry and Hermione reborn as an Aura Guardian of Rota and a Psychic of Saffron respectively.

*** Are you sure that's the right author? I'm not seeing it on her FFN page.
