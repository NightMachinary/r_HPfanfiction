What Fic took your fanfiction V card? What did you learn from the experience? And looking back on it would you consider that Fic up to par with your expectations now?

And as a bonus, how did you discover FanFiction


** First one I ever read was HPMoR. I remember it had some good selling points (few spelling or grammar issues, etc) but I haven't been able to get more than a couple chapters in on the few times I've tried rereading since then.

** Interesting way of putting it. It wasn't a single fic but a writer. I was already very old and halfway through writing a fic by the time I discovered that what I was writing was called fanfiction and lots of other people were doing it too. I looked at quite a lot of it and was mostly pretty unimpressed. The first fanfiction writer I discovered who showed me that fanfiction could be good---very good---was Lady Altair. It also gave me the sinking feeling I was never going to be that good, so what was the point? etc, (as you do). But I didn't stop (not for long anyway) because story. And yes, I still think she's a terrific writer though these days I don't care for present tense which she uses quite a lot.

** First fic I ever read, near as I can recall, was a Star Trek: Next Generation fic set 30 years after the series (which was still on the air at the time), where Picard's daughter was captain and there was a fully borg Tactical officer. It was a text file off a news group, if that tells you how old I am. (Kids, ask your parents)

In the modern FFN era, the first fic that got me back into reading fanfiction was A Captain and A Madman. It's a Star Trek/Doctor Who crossover that ended up being surprisingly deep and thoughtful. Can't recommend it enough. Even post DW 50th, it holds up very well.

I was aware of the existence of fanfiction pretty early on, but not particularly interested. The shittyness of DH really sparked my interest though and got me addicted. So I guess that book did at least one thing right. If it had been good I'd probably never gotten into fanfiction.

It's starts with Snape and Harry being imprisoned and tortured by Voldemort, and had scenes that shocked me as a 12 year old. Now it reads as pretty tame. Some things seem funny, like the fact that the evil residence is called Nightmare Manor. I would still recommend it to people who are looking for some super angst Sevitus.

** They Shook Hands, by Dethryl.

I was on one of those random spelunking sessions into TVTropes, where I saw it on the FanFicRecs. It just sort of jumped to me. I'm like, 'why not? I'm tired of the main story anyway,' since CC was a bust. It's a 'Harry in Slytherin' canon-rehash, but I did read it up until mid-fourth. End of third was when the story just kinda went all 'Harry Potter and the Birds and the Bees' to me, and I wasn't into ships then.

Might consider reading it again, whenever I finish the one I'm doing now (Regulus' /R-Series/ ATM). Eh, my interests in fics randomly alternate between 'let's see whats interesting' and 'I'm in the the mood for smut.'

I was a teenager then and rather shocked to read something like this, but for some reason I kept looking for more. And years later here I am, still reading fanfiction... I'm sure that the first one I read was badly written. But seeing as how I was barely able to read english texts back then I didn't really care about that.

** Knowledge is Power.

That fic is pretty much an antithesis of canon. Both the MCs are extremely driven towards their goals, and the overarching theme of the fic is that you can do whatever you set your mind to do.

Yes, it is old, it has cliches (although they weren't so cliche back in 2009 when I first read it), some parts are just plain silly, and it can definitely be improved. But it's got the best powerful Harry (in a believable sense) that I've seen so far, along with a couple of well written OCs. I still consider the HP from KiP to be the benchmark for powerful!HP tags.

** Ooh, interesting!

I first was into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and was writing and reading that fandom till about 2003. I discovered Harry Potter at about the third book, which is still my favorite, but didn't get into fanfiction of it until book 5, and that was all Remus/Tonks. I read a lot of Hermione/Snape back then, and I even have a rec post I made toward the tail end of my obsession with that pairing, back in 2006, on LJ! Most of them have held up quite well, especially because back then, his character was still very much up in the air, with people believing he was definitely a baddie, and others determined to write him as always a good guy all along.

â€‹

One of my very first things I loved about fanfiction itself was the community aspect. The CSI forum I frequented did a lot of fic challenges, and one of the most interesting was when they'd have us write a story, having given us the first line and the last line. Those were always a really fun way to see how people thought so differently even with the same characters on offer.

** I read a few reviews of CC claiming that it's worse than fanfics, but ordered it nonetheless. One disappointing read through later, I remembered those reviews and took a look at fanfiction.net. I remember that, while I didn't mind Ginny as love interest, the romance was utterly disappointing, so I looked for a story with that ship.

The first one I read had Harry get a note from his future self that Ginny was his soul mate. They bonded, became phoenix animagi and when they eventually had sex, it hurt Voldemort badly. It was abandoned 200k in because apparently, the author died.

Number 2,3 and 4 were the Bonds of Time series, which first derailed horribly a million words in and then was abandoned because apparently, murdering Hermione's parents is a horrible start for a romance with Ron.

I'm still looking for badass Ginny stories, but given that I adore Hermione, so she, ideally, should be the BFF for both. And given that I find the other Weasleys utterly boring, they should neither play a prominent role nor be shipped with Hermione. Also, no Death Eater whitewashing. It's nearly impossible to find stories with those requirements because most H/G writers generally don't diverge much from canon (or bash Hermione if they do so).

On the other hand it was my first fic so I didnt know how popular WBWL is. I would still stay that its world building is among the best although i probably wouldnt even start such a fic nowadays. I am kinda tired of this type of fics now because in my opinion there are only so many ways Harrys school years can be retold.
