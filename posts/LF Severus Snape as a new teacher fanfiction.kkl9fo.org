** The Hogwarts Potions Professor by Seekeronthepath is awesome and probably more or less exactly what you're looking for.

Also, the first part of Of A Linear Circle is also something that fits the bill - but really only the first part, as the story rapidly grows and expands. However, the first story starts with Snape as a student, gives us a couple of vignettes, and then probably my favorite scene of Snape going "oh gods everything is awful and somehow I am now Head of Slytherin House and what the fuck is Albus thinking how am I going to do this" that I've ever read. And in general there's a lot of focus on teaching in this fic - but also a lot of other stuff too, it's a long, brilliant epic that sprawls dramatically and covers a bunch of things. So I'll link it, but be advised that only the first story really closely fits your request.

** [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/8266.html][The Little Joys of Teaching]] is a good one.

[[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/43077.html][Wormwood and Gall]] is a sad take on his teaching career.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/868256/chapters/1666520]]) is more canonical, which of course involves Snape self-destructing his life.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3403247/chapters/7450547]]) is an interesting fic about him becoming the Slytherin head of house.
