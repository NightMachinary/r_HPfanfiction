Bonus points if they associate the cat's thought and action to make a dictionary of cat-tongue, and/or become a cat speaker.


** The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862) has Harry and McGonagall both understanding cat-speak because of their animagus forms and resulting experience with cats in general.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

Fem!Ron spends a couple chapters trying to figure out a way to communicate with Crookshanks. She eventually finds a spell and manages to cast it. The ensuing conversations are hilarious.

** There is no canonical proof that animals communicate with each other (and even less that animagus can communicate with the animals its shape they have). Can you imagine [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/web-how-do-you-become-animagus][all that effort]] spent and all that for nothing?

*** The "there's no canon basis for..." complaint, on its own, makes no sense - it's fanfic, if the fanfic-author wants to change something about canon or introduce new elements they absolutely should. It'd be boring, and probably a copyright nightmare, if all fanfic just boiled down to "the books but in my own words".

There /is/ an argument to be made for complaints in the sense of "these fanon clich√©s never result in a story I want to read, so I avoid them" - but that's not a constructive thing to be talking about in a request thread. In fact, it's toe-ing the "No Request Thread Bashing" rule.

*** That's why I suggest legilimency, right? jk, jk.

well... I like cats. I had a cat. I want to peer into their minds, and see what makes them so cute in their behavior. call it curiosity, but I want to read a fic that explore cats?

**** Oh, I am stupid ... I read it incorrectly, I understood you meant learn to be Animagus. Sorry, taking back everything. Well, I suppose, theoretically, Legillimency could work even on animals.

*** Doesn't Peter Pettigrew communicate in some way with rats to find out where Voldemort is? I might be mistaken but I think it's mentioned at least once in Goblet of Fire that he has some affinity with them due to his animagus form
