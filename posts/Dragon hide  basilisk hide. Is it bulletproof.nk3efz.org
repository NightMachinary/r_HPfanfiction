** We don't see any guns in Harry Potter so we don't know. HP dragons are very resistant to spells and even in folklore or other universes (think Smaug) they can only be killed through a chink in their armor. They also seem to be very resistant to burns and poisonous spikes. We don't know much about the basilisk but you could do whatever you want without defying canon as Harry kills it by stabbing it in the mouth.

** In myths, dragon scales are often a very special, durable protection, see e.g. Siegfried. So I say yes.

(There's obviously no canonical answer.)

** If it weren't, surely guns would be a lot more common in the magical world.

** I'd like to think that dragons are impervious to everything except from other dragon's teeth and claws.

As for basilisks, my headcanon is spell resistant skin, and thick weapon resistant skin, but not impossible to penetrate with the right wespons. The membrane in the mouth is poison and spell resistant, but is not stab proof.

*** Well in HP at least, Wizards are shown to use spells to subdue dragons, so they are definitely NOT impervious.

The fact that Wizards use them for entertainment and Goblins use them as guards shows dragons are pretty low on Wizard World's pecking order.

**** IIRC, it generally takes several people working together to subdue them. So I think it's most likely that they at least strongly resist magic, but that resistance can be overcome with enough power. (Weak spots like their eyes are an exception, of course.)

** I'd say that they're probably both at least as good as kevlar, if not more so for dragon hide.

** Surely it would depend on the bullet.\\
Given that the goblins keep their guard dragon in line by poking it with sticks and the tanned hide is canonically treated a lot like leather, dragon hide is unlikely to be effective against bullets of any significant size.\\
That being said, given that a dragon is a really big animal, you definitely need something with a tremendous amount of stopping power to take one down.

I'd say the same would be true for a basilisk.

When trying to determine the effectiveness of guns in a story apply the following test:

If a given creature is vulnerable to a wizard banishing a sword at it or a giant animated chess piece or troll hitting it with a club then said target is going to be equally inconvenienced by being shot in the face with a really big gun.

Or to put it another way, if a werewolf or a large animagus form is a legitimate threat, then so is a gunslinger.
