So, in most of genderbend stories the character's personalities stays the same or very similar to the original, why not a story where they have personalities completely opposite to the original ones.

Like, Hermione is a studious book worm, so the male Hermione could be some type of a perv who only cares about girls and tries to seduce the teachers to free himself of detentions. Female Draco could be more like Scorpius, shy and nervous and insecure. Ginny could be insensitive and insecure and Ron could be energetic and confident (what means we just swap Ginny and Ron?).\\
Wormtail can be brave and smart, alongside to a kind Voldemort who treats his followers like humans beings who probably would smile and sing joyfully while murdering and torturing people.


** Hm, yeah, but I guess that would almost make them OCs. The thing about genderbending is that most people use it to explore how things would change if x character was another gender. Changing their whole character would kind-of defeat the purpose, imo.

I mean, if Ginny were male and insecure, that what exactly makes him the Ginny we know from canon?

** I now want to write a fic with almost everyone switching genders, but Ron and Ginny in particular.

Gin, or Gingalain (Gingalain, in Arthurian legend, is Gawain's son, so it's sticking with the theme because "Ginevra" is the Italian version of Guinivere, King Arthur's wife) or Gawain (better than Gingalain, at least), would probably be the "forgotten" child much like Ron is because he's just another male and was born after the much-awaited female. He'd probably be really bitter and jealous and I imagine that he'd be a secret Slytherin. He probably would've read all of his siblings' old books and learned all he could about Hogwarts.

Ron, or Rhona (I don't much like the name Rhonda), would probably be super full of herself because she's been doted on as the only female in the Weasley brood. She probably bullied Luna Lovegood for being odd and weird and isn't the best sibling. She's probably alike with Percy in regards for being the least favoured sibling.

For Harry, I would use the name Rose (I heard that's what Lily would've named Harry if he'd been a girl, I don't like it when people call the female version of him Harriet, though it's not that bad of a name). She'd look a lot like Lily, I suppose, and would be really really tiny. She'd be shy but very intelligent (she'll actually use her flipping brain!) and would also be very resourceful.

** If the personalities are so different though, I mean more than just what can be explained as the difference between a male and female who are otherwise exactly alike then isn't it really a new character though? Like male!Hermione being a perv, I'd read but only if it's secondary to him still being a massive bookworm like original Hermione. In short there needs to be something connecting them to the original character aside from name, for me.

*** That said, I'd like to read a female Ron who crushes on Harry. Maybe by not being a boy like Harry is she wouldn't feel so overshadowed by Harry all the time.

** Ooh this is fun.

I imagine Harry would be sort of like the Harry from AVPM, if you've seen it. Harry would be super full of himself, and love being rich and famous.

Let's see... Luna would be a very closed minded, "won't believe it till I see it" type. Neville would be a bully to Draco. Snape would be cheerful, always smiling and awarding points. Hagrid doesn't like animals, and is very good at keeping secrets. Fred and George would be uptight and serious like Percy. Percy would be the one cracking jokes and teasing everyone. And Crabbe and Goyle would be talkative geniuses.

It would be utter chaos. I love it.

**** Umbridge wears heavy eyeliner dresses in all black, but despite her gothic appearance, she cares very deeply for the children she teaches, and always stands up for what's right. She's also allergic to cats.
