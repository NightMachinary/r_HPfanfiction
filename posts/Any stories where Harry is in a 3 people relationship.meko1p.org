Like, I read one where it was Snape Lucius and Harry once (I can't remember anything about it except Harry had a type of big cat animagus) But whenever I've read fics or something where there's 3 people in the relationship, it's always been so sweetüòÖ So any good recs? Doesn't have to be the three previously mentioned but preferably not with Ron or Hermione, and of poss not ginny (I don't dislike ginny but I way prefer like Harry and draco or something üòÖ)


** Ok, i was going to link it but then I realized it would violate rule 8 so check out

/Best Friends, Always/ and it's sequel /We Three Seekers/

** If you don't mind explicit smut, I want to be the first to recommend the Triplicity series by idleside on AO3. It's a post-war EWE (The first story, linkao3(Best Behaviour by idleside) has them getting together at Ginny's wedding to Draco) about the trio relationship of Harry, Daphne, and Pansy.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

** Darkly Loyal by Kierra Marcos is a Harry/Draco/Hermione. I know you said no Hermione but it's one of the best fleshed out stories I've read.

** There are many, many of these, but perhaps want to post this in the HPSlashFic sub because this sub tends to be anti-slash. Harry with multiple females is usually called harem instead of threesome (and will almost always include Hermione as one of his partners).

My favorite all-slash threesome is Harry/Draco/Snape, which I like to call Snarco (AKA "Two and a Half Slytherins"). A nice sweet story in this genre is [[http://www.pornbunnyfarm.com/pages/andthentherewerethree.html][And Then There Were Three]] by Swtalmnd.
