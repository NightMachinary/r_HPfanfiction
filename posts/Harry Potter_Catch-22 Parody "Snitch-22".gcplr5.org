/The castle of Hoganosa lies near the stormy sea eighty miles north of Privet Drive. It is quite magical and obviously could not accommodate all of the bureaucracy described. Like the setting of this novella, the wizards and witches, too, are fictitious./

It was love at first flight.

The first time Potter saw the gamekeeper astride his flying motorcycle, he fell madly in love with him.

Potter was in the hospital wing of Hoganosa Castle with a pain in his floppy arm that fell just short of being boneless. Madam Pomfrey was puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite boneless. If it became boneless, she could treat it. If it didn't become boneless, and stopped being floppy, she could discharge him. But this just being short of boneless all the time confused her.

Each morning she came around the ward. She would read the scroll at the foot of Potter's bed and ask impatiently about the pain. She seemed irritated when he told her it was exactly the same.

"Still no total bone loss?" Madam Pomfrey demanded.

She shook her head, when Potter shook his head.

"Take another dose of Skele-Gro," she sighed, mostly to herself.

Madam Pomfrey made a note to give Potter another dose of the potion, and she moved along to the next bed. She did not like Potter. Actually, the bones in his arm /had/ fully gone away, but Potter didn't say anything and Madam Pomfrey never suspected. She just suspected that he had been losing bones and not telling anyone.

Potter had everything he wanted in the hospital wing. The feasts weren't too bad, and the food was brought to him in bed. There were extra rations of meat pasties, and during the cold part of the afternoon he and the others were served chilled pumpkin juice by the house-elves. Apart from Dobby and Madam Pomfrey, no one ever disturbed him. For a little while in the morning he had to clean slugs off of the school trophies, but he was free after that to spend the rest of the day lying around idly with a clear conscience, as if he weren't even a Horcrux. He was comfortable in the hospital wing, and it was easy to stay there since he always had a dragon-grade fever. He was even more comfortable than Longbottom, who had to keep falling down on his face to get his pasties brought to him in bed.

After he made up his wizard brain to spend the rest of the school year in the hospital wing, Potter sent owls to everyone he knew saying that he was in the hospital wing but never mentioning why. One day, he had a better idea. He sent an owl to everyone he knew, saying that he had been chosen by prophecy to complete a dark and dangerous mission. "They asked for kids who were already Horcruxes. It's very dangerous, but someone has to do it. Someone chosen. Someone who is me. I'll send you an owl the instant I get back." And he had not sent any owls since.

All the Gryffindor patients in the hospital wing were forced to edit essays written by Slytherin students, who were kept in a dungeon of their own. It was a tedious job, and Potter was disappointed to learn that the lives of Slytherins were only slightly more interesting than the lives of hospitalized students. After the first day, he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony, he invented games. Death to all Muggles, he declared one afternoon, and out of every essay that passed through his hands went all proper nouns. The next day he declared wizard war on adjectives. He reached a higher level of OWLs the following day when he inked out every word in the essays except /a/, /an/, and /mudblood/. That erected more dynamic magical racist tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left an essay far more aligned with Mars. Soon he was inking out topic sentences and leaving the supporting paragraphs untouched. One time he blacked out everything except "Dear Professor McGonagall" from an essay, and at the bottom he wrote, "I yearn for you tragically. A. Filch." A. Filch was the janitor's name.

When he had exhausted all possibilities with the essays, he began altering Marauder's Maps, obliterating names and poltergeists, annihilating corridors and prefects' bathrooms as though he were Dumbledore. Snitch-22 required that each censored essay and map bear the name of the censorer. Most essays he didn't read at all. On those he signed his own name. On those he did read he wrote, "Dudley Dursley." When that grew monotonous he wrote, "Dursley Dudley." Editing the maps had serious repercussions and produced a level of rippling anxiety among the teaching staff on the level of a dungeon troll. Eventually a Polyjuiced spy was floated into the hospital wing, posing as a student. They all knew he was a spy because he kept inquiring about a patient named Dursley or Dudley and because after his first day there he wouldn't edit essays. He found them too monotonous.

It was a good hospital wing this time, one of the best he and Longbottom had ever enjoyed. With them this time was the thirty-four-year-old Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with the flowing golden hair who had been blasted into the Chamber of Secrets in mid-winter and hadn't even caught a cold. Now the summer was upon them, the teacher had not been blasted into the Chamber for several months, and he said he had the grippe. In the bed on Potter's right, still lying on his belly, was the startled teacher with a turban on his rear and a face for a head. Across the aisle from Potter was Longbottom, and next to Longbottom was the Ravenclaw with whom Potter had stopped playing wizard's chess. The Ravenclaw was a good wizard's chess player, and the games were always interesting. Potter had stopped playing wizard's chess with him because the games were so interesting they were foolish.

Then there was the educated Welshman from Wales who looked like someone from a children's fantasy movie and felt, with school pride, that wizards -- pure-bloods -- should be given more house points than drifters, whores, degenerates, layabouts, the unemployed, squibs, and indecent folk -- half-bloods.

Potter was delisting ingredients in potions essays the day they brough the Welshman in. It was another quiet, hot, untroubled day. The heat pressed heavily on the mullioned windows, stifling sound like a well-placed Muffliato Charm. Longbottom was lying motionless on his back again with his eyes staring up at the ceiling as if he had been Petrified. He had been working hard at increasing his lifespan without a Philosopher's Stone. He did it by cultivating boredom. Longbottom was working so hard at increasing his lifespan that Potter thought he was dead. They put the Welshman in a bed in the middle of the wing, and it wasn't long before he was proffering his views.

Longbottom sat up like a backfiring wand. "That's it!" he cried excitedly. "There was something missing, and now I know what it is!" He banged his fist down into his palm. "No school pride," he declared.

"You're right!" Potter shouted back. "You're right, you're right, you're right. Ten points to Griffindor. The pumpkin juice, the Quidditch team. Hagrid's rock cakes. That's what everyone's fighting for. But who's fighting for the pure-bloods? Who's fighting for more points for the pure-bloods? There's no school /pride/, that's what it is. And no school /spirit/, either."

The DADA teacher on Potter's left was nonplussed. "Who gives a flying Chudley Cannon?" he asked tiredly, and turned over on his side to go to sleep.

The Welshman turned out to be good-natured, generous, and likable. In three days no one could stand him.

He sent shudders of annoyance scampering up ticklish spines, and everybody fled from him like spiders from a basilisk -- everybody but the Hufflepuff in white, who had no choice. The Hufflepuff in white was encased from head to toe in plaster and gauze. He had two useless legs and two useless arms. He had been smuggled into the hospital wing at night, and the students had no idea he was among them until they awoke in the morning and saw the two strange legs hoisted from the hips, the two strange arms anchored up perpendicularly, all four limbs pinioned strangely in mid-air by some unseen magic. There was a bag of clear potion linked to a tube that went in at his elbow through a crack in the bandages, and a zinc pipe coupled to a rubber hose coming from his groin that carried waste from his kidneys into a stoppered flask on the floor. When the flask on the floor was full, the bag at his elbow was empty, and the two were simply switched quickly so the potion could drip back into him. All they ever saw of the Hufflepuff in white was a frayed black hole over his mouth.

The Hufflepuff in white had been stationed next to the Welshman, and the Welshman sat astride his bed and talked to him until the stars shone through the mullioned windows in an incomprehensible, friendly drawl. The Welshman never minded that he got no reply.

Temperatures were taken twice a day in the hospital wing. Early each morning and late each afternoon Madam Pomfrey entered with a jar full of wands and worked her way up one side of the wing and down the other, distributing a wand to each patient. She managed the mischief of the Hufflepuff in white by inserting a wand into the hole over his mouth and leaving it balanced there on the lower rim. When she returned to the student in the first bed, she took the wand and recorded his temperature, and then moved on to the next bed and continued around the ward again. One afternoon when she had finished her first circuit of the hospital wing and came again to the Hufflepuff in white, she read his temperature and discovered that he was dead.

"Murderer," Longbottom said quietly.

The Welshman looked up at him with a lopsided grin.

"Killer," Potter said.

"What are you talkin' about?" the Welshman asked nervously.

"You murdered him," said Longbottom.

"You killed him," said Potter.

The Welshman shrank back. "You fellas are crazy. I didn't even touch him."

"You murdered him," said Longbottom.

"I heard you kill him," said Potter.

"You killed him because he was a Muggle," Longbottom said.

"You fellas are crazy," the Welshman cried. "They don't allow Muggles in here. They got a special place for Muggles."

"The teacher smuggled him in," Longbottom said.

"The Death Eater teacher," said Potter.

"And you knew it."

The teacher on Potter's left was unimpressed by the entire incident of the Hufflepuff in white. The teacher was unimpressed by everything and never spoke at all unless it was to show irritation.

The day before Potter met the gamekeeper, a stove exploded beneath the Great Hall and set fire to one side of the kitchen. An intense heat like fiendfyre blazed through the area. Even in the hospital wing, almost five stories above, they could hear the roar of the blaze and the sharp cracks of flaming tinder. Smoke sped past the orange-tinted, mullioned windows. In about fifteen minutes trained Aurors arrived to fight the fire. For a frantic half hour it was touch and go. Then the Aurors began to get the upper hand. Suddenly there was the pop of wizards Apparating back from a mission, and the Aurors had to put up their wands and speed back to the grounds in case one of the wizards Splinched themselves. The wizards all Apparated back safely. As soon as the last one arrived, the Aurors got their wands back out and raced back to the kitchens to resume their fight with the fire. When they got there, the blaze had gone out. It had died of its own accord, expired completely without even an ember to be watered down, and there was nothing for the disappointed Aurors to do except drink lukewarm pumpkin juice and hang around trying to screw the teachers.

The gamekeeper arrived the day after the fire. Potter was busy blotting out all but romance words from essays when the gamekeeper sat down in a spindly chair between the beds, crushing it, and asked Potter how he was feeling. He had placed himself a bit to one side, and the huge ring of keys under his moleskin coat were all the identification Potter could see. Potter had no idea who he was and just took it for granted that he was either another faculty member or another madman.

"Oh, pretty good," he answered. "I've got a slight bone loss in my arm and I haven't been the most regular of fellows, I guess, but all in all I must admit that I feel pretty good."

"Tha's good," said the gamekeeper.

"Yes," said Potter. "Yes, that is good."

"I mean' to come aroun' sooner," the gamekeeper said, "bu' I haven' really been well."

"That's too bad," Potter said.

"Just dragon pox," the gamekeeper added quickly.

"I've got the temperature of a dragon," Potter added just as quickly.

"Tha's too bad," the gamekeeper said.

"Yes," Potter agreed. "Yes, that is too bad."

The gamekeeper fidgeted. "Is there anythin' I can do fer yer?" he asked after a while.

"No, no." Potter sighed. "Madam Pomfrey is doing all that's magically possible, I suppose."

"No, no." The gamekeeper blushed slightly under his gigantic beard. "I didn't mean anythin' like that. I meant Chocolate Frog cards ... or Exploding Snap ... or ... gobstones."

"No, no," Potter said. "Thank you. I have everything I need, I suppose -- everything but the bones in my arm."

"Tha's too bad."

"Yes," Potter said. "Yes, that is too bad."

The gamekeeper stirred again. He looked from side to side a few times, then gazed up at the ceiling, then down at the floor. He heaved a deep breath.

"Ron Weasley sends his regards," he said.

Potter was sorry to hear they had a mutual friend. It seemed there was a basis to their conversation after all. "You know Ron Weasley?" he asked regretfully.

"Yar, I know Ron Weasley quite well."

"He's a bit loony, isn't he?"

The gamekeeper's smile was embarrassed. "I'm afraid I couldn' say. I don' think I know 'im that well."

"You can take my word for it," Potter said. "He's as yampy as they come."

The gamekeeper weighed the next silence heavily and then shattered it with an abrupt question. "You are Harry Potter, aren' ya?"

"Weasley had a bad start. He came from a large family."

"Excuse me," the gamekeeper persisted. "I migh' be committin' a grave error. Are you Harry Potter?"

"Yes," Harry Potter confessed. "I am Harry Potter."

"Of Gryffindor?"

"Of the Fighting Gryffindor House," Potter replied. "I didn't know there were any other Harry Potters. As far as I know, I'm the only Harry Potter I know, but that's only as far as I know."

"I see," said the gamekeeper grumpily.

Potter straightened sharply when he spied the dormice in another inside pocket of the gamekeeper's coat. He was thoroughly astonished, for he had never really talked with a gamekeeper before.

"You're a gamekeeper!" he exclaimed. "I didn't know you were a gamekeeper!" Potter stared at him with a big, fascinated grin. "I've never really seen a gamekeeper before."

The gamekeeper flushed again and looked down at his hands. He was a giant with overgrown hair and black, twinkling eyes. A nest of a beard sat on his chin. Potter wanted to help him.

"Can I do anythin' at all to help yer?" the gamekeeper asked.

Potter shook his head, still grinning. "No, I'm sorry. I have everything I need and I'm quite comfortable. In fact, I'm not even sick."

"Tha's good." As soon as the gamekeeper said the words, he was sorry and shoved his knuckles into his mouth. Potter remained silent and disappointed him. "There are other students in the wing I hav'ta visit," he apologized finally. "I'll come ter see yer again, prob'ly tomorrow."

"Please do that," Potter said.

"I'll come on'y if yer want me to," the gamekeeper said, lowering his head shyly. "I've noticed that I make many o' the students uncomfortable."

Potter glowed with affection. "I want you to," he said. "You won't make me uncomfortable."


** Quite original, definitely capturing the Catch-22 absurdity with the bone loss thing. Nice job :)
