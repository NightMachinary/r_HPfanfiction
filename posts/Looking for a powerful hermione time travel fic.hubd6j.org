:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I'm looking for a specific fic that for some reason I cannot find at all! It's about Hermione, she's super powerful, and she travels back in time multiple times to become more powerful and train to be useful in the war. I believe it's Dumbledore who sends her on these trips. If I remember correctly it eventually develops into Snamione? Anyways it ends up where she's old enough (like 25-30 range I think) which is why it's one of the only Snamione's I can believe and actually enjoy. If anyone remembers it please lmk! It's also pretty dark and intense if I remember correctly. Thanks!


** Linkffn(sin and vice) is it! Loved this fic.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
