I'm looking for a story set after the Battle, with Harry, Ron and Hermione going back to Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, Ginny and (I think) Hermione being assigned as Aurors, with a mission involving Draco being on the bad side.

Another one I'm looking for features Amelia Bones being the replacement for Minerva as Transfiguration Professor in another After the Battle story.

The final one is set after the Battle. Harry becomes DADA teacher but is secretly an alcoholic. Part of it has the Weasley men beat seven shades out of him but I can't remember why.

Both of them feature a Harry/Ginny pairing


** I think the final one is Glimpses of Battle on ao3, but has been abandoned.

*** Thanks [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]], I have had a look and that isn't the one I remember. I believe it had the first chapter set in the RoR, with Harry and Ginny, and then the next chapter started off at the cottage in Godrics Hollow. It was the first of a series of 3 fics.
