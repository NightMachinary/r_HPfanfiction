In Cannon Book Seven, Hedwig, faithful familiar of Harry Potter died. Over her time spent with the boy, they built a 'Familiar Bond' which had uplifted her from a 'smart animal' to possessing true intelligence. Her wizard wasn't the smartest kid around, but he loved her and she loved him. (Familial love) After living with Harry for so long, she really shouldn't have been surprised when upon death, she found herself in a ghostly version of Hogwarts' Great Hall, in front of the personification of Death.

Hedwig knew her wizard, knew he had so much pressure on him, had so many sorrows. When Death told her that Harry Potter was going to reunite the Hollows and permanently lose the ability to die, thrown from one life to another whenever he took his final breath, never reuniting with his loved ones... She had screeched at Death that her wizard didn't deserve that heaped on him on top of everything else he'd been through. Death offered a way to spare him and endless trudge through existence, but at a cost. She would have to take his place. It was not a difficult decision.

As soon as the deal was struck, Hedwig found herself back at the moment of hatching from her egg again. Soon, she was resting in her mother's nest, and vowing to herself that Harry Potter would have an easier life this time around if she had to deliver packages of Fiendfyre to everyone that had made her wizard's life miserable.

That second life was something of a learning experience, Harry pulled through and won sooner, with less casualties, less friends and loved ones he'd had to bury. In her third life, she decided to pull out all the stops and use everything she'd learned to give her wizard the best life ever. Tricking a young, attractive teacher into signing a marriage contract that became active when her wizard reached maturity, ensuring he was removed from the Dursleys immediately? Done. A entire harem for him? Done. Draco Malfoy ruined? Done. Goblin steel talons imbued with basilisk venom, making her the most lethal owl in history? Done. People refusing to harm her wizard due to the fear and awe of his awesome owl? Done. Harry Potter living a long and happy life? Probably. Discovering the Elixir of Life is near instantly deadly to owls? Done.

From there, Hedwig learned subtlety, as she sat on the shoulders of every version of Harry Potter imaginable. Girl-Who-Lived, WBWL, Time Travel, Dark Lords Harry Potter, very Alternate Universes, if you can imagine it, she's seen it. Now, she's found that her wizard does best if he fights his own battles, but you can bet she's been zipping here and there, stacking the deck for him. If she does her job right, no one ever knows she's done anything at all. Thanks to a rather odd life, she eventually gained the ability to siphon minuscule amounts of magic from her wizard and anchor it, not in her flesh, but her very soul. After taking tiny amounts of magic from him for a hundred lifetimes, the owl is now as powerful a magical creature as the feared dark lord, but she really hasn't figured out what to do with it yet.

As she becomes aware in yet another new life, she spends a moment reflecting on what went wrong just before. /Should have dodged left instead of right.../ There had been a pitched battle in Harry's fifth year, Dolores Umbridge had taken things too far and tortured a witch Harry had developed feelings for. (After seeing so many variations of Harry's life, Hedwig knows which girls fit best with her different versions of her wizard, and she's long since taken to nudging them together.) The toad had died in the ensuing conflict, and Voldemort had mobilized the Ministry against Hogwarts in response. But in the week it took them to muster for a castle siege, Hedwig and the castle's elves had exploited everything she'd learned in a thousand lifetimes, and Hogwarts was now the most powerful magical fortress seen in not only this world, but a hundred others.

It was led by Harry Potter, leader of Potter's Army, and the best trained tactician the Wizarding World had ever seen. To be honest, Hedwig had gotten careless during the battle. Excitement, real excitement had become rare, and it had blossomed in her heart as she fought beside her Wizard, using her magic to lay waste to both the corrupt Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters now wearing red robes. Eh, Harry would be fine. If the battle went poorly, a Fidelius would go up and everyone outside the castle would be stunned. It was all a distraction anyway, the real objective had been seizing the printing presses long enough to print out and deliver the truth of the conflict not only to Britain, but the world.

Odd... She should be out of her egg by now, but nothing was happening. In fact, the walls around her were... fleshy? That can't be right. /This is really odd.../

Half an hour later, Hedwig had her answer. She wasn't being born an owl this lifetime, in fact as her small head tried to get a look at her mother, it took a while to realize the species. The new body threw her too. It turns out, in this life, she was in fact a Gryphon, still a snowy owl in the front, but some sort of currently white feline in the back. /Oh... This has potential... I think I'll celebrate by ruining everyone's plans right off the bat./

â€‹

This is my prompt, feel free to use as much or as little of it as you want. I had an idea that Hedwig would, as soon as she's strong enough to carry a human child under her own power, find Harry walking home from school and after making sure this wasn't a reality where the durseleys treated him well, just pick him up and fly him to a warded island she knew of from a prior life. From there, she could find some friends for him, after all she would know by now who had really crappy childhoods and would be happier on a tropical island. People go crazy trying to find Harry, Hedwig's chosen island has /really/ good wards. Maybe she tutors Harry and friends, or maybe she just lets them be kids for a while, and then flies them back to Diagon a few days after Harry should have gotten his letter.

Have fun with this if you decide to take it up!

Edit: And yes, I'm implying that the Hedwig from linkffn(12603861) is her third try at this. Btw, that's a fun short story and you should check it out.

** Love it! That sounds so fun! Hedwig got the short end of the stick anyway, so a powerful magical familiar sounds like a fantastic character to play with.

Additionally I can see it play out that she and Crookshanks team up to unmask Pettigrew and force him out of his Scabbers body in front of the entire school, leading to McGonagal screaming that he's alive.

This has potential in so many directions.

*** One of my fics had the two of them teaming up to make sure Pettigrew got captured as he tried to flee after Voldemort's final defeat: >! Hedwig followed him from the air, marking his position; she couldn't attack for fear of getting cursed, but he couldn't transform to cast at her without drawing attention and getting caught. Eventually, following Hedwig, Crookshanks managed to lead a group of pursuers right to him.!<

  "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world." Some would say that Hogwarts is the wrong place for Umino Iruka, and he's about to find out. With new students, he hopes to light the Will of Fire in this new world while new dangers lurk in the darkness. No overpowered ninjas running roughshod over the Potterverse in this fic! Mentor!Iruka, Gen fic

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

Oh god, imagine if she set up an island of the lost with every orphaned/crappy childhood protagonist in existence and their sidekicks. Then she gets manuals on every form of ability/magic from their native worlds and makes Harry, et all learn everything.
