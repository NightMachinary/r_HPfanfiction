I have read most of the stories of this pairing on AO3 that are highly bookmarked and kudos'd, but I just don't have the skill in sorting through fics on FFN like I used to. One of my all-time very best favorite of that pairing is linkffn(Chemistry & Timing), so I know there's good stuff on there! I am not saying I wouldn't want recs from AO3, but chances are I've already read it. So if you have Remus/Hermione recs from FFN, I'd be super grateful!

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

**** I seriously love it so very much, though the part that covers when she's not there drags. Except maybe part of why it drags is because the part where the two of them are together is so, so good that I miss the sparkle till they're back together.

  *2018 Marauders Medal Nominee* - After the war, Remus must learn to navigate his life without his wife by his side. Though she's always thought she knew what she wanted, Hermione struggles with the path her life has taken. A story about the aftermath of war, healing, and the long road it takes to get there. Initial Ron/Hermione. Eventual Remus/Hermione. Slow burn. EWE.
