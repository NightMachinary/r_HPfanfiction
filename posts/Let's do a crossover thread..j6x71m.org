*** And to get the obvious one out of the way:

"Madam Bones," Dumbledore said as the Director of DMLE arrived in his office, flanked by three hard-faced Aurors. "I must say, you're here sooner than expected."

"In the name of the Ministry of Magic, you are under arrest, Headmaster," Bones responded, pulling out her wand; the Aurors behind her did the same.

"Are you threatening me, Madam Bones?" the Headmaster asked her quietly, his eyes no longer twinkling as usual.

"The Wizengamot will decide your fate," was the Director's response.

"I AM the Wizengamot," the Chief Warlock declared.

"Not. Yet."

"It's treason, then..."

Dumbledore stood up as he said this, the Elder Wand slipping into his right hand.

**** “AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!” Dumbledore screamed, spinning over his desk with far more agility than expected for someone of his age. Before Madam Bones could even blink, two of her best aurors were struck down by a pair of killing curses. A rapid spell chain from the headmaster proved too much for Rufus Scrimgeour as a reductor blasted through his shield, followed soon after by a third killing curse.

With her backup depleted, Madam Bones was forced onto the defensive, retreating down the spiral staircase and into the corridors. Dumbledore was hot on her trail, sending a multitude of curses towards her. Somehow, she managed to dodge, weave, and block the headmaster's assault while maintaining as much distance between herself and Dumbledore as possible.

Madam Bones knew she couldn't keep this up forever, after all, she was duelling against one of the most powerful wizards of all time. As the battle progressed, more and more spells were slipping through her protections, while Dumbledore was completely unscathed. Aiming at the floor, Madam Bones cast a Bombarda, slipping through a set of doors during the chaos.

Madam Bones swore. She'd ran up the Astronomy Tower, there was no way out now.

The doors blasted off their hinges as Dumbledore strode towards her, the Elder Wand thrumming in his hand, casting a flurry of spells towards her. Despite still being in the fight, Madam Bones felt completely outclassed. She'd tried every trick in the book, yet nothing was even getting through.

Until suddenly, Dumbledore's casting started to slow down ever so slightly. The headmaster conjured a barrage of arrows, blasting them towards her. However, his aim was slightly off and Madam Bones merely had to sidestep to avoid them. But this was her chance. Dumbledore had overextended and she now had an opening.

If one had looked more closely at the headmaster, they might have noticed the grin appearing on his face as the Elder Wand twirled out his hand and onto the floor.

Madam Bones pointed her wand at Dumbleore, who scurried towards the balcony. “You are under arrest, my lord.” She said, pacing towards him. Dumbledore however, seemed more interested in something to his left. Sparing a glance, she saw the target of his fixation: Harry Potter.

“Harry. I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Ministry are taking over!” He accused, gesturing towards Madam Bones.

Madam Bones scoffed. “The oppression of the greater good shall never return. You have lost.”

“No, no, no, you will die!” Dumbledore lifted his hands, shooting lighting towards Madam Bones, who managed to get a shield up just in time. “She is a traitor!”

“He is the traitor!” She screamed, struggling to repel Dumbledore's lightning.

Dumbledore looked at Harry. “I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose!”

“Don't listen to him, Harry!”

The headmaster's torrent of lightning was slowly decreasing, with the wandless magic taking a lot out of him. “Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . “ He gasped, struggling for breath. Soon after, the lighting stopped completely, as Dumbledore dropped his arms. “I can't ... I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I can't hold on any longer.”

Madam Bones glared at the headmaster. “I am going to end this once and for all!”

Coming closer, Harry pleaded at the Head of the DMLE. “You can't kill him, Madam. He must stand trial.“

“He has control of Hogwarts and the Wizengamot. He is too dangerous to be kept alive!” She countered.

“I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.”

“It is not the Ministry way. He must live. I need him!” He asserted, as Madam Bones raised her wand. The tip glowed green, killing curse on the tip of her tongue. “No!” Harry yelled, drawing his own wand and casting a cutting curse at Madam Bones.

The spell cut cleanly through her elbow, dropping her wand arm onto the floor before Dumbledore followed up with a blast of lightning. Madam Bones screamed. “Power! Unlimited power!” Dumbledore yelled, blasting her off the Astronomy Tower balcony.

Harry sank down to his knees, looking on in horror. “What have I done?”

The headmaster summoned the Elder Wand and stood up. “You are fulfilling your destiny, Harry. Become my apprentice. Learn to use dark magic.”

“I will do whatever you ask.” Harry replied.

“Good.”

“Just help me save Ginny's life. I can't live without her. He pleaded.

“To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.” The headmaster said.

“I pledge myself to your teachings”

Dumbledore cackled. “Magic is strong with you. A powerful dark lord you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Lord . . . Vader.

“Thank you. my Master.”

“Rise, Lord Vader.” Dumbledore commanded.

*** Voldemort: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Herpo the Foul?

Harry: No?

Voldemort: I thought not. It's not a story Dumbledore would tell you. It's a wizard legend. Herpo the Foul was a Dark Wizard, so powerful and so wise he could use Magic to influence Magic itself to create life... He had such a knowledge of dark magic, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

Harry: He could actually save people from death?

Voldemort: The dark arts of Magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

Harry: What happened to him?

Voldemort: He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he believed so much in prophecy, he took a path that would lead to his own death. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

Harry: Is it possible to learn this power?

Voldemort: Not from a Dumbledore.

***** Lord Voldemort sensed something approaching. A moment later, the two Death Eaters guarding his office were blasted into the walls by telekinetic force, as a tiny, hunched figure in a dirty tea towel and socks stepped through the door.

"I hear Master Riddle is having a new apprentice", the house elf squeaked.

"Master Dobby", Voldemort growled, his displeasure evident in his voice. "You survived."

"Surprised?"

Voldemort rose, his wand sliding into his hand.

"Your arrogance blinds you, Master Dobby. Now you will experience the full power of Dark Magic." He swung his wand, and bolts of lighting flashed across the room and slammed Dobby to the floor.

Voldemort approached Yoda's body, chuckling malevolently.

"I have waited a long time for this moment, my little bat-eared friend."

Dobby pushed himself to his feet and faced the cackling Dark Lord.

"At last the Order is no more", Voldemort gloated.

"Not if anything to say about it has Dobby!" He raised his hand, tossing Voldemort backward and over his desk with another blast of telekinesis.

"At an end your rule is. And not short enough it was."

Voldemort tried to flee, but Dobby apparated with a pop, appearing in front of him, blocking the door.

"If you is being so powerful, why flee?"

"You will not stop me", Voldemort hissed. "Lord Severus will become more powerful than either of us."

"Faith in your new apprentice is being misplaced. As is your faith in Dark Magic."

Dobby sent a blast of magic at Voldemort, dodging the green bolt Voldemort flung at him, and the battle began...

*** “No, my father didn't fight in a war. He died in a car crash.”

“That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt that magic was unnatural.” Remus said to Harry.

“You fought in the Wizarding War?”

“Yes. I was once a member of the Order of the Phoenix, the same as your father.”

“I wish I'd known him.”

“He was the best broomstick rider in Britain, and a cunning duelist. I understand you're quite a good flyer yourself. And he was a good friend.”

“I have something here for you.” Remus stood up and went over to a shelf, taking down a long, narrow box. “Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Remus on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.”

“What is it?”

“Your father's wand. This is the weapon of a wizard. Not as simple as a Muggle gun; an elegant tool for more magical purposes. For over a thousand generations, the wizards used magic to live in harmony. Before the civil war... before Voldemort.”

“How did my father die?”

“A young Order member named Sirius Black, who was a friend of ours until he turned to evil, helped the Death Eaters hunt down and destroy the Order of the Phoenix. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Order is all but extinct. Black was seduced by the Dark Arts.”

*** Star Wars is a tricky one. I feel like thematically the stories fit well together, but tonally the carefree whimsy of the HP magic system clashes terribly with the spiritual seriousness of the Force.

So in general any HP/SW crossover I think works better as a fusion fic (i.e. combining the worlds into a single coherent system) rather than a straight crossover (i.e. HP magic and the Force existing in parallel).

He asked Voldemort "My Lord, I think I saw someone in the shadows. I'd like to check it out, make sure there's no muggles seeing us."

Then he quickly left the forest clearing and apparated away, to the nearby hill where Dorothy and Dumbledore were observing the Death Eater meeting.

Just seconds later, the three-story townhouse they'd portkeyed into the sky hit the ground.

Caught completely by surprise, Voldemort and his followers couldn't possibly get away before the massive pile of bricks, wood and concrete turned the entire clearing into a crater.

*** After somehow escaping Gold Experience Requiem's death loop, Diavolo suddenly finds himself in a different reality, where the Arrows nor Stands are non-existent, and within the mind of Harry Potter before he discovers he's a wizard. Harry soon learns about Diavolo's existence and now has to live with a paranoid mafia boss in his head and learn how to use King Crimson and Epitaph.

Diavolo occasionally takes control of Harry during life-threatening situations and to express dominance and strike fear into those he sees who are inferior (especially the Dursleys, Malfoy, etc)

Harry and Diavolo's relationship is complicated to say the least.  Harry being uncomfortable with a mysterios man inside his head while seemingly being cared for from him. Diavolo acts as some sort of guardian who wants Harry and to another extension, himself, to rise to the top above everyone just like how he had done as the boss of Passione

Unlike Doppio, who was completely oblivious to the fact Diavolo was possessing him, Harry is fully aware and mentally talks with the mafia boss instead of through a random object as if it were a phone. Harry is also capable of using King Crimson and Epitaph at its fullest instead of only its arms and Epitaph

It also turns out Harry was born as a Metamorphmagus, allowing Diavolo to don his signature appearance (Pink hair with spots, fragmented green eyes) whenever he is in control.

Initially Dumbledore is unaware, but as time passes on, he notices Harry's unusual behavior at certain times and theorizes that there's something or someone sinister hiding within the Boy-Who-Lived

Voldemort encounters Diavolo/Harry for the first time during his attempt to gain the Philosopher's Stone. When Quirell tries to kill Harry, he suddenly finds himself in a different position in the room, having no memory of how it happened. He hears a noise behind him, biut before he can turn around, a white fist connected to a red arm bursts through his  chest. Voldemort's spectre form escapes, not before going through a brutal beatdown from the Crimson figure. And he couldn't forget those eyes. It didnt belong to Potter. No, it belonged to a monster just like him, a demon.

Department of Mysteries, 1996

This wasnt how it was supposed to go. Acquire to Prophecy for the Dark Lord, and if possible capture the Potter boy. Plain and simple The boy disappered after they had cornered him. They scrambled around the Hall of Prophesies.

Soon, Lucius heard a scream, no doubt belonging to Bellatrix. He carefully navigated towards the source, and to his horror, the dark witch was on the ground, lifeless. She was surrounded by a puddle of blood with a large hole in her stomach. Lucius then saw something in the corner of his eye. On instinct, he sent a curse at a shadowy figure only realize the person was himself. He suddenly finds himself in the position of that figure.

Struck with absolute shock, Lucius could only freeze as he heard a voice behind him, with a tone as deep and cold as the Dark Lord

"Think of this as a gift, a farewell gift from the heart. In a moment you will cease to exist, so I will allow you to know now. What you witnessed and just felt, was your future self laid bare. Simply put your past self saw a future version. Now behold, know the almighty power of King Crimson. I obliterated time and leapt beyond it!"

Lucius suddenly felt unimaginable pain coursing through his back. He felt blood building up in his throat, and he couldnt help but puke

"It doesn't matter who it is, I shall never allow any cretin to threaten my eternal transcendence, not ever! The time has come for you to fade away!"

Lucius' stomach bulged before a fist came bursting out

*** Harry woke up next to a campfire. He didn't recognize the area at all. All he could say for certain is that he wasn't in the United Kingdom any more. It certainly didn't look like any part of England he had been to before. He couldn't see very much beyond the campfire.

As he scanned the horizon, looking one way, then the next, a strange man appeared across the campfire from him sitting on the log, without even the telltale snap of apparition. The stranger was dressed in a black three-piece suit with a black tie and top hat. He had a well-maintained handlebar mustache and pale skin with dreamy, pensive eyes.

Harry scrambled for his wand, but froze as the stranger spoke.

"I know who you are, Potter." The strange man tilted his head. "You don't belong here." The man's voice alone was intimidating.

"Sorry?"

"You don't belong here," The man repeated.

"Who are you? Where am I?"

"Harry. Harry Potter. I'm just a man who wishes he had known life a little better. Gotten better advice. Made different choices," said the man, his tone a strange mix of ice and brimstone. "But you... You're interesting. A man touched by destiny. A man out of time."

Harry completely lost. "What do you want?"

"It's not about what I want.. Or maybe it is. I can't really remember. I have a friend getting drunk... Or should I say, 'pissed', as your countrymen do? Ah well, he's at Thieves' Landing. I think he might be about to be unfaithful to his wife. Why don't you head over there and advise him how best to proceed?"

"Thieves' Landing, where is that? How am I supposed to get there?" Harry asked when he was suddenly nudged by a horse's nose. It had full tack, and when he turned back to the stranger, he was gone, as silently as he came.

Harry scanned the horizon again, "Wanker," he muttered. He spotted a plume of smoke in the distance, and if he squinted, he thought he could make out a few buildings. He gingerly mounted the horse, which stayed still as he clambered on. "Well that seems as good a direction as any..."

He urged the horse forward towards signs of life, hopefully he'd be able to find some directions, and maybe a way home.

Draco: Those Death Eaters want you dead so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth: there's no going back. You've changed things. Forever.

Boy Who Lived: Then why do you want to kill me?

Draco: Kill you? I don't wanna kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off firsties? No. No. No! No you- you complete me.

Boy Who Lived: You're garbage who curses people for galleons.

Draco: Don't talk like one of them, you're not. Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're a freak. Like me. They just need you right now. But as soon as they don't they'll cast you out. Like a squib.

Draco: You have these rules, and you think they'll save you.

Boy Who Lived: I have one rule.

Draco: Then that's the one rule you'll have to break to know the truth.

Boy Who Lived: Which is?

Draco: The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. And tonight you're gonna break your one rule. There are just minutes left so you're gonna have to play my little game if you want to save... one of them.

Boy Who Lived: Them?

Draco: For a while I thought you really were Ron... The way you threw yourself after her... (Harry blocks the door) Look at you go! Does Ron know about you and his little bookworm?

Boy Who Lived: WHERE ARE THEY?

Draco: Killing is making a choice. (Harry punches Draco)

Boy Who Lived: WHERE ARE THEY?

Draco: You choose one life over the other. Your friend, the would be quidditch star, or his blushing bookworm bride-to-be. (Harry punches Draco again) You have nothing! Nothing to threaten me with! Nothing to do with all your magic. But don't worry. I'm going to tell you where they are. Both of them. And that's the point. You'll have to choose.

*** Hermione jerked awake to the sound of crackling wood. She felt nauseated and like she'd forgotten something... Something important. But what?

"Ah right, you haven't died before." A voice sighed next to her. "Breathe Hermione, we're back in the common room."

"Fucking hell my head." Another voice distorted by phlegm slurred from her side, impossible to identify thanks to its distortion.

Hermione finally forced herself awake. "What-?"

"Dolohov." Harry said bluntly and Hermione's world spun. That cutting curse had hit her on the neck. She'd gone tumbling and seen her body slump to the ground. Then the darkness came, an infinite abyss engulfing all she was and she'd-she'd...

"I died." She announced quietly, a sort of revelation falling upon her. "How am I alive? I remember dying."

"Well." Harry said, licking his lips. "I made some modifications of my own to the DA contract. Basically, once you've signed it, you're bound to defeat Voldemort and his death eaters, to the point where if you fail, you get another try. And another. And another. And so on and so forth."

"Wait, you gave us immortality?" Ron exclaimed from his corner. "That's wicked."

"It isn't. It's conditional and ends when the Dark Lord dies. Look, don't mess around with it Ron. It could seriously mess with your soul."

Hermione looked at Harry, then looked at the window outside. Sunset. "Harry, how are we getting back to the Min-"

Neville barged into the common room. "Great, you're awake! Luna explained it all Harry, but we've got to go now. The thestral herd's going to move soon!"

And so everyone embarked on a remarkably unpleasant journey to getting good.

*** “Voldemort, I've come to bargain.” Harry stepped out from behind the tree to face Voldemort.

“What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say, Merlin?” Ron snapped.

“If we can't protect Hogwarts, you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it!” Neville roared at the crowd of Death Eaters.

“This is so unlike you, Weasley. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just blast your way out like Finnegan?” Malfoy sneered.

“Harry, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my entire life.” Hermione rolled her eyes.

“I understand that the Ministry has made a decision. But given that it is a foolish decision, I have elected to ignore it.” Dumbledore said calmly to the Aurors sent to arrest him.

“No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Horcruxes. All of Wizarding Britain lies within your grasp.” Barry Crouch Jr. knelt before the Dark Lord.

“I think you look great, Harry. As far as I'm concerned, that's Wizarding Britain's ass.” Colin winked at Harry from behind his camera.

“There was an idea.” Mad-Eye Moody said to Kingsley. “Black knows this, called the Order of the Phoenix. To bring together a group of remarkable people, to see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to fight the battles the Aurors never could.”

“I'm with you until the very end.” James Potter said to his friends. “Mischief managed.”

“I shouldn't be alive unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Remus. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know he's out there, alive.” Sirius waved a newspaper picture of the Weasley family, and their pet rat that was missing a toe.

“In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! I didn't see an end, so I put my wand to my head and the wolf chewed on it. So I moved on, I focused on teaching. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show.” Remus yelled at Dumbledore.

“A lifetime ago, I too sought the Hallows. I even wielded one in my hand. But it betrayed me, abandoned me here for another, guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.” Grindelwald spoke from behind the cell bars.

“Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say, I am.” Voldemort drew the Elder Wand from his sleeve.

“You... will never be... immortal...” Severus Snape gasped as Nagini's venom began to burn through him.

“This was a gift. Now you go and be the wizard you're meant to be.” Lily brushed Harry's hair back to reveal the lightning-bolt scar.

** Repairman Jack.

It's a Lovecraftian world where the inimical forces are trying to open up the doorway for their gods to come and do their thing.

The forces on our side don't really care about humans, about whether they are happy, sad, suicidal, or murdered. But they don't want the little marble that is earth to be stolen from their side.

In one of the books there was a Sahuagin type humanoid fish creature. So when Harry goes down to save his hostage, he finds a war going on between the Sahuagin and the Mermen. As a result he actually has to fight to protect and save the hostages, who are about to be carried off for food, all gift wrapped.

Krum soon discovers that his idea to do a partial transfiguration wasn't smart, since he can't cast spells, and he's hurt bad. Harry desperately wants to save him, but he's too far away, and he can't leave his two best friends, Cho, and Gabrielle helpless and alone.

Fleur doesn't get ambushed by the grindylows because they were hanging low because they didn't want to gain the attention of the Sahuagin. So Harry arrives first and is desperately trying to protect all four hostages. Then Cedric and Fleur show up and the three put up a united front.

They cast the bubble head charms on the hostages, waking them up. Cho shows her vicious side once she figures out what's going on with the Sahuagin trying to eat them.

Ron immediately tries to start using spells to help in the defense, but since he's not studious he's limited in his repretoire. He comes to the realization then that he can't sit back and let Harry do all the adventuring, especially if he's a friend he'll get dumped in the deep end. He swears he's going to practice more seriously.

Hermione freezes in place for a while in fear and confusion, before she jumps into action. Her spells aren't nearly as powerful as Harry's or the other champions, but she's got some nice assist spells that confuse and interupt the Sahuagin's joint attacks, breaking up their formations.

Gabby shows that she's a little spitfire as she clings to Fleur's back, using what control she has over her flames to warm her sister so she's not so handicapped by the cold, watery environment that saps a Veela's strength.

They manage to get to the shore, bruised, batttered, and exhausted.

And that's when the reality of the dangers of the Tri-Wizard tournament finally dawn on all the students, because the celebrated Quidditch Seeker and star dueler Victor Krum is dead.

Mostly it was aimed at other countries, until Voldemort rose to power in the 70s. Now in the aftermath of the Boy-Who-Lived, the remnants of the Death Eaters who got off with a bribe are hunting down anyone who they suspect of having links to the muggle government.

In an impossibly hidden enclave, students of an ability known as "magic" are preparing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of peace in their world, still ignorant of the greater conflict yet to come. Hermione Granger, daughter of a spy for the Principality of Zeon, is the only one aware of the true dangers that are yet to befall humanity, which has led her to engineer a bold gambit to help rid her friends of the Dark Lord known as Lord Voldemort. As the pieces fall into place and the future draws ever nearer, our heroes are set to rise in Mobile Suit Gundam: Granger's Folly./

*** Suddenly, Harry was angry. It was the first time Lord Frieza had done it since he came to this godforsaken planet, but with that many requests, the ship would be flooded.

With a sigh, Harry pulled out his wand and summoned the muffins.

"This bloody lizard better not expect me to do this again."

But the requests continued. There could be only one solution. With a shout and a swish and a flick of his wand, the whole planet was transfigured into a giant muffin.

"I quit," yelled Harry, as he turned on his heel and with a pop, returned to London.

With a muffled giggle in the background, the giant muffin exploded into millions of mini-muffins.

​

​

"Harry, you're finally back!" yelled Ron excitedly. " I thought you went on an exploration trip and wouldn't be back for months." He said.

"Yeah, mate, but I didn't think the muggle would actually have me conjure muffins! I was so excited to explore space, and the wanker had me conjure muffins," Harry explained exasperatedly.

"Sound like too much work to be worth it. Why weren't you back earlier?" Ron asked.

"Well we landed pretty soon. So I found another bunch of aliens with a ship and they offered me a job in the kitchens. I figured it'd be fine. Anything I don't know how to do, I can just conjure or transfigure until the next planet. The ground was rumbling, so I figure it was about time to leave and my bloody boss starts requesting me for millions of muffins!" Harry recalled,frustrated.

"So I transfigured the whole area into a muffin and came back. That'll show that bugger. He'll be trapped there." He mumbled darkly.

** The car Harry Potter found himself sat bolt upright in was a 1954 Bentley R-Type Continental. Apparently it was one of only 208 ever made, housing a six-cylinder, 4.5-litre engine, and was retro-fitted with central locking, climate control, satellite navigation and a host of other modern conveniences.

He had to admit it was monumentally nicer than bumbling across the country in Mr Weasley's flying Ford Anglia, the seats were leather and plush, the ride smooth and the engine quiet and understated. Even if it wasn't a flying car capable of turning invisible (and even if Harry would still forever prefer flying on a broomstick than any other manmade form of transportation) it was undoubtedly the coolest, nicest ride he'd ever been in.

This, in no small part, by his company. His name was weird, his drawl on that cheerful boundary between endearingly sarcastic and infuriatingly condescending. Dancing back and forth in a way that didn't let Harry know exactly where he stood (or sat) with the Skeleton Detective: Skulduggery Pleasant.
