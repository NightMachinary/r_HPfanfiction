Hey, I'm very new to the fan fiction community and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on some light read fan fictions to start on before working my way up to big ones.

I believe I have a good grasp on the lore of Harry Potter and particularly the characters but it would nice to be start off with something a little less demanding at first if that makes any sense.

Thank you very much!


** You're probably not aware of the tropes or ships yet, but what part of the world interests you the most? Do you want it centered around Harry Potter and his buddies, and if so, at what age? Do you want to explore a different era like Marauders or Grindelwald or second generation? What genres do you like?

Something to keep in mind is that "AU" is alternate universe so, for example, a fic where Harry gets sorted into a different house in his first year would be an AU. "Canon divergent" is where the fic follows the books then veers off the path; for example, if Sirius survives in the Department of Mysteries, it would be considered canon divergent. Canon is strict adherence to the books. Do you have a hard preference for canon?

This will help people tailor their suggestions to what interests you specifically.

** Unless you hate canon pairings, I always strongly recommend reading canon compliant fics first, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] depicts Year 6 from Ginny's POV. It's very well written and also my entry fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] is an excellent Year 7 fic from Ginny's POV and shows the horror at Hogwarts during that year. Its author [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] is active here and has written [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum/works?fandom_id=136512][many great canon compliant fics]].

Already mentioned, author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has written a massive postwar series of 85+ fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], set in 2009 and depicting Harry and Ginny's work/life, is likely his best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]] is a little self promotion. I wrote this one shot for the occasion of Battle of Hogwarts' 20th anniversary.

** what are you looking for? there is everything from cute fluffy one shots (standalone stories) of a perfect Christmas with the weasleys, to entire series rewrites millions of words long.

there are romances, action adventures, horrors, lighthearted stories, extremely dark ones.

there are tons of tropes that have developed (time travel, marriage law, overpowered harry, manipulative horrible dumbledore, etc).

i would maybe start with some shorter ones and see if anything catches your interest. i really prefer ao3 (archive of our own) because of the great tag and filter system.

** I always suggest series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with linkao3(1615616) and go on), and stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter). My own first large HP story was linkao3(601124) and that's pretty good start as well.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** If you're looking for light reads, check out Clell. Hiding in Plain Sight is a great place to start, imo, just be aware that a) it's a comedy and b) it's not canon compliant. At all.

For something more canon compliant, try Just A Random Tuesday. For a what-if scenario (canon divergent), you can't go wrong with For Lack of a Bezoar. Just be aware that it's... not all that light, honestly.

** I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6872861/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady's]] series. She has one on now that updates every Tuesday and Friday, so you'll get steady updates (the fic's finished by the way).

She also has several other stories, some of which are crossovers, of various natures. So you'll have something to read. Nothing overwhelming in her writing, so it should be smooth sailing.

I also second Northumbrian's fics, as you'll find plenty to read there.

** I would suggest you start with linkao3(Sing a requiem) because you're entering a fandom where a lot of people (readers and authors alike) are blasÃ© about an orphaned teenager being manipulated into committing suicide. This story offers a different and far more healthy perspective.

The second story I would suggest is Linkffn(Stages of Hope) because it gives you a look into what will happen when adults sit back and teenagers are forced into fighting a war against actually competent villains. It's basically a realistic look into the horror of child soldiers in a way.

I know that these aren't exactly /light/ reading, but they're good stories.

She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

** They are kind of long, but they are lighter in tone and not too out there concept wise, so I'd recommend either of White Squirrels long fics. One is called The Accidental Animagus the other The Arithmancer. Or maybe the Innocent series by MauraderLover7. I also really like Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting by TendraelUmbra, but it's only just gotten to the end of year one and doesn't update super often. Really like the portrayal of Dumbledore though.
