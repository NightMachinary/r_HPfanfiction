Wondering if there's any new stories out in the last year of these pairings! Hopefully updated regularly or already finished, or even just your favorite story with either of these pairings! Thanks!

**** yeah it's definitely a shame it slowed down

and although these HP/NT arent new, they're no longer on ffn so I thought I'd give em a mention: Chelseyb's /The Rebel and the Chosen/ and /Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror/. the second is unfortunently abandoned, but they're both good reads. you should be able to find em both with a Google search

**** I've been following its progress on dlp, where it's reviewed before its posted on ffn. The author seems to be currently rewriting the most recent chapter in order to not rush the pacing and develop a superior story, so I say hats off to him.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  Agent Fleur Delacour preferred to hunt alone. Auror Harry Potter preferred to have a partner that didn't make him so frustrated, and in so many ways. But the madman on the loose didn't consult them before he started killing, so they'll just have to make due. An AU where the Triwizard Tournament was never brought back, but fate can't keep our dynamic duo apart forever.

** The Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthrones is pretty good. Kinda dark, and AU Harry, but I enjoyed the read.

Heart and Soul by Sillimaure.

Both Harry/Fleur, both you'll know if it's for you or not pretty quickly, so you won't waste your time.

** I'm currently writing "Dawn of Darkness" which is a sixth year Harry/Tonks story. Starts at Slughorn's party and then totally diverges from the HBP plot. No training montages, Lordships or helpful Goblins.

  When Harry invited Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas Party he never expected to stumble into a web of deceit and intrigues woven across Europe.

** My darkness ascendant is hinting at harry/tonks potential. Harry/fleur will be some serious hate fucking but it's only first year and that happens during the triwizard tournament. harry and tonks are just friends for now with harry accidentally seeing her nude or touchig her innapropriately by accident. It's on semi-hiatus atm though i hope i begin again by march at latest.
