The there is How Could One Will Cause So Much Chaos by darkoraclegirl which is a modified response to Bloody Brandy's Vegas Challenge (Marvel characters versus DC verse) where Harry goes to vegas, gets smashed and wakes up married to a couple girls.

linkao3(11244792)

Then you have the story Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death by JacobApples where when Natasha Dies and Death sends her to the HP Universe to "save Harry" after Voldemort attacks him in Godrics Hallow.

linkffn(13299423)

And then there's another response to the Bloody Brandy's Vegas Challenge called Harry Potter and the Golden Ring II by chadmaako. But this time Harry ends up married to Spiral.

  Newly emancipated 15 year old Harry Potter decides to get out of Britain for the summer and head to Vegas for his vacation, bringing along Tonks and Remus to keep him out of trouble and things he shouldn't be doing. Two days later Harry wakes up in a hotel room in bed with Tonks and a mystery woman, another mystery woman in the bathroom, Remus is missing, and next to no memory about what happened during the last two days. Want to know the whole story? Join Harry on this crazy ride to learn just what happened to Harry during those two days and what happens as a result of it all.

  Harry is fed up. Left alone with the Dursleys year after year. Being the boy who lived means nothing when no one seems to care HOW you have to live. No one listens to him. No one believes him. No one cares about him. So Harry Potter is taking his destiny into his own hands. With his vault key, the clothes on his back and his trusty wand, Harry departs, leaving the wizarding world behind...or so he thinks.But eyes are on him always. His journey isn't as unknown as he would like to believe. Plans are set in motion to claim the boy who lived and change the lofty title to something a little less...lively.Will a master assassin's blade turn the boy who lived into the boy who died?A story that has been requested by many. Another take on Storylover213's Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation Challenge (from Fanfiction.net) but this time with someone from Marvel's lineup. The character of choice is one of my personal favorites. I hope you enjoy.

  This story looks at how the events of the Avengers movie would change if a powerful and skilled Harry Potter arrived from another universe around the beginning of the movie. Harry/Natasha pairing. Extremely powerful Harry.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating. Update whenever her movie comes out :D

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13335283/1/]] )

It's fairly new and starts out very decently and uniquely. Sadly, last chapter suffers heavily from Harry playing "hold the idiot ball" and seems to me, it will happen again as needed. Which honestly killed the story for me but if you can ignore that, you might enjoy it.

​

Apart from the recommendation, In general, when it comes to HP/Marvel crossovers, lately every other story I open turns out to be poorly planned and even more poorly executed, old as hell MoD!Harry trope.

Which is very sad especially due to the fact that, most of those stories are clearly written by people who, could not write a mature 35 year old Harry believably to save their lives, trying for some unknown reason to write, hundreds or sometimes thousands of years old main character.

  Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a foolish Dark Wizard attempted to summon the power of an extradimensional entity without understanding the consequences, and the entire world paid the price. Desperate to save himself and his godson, Harry makes a bargain with a being of incredible power and escapes to another Earth, one with a fighting chance. Will he save it, or doom it?
