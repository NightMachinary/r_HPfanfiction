So we all know that Tom Riddle was the most powerful dark lord in mordern history(I think).He killed loads of people,created so many hocruxes and wanted to rid the world of muggleborns and muggles.However, he did all of this to create change and to fight for his beliefs.How is fighting for beliefs wrong?Without doing the evil acts of splitting his soul,would he have been considered right?(Well ,maybe not right but...)


** Short answer: he was a literal psychopath, incapable of loving nor caring about others.

But this here is a stupid question:

Because some beliefs are evil and are not good by default. Supremacy based on immutable factors like race, "blood" or what have you are inherently stupid and, well, evil. It gets even worse when you literally kill for these.

*** I'm always a bit surprised when questions like these pop up. I get that each culture has their own morals, but there's really no way you can spin Voldemort's actions to make him appear even decent. The dude considered killing a kid just for the hell of it.

**** I dunno, sometimes people abstract away from it too much. Like, Voldemort wasn't just "fighting for his beliefs". To the extent that he even cared about blood supremacy (which Dumbledore hints was a facade of a sort; he was even willing to "ask" Lily to become a Death Eater), he was still willing to kill whatever pureblood annoyed him.

Dude was just a murderer for fun, it's beyond any semblance of defensibility.

***** i've always been of the mind that voldemort made due with what he had available. blood supremacy existed before voldemort and he used it as a tool to gain power. if he had discovered different hidden magics in his time at hogwarts, something that offered him an easier way to power, he would have done that instead.

ultimately voldemort wants the freedom to do as he pleases without anyone else, not even a government, being able to tell him no.

**** Part of it is that people have a fascination with the evil and weird. You need only look at the spectacle serial killers and mass shooters turn into (read: the manson family)

Another part is that, no offense to some here, many of the people on here are about 18-24. Its at this point that a lot of people begin questioning "the ideas of good and evil." Armchair psychologists realizing "good and evil are just labels, they don't really exist," and think thats clever. News flash, everyone does that at one point.

Yeesh.

***** Sure, we all might have done that to a degree, but how many of us have really considered taking away the "evil" title from someone who wants to kill kids not even for just his inane cause, but also just because he /can/? I certainly haven't.

JK Rowling made him a textbook evil villain. It's literally like looking at nazis and wondering if Hitler really /needs/ to be classified as evil, because hey, he was only wanting change and fighting for his beliefs, beliefs of which he thought were right, which is more than we can say about Voldemort.

I think, at a certain point, you surpass a phase of wannabe intellectual thinking and delve right into nonsense. And making an argument for Voldemort not being evil is a bit beyond that point. I also don't think we should excuse it simply because many might go through that phase. It deserves to be called out as unreasonable, and I didn't even do it harshly, so not sure what the "yeesh" is there for.

**** I think you are missing the point. He didn't try and kill a kid for the hell of it, he did so because that kid was a direct threat to his power. Harry Potter was only killed by Voldemort because of the prophecy. Voldemort is not evil for the sake of being evil, but rather he seeks power. Anything that inhibits his gain of power or threatens his grasp on power is dealt with immediately. Harry was merely a victim of this.

TLDR: Voldemort had a very good reason for killing Harry. That reason being the prophecy; a direct threat to his power.

***** Not the kid I'm talking about. On his walk to the Potter's home, he briefly thought about killing some kid running about. He deemed it "quite unnecessary," but the fact that he even fingered his wand for a second, even thought about how the kid wouldn't make it back to his mother, shows what kind of monster he is.

#+begin_quote
  Then the child turned and ran away. . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand. . . . One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .

** One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.

I think you might want to reassess your opinion here. The most defining characteristic of Voldemort, what shapes his very existence, is an utter narcissism. He refers to himself him in the 3rd person. He exhibits traits of someone with a god-complex. The only living thing he actually cares for is also partly himself. He sees Slytherin as awesome because he's related to him Voldemort, the most awesome.

The problem, really, with this personality is, when combine with the possibilities magic and a classical sociopathic mentality, means Voldemort /would willingly kill anyone or anything in the entire world to save himself/. He would destroy the world in a heartbeat if it meant he would survive. THAT is evil.

And that, my friend, is the story of Grindelwald. /Grindelwald/ is the chap you're looking for for a Dark Wizard and would-be evil overlord who fought for a cause he actually believed in, and can thus be considered redeemable, no matter how terrible the actions he took to further this goal, or the fact that said goal/beliefs was/were entirely misguided.

But Lord Voldemort is quite another beast. Lord Voldemort was a bitter psychopath who just flat-out despises everything but himself. He despised Muggles moreso than wizards, because he had respect for power, and for that only, but generally he wished good upon no one but himself. He didn't really have a coherent purpose of "wiping out Muggles and Muggle-Born mages", though he may have said such things to the Death Eaters; he mostly just wanted to take over the world and revel in being an immortal god-dictator.

And no, (this is important), he /didn't/ believe in blood purity (how could he, when he who thought himself the greatest wizard ever was a half-blood?), he was just parroting the beliefs of pure-blood bigots like the Malfoys or the Crabbes so that they'd become his henchpeople.

** Considering that his Death Eaters are a carbon copy of the Sturmabteilung (Nazi Brownshirts), the Muggleborn "laws" the Ministry passed once he took over are very similar to the laws about "racial hygiene" the Third Reich passed and the Ministry under him turned Azkaban into a concentration camp...

Definitely NO.

Genocide, countless war crimes, racial discrimination, lethal force against political opponents, restrictions of free speech and freedom of the press with severe penalties... Does any of that sound like something good or righteous?

*** If you are poor, and someone comes along, telling you that the Negros, the Jews or the Muggleborn are getting more, or are being treated better, or receive the money you should get, over time your inhibitions to act out in a group will cease to exist.

Not all people are susceptible like that.

But, as groups band together, a single person standing out, telling the rest "NO!", will become more rare as time goes on, out of fear for repercussions. Standing up for ones believes is a luxus, when human rights have become expendable.

***** Yes, that is quite true. However perceived aggrievance and reality often differ. It is one of the reasons why arguing against Propagandism is a mammoth task.

Misinformation, lack of common education and deliberate propaganda are a combination that will make people believe near anything.

Also, since we are talking about Magical Britain and not actual British history, it is not wrong to assume that Magicals on British Isles, did not have any equivalency to the Age of Enlightenment.\\
I strongly believe that if they had anything of similar purview, the influence of Blood Purism would not have spread as far as it had.

Anyway, its all just wishful thinking as we never are going to find out what was and could have been.

** In my humble opinion, Tom Riddle is not ideologically driven. Here's my Cliffs Notes about how Tom became Voldemort (literally writing this on the spot, hopefully won't miss anything).

1.  Tom Riddle is a psychopath. He has difficulty empathizing with others. He harms animals. He harms other humans and revels in the mysterious power he has. He knows he is /different/, that he is /better/.

2.  He finds out he is a wizard. That there is a society of mages. That there is a school to learn magic. He's told by Dumbledore that his stealing is wrong, Tom isn't forgiving about this. Tom also lets on that he is a parselmouth, therefore a descendant of Slytherin. Dumbledore doesn't tell him about his ancestry. Tom is given money to buy his things, I imagine it was disgusting for him to be the recipient of charity.

3.  Tom goes to Hogwarts. To anyone else he is a Mudblood, they look down upon him. He doesn't /yet/ know whether he is better than others. After all, they are as magic as he is, maybe some are even better. He is very ignorant.

4.  Tom is Sorted into Slytherin. His peers are exceptionally discriminatory and bullying towards him. Maybe he bullies them back, I think not -- not yet. He works hard. He studies. He wants to learn how he came to be magical himself. But more importantly he needs to get better than his peers, /and/ better than the older kids who look down on him.

5.  A few years pass. He becomes an exceptional wizard. His genius is recognized by his peers and tutors, but it's not enough. He must become something more, and the Slytherin ancestry he recently uncovered helps him towards that. He cannot claim the Slytherin name, but he'll create a name all will fear to utter, these basic wizards who shunned him earlier in his life. They would learn to fear him.

6.  He shared his ancestry with a few peers. They recognize his superiority due to his skill and the threat he posed. He was the "top dog" in Slytherin, and to prove is Greatness he uncovered Slytherin's hidden chamber in Hogwarts, he unleashed the beast within, killing Myrtle Warren, and manipulated the faculty into expelling the oaf half-giant Hagrid. He proved what he was to them, that night. He was something /more/. And they could be with him or be left behind.

7.  He found his Gaunt relatives and destroyed them, killing his weak Muggle relatives too. At age sixteen he uses the death of his father to create his first Horcrux and attain a version of immortality. It is an /absurd/, unparalleled achievement. To those who know of Lord Voldemort when he was still at school, they know he is easily the most talented student to have ever walked its halls.

8.  Tom speaks to his followers about Saint Walpurga battling pests and disease, and they, the the Knights of Walpurgis, will extermination Muggles and subjugate the Mudbloods. They are not merely inferior, but are vermin. His peers respect him. Revere him. Are in awe of him. But he didn't care for their respect or reverence, it is to be /expected/, he thought he was special because he was magical when a boy, it turned out to be he was exceptional among wizards. Horace Slughorn speaks to him of working for the Ministry, working his way up and becoming the Minister for Magic. Possessing /real/ influence and control.

9.  Upon leaving Hogwarts he didn't go to the Ministry. Instead he dropped the name Tom Riddle entirely, adopting Lord Voldemort exclusively. He uses his skills at Borgin and Burkes to accumulate treasure. No doubt raising funds from the clueless customers and leaving them none the wiser for it. Then he happens upon two truly priceless treasures. The Locket of Salazar Slytherin, and the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff. These are irresistible to Voldemort and he cannot pass up the opportunity.

10. In short order the Cup and Locket are his. He leaves his job immediately. Despite his work he has delved deeply into the Dark Arts, acquiring Dark tomes and scrolls, learning the most esoteric of magic. Magics so Dark they haven't been seen in Britain for centuries, millennia. Now with his wealth he goes abroad with his followers, learns from other practitioners of the Dark Arts. He locates the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw. By now, he has four Horcruxes and a deep well of followers at home and abroad. His Death Eaters. They have sown terror throughout Europe with their bone white masks, his followers certainly had their fill of blood, meanwhile Voldemort is destroying any skilled witches or wizards who might cause problems when he truly reveals himself.

11. He returns to Hogwarts. A guise, of course, to hide the Diadem of Ravenclaw in the Room of Hidden Things. There is an elegance and irony to it. Dumbledore calls him "Tom", and Voldemort sees no need any longer to hide his new name. There is some surprise when Dumbledore rattles off a list of his followers, but nothing more is done. The old man won't be the first to lift his wand. But Voldemort knows it is only a matter of time ...

12. Years pass. The Ministry is his in all but name. Wealth, control, and influence do not concern him. But he has proven that /Magic is Might/. Dumbledore and his Order are beaten back. Every occasion he and Dumbledore fight it leads to a stalemate, but time is something Voldemort has more than anyone else alive. Again, it is only a matter of time. He has eyes and ears everywhere. His follower, Severus, brings him news of a prophecy overheard while spying on Dumbledore, he has the fates in his pocket and the child of prophecy will fall ...

... and that's pretty much how I view Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort. He is perhaps the greatest Dark Wizard to have ever lived. After the rebirth I don't really know what to think. He has to re-establish his base. His Horcruxes are destroyed one by one. Perhaps he does go mad, but he still holds influence, and still has his magical prowess. There are none equal to him. Shame about that Potter boy mucking it up. It is Voldemort's arrogance that killed him, in all other 14,000,604 timelines, Potter gets blown to smithereens in Year 4 and perhaps Voldemort recovers a measure of his previous influence. But then again, canon is weird and Deus ex Machina is the one true god.
