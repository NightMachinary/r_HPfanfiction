Im looking for some good stories that include Hermione bashing. I don't know if it's just me but i hate her character.

(Can include Weasley bashing too, i don't really like them either)

When suggesting a story:

1. *Pairing for Harry.*
2. *NO GAY RELATIONSHIPS.*
3. *Not abandoned.*

Thanks in advance.


** Of course, each time someone asks for a Hermione bashing it gots downvoted. I always imagine a horde of bushy-haired fans proudly downvoting it.

*** Yeah that is a funny phenomenon.

About a month ago i asked for Harry/Black Sisters stories, and it got less comments than this post, but WAAYY more upvotes.

And how nice it is to meet a person who has similar views about Hermione.

*** Bashing requests in general get downvoted here because usually, bashing is not a sign of quality.

Try asking for Ron bashing, specify that you hate him, point out that you are partial to the other Weasleys being bashed, and tell me how many upvotes you got.

**** You can do a quick search and you'll find that even asking for a fic where Harry doesnt befriend Hermione(so no bashing) is going to be downvoted. And you'll probably get upvoted if you ask for Ron bashing in this sub. The problem lies in those stupid person who doesn't understand that downvoting is for offensive, irrelevant, etc... post. But you shouldn't Downvote if you just disagree with what op is looking. Sadly, most of those stupid person are also Hermione fanatics.

*** Hard to explain, but my friend who got me into HP hated Hermione, so when he explained about her bossyness and other annoying qualities it kinda stuck.

And for the Weasleys, i only dislike Ginny and Molly. Molly for how she treated Sirius and Ginny because i was so dissapointed when Ginny ended up with Harry in canon.

**** You don't dislike Percy or Ron but you dislike Molly for her relationship with Sirius? Sirius was reckless and damaged, it was fairly natural for her to be wary of him, especially when her children are involved. Who would you have Ginny end up with?

#+end_quote

She mocks Sirius about his time in Azkaban to his face in his own house. That's something you expect from a lowlife like Snape, to be honest. She says this when Sirius wants to tell his godson why he's being hunted - which, in hindsight, was absolutely the right thing to do.

Sirius wasn't reckless or damaged in book 5 - for all that canon characters (and fanon authors) like to think that Sirius is very reckless, he doesn't actually do anything reckless in Book 4 or Book 5 at all.

Both Hermione and Ron are portrayed negatively in this one. Hermione is basically portrayed as a shrew , Ron is portrayed as lazy and insensitive and both are shown to be bad friends for Harry.

** linkffn(HJG: The Smartest Witch of Her Age?)

It's not exactly bashing, but it's certainly a dressing down.

Also, linffn(Rise of the Wizards) and linkffn(Saviour of Magic) both give Hermione a rather unfavourable view. Still wouldn't consider it bashing, though.

**** The "bashing" I was talking about was that some of Hermione's smarts and research get attributed to Dumbledore feeding her the information. As well as this paragraph:

Miss. Granger however did accept the bribe. She spied on you at every opportunity. Each time you had too little information, Dumbledore would tell her what she could pass on to you. She was given several rare books from his own collection in return. She didn't understand the books yet and they were confiscated by the Unspeakables, so she didn't gain a single thing.

** I love bashing characters and I think they are all fair game( except for Luna and Nelville) IF it is done in a way that makes some sense canonically- like if the author takes things that happened in Canon and just extrapolates or presents a different interpretation.

​

So, yes...Hermione bashing you say?
