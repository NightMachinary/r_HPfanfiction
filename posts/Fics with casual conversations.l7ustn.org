Characters are just discussing about topics that have little to nothing to do with the plot. It adds a sense of realism. Like how Tarantino puts casual conversations in his movies.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28794234/chapters/70614006]]) is a short story about Harry and Ron just playing chess over the course of the 7 years? (self rec but it might actually be what youre looking for?)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15889737]]) this is just a look at what the other students thought of Remus Lupin its kinda funny =)

** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Pretty much entirely consists of this. The plot kind of takes a back-seat to showing the characters just hanging out and being students at a magic school.

*** What i like best about this fic is the character interaction, especially as the group of friends have their own in jokes and such.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
