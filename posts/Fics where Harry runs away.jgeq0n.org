Does anyone know any fics where Harry runs away from the Dursley's. I don't care if he runs away to the magical or muggle world. I'm fine with any pairings except for snarry,hinny, and romione. Thank you so much!


** Harry ran away from home when he was 6 after being abused, and was taken in by street kids. Only problem, Harry's got wings. _unfortutanely the story is abandoned_

Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  After Harry Potter runs away from his relatives' home for the sixth time, Albus decides something drastic must happen. Instead of sending a friendly witch from family services like he had done before, he sends Severus Snape in hopes of scaring the boy into staying put. But when a storm interferes with plans, Severus realizes why Harry runs away and a change of plans ensues.
