Hey!

Just looking for some fic that has Harry or any other charachters interacting with Sherlock. I read the one where he gets adopted by Sherlock and John. He ends up getting special training and stuff. John is a magic black hole??? It was pretty good but I was curious if there was anything else out there.


** I really like this one - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255]] - which has an adult MoD!Harry working as a medium in the Sherlock universe. It can be read as crackfic w/ serious bits or a serious fic w/ humor (probably more the latter). It's Harry/Mycroft, nothing explicit, the most they do is kiss iirc.

** Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  Everything started with a stumble - his new life in a new world as well as his surprisingly successful career as a medium.

*** I can't see them working. It'd be a game of ‘I'm smarter than you' with both of them being TOO INTENSE at each other while the soap opera plots thumps along like their bed frame.

****** [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]] is a web serial (also has a sequel) that has spawned its own fandom - there is a wiki you can check out. Tattletale is one of the characters and she has a psychic inference ability that is similar to what Sherlock does.

Edit: I'm not saying Sherlock is psychic, just saying that what he does due to his intellect, Tattletale kind of does due to her psychic ability.

The author's also been writing some other post-magic-apocalyptic stuff in the same universe but without overtly saying it's HP.
