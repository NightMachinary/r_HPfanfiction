  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** From the wiki: /The Fomor are an ancient race of water-dwelling creatures. They are "exiles from myth and legend, the outcasts of the gods and demons of every land bordering the sea. Defeated giants, fallen gods, dark reflections of beings of light. They are many races and none, joined together beneath the banner of the Fomor in a common cause." Their common cause is revenge/

So you want a HP/Dresden Files where the Potters are actually fallen monsters disguised as humans? It's a bit weirdly specific, but I can get behind that.
