So I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][The Archeologist]] linkffn(13318951) and I wanted to know if there are other fics in which Harry gets transported in another universe and gets a female body. Preferably complete or not abandoned fics and F/F pairing for Harry if there is one.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** Pretty sure - actually just went and checked to confirm - that Racke outright states that The Archaeologist is the way it is because of Fate's Fool, a direct inspiration. If OP liked Archaeologist, they'll probably like Fate's Fool.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.
