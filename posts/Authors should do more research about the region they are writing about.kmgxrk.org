Hi so I am British and I keep reading Harry Potter fanfic which has a lot of Americanisms in them. Harry Potter is based in the UK and should be written with that in mind and I don't just mean adding correct locations. A place is more than just its name it has a culture hidden in the way people behave and in their language and a rich story really immerses you in that culture. Every time I read something that is wrong I get jilted out of the story.

Now I appreciate that I am talking about fanfic and that people write them for fun. It never really bothers me when it happens for shorter stories. However, when an author has put in the effort to reach many multiple hundreds of thousands of words it seems to me to be a small effort to double check things like the difference between cookies and biscuits.

I was mostly just wondering if this bugged anyone else, I personally want to feel like I am in a new place when I read a story and would be rather disappointed if it just wasn't right.


** Honestly, I think this is an impossibly difficult ask. American English and British English are different languages with a huge percentage of the same words. If you speak one, your mind tends to fill in the gaps unconsciously when you listen to the other, so you don't consciously learn the differences until you have a specific need.

Why should "apple" be the same, but courgette/zucchini not? Why should "socks" be the same, but sneakers/trainers not? It's impossible for an author to check every word to make sure it's the same on both sides of the pond-- and you never know which word is going to be a problem because there's no pattern to it.

*** Some differences are easier to spot like mom/mum. I wonder how many people would spot the difference in this example.

Harry: What are Aurors?

Ron: Think of them like magical SOF.

*** Then perhaps it isn't necessarily the authors place to get it right. I have friends who look specifically for British Betas to ensure their stories are as realistic as possible. Although knowing fanfic i am happy when the grammar is correct, let alone when the author has even bothered to find a Beta reader.

**** It would be nice if good beta readers grew on trees, but they do not. There are many more non-British writers than there are British beta readers. A beta needs to have the time to Britpick and the inclination to help with any given story.

I make every effort to get my story “right.” The formatting. The grammar and spelling. The word choice. The sentence structure. The arc of the plot. Continuity. The food. The geography. The speech patterns and accents (I need to have a browser window open with a chart when I write Fleur or Krum). The layout (Ginny's room is on which floor?) and the timetable (Harry has potions on which day?) and the character details (which food does Ron hate?). The timeline (had that been invented in 1995)?

It's not sheer laziness that keeps me from “bothering” to find a Brit-picker. It's a manifestation of the fact that this is a hobby, not a business.

***** This is my feeling as well. There should be some good faith efforts to get these things correct, but there's just too much that it is ridiculous to ask amateur authors to get every minute detail right. I'd rather things be consistent within the fic tbh.

Do you have these available to the public? One for Hagrid would be a good resource too.

***** Thats the sort of effort I appreciate and when I can tell its been done I always contact the author and thank them. But yes I suppose at some point it becomes a lot of work and choosing where to draw that line will be a personal preference.

FYI I have totally kept like 30 tabs open on chrome just keeping track of character traits before. There is always a moment of relief when you can close all of them. Not sure if this is of any use but I started using "toby" its a tab manager where you can store collections of tabs by date or group and can sync between machines and reopen them at any date.

** I'm with FicAccount on this, I'm afraid. I do sort of agree that britpicking is a good idea and usually makes for better stories, but I think demanding people do it is a bit much and I'd add that it's not quite as easy as just 'getting the words right'. Culture is immeasurably complex, and even words can vary considerably across very small regions in the UK. Think about the difference in slang between Manchester and Liverpool, say. They're, what, 30 miles apart, and both accent and dialect vary massively. I'm British, lived here and spoken the dialect my whole life, and I still can't keep up with the different dialects spoken over just England (and then that differs even more between various immigrant communities, areas, and then you've got Wales, Scotland, and Ireland too). I get that it annoys you and I understand, but I think you really are expecting too much from something people do for free on the internet without actual training. There's only so much time in the day and people have jobs or school in the morning, y'know? As a culture nerd who worldbuilds for a hobby, I can say with 100% certainty that just writing a lot of words is a lot easier than doing in-depth cultural research on somewhere you've probably never been to, or maybe even never met a person coming from.

It also depends on your priorities as a writer. I can very much understand why a lot of people don't do in-depth research into a new culture when they just maybe want to write a fun story about characters they love. But for the worldbuilder readers who like all the little details to be right, because that's what generally gives them immersion, that kind of focus is definitely jolting to them (I am one of those people, but I've mellowed over the years :D).

** I really don't understand this.

Fics are a hobby. A lot of them are already of such high quality for something free, sometimes even better than printed/published work.

There will be mistakes, some will be abandoned, consistency won't always be a thing. It's part of the game. Because it's a hobby and not a business and people write for FUN.

But to come complain about britpicking, I find it kinda rude. Especially considering that there is one french girl in the story and neither JKR nor many fanfic authors ever bother to write her beyond the more ridiculous and insulting stereotypes. But many of the authors, who are not English and have different native languages have to be perfect about their English because in a 10k+ free story you will be put out because it's biscuit and not cookie?

That's really so entitled and rude.

People really put themselves out there by sharing stories/their own take on the characters and their potential etc. It's even harder when, for a lot of them, it's a second if not third language used to interact with the most people.

And, truly, you're reading about a magical world, I find it strange that you can stomach magic and all its (canon) inconsistencies but not the fact that someone drinks tea with milk and eat biscuits or cookies or whatever else.

*** You're right, there's plenty you wouldn't expect. A British person, however, will pick up on it instantly. It's always worth finding one to give it a read before you post. Not even for checking your writing skills, just to make sure there's no obvious Americanisms.

*** For some things I can see how that is true. There are however a lot of really common things that people on both sides of the pond are aware of. I think things like cookies and biscuits, rubbers and erasers, lifts and elevators etc are known to be different. All I really want is for those to be right.

I always cringe when Thor tries to pronounce Niđavellir. It's beyond awful. Or Bifröst, Mjölnir, Heimdallur, Frigg, Valhöll. Oh, and Þór, and Óđinn. Do some research...

Or when you meet a little girl in Skyrim who's called Helgi. Helgi is a man's name. The female variant is Helga. It's lazy, is what it is.

** I get irritated at dialogue. They say "dude" or "mate" too much. Which unless you watch a lot of BBC you probably wouldn't know but that's the small thing I can usually spot that tells me the author isn't british. The story might be fantastic but the characters sound wrong.

Doesn't necessarily mean I'll stop reading the story but I will notice it.

** It does bother me sometimes. With a high-quality fic I can look past it, but depending on my mood I've been known to stop reading something because of Americanisms.

It shouldn't be that hard to find a Brit-picker though. There's plenty of British people on this sub, I'm sure, so it's easy enough to post "hey, I've got this new fic I'm writing, would any British person be willing to look it over for Brit-picking?"

I'm always happy to look something over, all anyone has to do is ask. :)
