I'm getting tired of reading stories where muggleborns are oppressed in every manner of their lives. I don't like how many authors take canon's oppressive minority of purebloods and turn it into an oppressive majority.

Looking for stories where blood status doesn't matter, or doesn't matter much. Preferably over 100k words and well written.

*** "The Dark Lords"? Already you're slipping into fanon. There only ever was /one/ Dark Lord, Voldemort. The only other vaguely Dark Lordish person in canon was Grindelwald, and not only did he not call himself a Dark Lord, but he didn't care about blood status --- he had a strict "wizards over muggles" policy but didn't differentiate among wizards.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
