Any good stories where Harry gets expelled from Hogwarts and his wand (presumably) snapped? Most canonically likely point being the trial, but anything else goes as well.

Please no hurt/comfort/cry baby/mpreg/bashing nonsense!

Thank you


** Well, a couple of days ago I re-read The Sniper: linkffn(3918135)

It's basically one scene of Harry shooting Voldemort with a sniper rifle, then a bunch of exposition as to how he got there in the first place, starting with being expelled at that trial.

There's also Lady Archimedes, sequel to the Arithmancer; starting in chapter 28, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/28/Lady-Archimedes][the DA is caught and Harry is expelled from Hogwarts]]. Though Harry isn't the main focus of the fic.

Mm, you know, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5rckfi/wanted_pointofdivergencestyle_fic_fudge_wins/][I made a prompt/request for a fic once]], one where Harry makes an excellent showing at his trial; Fudge still 'wins' by blatant cheating and disregard for procedure, but his sheer audacity in doing so causes a rift in the Wizengamot.

** I don't recall the name, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could find it, but this particular story involves a Harry that at some point before second year (possibly before first too) running away from the Dursleys. He is a metamorphmagi, and goes to school disguised as a muggleborn. He tricks Dumbledore at some point by pretending to be his own guardian, by transforming into his "dad". At some point, a fake Harry that was raised I think in the US appears, who is eventually unmasked. After the Triwizard Tournament, Harry (disguised), is accused of killing Diggory (I may be remembering this wrong). He denies this, but Dumbledore doesn't believe him. He is sent to Azkaban and eventually escapes and defeats Voldemort.

There's a divergence fic by the same author starting at the moment where Harry is accused. Instead, Dumbledore believes Harry, and they gain a mentor-student relationship. I recall this fic being better received (and may have been considered to have a better written ending and climax).

*** Yeah, I've seen that somewhere. Found the whole bit where the ministry kidnaps and kind of mindrapes him at the end a bit offputting, as well... I don't remember the name, either. If anyone's got the name of the divergence one, that'd be great as well.

  This is a what-if spin-off from the fanfic 'The Hidden Hero' by Evebb, answering the question: What would have happened if Dumbledore had believed and supported Mark (aka Harry) at the end of chapter 19? Mentor!Sensible!Dumbledore Enabled!Light!Harry. Giants, Dark Arts, Ministry takeover, Horcruxes, Undesirables, Harry masquerading as a muggleborn. No Deathly Hallows, MoD, or H/G

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.
