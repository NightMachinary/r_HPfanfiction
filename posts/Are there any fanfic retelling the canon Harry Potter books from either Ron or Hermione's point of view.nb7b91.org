Are there any fanfic retelling the canon Harry Potter books from either Ron or Hermione's point of view? I remember coming across a few incredibly well-written ones but I just cannot find them again. Romione stories preferred, thank you!


** Here's one for Hermione with books 1 and 2 done. To be perfectly honest I haven't read it yet, but the comments seem positive!
