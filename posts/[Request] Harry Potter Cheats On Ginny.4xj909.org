** This would be great! I feel like the closest I've read to this is Ginny being infatuated with Harry while he's secretly dating someone else (Usually Hermione).

#+begin_quote
  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.
