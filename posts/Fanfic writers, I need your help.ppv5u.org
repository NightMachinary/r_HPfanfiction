Now that I have your attention, let me begin. I am currently attending film school and just got an assignment to write a paper on a book that has been adapted to a film. My reaction was, obviously, Harry Potter. But I've decided I want to take this further. I've come up with a basic story between two men during Lord Voldemort's second reign (HBP/DH). One man, Evan Nolton, is living in the muggle world, enjoying the simple life. He doesn't like relying on magic as much as wizards today do. He'll use it for convenience (controlling the TV, cleaning up messes, ect.) but also enjoys doing things himself. This changes when an old friend of his shows up and asks him to help with the war. Evan turns the second man down, but the second man will stop at nothing to get Evan to fight. They end up dueling in Evan's house. I know there are some passionate writers out there who could help come up with ideas or cool shots. I really want this to be awesome. Here's a bit of a reference for the dueling. Mine won't be exactly the same, but it'll be along these lines. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW1fQ6NgMUk&feature=related]]
