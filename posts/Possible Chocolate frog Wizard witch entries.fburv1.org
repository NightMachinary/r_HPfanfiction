So. I've been thinking what do you think the magic users of history will be chocolate frog worthy and what are the flavour text they might have.

Excluding Dumbledore and the Hogwarts founder. I'm not sure if there's a Canon stuff for this.


** Every spell, every potion every star will have be discovered by someone. Every quidditch team will have had a founder and a few star players over their history. Binns couldn't have filled years with Goblin Rebellions if there weren't key figures involved. Ministers for Magic are probably worthy of a card.

** There's a number of them listed on the wiki that you might want to look at first! [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Chocolate_Frog_Card#Famous_Wizards_and_Witches_Cards]]

I believe a bunch would come from assorted games/non-book sources, but it could serve as inspiration.

In general, I would go two different ways on it if I were making some myself - one is if going for more of the canon, whimsical approach that defines the WW to me, and so strive to include more funny tidbits (eg, like the one on the wiki that has one for: "Sent to Azkaban for continuing to keep Sphinxes in his back garden despite repeated warnings"). The alternative is the more serious approach - where you'd want to have those that invented important spells, were or defeated Dark lords or other threats, or famous leaders that were of import for a decade or more.

** I always wondered if there was a game attached to them. I mean, some kind of game like Top Trumps attached to the card collecting elements would give an actual point to collecting them beyond just having them.

  Pokémon card

Yeah, basically. Or Magic the Gathering, for anyone else reading this that doesn't know pokemon cards. You get a base deck you can play with, then augment it with collectibles from the frogs.
