I come across fics that have some ingenious ideas regarding the inner workings of the Ministry. It makes me wish that JKR had expanded upon some of the glossed over canon aspects of the HP world.

What ideas/tropes are commonly better executed in fanon than they are in canon?


** - History and relevance of Merlin - most recently as seen in A Long Journey Home, but many earlier stories related to Merlin as a near-deified figure from well before the founding of Hogwarts.

- Competency of Ministry workers in dealing with muggles. Arthur in the books seems like a barely-competent Pureblood with limited understanding of muggle culture yet responsible for policy and enforcement of Statute rules regarding enchantment of muggle objects.

- Population estimates and the inferred existence of lesser magical schools in Britain and elsewhere.

**** Nothing in Potter canon explains why Merlin is the go-to-expletive, and what has been said is that he was a Slytherin.

There's so much wrong with that. My mind immediately jumped to the sane conclusion: the source was a Slytherin prefect introducing firsties to the House (part of the Pottermore material) and he had said that to test how gullible they were. I.e.: it's LIES.

Most useful fanon versions of Merlin have him saving Atlantis or discovering its lost mysteries or inventing half of the canon spell repertoire. The aforementioned Long Journey Home placed him as the wizard who traveled the world, uniting wizards across the globe in scholarly cooperation.

You cannot just move his legend to the tenth century without radically changing /everything/. The whole reason King Arthur "works" is that we have virtually no reliable historical info for that time -- but we do know a lot about the time of Aethelstan the Unready etc. which is around the time of Hogwarts.

Pottermore is filled with nonsensical tripe that conflicts with itself, with the books, and with the real world setting that otherwise mostly works for the HP canon.

Myrddin was a nomadic madman (unlikely) who was baptised in castle (even more unlikely). JKR's uncredited theft of a real Welsh historical figure isn't all that troubling as she's hardly alone in failing to do her research.

To my knowledge there is no consensus if Arthur was ever a real person, but it seems unlikely as Geoffrey of Monmouth (the legend's author) wrote extensively about magic.

Her Merlin might be a llama, if she wants. Whatever, she's right, per definition. She's even right if secondary sources contradict the books. Harry Potter is -- per definition -- a completely subjective record of a fictitious conflict.

I always figured it was semi-deliberate. Like it's become a cultural norm for wizards constantly mispronounce Muggle things deliberately to show off how distant they are from Muggles.

We know that the Ministry is actually incredibly competent when it comes to maintaining secrecy, because obviously the magical world remains a secret. So the people who matter, such as the obliviators, likely have a very good working knowledge of the Muggle world.

**** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] (well actually I'm on its sequel now) and its nowhere near the main focus of the fic, but Harry starts trying to become an Animagus after Sirius rescues him from the Dursleys at age 8. The Animagus stuff comes in maybe midway through the story. The author's take on it is really cool! I recommend the story as a whole, as well.

** Magic in general. Even the most frothingly silly powerHarry fic at least bases plot on it, rather than having it as background decoration.

** I would say the level of various spells, and Magical Exhaustion. This concept is alluded to in a way when people say that Dumbledore is not as powerful as he used to be. Also I would say Magical Core Properties are better in Fanon. It is said in the books (especially The Chamber of Secrets) that the core exists (in the books Riddle states he is draining the magic and the soul of Ginny, meaning that they are separate things). Some fanfictions also show that the core can grow as a person matures, which explains the way JKR only taught the stunning spell and such in the later years of the series.
