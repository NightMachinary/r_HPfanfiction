I'm curious to see what the authors of this community have created. It might generate some traffic for our stories too.


** I shamelessly promote this on a regular basis -- the Chessmaster series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn), is mine.

Essentially this fic started with me wanting to give Ron a deeper characterization and play around with politics. It features Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin, politics, a splash of world building, and a savvier Voldemort.

Tangent: You know what's weird? I actually read MORE fanfiction when we had a newborn. She'd get up all hours of the night and I'd get up with her, and reading fanfiction is usually what I did. Now that she sleeps through the night, I find myself gravitating back to long-neglected books or watching more TV. I'll have to make a better effort to read more of you all, cuz it's some really good work.

** Since I shamelessly promote it on a regular basis, I imagine most people here will already be familiar with Victoria Potter linkffn(12713828).

So to "add value" I'll briefly describe my broad plans for the story and how they have evolved.

Victoria Potter started as a rewrite of my previous fem!Harry story, which I abandoned after it reached the end of first year. The principal premise of that story had been to depict the development of a top-tier witch and so it featured a lot of magical theory, but by the time I had finished writing first year I realised I wanted to tell a proper story, not just a magical theory sandbox. There was a laundry list of things I disliked about the previous version: the characters were too mature too fast, the themes were too dark, the main character too unlikeable, the world too AU, the magical theory too dry in presentation, and there was very little in the way of plot other than drama.

So I set about rewriting it to correct those errors. I inserted more plot, albeit with stakes more age-appropriate than canon. I tried to make the main character more sympathetic, though certain characteristics have carried over. I endeavoured to show magic in use rather than simply in textbooks. I made the world closer to canon, but still with lots of additional details or little differences, with the aim of recalling the feeling of first reading the HP books and falling in love with the world. And I made the tone of the fic much more lighthearted, especially in first year, with the aim of having the tone develop with the characters.

Victoria Potter very quickly took on a life of its own and has diverged from my previous fem!Harry fic to the point that they in fact bear very little resemblance to each other. In particular, I have progressively beefed up the plot elements. My original plan had been to get through years 1-3 quite quickly, almost like an extended prologue to the more detailed years 4-7, but I quickly realised that you can't have three years of just worldbuilding and character interactions.

So year 2 is now more or less a full mystery story in the style of canon books 1-3, and year 3 will follow the same approach. That said, I am still trying to keep years 1-3 pretty concise, again taking my lead from the length of canon books 1-3.

The story's linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) and is an in-progress 7-year AU with a single point of departure: Hermione was born a Parselmouth, and discovered it at quite an early age. She grows up with a very different outlook on the world and a firm dedication to the cause of sentient nonhumans. A wrench is thrown in the stations of canon and hijinx ensue.

  Neville Longbottom wasn't chosen to be the hero. Draco didn't even try out. But when the war is over and the nightmares begin, the two of them, along with Hermione, will do whatever they need to to ensure another Dark Lord doesn't rise from the ashes.

** I've written a few fics, but haven't written anything since last December.

My greatest accomplishment by far is finishing my 12 year WIP which I thought I would never get done.

Linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)

My favourite will always be linkffn(food for thought by lovehp) just because I loved writing Snape and the tension created between Harry and himself over a pretty mandane thing.

I love writing about the darker and sinister side of the wizarding world and exploring the emotions and trauma that it invokes in the characters. So many of my fics portray some pretty hellish scenes and characterisations as well as development.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

A humour heavy (but still serious, I swear) fic that sorts around half of the student population into different houses. It focuses a lot of the broader cast of students, though a lot of focus is given the the Slytherin students (which now include Harry, Hermione, Parvati, and Lisa). Pretty much everyone ends up in a different friend group, and I've done my best to avoid recycling of canon material. I'm about halfway through year 1 at this point (I only started publishing in April, and I've been writing the fic live). I also just recently hit 1k follows.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

My contribution to the appalingly low number of HP/f!TR fics. fem!Riddle finds the horcrux in Harry's scar in the chamber, and decides that possessing him would be much more discreet that absorbing Ginny's soul. Unfortunately, Lily's protection is still active, so she's stuck inside his head, unable to possess him and unable to escape, but able to control his body for brief stints of time and feed him information. It's still in its early phases.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

Kal-El was promptly blood-adopted and raised as Harry Potter, having been /born/*/e/* to them at just the right time.

The *e* at the end of the word Born is important here, as the most common letter in the English language is a huge plot point.

The first is a completed Harry in Slytherin story that covers his first year. It has 1k followers, and seems to be pretty popular. There are some grammatical errors in this one, but it is my most popular. I am currently revising it, as book 2 is coming out in a few months; but I haven't had too much time to truly commit to editing.

The second is another Harry in Slytherin story, though a different series where he is darker than the first. It's a WIP but is updated weekly and will cover his first year.

The third is a Harry/Gabrielle set in fourth year. It's 80k words in though nowhere near compete. It's updated at least every few weeks, though school has made it hard lately.

The fourth is surprinsly my most popular if you base it off of per chapters numbers. It's going to be an eventual Harry/Narcissa and is set where Harry time travels back to the Marauders era in a last ditch effort to beat Voldemort, as his side was about to lose the war.

The fifth is a Harry/Delphini story set in HBP where they are the same age. It's kind of updated whenever I have time, and is definitely more of a side project.

The sixth is a controversial one that has gotten more hate than any other, because of one particular scene. It's a response to a challenge and is definitely the bottom of my priorities, though I do intend on seeing it through. It will be an eventual Harry/Astoria and is a WBWL story.

** My only fic right now is linkffn(Figure in Gray by Erebus1999) which is kind of like Ebenbild's /Basilisk-born/ in that it will have a little bit of everything once I get it going good. I have plot-bunnies written down for one or two more, and I may throw some one shots in though.

All of that said, as of today /Figure in Gray/ has only a prologue and chapter one. I have the second chapter laid out, but I have to sit down and just hammer out like 7k words then edit it all. As I'm not a fast writer by any means, that takes far longer than it really should. Also, despite it being the summer (which means I'm out of college) I'm still constantly doing stuff that keeps me away from my Craptop and not writing.

Enough ranting though. Cheers all

** I've got three ongoing stories and a crossover in progress, each of which has a different feel - necessary, or else I'd go nuts by this point.

My big ongoing story is Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council. I had the idea of writing a fic in the HP space, but could not nail down what sort of story to write. A Harry whose father lived? A female Harry sorted into Slytherin? A Ravenclaw harry who was raised by the Goblins, but with a witch as a foster mother? Maybe the female gryffindor twin of a deceased Harry?

In the end, I did all four, plus a canon version for fun. Each can hear thoughts from the others, and the five - together - have to navigate their lives. With five worlds, I get to pepper in subtle changes here and there, such as one world where the Headmistress is a female Albus dumbledore. Blending the worlds together has been an absolute delight, and I'm thrilled that the story has been received so well.

The fiftieth chapter just went up a few days ago. Enjoy. linkffn(12979337)

Who Dares Wins is a twin fic, sort of, where a more military/pragmatic Harry goes into the battle of the Ministry ready for a fight, and ends up winning handily. The bigger surprise, however, is that his parents show up to help protect him while his twin brother fights Voldemort in the atrium. The Potters came out of hiding expecting canon!Harry, and instead get a powerful and confident Lord Potter who has a plan and allies. Started as a one-shot, but the reception was good enough to convince me to keep going, with thirteen chapters up as of today. linkffn(13182638)

The Prisoners' Tale is much lighter, and focuses on the growing relationship between a Harry Potter who died on Halloween 1981 (but whose soul latched onto Voldemort's, and who later subverted the ritual in the graveyard to resurrect himself instead of the Dark Lord) and a restored Nagini. I'm proud of it, though it's only a few chapters in, as it seems to be the only ongoing Harry/Lady!Nagini story I can find on ffn. linkffn(13107553)

** The things worth mentioning that I can link:

linkffn(Retroactive by wordhammer) - a nearly canon-compliant short story about Harry and Luna hijacking the Time Turners at the end of the Ministry battle in order to change the outcome. It's funny, includes some nice world-building info and good characterizations. Bittersweet ending nearly ruins it for most readers.

linkffn(Wordhammer's Mad Ideas) - a collection of story stubs, but the real value comes from the 1st, 3rd and 6th chapters, about Harry trying to use a Dementor to destroy the locket horcrux. As Harry says to Ron, "Things didn't go as planned. Are you really surprised by that?"

linkao3(Ruminations on the Wizarding World by wordhammer) not a story so much as essays about my Potterverse headcanon and alternate ideas.

** Currently I'm working on Dark Savior linkffn(13160197) it's a Batman/HP crossover. First time I've ever done anything in the DC universe been reading them for years. However, never got the exact elements I wanted with it so just decided to write what I wanted.

I've done several Once Upon a Time/HP crossovers but they're all currently on Hiatus.

​

Also have one experimental crossover with Sarah J Maas's A Court of Thorn and Roses called Heir of Stars and Shadows linkffn(13159585) that I'm working on as well. The reviews for that one are sort of dismal though, so it really hasn't been my primary focus

** I'm writting some Lily/James stories at the moment.

The Best ( linkffn(The Best by schak) ) is a pure fluff fic how James over the years fell in love with Lily. It is short and sweet.

Lily Bud ( linkffn(Lily Bud by schak) ) is a sister story to The Best. from time to time we see things that happend in The Best, but now out of Lily's perspective. It is a lot more in detail and deals with all of Lily's important relationships, be it with friends, family, lovers, allies and enemies. I started to write this story, because I realized that after reading the Prince's Tale, I lost a lot of sympthy and respect not only for Snape, but Lily as well and this was me thinking myself into a child and teenager that had to grow up in a war about her right to live and that only ever knew a magical world at peace in the stories of another child.

So let me tell you about this Harry. His wand has a rare and powerful core, and he owns a cool enchanted trunk. He communicates well with animals (or at least half-Kneazles). Thanks to a goblin inheritance test, he's a confirmed descendant of Gryffindor. His animagus form is so rare it shocked everyone, and his patronus has unique traits that he employs in duels. Basically, he's a total badass.

My very first one is The Flame's Shadow, which is really a Fantastic Beasts fic with a Percival Graves/ Credence Barebone pairing, but hey, it was the the first work I was really proud of. It's a 3-shot, and doesn't take more than 10 minutes to read. Basically a short story on Graves and Credence told from Credence's POV, and it ends on an angsty note. Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13591983/chapters/31200042]]

My second one is Eggs, which is a oneshot, told from George Weasley's perspective at the end of the war. Basically deals with PTSD, trauma and all that-- or at least I try to, in the most respectful way I can. Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18547381]]

I have a few fics planned on the way, but I'm not sure if they'll ever come to fruition, lol. I plan to write more Gravebone fics, and maybe one about Tom Riddle, American Psycho style. I've been thinking about writing a longer story about Hedwig's namesake, but short stories are my thing so I'm not too sure about that too.

** The fic I'm most proud of is a mystery story about a private investigator Harry who goes undercover as a Hogwarts Divination Professor to investigate a case of a missing student, but this sub won't appreciate the pairing, so take a look at this comedy time-travel one-shot instead. linkao3(16999125)

It stars, among many other things, teenage Lockhart with a 70's perm, Snape brewing drugs, hopeless romantic Regulus, Narcissa who has her priorities straight and, of course, Harry who's just trying to stay sane at this point.

Edit: I've always known the bot hates me. Here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16999125]]

" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy. "

Since I am a Swedish person I thought it would be fun to write a story that Swedish wizards and witches could attend and in canon that would be Durmstrang. This story follows the current canon very closely and incorporates features from both books, movies, and Pottermore.

** I'm currently rewriting and expanding things I wrote years ago. I suppose I'm doing it the odd way by writing three simultaneously. Currently I've got two at 100% done; two at about 60% and one at about 5%.

Brief Precis.

- The main character is a Slytherin girl in the same year as the Twins. So about three years older than the Trio. She is a half-blood who is familiar and comfortable with the Muggle world, and indeed prefers it in many ways. Yet I've done my best to make her an absolutely dyed-in-the-wool Slytherin; the hat did not make a mistake.

- The whole thing is written as a faux-memoir. "Written" about now and looking back on events of about 30 years ago. If I'm honest, the series falls squarely into the category that TV-Tropes calls "First-Person Smartass".

- Harry is /strictly/ an unseen character. But lots of canon-characters get walk-ins as and when appropriate. The standouts are the Twins and I make a great deal of use of them - she and they have quite the grudging-respect, best of frenemies thing going on. The stories as a whole are completely canon-compliant.

- A couple of the stories are set in Hogwarts. But much of it is her post-Hogwarts career, running concurrently with the events of the canon-books.

I've not really posted anything as the writing process is sufficiently slow that I don't want to put up completed ones and have a huge delay for before subsequent ones go up. Which is actually hugely presumptive on my part, as I'm assuming people would want to read subsequent instalments.

But if anybody's up for beta-ing, or offering feedback, I'd be happy to send it their way. PM me.

Snape Chronicles: Reflections and Redemptions

Summary: The end was only the beginning for Severus Snape. After that, there is a clarity to be found and one can see things as they really are, not how one imagined them to be.

There also may be a sequel and possibly a companion piece. I need to get further with the outline for the second story so as to not leave plot holes in the first. If it doesn't work out this story will need a re-write. My hold up is I lost my beta, so if anyone could point me in the direction of a Britpicker that would be appreciated.
