So no remione, sirimione, tomione, snamione, etc. As long as its something that hasn't been done over again and again I don't mind what it is exactly! Also think of pairings relatively. For ex, Salazar/Hermione or Harry may be rare compared to some pairings, but it's pretty popular as far as Hermione or Harry/Founders ships go. (also I'm more interested in Godric/Hermione in general, but I digress.)

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation.

  Waking up in St Mungo's almost sixty years in the past, newly appointed Auror Ron Weasley is out of his depth. England is at war with the Dark Wizard Grindelwald, but he's more concerned about the threat of a young Dark Lord still at Hogwarts. Ron is about to learn a very valuable lesson in Time Travel, and the dangers of trying to change history.
