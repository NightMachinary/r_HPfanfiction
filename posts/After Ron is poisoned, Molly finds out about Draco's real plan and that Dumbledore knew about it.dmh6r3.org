I know all order members think Dumbledore knows best, but I can't imagine she would just shrug and say,'it's fine. I'm glad he's helping Malfoy'. Would this change order members' view of Dumbledore? Would Ron's mother still be willing to be a member?


** They all turned a blind eye to an underfed kid being sent back to an abusive home. I have a hard time believing those not named Molly, Arthur, and Bill wouldn't continue doing the same.

**** Harry was followed around by Order members when he was kid. It's how he was able to identify Dedalus Diggle in the Leaky Cauldron. So threatening the Dursleys when he's a month and a few days shy of 16 is absolutely turning a blind eye.

Also Vernon says "no meals" when her lets the boa out of its tank, no food was a source of punishment more than once.

***** A guy meeting Harry doesn't mean they were aware of abuse.

Missing a meal as punishment for endangering Dudley's life doesn't mean he was underfed, him actually complaining about not getting enough food like he did in Chambers of Secrets is being underfed.

****** You think it's believable a person sent to specifically follow Harry around for his safety couldn't see that Harry's demeanor and attire didn't fit with the suburban, middle class Dursleys? Edit: and Mrs. Figg was two streets away and routinely watched him. They allowed themselves to be talked down or outright ignored it.

And he wasn't punished for "endangering" Dudley, who had punched him in his ribs. He was punished for doing something he had no control over. And as no meals was used twice as a punishment I don't see why it's difficult to believe it was a routine thing.

******* Firstly Diggle has no Idea about muggles, so he could easily miss the abuse, second we have no Idea that he followed Harry around.

And yes Figgs knew about the abuse, but how would that result in the Weasleys knowing.

Also Harry was totally punished for endangering Dudley, just because he did it accidentally doesn't mean he wasn't the cause, and again missing a meal occasionally doesn't make you underfed.

  But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?"

  Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,"
#+end_quote

He was punished for doing magic. I mean the very next chapter begins with "the escape of the boa constrictor earned Harry his longest punishment ever."

The general consensus in the fandom is that Harry didn't get as much food as he would have liked. Not starved to death, but he was rarely if ever /full/. A thought by Harry pretty much tells us he had to sneak to get food and that wasn't always an option.

********** ...the people continued to exist and followed Harry around while ignoring his abuse (including Diggle, who just so happened to be in a random muggle shop), so the Draco debacle should only ruffle Weasley feathers. That's the gist of my initial comment.

We're not getting anywhere here, so agree to disagree.

****** His rations in CoS were below 500 kcal/day. That's less than half of what you got in the ruins of postwar Germany. And his "breakfast" in GoF was 50 kcal if you are generous. That's inhumane treatment right there.

And sending cake is not the right answer to that. If anything, that makes Molly guilty of conspiracy to commit child abuse because she knew but chose not to bring criminals to justice.

************ He was smaller and thinner than he was supposed to be, which is a medical condition and therefore Harry was not healthy nor physically unharmed. Vernon hit Dudley in canon and Harry didn't bat an eye, which implies that physical violence wasn't uncommon. That definitely constitutes as physical harm, as does the Harry hunting. And Petunia's attempt to hit Harry with a frying pan could very well have lethal, hence the attempted manslaughter.

That's an assumption which could or could not be revealed as true during the trial. But it is enough to start digging.

Remember, Malfoy has been calling for racial purges since age 12 and has been gleeful that Voldemort returned. It is not unbelievable to assume that he was happy to have joined.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
