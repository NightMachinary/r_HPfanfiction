** War Widow (by anthfan I think),\\
Angels in Australia (pretty sure this is an hhr),\\
Ward 37 (I think it's called that),\\
Survivor (by truewriter I think),\\
The Road not Taken (Chem Prof),\\
Threads of Time (Chem Prof also. a whole bunch are post-dh),\\
Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad? (Nonjon),\\
Cause and Effect (I think this one is apaidan, and one of the other two up there are as well)\\
Now What? (forget who wrote this)

Sorry I can't paste links atm, so these are just some of the ones I remember. I have a bunch on my profile in my favorites (fanfiction.net/~nedryos). Chem Prof and apAidan are two really good ones you should check out. The rest you can probably google with "fanfiction.net" after the title.

There's also one where Harry and Hermione buy a yacht and set sail for a couple years. Forget the title though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418163/1/Fulfilling-Obligations][Fulfilling Obligations]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418163/1/Fulfilling-Obligations][Unlike a Sister]] are both canon-compliant but H/Hr all the way. The latter is brought up frequently on this subreddit--rightfully so-- but I found Fulfilling Obligations to be just as effective at portraying a realistic romance between the two after Hogwarts. It's really underrated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163250/1/Better-Never-than-Late][Better Never Than Late]] is also really good. A work in progress though.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8891][The Catalyst]] is great as well. It's the most recent by [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/profile/16292][lorein829]]--who's written other amazing post-Hogwarts fics like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6446][Shadow Walks]] and [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8245][Senses]]. Her most famous one is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5638&chapterid=&agree=1][Resistance]] but I'd hesitate to call that post-Hogwarts.

*** Thanks for these. Fulfilling Obligations looks especially promising. I did enjoy Unlike a Sister, but broken families, no matter how amicable the outcome, makes me a bit depressed. Still, a good recommendation and I'll snap to reading the rest of them as well.

*** Thanks for the Fulfilling Obligations rec. It's a nice story, well written, with great, witty dialogue. My only minor criticism is the rather cheap way in which [[/spoiler][Ginny was written out of the story]].

**** Haven't gotten that far into the story yet, I'm mostly just sitting here, shouting [[/s][SPOILER]]. But yes, enjoying the story more than I do most affair!fics so far, well written and engaging.

***** I hear you. I normally don't like affair fics either since I find affairs to be morally reprehensible (especially when children are involved) and I would like to think better of the principal characters. Moral courage would demand that Harry and Hermione set aside their passions until they can break it off honorably with their to-be-exes. If they can't find it in themselves to do that, to respect their partners and themselves that much, if they're too weak to do so, then they don't deserve happiness together. Cheating on a loving spouse is /always/ morally blameworthy.

Not to be pedantic, but Greek philosophers identified [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_words_for_love][four types of love]]: philia, storge, agape and eros. To the extent that this is an accurate qualification, affair fics tend, by and large, to rank eros, the most fleeting and superficial of the forms of love, as being somehow superior to other forms--storge and agape in particular--and thus morally praiseworthy. It's quite the opposite.

Couple that with their relationship being based on deception and moral weakness, which can't possibly evolve to anything healthy, Harmony wishes notwithstanding. How either can ever again trust the other, knowing what they're capable of, is beyond me.

****** I think that in Fulfilling Obligations, the love is mostly agape with some Eros thrown in. The true dilemma and conflict is fighting against those inhibitions, which they do quite effectively. This story is technically an affair fic--at least not physically. They really are honorable people in this one, unlike other affair stories.

** There are so many! These are my usual search parameters on ff.net: 60k words, Complete, Harry and Hermione as main characters (not as a pairing, many old fics don't have that set), sometimes filtering out Ginny, Snape, or Draco as characters, English, all ratings

Off the top of my head I can think of the one I am reading now, /Harry Potter and the Forgotten Brother/, /Breakfast in New York/, and /Harry Potter and the Heir of Morgaine le Faye/.

** Quick question, are you looking more for Epilogue-compliant fics (mostly affair!fics) or EWE ones that continue from Battle of Hogwarts?

*** I prefer fics that disregard the epilogue entirely, I'm a sucker for fluff, and affairfics kinda... taints the experience a bit. In fact, I'd love to see more HHr fics that go into next-gen territory
