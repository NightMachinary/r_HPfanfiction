  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

  For so long, they have stood in the background, for so long, they have guided the destiny of the Wizarding World. But who are... they, exactly? Who is playing who? And what are their ultimate goals? - Graphic Violence, Death, Bad Language, Lemons (maybe) - No Pairings, at least nothing long-term. Formerly A CURSED BLOODLINE.

** Unspeakably complicated circumstances has a really interesting take on the unspeakables. Essentially, the Unspeakables are people who ought to have died but didn't. The ministry then kidnaps them and makes them do super secret spy work.
