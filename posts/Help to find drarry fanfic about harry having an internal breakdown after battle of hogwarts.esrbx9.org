:END:
Can someone help me find this fanfiction of harry/draco which is set some 5 years after the battle of Hogwarts? It starts with harry having a nervous breakdown such that he starts living inside his own head for 2 or 5 years and then utters the word "draco". And then Draco is brought in to help and the story unfolds from there. Read it almost 2 years ago and it was older still but can't seem to find it now.
