** No. The Scarcrux isn't like the other Horcruxes because there have been no protections put on it. A Horcrux isn't naturally super durable, it is the protections put by its owner that make it so. Also, Harry has been injured lots of times, so he can't be invincible or invulnerable.

** Hmm, it might do something, horcruxes seem more durable than they ought to be... That could just be charms Voldemort put on them after the fact though. Harry gets small injuries so I don't expect he has any magical protection of that sort. Could be the sort that only kicks in when lethal injury occurs though.

The prophecy might do some spooky action at a distance to prevent non-Voldemorts from killing Harry. Something like helping Harry know when to duck.

I really can't get my head around how prophecy is supposed to work in the HP verse. Are there magic gods looking into the future and using seers as sock puppets to tell people things sometimes? Are they taking action to make them come true? Why would one event deserve a prophecy but not another?

The simplest interpretation is that Harry would just die if he were hit hard with something heavy.

****** I get what he was getting at. However...

- Harry wasn't a real horcrux

- Voldemort's protections made the horcruxes nearly invulnerable

- And there was nothing to stop him from dying until Voldemort took his blood.

** Being an Horcruxe does not bring any special protection to an item (or in the case of Harry and Nagini, a living being). It's because the Dark Wizard enchanted the items before hand (to make them suitable receptacles) that they are resilient.

So no, Harry doesn't have a "invincible skull", but it doesn't mean he would have died from this because :

- It's not like Petunia tried to swing at full power. She just tried to give him a "little" hit with the thing she had in her hand (so a frying pan). I mean, as a child I got hit by a broom once or twice because my mother had her hand full, it's pretty much the same thing. A bump at worst (also, I can't help to think that she would not have tried after one hit if she truly went for the kill).
- In HBP, Harry get hit in the head by a metal ball flying at high speed, probably followed by a pretty big fall (since he was flying), and he is good to go after one night in the Infirmary. If he could get out of that without any lasting injury, I doubt Petunia could physicaly kill him even if she wanted to.
