So a long time ago I read this fic on FF.net where Remus somehow gets into Auror training along with James and Sirius. But it doesn't last long because on one of the training missions, Femus gets I hired and his partner tries to heal him with something that had either silver or wolfsbane in it, which obviously hurt him worse and so it comes out he's a werewolf and he has to quit.

This was years ago and I believe it was already an old fic, possibly not even finished or maybe abandoned. I'm going down the Remus tag on FF, but it's a slow go. I've got Remus and Sirius as characters, because that's what I usually put when looking for Marauders stories and then filter out anything with OCs and Hermione.

Any help finding it would be awesome! I've just managed to find like thirty other fics I've read/want to read, so the go is slow. Lol
