Do we have any economists in the house? I've spent a couple of weeks trying to find info on how gold standard economies interact with fiat-based ones, but to no avail. Surely there was a period when both types of economy coexisted?

Basically I'm trying to work out how to muggle and wizarding economies would interact, if and how conversion between the two would be regulated, and whether or not it is feasible for Goblins to use the muggle stock exchanges. With the last one, I was also trying to find information on the early days of stock exchanges to use with the wizarding conomy, but I wasn't sure if it would even be feasible with the drastically smaller population.


** For a supposedly post scarcity society like the Magical World, there shouldn't be material poverty to begin with. And yet, we could observe evidence of severe poverty in Magical Britain. I think one of the main culprits was their use of gold as currency. By tying potentially infinitely high productivity (magic at will) to a very limited amount of currency in circulation, they all but guaranteed long term deflation and thus unending economic depression.

Maybe that was part of the Goblin conspiracy to keep Wizards well below their potential after all.

*** The wizarding world should be p.much post scarcity, but think of it this way: just because I know how to sew doesn't mean I feel like sewing all my clothes by hand, and I'm sure that applies to domestic spells etc.

** I'm no economist, but a gold standard economy assumes money can be directly exchanged for a certain value of gold bullion correct? Now consider that the durability of currency is a serious consideration to its design, and also that goblins are bankers who likely understand economics fairly well. So something we have to take into account when dealing with a magical currency is whether a gold Galleon even /can/ be converted into gold bullion. It's entirely possible that Galleons are enchanted against being easily melted down or otherwise destroyed. This would essentially make it possible for a gold coin to be used as a fiat currency, thus completely bypassing the GS-Fiat interaction, currently at least. Historically is another matter, but the Goblins in this case could just discontinue any currency-gold exchange service they may have offered in the past to bypass the protections on their coinage. They probably also cap the amount an individual can exchange in order to prevent anyone from crashing the small wizarding economy on a whim by converting all their currency and flooding or draining the economy of Galleons.

As for stock exchanges, I wouldn't put it past the goblins to have human agents making trades for them on the muggle exchanges. However, I don't think magical society would have public stock exchanges due to the small size of their society. Their economy just isn't big enough to support those kinds of large financial endeavors. Instead their economy would probably look more like that of an insular small town, all family-owned small businesses with monopolies or near monopolies on their niche, where deals and partnerships are done privately rather than traded publicly.
