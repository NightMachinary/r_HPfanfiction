I'm looking for any story, where Harry is a Jinchuuriki. Preferably to Kurama, but any Bijuu is ok.

Would prefer story still set in Britain, and no yaoi.


** I'm going to be cheeky and recommend the Denarian series because that Harry is also the vessel of a godlike foxy being.

** I only know two. Neither in Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5852062/1/Multicolour-Post-Its][Multicolour Post Its]]: Naruto is Harry's jinchuriki. Set in the Leaf.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8530656/1/Shark-in-the-Leaf][Shark in the Leaf]]: Harry has the Tree Tails. Set in the Leaf. I wasn't a fan of this one but I have high standards and dislike most of Naruto fandom so maybe you will be.
