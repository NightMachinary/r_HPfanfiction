I wanted to read this but I don't know what the title is and I accidentally exited the tab. Harry dies on Halloween of '81 but something weird happens and he made a deal with Death or is the MOD or something like that. Thanks.


** If you accidentally click out of a tab, all you have to do is ctrl+shift+t or you could go to your history.

*** That's normally what I would do but it was in an incognito tab so I wasn't able to.

**** I feel your pain! I recently lost like 3 fics I'd had in incognito mode, and had to wrack my brain to figure out what steps I took to get to those fics.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)
