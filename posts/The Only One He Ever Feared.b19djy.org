So, Order of the Phoenix was by far my least favorite book and movie of the series. Harry's angst turned up to 11, Umbridge, Snape's Occlumency lessons, Umbridge, Sirius' dying, and Umbridge.

But I will never forget how my jaw fell open when I turned to the page to Chapter 36 and saw the image of Dumbledore dueling Voldemort.

Now we are seeing how incredibly powerful Grindlewald is, along with the claim of "greatest wizarding duel of all time" from Deathly Hallows.

Any good stories where Dumbledore really shows that he is powerful beyond the average wizard?

  “What -?” cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, “Dumbledore!” 

  Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates.  

  Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.  

  “It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The Aurors are on their way”  

  “By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame.  

  Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.  

  “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, are you?”

  “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit”  

  “There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled Voldemort.  

  “You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it.

Dumbledore is such a badass. He's one of my favorite characters in all of fiction. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] has an excellent Dumbledore, though we don't get to see much of him.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** Chapter 83 of linkao3(14078862), which would be better served as a one-shot and not spread already too wide spread storyline, but it is really great. Suddenly, you are allowed to see that he (and two other wizards of higher level involved) really stand out from the crowd. And no, Harry is no way that powerful (which is The Right Thing™).

** The Harry Potter & The Darkness Before the Dawn trilogy by Madscientist: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/3883]] Was my absolute favorite PowerfulWarrior!Dumbledore portrayal in Fan Fiction. Unfortunately the last story in the series was abandoned, but its still worth a read.
