** ...? Voldemort's dad was basically raped lol. Voldemort's mother, Merope Gaunt used a love potion on Voldemort's dad, Tom Riddle Sr, then she stopped giving him the potion believing he was truly in love (At this point she's pregnant, not sure how long though) Tom Riddle freaks out and leaves. Years later Voldemort killed him for 'abandoning' his family, despite being essentially raped. Can't recall if Voldemort actually knows this or not.

** Interesting question. I'd assume most people are not rapists and would not use charms, potions, etc. for nefarious purposes but for the small percentage of the population who are “bad people,” I suppose it's quite easy for them to commit such crimes and get away with it.

I am assuming canon wouldn't be far off from muggle world, but fanon is riddled with it thanks to crazy writers.

** For all the love potions and charms, we have few in-canon examples of attempted sex coerced by magic. I think it's more to do with the writing than the /likely/ state of the logically-consistent outcome of memory charms and love potions existing.

It's possible that it's so common people don't even see it as rape: cf Molly Prewett giving Arthur Weasley a 'nudge' with potions, how much of a 'nudge' was it? Or Dumbledore's sympathy for Merope Gaunt and lack of use of the term to describe what she did to Tom Riddle Senior.

Or it's possible that it is very rare, and Merope Gaunt's use is a wild aberration. Cf: Hermione's capture. She is tortured horribly and kept for a while, but there's no mention of rape. And there's no mention of unwanted children forced on prisoners.

I think you can argue in any direction at all, from it being a common hobby for a certain set of wizards and witches, to it being incredibly unusual even when murder is happening frequently.

***** Yeah, but rape can traumatize people for life, make you feel violated in horrible ways. Once you're dead, everything's just gone and there is no pain. We all die in the end anyway.

I mean, you can't really argue that murder is more socially acceptable to have on shows, movies, books, and games. Imagine a game where your character rapes someone. The outrage would be astronomical. But murder? Psh, been there a million times already.

******* I'm not saying it's a good thing. It's just that we all expect death at one point. No one is surprised that they'll die. No one gets traumatized by their own death. We're desensitized to death, even by murder, because every single person has it happen.

Very many hentai games feature someone raping MC or MC raping someone. For example Violated Heroine.

***** On the other hand, it's much less likely that a reader was personally affected by murder than that they were personally affected by rape, either experiencing it, or helping someone through the aftermath. And if murder bothered you, you already wouldn't be a fan of the books, so people who can't stomach murder in fiction have already been selected out.
