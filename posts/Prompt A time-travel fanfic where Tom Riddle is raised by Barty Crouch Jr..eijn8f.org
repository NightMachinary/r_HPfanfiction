Barty's grandmother (or some other relative) told him Voldemort's real name (and his past) and he was distraught after his Lord's disappearance in Halloween 1981. Being the most loyal death eater, he steals a Time-Turner and goes back to Wool's orphanage in 1927 to adopt a certain Tom Marvolo Riddle.
