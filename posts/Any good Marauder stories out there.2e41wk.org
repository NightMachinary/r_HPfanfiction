It doesn't have to be from any particular character's perspective but it would be great if it would focus more on such events as the creation of the Map or the Animagus transformation, rather than the romance between Lily and James. Stories which describe the events immediately before/after Voldemort killed the Potters are also fine.

Also it would be nice if they were completed. There was this James Potter chronicles one on fanfiction.net but the author hasn't updated in a long time.

*** Seconding this.

For what it's worth, there were rumors of a sequel in the works (Harry returns to Hogwarts after being raised by them). I don't know its status though.
