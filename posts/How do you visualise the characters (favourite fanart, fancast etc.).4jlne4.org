** Let's see... Well, firstly, DanRad is a pretty decent Harry in my book. He's pretty much my mental image with darker hair and green eyes.

Hermione my usual fancast for her is Kimberly Elise - a decent looking girl with big, natural hair, though with buckteeth in the first few years, obviously.

Ron I generally imagine as thinner, taller and lankier than Grint, with freckles across his face and a pointy chin, a square face. Percy I imagine as similar, and then Charlie, Fred and George I think of as having much shorter, stouter frames. The Weasleys share the freckles, but Fred and George have big muscled arms, and Charlie is muscled and scarred over.

I have an issue with Bill in the films, though. I definitely think the actor could have been great, but not with his sallow-white skin, terrible hair and generally gross face in DH: Bill is supposed to be cool-looking and handsome, which Domhnall Gleeson is completely capable of, but for some reason didn't embrace during the films.

I loved Mark Williams and Julie Walters as Arthur and Molly, though - and Ginny... Well. I generally imagine her as a pretty girl with a heart-shaped face and long, flowing hair. Bonnie Wright definitely isn't the mental image I have for her.

Snape I imagine much younger. I generally embrace Louis Garrel or Adrien Brody as ideal fancasts - Alan Rickman was a fantastic actor and I adored his portrayal of the character, but he was straight up too old. Same for Gary Oldman - a very attractive, talented actor, but... Good lord. Sirius was meant to be like, thirty. Gaz did NOT look thirty in the films.

Lucius I generally imagine as pale and broad-shouldered, with a square jaw; Narcissa and Draco I think of with the same complexion, but more slender bodies and softer features, with less definition of the jaw and cheek bones. I definitely embrace Lucius' long, straight hair, though.

With casting, though, Richard Harris and Warwick Davies in the first two films are the best for me. Flitwick with all his big hair is fabulous to me - I don't know what the Hell they were thinking with the tux and the ugly little moustache in the later movies.

** I used to have a different interpretation of Harry, Hermione, and Ron before the movies came out, but these days I pretty much end up visualising Dan, Rupert, and Emma as the Hogwarts-era trio no matter what I try otherwise. Any fancasting/visualisation I have is generally for a much older trio, around the age that they are in the Epilogue:

Harry: Somewhere between [[https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393607897303/Adrien-Brody-Roman-Polans-011.jpg][Adrien Brody]] and [[http://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/2014/04/14/956/n/1922398/b86ec0b24aa6a4f3_145548805.xxxlarge_2x/i/Jon-Hamm-Larry-Decker.jpg][Jon Hamm]], though I tend to err on the side of Hamm because he and Radcliffe played the same character in A Young Doctor's Notebook. I'd imagine these two are bit Hollywood attractive for the Harry, but Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are all significantly better looking than how I originally imagined the trio as well.

Ron: Either [[http://www.trbimg.com/img-5515f3ef/turbine/la-et-st-damian-lewis-pbs-wolf-hall-conversation-20150329][Damian Lewis]], or a longshot [[http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2015/09/michael_fassbender_2_-_h_2015.jpg][Michael Fassbender]]. Oddly, I also feel Domnhall Gleeson is a better fit for a late twenty-something Ron than he was for Bill.

Hermione: Definitely [[http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/18000000/Rachel-W-3-rachel-weisz-18059366-452-300.jpg][Rachel Weisz]]. She /is/ adult Hermione to me; if I were in charge of casting for a Cursed Child movie and they wanted to cast someone else for all the characters, this would be the one choice I'd fight for.

Ginny: Gin's a lot tougher because I actually don't know many redheaded actresses in the proper age range. In fact, the only one I'm super familiar with, due to her role in Mad Men, is Christina Hendricks, and she is most definitely not how I picture Ginny. If I were to guess, possibly [[http://science-all.com/images/isla-fisher/isla-fisher-03.jpg][Isla Fisher]], but I don't think she's a great fit, either.

** Dumbledore = Stephen Fry; tall, kind-voiced but can rouse a terrible temper. He even has a broken nose.

Snape = Tim Roth; more skeevy and spiteful-seeming, and 15 years younger than Alan Rickman

Hermione = Anna Poppelwell; the right age and has thick brown hair, with appropriately large front teeth but who shines as a discovered beauty when she grows older

Harry - Dan was good, James McAvoy could have been great but was too old for the role when cast

Voldemort = Hugo Weaving

Sirius = I'm a fan of Oldman and felt he did great with what the scripts and directors allowed for him. The only reason I'd replace him is for a better match for the character's age; maybe Rufus Sewell or Clive Owen

Remus Lupin = Paul Bettany, again mostly to adjust for age as I liked David Thewlis' performance; then again, Remus faded into the background of exposition for the later books. If Bettany was Lupin, they might have been more tempted to include the DH argument between him and Harry over abandoning Tonks

Bill Weasley = special appearance by Ewan MacGregor

Fleur Delacour = Keira Knightley

Quirinus Quirrel = Hugh Grant; he already has the stuttering down...

Minerva McGonagall = Helen Mirren or Charlotte Rampling or Emma Thomson - Emma did great as Trelawney but she could easily have brought more life to the role of McGonagall (while acting like a younger version of Maggie Smith)

*** I disagree about Voldemort, if only due to personal preference.

Instead, I would cast Doug Jones, who fits the "tall (6'4"), pale, skinny, and odd-looking" physique of the monstrous Voldemort of Harry's time.

Jones is American actor and former contortionist known for roles in the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres, often wearing heavy makeup to play nonhuman characters. He's also the "go-to" guy when you have a role that fits that criteria, and who you want to act out the role of a "monster", which makes him perfect for the role of Lord Voldemort.

His previous roles include:

- Billy Butcherson (zombie) in /Hocus Pocus/

- Abe Sapien (mutant) in /Hellboy/ and /Hellboy 2: The Golden Army/

- Angel of Death and the Chamberlain in /Hellboy 2: The Golden Army/

- The Faun / The Pale Man (monster) in /Pan's Labyrinth/

- The Silver Surfer in /Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer/

- The Operator (Slenderman) in /Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story/

- Edith's Mother / Lady Sharpe in /Crimson Peak/

- Frankenstein in del Toro's /Frankenstein/ (upcoming)

- Dr. Henry Vataber in /Universal Dead/ (upcoming)

Likewise, he also sometimes works closely with director Guillermo del Toro, who was once originally tapped as a possible director for /Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/.

#+begin_quote
  Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film "so bright and happy and full of light, that [he] wasn't interested". [[http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/][(Source)]]

** Anne Hathaway would make a decent Hermione (without the glasses though): [[http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/files/2014/10/gimme19_PH_princess.jpg]]

She's really close to Hermione's true age (81 vs 79), and has a passable British accent. Her roles in Les Miserables, Dark Knight Rises, and Interstellar show she can act, too.

** For some reason I have a very hard time visualizing the main characters as taller/more physically mature as they age. Since many stories start off in 1st year, my brain seems to get used to that image, and I have a hard time adjusting when I realize they're supposed to be tall and lanky now.

It's odd because I have a slightly different mental image of Hogwarts, especially the Great Hall, every time I read a story, and it just happens automatically, like my brain has an infinite supply of subtle permutations.
