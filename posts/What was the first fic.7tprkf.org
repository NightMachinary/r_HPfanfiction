A few questions here. I realized I never really stepped out of my favorite trope to explore all Harry Potter fanfictions. I simply stayed within what I really really liked. Which was any form of Snape-Adopts-Harry, Snape-Mentors-harry (My favoritest), and of course Severitus. But being in this forum I've begun to read alot of others people have recommended to others. And it's opened my eyes to different but equally as awesome fanfics.

So what is your favorite trope? What was the first time you ever stepped out of it?


** My favorite tropes are Regulus is alive, Percy did espionage work, Draco redemption fics.

Huh. I just realized I like stories that involving characters growing for there mistakes. I guess the appeal to me is the fact those fics involves a person climbing from hardship even though they were perceived as wrong or was wrong.

I recall my first tropes I got out of were the Drarry and Dramione ships. They are not bad fics, but I think I grew out of the phase where opposites attractions were all there are. I now like fics where a characters can grow on their own and find their strengths themselves.

** I never really explored other pairings than the ones I started with (mainly, Hermione/older, darker guy - Snape, Lucius, Tom Riddle Jr/Voldemort), but what I search for has evolved a lot. I used to have no issues with student teacher relationships for example, but now I find that I'm a bit repulsed by those fics, not because of the student-teacher bit, but because Hermione is 17-18 or 19 at best (time turner/8th year). I'm only 22 now, but when I think of myself at 17 it feels so far away, I can't imagine any adult in their right mind finding anything interesting in a 17 years old. Even if it's Hermione, even if she's soooo mature... Yuck. Especially when she turns 17 and the guy suddenly notices she's all grown up now... Yuck yuck yuck. So I try to look for fics where she's older, either post-war or AU where the war didn't end in 1998. Or time turner fics, sometimes. I still read some fics where she's younger when I can't find anything else, but some parts tend to make me cringe a lot. If it keeps going on like that, I imagine in a few years I won't be able to read anything where she's younger that 22 haha.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
