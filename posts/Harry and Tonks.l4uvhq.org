I'm not usually a huge HP/NT person but I recently read a very good one and I'm a big fan now. If anyone has any fics they would recommend that would be great.

Im fine with any and all kinds of fics. I'd prefer them to have a plot of they're going to be smutty/lemony. Also I'd like them to have a decent plot in general. They're relationship can be the main focus but I'd prefer it to be around a story as well.

  After a harsh rejection from Remus. Tonks finds herself crying the night away in #12 only for the least likely someone to come along and show her a great kindness. Rated M for Sexual Situations mainly. This is a Honks story so make sure you really want to see it. Minor Ron bashing. Takes place summer before 5th year. One Shot.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** I've seen harry potter and the metamorphmagus mentioned a few times and I'll second that if you haven't read it already. I went on a harry/tonks kick a couple of months ago, and it was by far the best. There is a lot of smut, but also a really fun plot and great character development for harry and tonks. There's even some pretty interesting conversation on the topic of sexual liberation woven into some of the smutty scenes. It's just really well done. I shan't link it here, because several others have already.
