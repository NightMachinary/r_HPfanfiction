I have been reading a few fics lately where harry is forced to go to hogwarts against his will, and i am severely tired of him always caving to them immediately, so are there any fics where harry refuses to do classwork, doesn't give a crap about points or detentions, is sarcastic and curses at the teachers/pupils? (Love a harry that doesnt take crap and cave, and just badmouths and is antagonistic towards everyone thats forcing him there)


** This fits pretty well. The only problem is it's a one shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/124/Odd-Ideas][Odd Ideas]]

It's a series of one shots, the one I'm talking about is My India, chapter 124.

Harry grows up in India. He doesn't want to go to the UK.

**** I'd like some more chapters, but I'm not sure how far you can push a story that's based around the idea that Harry doesn't want to be in Hogwarts/the UK.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.
