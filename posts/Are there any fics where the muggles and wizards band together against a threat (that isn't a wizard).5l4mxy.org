I'm curious, I've never seen one.


** Me neither.

I would be very interested in some "The War of the Worlds" like story where wizards decide that the defense of Earth is more important than the Statute.

** I'm also fascinated by this possibility. By the year 1992 (end of Philosopher's Stone, start of Chamber of Secrets) the Statute would have been in place for 300 years. Its third century would be a fine time for it to be lifted.

Heh, you know that thing in Iron Man Armored Adventures where gathering all 10 of the Makluan Rings drew the attention of the Maklaun Empire to Earth?

Maybe the destruction of the Philosopher's Stone, extraordinary transmutation artifact that it is, causes a unique energy signature to ripple out from Earth, drawing the attention of aliens from another planet...or another dimension.

** Yes!!! I've seen one where they band together against cyborgs. I think it was a Next Gen Star Trek or Babylon 5 crossover set post-series.

I'm pretty sure it's a full scale invasion style story but I wouldn't say with 100% confidence how obvious the non magical presence was.

I'm on my phone atm but I'll remind myself to search for it tomorrow when I'm on my pc.

*** I can't find it :(

This is the closest I found, but it's... not quite what you're asking for, in terms of banding together since it's an alternate reality. But it mixes magic with a 19th-C militaristic feel; I'm pretty sure it's a crossover for a fandom I have no idea about.

  Harry found the boy by falling on him. He remembers the blood. Professor McGonagall recognized the boy, even with Harry next to him. His presence would change the future more than anyone could imagine. A completed story.

** A handful of Mass Effect crossovers. They generally explain it as the Muggles are losing the fight against the Turians in the first contact war and the Wizards join in to help or something similar. But that's never a major part of the story, usually it's just backstory mentioned at the very start.

** There's at least one story out there where muggles and wizards leave Earth because the ecological damage destroyed it. I think they settled on a planet and inhabited an underground cave system.

  Unable to handle another devastating war the Wizarding communities from around the world pull together and enlist the aid of the Muggleborn's families to launch themselves into space. Settling on a new planet is harder then it seems, especially when they find they are not the only ones wanting to claim it as their own

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) is long and well written. Muggles and wizards band together after the 4th year iirc. It isn't a major theme though

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

** It's mostly seen in fics where there's been an extinction-type of event. However it is mostly touched on in the first one or two chapters as a way of explaining what Harry and company tried before going to another world. I have seen this in various Warcraft and Game of Thrones crossovers.

From the description there seems to be some Avengers crossovers which suggest that there are cooperation between muggles and wizardkind, but I've never read any of them. But then again, those aren't really muggles, but instead the Avengers type of muggles (advanced science, super heroes etc).
