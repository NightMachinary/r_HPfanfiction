I think it was either FemBlaise, Daphne, or Pansy and this POV showed her bitchy nature or something and this person was dating Harry at the time? It was also somewhat funny.

Sorry I don't remember much.

  No one ever said being Harry Potter's girlfriend was going to be easy, but after 7 months at it one sly Slytherin thought she'd mastered it... that was until she was forced to explain their relationship to the inquiring minds of the Order.
