Lily Luna uses polyjuice to impersonate her mother and get money from the family vault and finds out that Ginny and Bill have been having an incestuous sadomasochistic relationship when her uncle rapes her-as-Ginny in their Gringotts vault.

  The Polyjuice would last one hour, enough for Lily to get into Gringotts and out again with 50 Galleons borrowed from her parents' vault.She didn't know that Uncle Bill had other plans for her.

#+end_quote

I don't think so, but I didn't actually read it so I'm not 100% sure. I kind of feel like you're either not understanding me or are pretending you don't. It's not a story that's meant to realistically portray the sexual activities of the older students. It's Harry and Luna having sex with preteen girls and it, and they, have a blatant pedophile fetish for young girls.

This means its content in term of who is involved is not all that out there in comparison, but the purpose and actual content of the story is very weird.

#+begin_quote
  What site?
#+end_quote

I don't remember. Like I said, it's a pedophilic fetish story and I don't want to read it, so I was only there for a couple minutes. If I had to give a guess, probably Ao3.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone who has a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be the hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

  A Corruption of Harry Potter Fic,I plan to follow our 'hero' from age 10 (the year before Hogwarts) through to the end of book 7.Harry's always been kind of a bitch in the books, so why not step it up?Not dark. No Gore/Vore/Scat - ever.Some characters are underage, the situation is fucked up, and all-in-all I probably shouldn't have wrote this,but here it is, and don't tell anyone where you found it >.>Come see Harry's journey to cock-hungry boy-slut.

#+begin_quote
  After Vernon dies from a heart-attack when Harry is four, his Aunt Petunia reveals the truth; Vernon had been abusive since Harry first stayed with them, and had groomed his son into a mini-me; another abusive male -- as a result, Petunia drops him off at Vernon's sister as soon as the divorce papers are filed. She tells Harry about the magical world, before they move to the Lake District, buying a house with the Potter Family Funds, and begin a life that slowly devolves -- or evolves, depending on who you ask -- into little more than sexual acts and debauchery. Slow updates! Just to be sure: I do not condone any of the acts in this fic in real life. I do condone incest, actually, because to me it's the same as gay and lesbian relationships; if you genuinely love your brother/sister/mother/father/daughter/son/etc. in a more-than-familial way, and they do the same, go for it. Just don't make babies, because they'll be genetically defect.

#+begin_quote
  Rose Potter had a twisted mind. She was not aware of her abnormality, and as such could not tell you when or how it happened. Rose was, simply put, a slut. A raging nymphomaniac, from a young age she found herself yearning for sex. Boys, girls, men and women, when approached about it she claimed she was just an early bloomer. Her obsession was made even worse by perusing the internet on her cousin Dudley's computer. BDSM, Bestiality, Hardcore, Gangbangs, Creampies, the wonderful world of porn expanded young Rose's mind far further than her original vanilla perversion. She remained a virgin till her Eleventh birthday, even if she couldn't remember the amount of times she'd rubbed herself raw or fucked herself into a stupor. So, when Rose first laid eyes on Rubeus Hagrid, the Groundskeeper, she wasn't even remotely surprised that all she could think about was how fat his ginormous, throbbing cock must be. After learning about the hidden magical world from the friendly giant, her mind couldn't move past all the witches, wizards, goblins, giants, Spiders, Dragons and More! She couldn't wait to be bent over and taken by them again and again. She was going to love the Magical World.

I also remember reading a smutfic on AoE3 that was Harry/Tonks/Lily(mom)/Alice Longbottom. A pity I lost it when my Kindle browser messed itself up. I never put it on my fic list.

  Voldemort can learn from his mistakes and incidentally ensures Love will end the war. Just... not the way Dumbledore had expected. Harry, naturally, doesn't get any choice.

** The only one that sticks out in my mind was a version of Video Game plot where Harry discovered 11yo Hermione, her twin 6yo-ish sisters and their parents were nudists and sexually involved. part of th video game was choosing who was having sex with whom and decided that the father was raping Hermione while the mother had a consensual relationship with Harry and the twins. iirc one of the twins also had their nipples pierced, which was stolen from Black Queen.

I got that story removed from ffnet. You're free to write pedophile fantasies but you're not free to post them on ffnet, sorry.

The only other email the administration responded to out of at least several dozen had to do with the Black Queen series. They decided that since it was presented as objectively evil and didn't descend into pedo porn for the sake of being pedo porn, that they weren't concerned about it. I wasn't either but the fact it's nearly on the front page and therefore representative of our fandom.

There are quite a few other popular (and unpopular) stories that include preteens having sex presented as PWP but the vast majority aren't fetishizing their age, just too fucking stupid to realize first year means age 11, and next to none include adults in those relationships. There are far more stories fetishizing rape, child abuse, and bloodplay--all of which are far more dangerous to normalize with proper safety guards--than there are ignorant accidental underage sex.

Beyond that, yeah sure there's some crack and intentionally disgusting stuff like rape by giants and werewolves, and some taboo stuff like incest and bestiality. All that's way beyond the rules along with smut in general but writing PWP about grooming and raping prepubescents just grinds my gears and doesn't deserve to share a home with our fandoms biggest and best works.
