  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Seems like a straight retelling of canon would be kinda... dull.

But I second What's Her Name in Hufflepuff as being kinda close.

  Alexander Dantes was a mere child, eager to learn magic, but he was a muggle-born and he knew not what that meant. But after his first night in Hogwarts he learned, and now this new world would suffer the consequences. Join him as he enacts his revenge, learns the secrets of magic, and fights for his very survival. Covers Years 1-7, Canon Compliant. MATURE! PART ONE! COMPLETE!
