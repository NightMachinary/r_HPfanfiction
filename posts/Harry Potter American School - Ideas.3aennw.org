What do you think the HP Wizarding school of America is like/where in this region would it be located?


** From the point of view of someone who spends more time DMing than reading Pottermore... Assuming you're looking or willing to create it from whole cloth, there are a lot of other important questions bundled up with that.

How was Magical America settled? Muggleborns may have made the trip with their parents not knowing they were magical. Squibs may have fled to the colonies to start over as far from the families that found them to be embarrassing as possible. Did those settlers carry a grudge against the old British purebloods that shaped their society?

Or, given that the colonization of America only just barely predates the statute of secrecy, but the Declaration of Independence /doesn't/ it's possible that Magical and Muggle society look nothing alike and American wizards and witches are all still British citizens and send their kids to Hogwarts. Or did they instead get folded into the already thriving Native American magical cultures? Is Magical America even a cohesive country? or does it's political map still look like the colonies did at the signing of the statute? with France and Spain and the Natives each holding onto pieces of it?

Sorry for the rather rambling response, but that's what my mind immediately spewed forth upon reading your question. Also... Salem, Ma. But only /AFTER/ the witch trials, because it amused the founders of the school to thumb their noses at the silly muggles. Or maybe the trials were sparked by a prank gone wrong by a group like the twins back in the day. Or perhaps a prank gone right?

** Here's my take on American magical schooling, based more on my own musings than anything else.

Firstly, there's more than one school in the US. If you figure that 1/4 of 1% of the population in the UK is in someway capable of magic, that'd still be the rather high figure of 152500 souls. If you use that same figure for the US, it's 797500, almost a million people. Even if you eliminate a chunk as non-school age, that's a LOT of wizarding going on.

So, my theory is, there's probably a solid dozen or so schools, but my take is that it's differentiated between lower and higher learning. Hogwarts is a boarding school that covers pretty much the entirety of a person's education, middle school through college, focused like a vocational degree. I'm guessing there's hundreds of what amount to High Schools across the US, where an American Magician can get the basics of their education, and choose to attend one of the bigger schools as post-secondary, where the schools focus on specific programs.

Second, It appears as though Hogwarts sort of encouraged the students towards a 'Hyper focus' of sorts. (I want to be an Auror, I NEED these classes. In turn, these classes pretty much teach the same thing over and over for rote mastery) and in counter, I feel like American schools teach a greater breadth of things at the cost of depth.

In simple, a British student's Expelliarmus is probably better than an American's, but that American probably has a dozen more spells in their bag that the British student has never seen, or experienced.

Third, I believe that American schools probably have a considerably larger curriculum devoted to muggle studies (Science, Math, etc) as a way to further their studies in an all-encompassing way. Wizard world jobs can't be hiring that aggressively after all.

Fourth, the amount of Half blood and Muggle blood students is probably considerably higher, based on immigration and the like. The 1920's probably saw a massive influx of magically blooded people.

Fifth, instead of a Ministry of Magic, we most likely have a Department of (something magical, I think Thaumaturgy has a ring to it) headed by a Secretary thereof.

Sixth, If I were going to place the college level schools, I'd put them in these places...

Salem Massachusetts

Georgetown Maryland

Stone Mountain Georgia

Baton Rouge Louisiana

Houston Texas

Chandler Arizona

Santa Catalina Island California

Eureka California

Eugene Oregon

Burlington Washington

Aurora Illinois

Lebanon Kansas (Center of the US)

Placing them near, but not in, large population centers would make the most sense, and hugging the coast seems a very Manifest Destiny thing to do. (I'm American, I can say that, LOL)

So, that's my take. Opinions?

I always thought that would make a good plot bunny.

But otherwise, I'd like to think that there's a franchise system - almost like Macdonalds - so you've got a privately-funded organisation of tutors spread across the continent.

Maybe an 'old' boarding school or two for the prodigies and trust fund babies, and apprenticeships run predominantly by Native wizards and witches.

** It's My Life by Fyreheart has a school located in the Midwest, Stillwater, Minnesota to be exact, which is a real town founded in 1837 as a logging town by settlers. Minnesota had a fair number of indian tribes at that time and was largely settled by Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish and German immigrants. The Midwest in general is a good choice for placement for two reasons:

First the large amount of European settlers who were mainly lower, working class (maybe including disenfranchised muggleborns, 2nd or 3rd sons with no chance of an inheritance, squibs, etc as you suggested).

Second the East Coast was rapidly populated, but the Midwest was very sparsely inhabited, with small clusters of settlers of one ethnicity. Today there are many huge areas of wilderness and forest across the Midwest where it would be easy for a wizard school/society to reside, similar to Hogwarts' placement in Scotland.

** There are two segments of magical society in America: the United States, which has its capital in Philadelphia and its school in Salem; and Lecv Ekvnlike, which is centered in Oklahoma. (Sort of.) In domestic affairs, Lecv Ekvnlike is by far the superior. However, Lecv Ekvnlike is fiercely isolationist, so the US has appreciably more renown.

Lecv Ekvnlike is the result of a federation between the Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee, and Chickasaw, formed in reaction to European invaders. The Muscogee spearheaded the federation. It proved ineffectual at first; they could barely check the oncoming plagues, and the alliance was too sparse and had too much territory to cover, so in terms of defense, it was a failure. But there was one way it could, and did, succeed. Evacuation.

Take a plot of land thirty miles in radius. Copy it in another dimension. Hide the doorway. This is how Lecv Ekvnlike started. It's an enclosed ecosystem -- no sun, no water cycle, nothing. At least the edge is solid rather than, say, nothingness that you can fall off into, or a field that destroys anything that passes into it, or...

They had to create a world from nothing. And they made it happen. Over the next few years, they stuffed a couple thousand people into it. And then they kept going. They set up permanent air-freshening enchantments. They created a river with conjured water and created a sink that vanished it where it would have left the enclosure. They planted crops, built houses, moved fish into their river, created a false sun, set up a whole town. Eventually they expanded the area.

This was quite magic-intensive, so they constantly searched for people with the talent. At first they had an informal apprenticeship program. They drew children from leagues away. Eventually, as Europeans fought their way west, they expanded their search, rescuing people but prioritizing those who would be useful. At first this included a wide variety of professions and skills, but as time went on, they restricted their search to what could easily be identified: magical ability.

During this period, European American magic was dominated by hedge wizardry. Homeschooling, spotty education, and very limited knowledge of local magical flora and fauna. But the settlers did maintain contact with each other, and they joined in the Manifest Destiny ideals. They moved west -- and by sheer luck, they stumbled on Lecv Ekvnlike. The resulting skirmish was a decisive victory for Lecv Ekvnlike, and they drove the settlers back over the Appalachians.

Lecv Ekvnlike only grew from there. They established themselves as the sole owners of magic in most of the Americas, inducting everyone with the ability into their society or binding their magic. They've grown to nearly a hundred thousand people (the majority of which are at least passive mages, what the British call "squibs") and their world encompasses hundreds of square miles. They are preeminent enchanters and are adept at conjuration and space alteration.

--------------

Lecv Ekvnlike is pronounced "lichuh ikunleki" (/lɪtʃə ɪkənlɛkɪ/ in the International Phonetic Alphabet) and is Mvskoke (Creek) for "under the mound". Mvskoke is the primary language, the language of instruction, and the language of government, though most people are bilingual speakers of English.

Schooling in Lecv Ekvnlike started as an extension of the apprenticeship system. If you have a skill, you are expected to spend some of your time teaching. If you wish to learn a skill, you are expected to find someone who is close enough to your skill level that you're not wasting their time. The greatest enchanter of the land won't teach a ten-year-old, but she does teach people some of the time. However, in recent years, some people have devoted more of their time to teaching than to production. They are still viewed as valuable members of society.

There is a dedicated school area along with student housing. Advanced instruction typically happens in the teacher's workshop, but for basic instruction, teachers go to the students in classrooms warded to absorb stray spells. The school is near the hospital zone, a fact that has proved useful all too often. The classrooms are typically one to a building with plenty of grass and greenery between.

The topics of instruction include anything anyone thinks is useful, but a normal education, on the magical side, will have a student learn basic charms, transfiguration, and transportation. History and civic studies are mandatory. If you do not complete a course on contemporary non-magical society, you are not allowed to leave Lecv Ekvnlike unattended, so most people take that course. A typical student will spend a few months at each of a variety of jobs and eventually pursue one or two of them. Often they will engage in an extended apprenticeship with one of their teachers.

A graduate is expected to be able to expand a plot of land from a postage stamp to what they need to live on, design and build their house, butcher a hog, raise a kneazle, mend a broken bone, solve equations, till and fertilize a field, prepare a meal, debate law, and write a book. Specialization is for Europeans.
