** Yeah probably, just my opinion but it hasn't aged well. I remember being hooked onto it when it was being written years ago. Revisited it recently and doesn't feel all that good anymore.

*** I think this is more about the reader as an individual than the fic itself. The tropes Cadmean Victory deployed were already a decade old at the time it was written, and despite the author's protestations, he really did very little to "subvert" or vary them.

But I can see how a reader new to the fandom, unfamiliar with those tropes, would find the fic engaging. It's certainly better written, from a technical stand point, than many of the fics which preceded it and used the same tropes.

**** This probably sums my thoughts up, thank you. To make myself more clear, for a reader new to fanfiction or even someone reading the story for the first time, it's a good read. To give credit where it's due, the author's writing is decent, grammar isn't shabby and the effort put into the entire story to complete it is commendable.

The cons for me were how OP Harry became in a relatively short span of time, some of the angst and some interactions with his old friends. On the whole, it's a decent story, which is why I think it's worth reading at least once.

*** It had some plot twists, right? It probably wouldn't be as interesting to read again if you remember the plot.
