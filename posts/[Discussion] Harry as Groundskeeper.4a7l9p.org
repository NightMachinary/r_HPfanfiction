Hey guys! I was thinking of writing a fic where Harry winds up expelled over the Dragon incident in Book 1, and starts working as a junior groundskeeper for Hagrid. I want to focus on the Magical Creature side of the Wizarding world, since it seems so many stories have already focused on the political side.


** I really like this idea. Especially because it could give a little introduction to this side of the magical world even before 'Fantastic Creatures'.

Just two thoughts that came spontaneously: - A LOT of the magical creatures are flying. Harry would probably be better suited to care for them, than Hagrid is right now. - If you came to the third year Hagrid would probably not fail that much as a teacher if Harry prompted him.
