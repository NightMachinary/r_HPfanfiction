So, I'm looking for fics where Harry meets a Muggle family, finds out one of their kids is magical, then mentors them all through the Wizarding World (sort of a more-involved version of what Hagrid was to him: takes them to diagon alley, gives them some info, shows them some ropes, etc). Can be a short one/two-off thing, or a long one where he's present in their lives through the whole journey. I just want to see him help some people find their feet like that.

Like the girl in Picnic Panic or Dudley's kid in any of the 'Dudley's kid is magical' fics that are about. I remember another where Harry meets a family by accident (I think the kid wanders in to the pub that their parents can't see and Harry helps the kid find his family again) and essentially has to convince them to be willing to take their child into the wizarding world, but I don't remember the title. It's basically the sort of thing I'm looking for though.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Something of the sort happens in this chapter. Harry and Hermione guide a family from Little Whinging through their first day in the Wizarding World.

Enjoy.

**** You are welcome. I really like how Hermione gets revenge at Harry's behalf without him being any wiser.

** There's one that centers around Dudley's daughter and Harry does show up pretty frequently because Dudley obviously has no clue how things work in the wizarding world. As a fan of lengthier stories- I enjoyed this one because the characters felt reasonably well developed and had original strengths and limitations!

I hope this is how the bot actually works:

*** Yeah, the first chapter certainly looks interesting - and it is a good concept. Thanks for the rec! I look forward to reading that character development for myself. :)

**** It is a series of seven novels and IMHO the best Dudley-has-a-daughter-witch ever (why it is never Dudley's son who would be a wizard, but always a daughter?).

***** I mean, there's the stereotype of more females writing fanfiction and the weird thing of people tending to write characters of their own gender more often (I find it far more interesting to write and read people who aren't overly like me - I've been me for 23 years, I've never been them, so it's interesting to try relate to that).

Perhaps also the wider trope of Father-Daughter bonding that seems to be in vogue at the moment - the Last of Us sort of dynamic has been more present in my experience than any kind of Father-Son bonding tropes, but that might just be my taste in stories.

Could also be a perception that Dudley's son would turn out more like Dudley (and thus Vernon) where his daughter would turn out more like her mother (and thus not one of the people who abused Harry).

In short, I have no idea - but there's a lot of possibilities. :D

** There is... Of Broomsticks and Blackboards, or something like that, on AO3. It hasn't been updated in a while but it's a good story so far

Oh, that has muggleborn-mentoring in? I thought it was just another 'post-war harry teaches after he gets tired of fighting' fic.

**** I may be mistaken but I'm pretty certain he mentors a muggleborn whos struggling to find his feet on the magical world. Pretty solid story too.
