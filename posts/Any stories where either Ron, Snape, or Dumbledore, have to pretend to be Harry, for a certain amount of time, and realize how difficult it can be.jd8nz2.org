Anyone can be the main character, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed, or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like, but doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

Am fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.


** I read one like that with Harry talking Dumbledore into taking his place at the Dursleys. It was in a collection of one-shots, so it would be tedious to find. (Doesn't mean I won't look, but it's not going to be a priority for me).

  After a disastrous fifth-year Potions class with Potter, Severus discovers that Potter is being tortured by Umbridge. With Dumbledore evicted from Hogwarts, there's little Severus can do to keep his oath to protect Potter. That is, until Severus is given the troubling news that Umbridge has given Potter another detention, thus compelling him to take Potter's place.

  Betad by Eider Down.Severus remembered dying, bleeding out, his consciousness barely there. He remembered pain. He remembered his one last look into those green eyes, doomed as they were to join him soon in death. His heart ached, as his neck ached, as his body ached.He greeted death as a friend.Severus didn't expect to wake up. It was rather disconcerting, really. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like. Which is to say, fucking awful.Hell would have been preferable, instead he's now back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. What should he do? Can he change events for the better? Whom can he trust?Meanwhile, there's something slightly...off about his cousin Dudley. Only time will tell, but at least that's something he has plenty of now.Severus is about to find out why they say you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.
