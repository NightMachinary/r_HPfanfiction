Tell me your favorite longest fics. I prefer the most "mature" rating possible, because I don't like any kind of censorship, and that's what I imagine with teen-rated fics, so just keep that in mind.

No slash and no bashing of Dumbledore.

Thank you.


** The best (and second longest) fic I ever read was Bullseye by Ohyeah100 on ff.net. It's an ongoing rewrite of the series from Astoria Greengrass's point of view. The timeline and events are the same, but Harry and the gang take a backseat and only pop in here and there, while Astoria deals with both real world and interhouse politics, family drama, societal expectations, gamblings with goblins, and now that Astoria is getting a bit older we're starting to see romance. It is amazingly written and even though it's pretty enormous (almost 600k last I checked), the plot never gets slow and truly is one of the best written fics I've ever read.

** I feel like I recommend it literally all the time, but Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie. Also Last Year by Canimal and His Little Bird series but the Wanders'WanderingDaughter. The latter is not for the faint of heart or anyone who triggers easily. It's easily the hardest to read fic I've ever encountered. If you're looking for something heart wrenching but not with smut, check out Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness by Thanfiction. It's about as sad as a fic can get. Links below.

Unfortunately I can't seem to find a copy of DAATYOD anywhere except a random google drive account, which I'm not about to trust. There's a lot of conspiracy surrounding that fic and the author, so he deleted a lot of his works.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Try this series:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens]]

One of my all-time favourites, it does a great job of mashing the whimsy of Harry Potter with some of the more mature themes found in Warhammer. Don't let the T rating fool you, it vascillates between comedy and life-or-death situations like a drunken spider.

It's also hilarious, so definitely recommended on that front.

Currently on book... Five, I believe.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Have you tried the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][Pureblood pretence]] series by Murkybluematter yet?

Neither slash nor a dumbledoor bash fic, The series is a fusion of sorts between the Harry Potter universe and Tamora Pierces' Song of the Lioness series.

Primarily following the life of a female harry, as she embarks upon her journey at Hogwarts, albeit in an AU were Voldemort decides to play the long game in taking over the wizarding world.

As such her parents are still alive, and she her self lives in a world were blood discrimination is alive and well, and as such only Pure-blood children are allowed to attend Hogwarts.

Harry, being half blood due to her mother, is barred from attending Hogwarts, and thus her dream of apprenticing under the world renown potion master, Professor Snape.

She, along with her Pure-Blooded Cousin, Rigel Black (borne to Sirius Black) concoct a plan to allow her to attend in Rigel's Place. Naturally, things only get more complicated from here.

Edit: Just thought I should mention that despite the T rating, It is not really a story for children, and will probably earn an M rating as the series progress.
