I don't want to mention the works by name as I don't want to cause someone to spam or attack the author when I may be looking to far into the situation. I will refer to the sorry that is years old as the first story and the newer one as the second.

Okay, so I was reading a new-ish SAO crossover over on AO3 and at the end of the first of two chapters it seemed like someone was using ideas from another story I had read. No big deal it's fanfiction and 100% new ideas are rare after all that I have read.

Then in the second chapter I noticed 2 other aspects that I have never seen outside the original story and they are moments that most of the story is entirely based around. I don't know if it could be considered stealing the story because the writing is not the same it just seems like they took the storyline another author created and decided to use it in their own work.

The stories are so similar that I felt uncomfortable reading the new one because I liked the original so much I have read it 3 times and that they hadn't even mentioned or given credit to the first story felt wrong. Not to mention the first story felt like it was much more well written.

How far does something have to go before a story should be considered plagiarized? (If a mod could let me know if it's okay I will post the First story's name and reference the parts that seem stolen to help with any debates this thread may cause.)

Edit: I don't think it breaks the rule to mention that Harry gains access to the Full dive system by pulling it from the trash after it's thrown away by the Dursleys, the blood wards save his life after being trapped inside the game, and he glitches out in game by dying and reforming repeatedly causing everyone with him to run away to avoid being caught up in his glitch. In the first story this is what the author basically focused the story around and all of it has happened in the first 2 chapters of the newer story.


** What you're describing sounds like it could be light plagiarism, but I think it's to uncertain to make a definite accusation. Any of the following possibilities may be true:

1. Both authors thought up the ideas independently. Especially since it's a crossover fic, it could easily be that the interaction of the two universes, sets of characters, and/or magic systems naturally push authors towards some of the same ideas. And those ideas might not seem as obvious to someone who is just reading the fics.
2. Both authors could have been inspired by something else. Maybe there's some other book/anime/movie/game/story that uses those ideas, and both authors independently decided to take the ideas from that source.
3. There was some prompt or challenge posted in some forum that you are not aware of that both stories were following.
4. The second author read the first story years ago, and honestly forgot that that was where the ideas originated.
5. The second author asked the first if they could use those ideas, and they received permission to use them freely without needing to give credit.
6. The second author decided to take some ideas from the first fic as inspiration, but is putting their own spin on them, and it's just not very apparent yet, because it's only the second chapter.

In the cases of numbers 5 and 6, the second author really should credit to the first, but it's mostly just a matter of good manners, not a legal obligation or rule violation. And in the case of 4, they probably would give credit if they were made aware of the issue.

The best thing to do, if you feel the need to do anything, is probably to tell the author of the first story about it. They're the only one who really has any potential reason to complain about this, and if they don't care, the entire thing becomes a non-issue.

** I abhor plagiarism, but I don't think I can give this one the full heave-ho. I don't know if just repeating the same plot points can be considered plagiarism, just look at how many indy!Harry fics follow the exact the same narrative. Hell, then you'd have to consider all of fanfiction is on shaky ground given that we're using someone else's characters and scenes.

There's a running theme in Warcraft/HP stories all starting Harry in the same zone as a tribute to the main fic in that section, but nobody is up in arms about that. Ultimately, I think unless its directly copy/pasted or only given minor changes, it's not worth breaking out the pitchforks. Now, if the fic continues and every single chapter hits the same plot points in the same order with the same pacing, then there might be an argument.

** The edit with the possibly plagiarized ideas wasn't there when I wrote my first comment. So I'll address the specific details now.

#+begin_quote
  Harry gains access to the Full dive system by pulling it from the trash after it's thrown away by the Dursleys
#+end_quote

Harry kicking off a plot by retrieving some important item that the Dursleys threw away is not a unique idea. And at least in this case, it seems like the easiest and most logical way to get the system into Harry's hands.

#+begin_quote
  the blood wards save his life after being trapped inside the game
#+end_quote

I believe that the blood wards in canon are supposed to only protect from Voldemort-related threats, but expanding them to protect from other lethal threats is a pretty small and logical change, and is also not a unique idea.

And since the most basic premise of SAO is that dieing in the game kills you in real life, and since Harry has a convenient way to stay alive available, it's not surprising that multiple stories would have those ideas overlap.

#+begin_quote
  and he glitches out in game by dying and reforming repeatedly causing everyone with him to run away to avoid being caught up in his glitch.
#+end_quote

That sounds like it could be a logical consequence of the previous point.

Either or both authors could easily have been inspired by something else here too. The idea of someone who can't die painfully and disastrously trying to die [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityHurts][isn't exactly a new or unique one]].

#+begin_quote
  In the first story this is what the author basically focused the story around and all of it has happened in the first 2 chapters of the newer story.
#+end_quote

And that makes it sound like even if the second author was aware of and taking ideas from the first fic, their intention is probably to explore the consequences of those ideas, not to retell the same story.

Yes, they still should give credit if they did intentionally take those ideas from the first fic, but it really doesn't sound like a major problem in this case.

** It may not be plagiarism at all. If the author has read a huge amount of fanfiction, it's entirely possible that they are "borrowing" from other stories, without realising it.

*** I know, I was trying to avoid breaking rule 9 of the subreddit. I don't think it breaks the rule to mention that Harry gains access to the Full dive system by pulling it from the trash after it's thrown away by the Dursleys, the blood wards save his life after being trapped inside the game, and he glitches out in game by dying and reforming repeatedly causing everyone with him to run away to avoid being caught up in his glitch.

** Once I read a story with half a very memorable paragraph lifted directly from a story on another site with a few words altered to fit their scene. I was so upset because I loved both authors, so I messaged the author politely asking if they'd read (Story) by (Author), because it sounded from (lifted lines) as though they had.

The author was so nice and embarrassed and said they had but they hadn't meant to copy it and immediately went and reworded the scene. This author said, and I think it's likely, that they read so much that sometimes you get confused with things you've thought up and things you've read somewhere. I imagine that's true, and the plagiarism might be unintentional in this case!

** Hmmm, AO3 has a function for "inspired by" links. I would think that at least mentioning the original source of your idea would be the polite (and honest) thing to do, especially for unique story elements. Plus it might get both of you more readers through cross-pollination.

There are at least two stories that I have specifically noted, where I like the overall story idea but think the actual writing is... well, let's go with "I think I could do better." I've toyed with the idea of doing just that, but a straight rewrite, in my opinion, should have the permission of the original author and I can't think of a nice way to say "great idea but your writing isn't up to my standards; mind if I have a go?"

That said, I've read literally hundreds of fics over the last 15+ years, with at least two hard drive crashes that lost my saved fics. It's quite possible that there are elements I might include in a story, with absolutely no idea which story or author I originally got them from---I might possibly even think it was something I came up with on my own, if it's been long enough, or I might think it's a common trope that doesn't need a shout-out. Or maybe I never read a story, but a friend mentioned reading a story in which thus-and-so happens. Give the writer the benefit of the doubt, that a similar thing may have happened to them.

What I might do is post a MILDLY-WORDED review on new story that says this reminds you of old story, ask if they were inspired by that work, and that you look forward to seeing how they handle the situation differently from old story.

*** I did post a review citing some of the parts that seemed copied and they did in fact mention using that authors story as a... base I guess. The original author disappeared and abandoned the story about 3 years ago, they said they reached out to them but never got a response. They felt so strongly about my review they posted over in [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] about it. They said the calling out they received was deserved. They edited the story to mention the original which was enough for me.
