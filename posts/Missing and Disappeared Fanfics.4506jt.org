It has come to my attention that my very favorite fanfic from /Harry Potter,/ /Faith and Understanding/ has been taken down for some reason or another. Not really sure why, all it says at Fanfiction.net is "Unable to locate story. Code 1." Not sure what that means, but moving on to the topic at hand:

Have there ever been fanfics that you were fond of that were taken down?


** I run into too many decent fanfics that get taken down.

Mostly older stuff that was uncomplete and the author took it down, or smut which admins purged.

I checked FictionHunt and sadly your favorite fic doesn't seem to be archived, I get an internal server error. Hopefully someone has a copy they can PM you.

*** Thanks for that.

I normally wouldn't mind, but this one really was my all-time favorite. I recommended it every Friday for weeks over at the Great Hall.

Long story short, it was Luna and Ginny's friendship. Ginny's POV. They learned and discovered and pondered and argued and drove each other crazy and trained to fight and confided in each other and, well, it was the greatest */platonic/* love story I've ever found for Harry Potter.

** That's exactly why the epub and now mobi links on the bot are so, so appreciated. An earlier fandom taught me about the heartbreak of a fic takedown and I started saving almost everything. I have hundreds in at least 5 fandoms. Admittedly, less than 100 in HP, I haven't even been reading in this fandom for 2 years yet.

** I had a story go down one when I was only half way through. A few days later a favorite author of mine yanked all their stories and went M.I.A. That is exactly the reason I started a library on my computer to archive the stories I like. Hell, I've even started copying stories that sound really good before I read them, just in case. Check out a program called Calibre to if you want to organize a library.

*** Me too! Over half of the fics in my iBooks are popular in the fandom or recommended.

** You can use [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][P0ody Files]] to download the fic if anyone every downloaded it from the site before. Go to the "Archive" tab and enter in the ID. I have a whole list of fics that have been taken down that I need to look into to get copies.

I was in the middle of a SBHG when it was taken down, linkffn(7009600)

And the same thing happened with a DMHG, linkffn(5328530)
