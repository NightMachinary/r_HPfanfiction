I am so pessimistic that I often imagine my animagus will be something like fish. I drop down and flounder on the ground at the first time.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

*** That actually makes a lot of sense. Orcas will hunt blue whales by elbow dropping on them until they drown and have great white sharks as scared of them as Acumentura are scared of Basalisks. I'd say that takes a similar level of balls to being a triple agent against the master Legimens.

**** Personality wise, it was a good match. Just not a very useful form and therefore he was embarrassed by it (he was overly fond of his dignity). Except in this fic they were, for some reason I don't recall, in Antarctica so he was forced to reveal it and it came in quite handy.

** I've got an OC that I've tried (and failed) to write a story about who has a cuttlefish animagus form. It fits, given his personality (self-image issues, feels like an alien in human skin) and talents (the mind arts), seeing as cephalopods are the closest things we have to aliens on earth and cuttlefish specifically can hunt by hypnotizing crabs with their flashing colors. Practically, it would be a useless form (unless he fell off a boat), but I think it would be kind of adorable anyway.

** In linkffn(Harry Tano by TheBeardedOne), Umbridge decides not to go through animagus training because her form is a toad. She considers the potion to have failed because obviously, a toad is inappropriate for someone as good-looking as she.

I remember another story in which there's a short conversation in which a female student explains that she's not going through training after discovering her form, but I don't remember what it was.
