Hi everyone, I recently just finished the series (books and films) for the first time. I'm currently feeling a lot of post Harry Potter depression right now and have been told to read some fanfics to help with this. I don't really know anything about ff, this is all very new to me.\\
I would love to hear some reccomendations for fan fics that are realistic to the books and the style that they are in. Nothing too crazy and stuff that is SFW please. As I miss the books and wish there were more, I'm looking for stories that really fit into the existing story! I would love to read more about James Potter, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. I also really love Snapes character so anything about him would be great! But again, I'm really only interested in stuff that fits into the existing books! Thanks so much.


** My first and favorite fan fiction read involved the Marauders, is completely canon if you're open to the idea that there was background Sirius/Remus, entirely G-rated in its romance, and is called [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][Shoebox Project.]]

All The Young Dudes is very famous, but I haven't read it. I'm shocked it's considered more popular than Shoebox although can't comment on quality because, again, I haven't read it. It may very well be better, but I have friends who have never read any other fan fiction but are aware of or have read Shoebox Project. I had never heard of All The Young Dudes before Reddit.

** So are you looking for something that reads like it was cut right out of canon? Are diversions alright?

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11344203/chapters/25387245]]) It's a build up to wolfstar but not the focus of the fic. It is more about Sirius' and Lily's building friendship.

Otherwise I'd recommend some of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell/works?fandom_id=136512][LullabyKnell's]] fics. Quite a few of them explore slight diversions and her world building and writing is /good/.

e.g. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667][*In the Name of the Brave*]] Is a canon rewrite of Philosopher's Stone with some new teachers. It's very magical and feels like reading the earlier Harry Potter books.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

** The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks feels as much like the books as any fic I've ever read. Harry remembers watching a girl named Sally-Anne get Sorted just before him, but he never saw her again. What became of her? It's not really an alternate universe; for the most part (although not 100%), it could have happened in between the pages of the books.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

If you're interested in James/Sirius/Remus at school, Against the Moon is a major undertaking (almost a million words) but a really beautifully characterized take on their first few years at school. It's technically incomplete, but it stops at a low-key enough place that it could be read as complete.

** I see people have commented about All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 on AO3 already but I'm going to recommend it anyway! It is canon-compliant, focuses on the Marauders, and mostly SFW (there is a few "fade to black" scenes but not until the later chapters).

The only canon-divergent aspect is that Remus is an orphan instead of growing up with parents, but honestly it seems so natural in the fic it doesn't seem canon-divergent at all.

It is from 3rd person limited of Remus and follows the Marauders throughout their 7 years at Hogwarts and post Hogwarts. Super good fic!

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857]]) is a great canon-compliant fic of Snape in the first war. It explores him becoming a Death Eater and eventually with some flashbacks to 6th-7th year in school.

I also recommend looking at A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles for another canon-compliant Snape. This one covers his whole life from birth to death. linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]])

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23795218/chapters/57165265][Aim & Ignite]] by shostakobitchh is a girl!Harry AU, in where Lily had a one night stand with Snape, of which Snape obliviated himself. The result is Ariel, a kid who feels like Harry, but the differences are noticeable. Both Ariel and Snape find out he's her bio dad in first year, and Snape is not a happy camper. Characterization is on point, and it explores the idea of Snape being forced into the role of a parent. It also promises to include Remus and Sirius once it gets to third year. I really recommend it!
