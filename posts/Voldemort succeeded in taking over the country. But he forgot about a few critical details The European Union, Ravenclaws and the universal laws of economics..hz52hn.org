While Voldemort was busy recruiting mostly Slytherins and fighting Dumbledore's mostly Gryffindors, the Ravenclaws of the country had already realized that the country was slipping into a dictatorship and reacted accordingly: By simply leaving the country.

After Voldemort finally managed to destroy the rebellion, the Brain Drain was already mostly over. All the best enchanters, brewers, spellcrafters and broom manufacturers had already left the country and started new lives. The EU had made it pretty easy to legally find work on the continent. Leaving the economy of Magical Britain a complete trainwreck. Nimbus unable of making a single broom with most of their team gone and working for Silberpfeil. Vital potion ingredients in short supply due to the value of the British Galleon crashing, making imports difficult. The ministry in shambles because it turns out that it needs taxes to run. Inflation caused by dumping the contents of Malfoy's vault into the economy in a desperate effort to revive it.
