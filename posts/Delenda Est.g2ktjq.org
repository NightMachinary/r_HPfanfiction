I am at chapter 6 of Delenda Est right now, but i have a question about this fic. It has an intresting concept but 1. Harry is annoying he doesn't want to change the future [which is dumb] 2. All i see is muggle wank [bombs,guns etc are more powerful than magic]

Does this fic get better or is this the entire fic?


** Well I would say whether a fic is good is all in the eyes of the beholder. I actually like the story. I think its one of the few Harry/Bellatrix that i think is realistic. Eg harry meets bellatrix before she goes off the deep end and becomes the insane deatheater that we all know.

As far as in terms of Harry not wanting to change anything remember this is after the 3rd year time turner where he was repeatedly told he can't change anything that he already knows has happened or really bad things happen. He'll slowly change this opinion.

In terms of muggle vs magical I believe the story does a decent job of balancing the two.

Now whether you should continue reading that's a personal choice. I would recommend that you keep reading. What's the worst that could happen you. You hit the end and decide that the story wasn't as good as you were hoping it would be. Or you reach the end and go Wow, that story turned out better than I thought it would.

Either way you were able to keep yourself from being bored during the quarantine by reading some Harry Potter fanfiction. That's a win in my book. üòÅ

** The guns-more-powerful-than-magic thing doesn't change, no. But it doesn't get any bigger or 'worse' by your metric, either. If memory serves, it's more of a motivating factor than an active part of the plot.

The changing the future thing does, though. He gets very proactive in some interesting ways later on, he just has to come to terms with rewriting everything he knows first.

Personally, I'd say it gets better, but I'm not overly bothered by the 'muggles are scary' thing like you seem to be, so I suppose my opinion probably isn't all that indicative of whether you'd enjoy it. I know some have said it gets a bit meandering in the last third though. Sorry, I know that's not all that helpful, but I would say that it got better, yes.

** I reread this recently actually. Harry doesn't stay annoying long. He's stubborn at first, but then he gets into changing things (hopefully for the better). I don't recall the muggle tech being a big thing.

Honestly, I found Bellatrix to be the most annoying part. Young-Bellatrix isn't a psycho Death Eater, but she fixates on Harry (which is actually pretty understandable) and then she fixated on politics (which struck me as ‚Äúshe's smart and bored and doesn't know what to do besides politics‚Äù not as her having any particular interest in politics). Smart and bored and not knowing what else to do besides entertain herself is actually kind of her base characterization the whole story actually.

That being said, I did enjoy the fic. I think it's worth reading.

*** I think the most annoying part about the story is Harry being average, both in terms of power or ability and intelligence.

*** I just finished this like last week and the muggle tech is just more a means to kind of show that the wizarding world should be aware but it's not a thing. Really good story overall. There are issues but none large enough to take away from it.

** The fic gets a whole lot worse. Like, unreadably bad past chapter 20.

*** I wouldn't call it exactly /unreadable/, but I was definitely disappointed in the second half of the story. The first half was really good IMO, but after Harry and Bellatrix return to the present, all the conflict and struggle just basically evaporates. The really unfortunate part is that there were plenty of plot hooks that could have been used to change that and present a real challenge, it just didn't happen.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
