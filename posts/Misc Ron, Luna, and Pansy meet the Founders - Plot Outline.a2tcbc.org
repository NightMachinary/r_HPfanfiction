Summary: Ron should have read Hogwarts: A History. Who would have known that following a lead to a Dark wizard would have gotten him, his friends, and Pansy Parkinson into more trouble than they've seen for thirteen years? Then again, since it's time travel, maybe it doesn't count.

I enjoy plotting stories but not writing them, so anyone can use this outline I made a few years ago.

Part 1: Thirteen years after Voldemort's defeat, Burke-Brand, an associate of Pansy Parkinson, puts together a spell capable of messing with time. He wants to go back one year to save his father from his unexpected death. Pansy figures out his plan and enlists the help of Ron Weasley, claiming to be worried that Burke-Brand is missing and possibly a danger to himself. Now a trusted and connected Auror, Ron is in the best position to get access to the Hogwarts grounds before midnight, the location and time Burke-Brand needs for the magic of the spell. The current DADA professor, Luna Lovegood, joins them as their escort within the premises. They all make it to Burke-Brand in time, but they interrupt his ritual in progress. They get trapped by the magic, altering it, and Burke-Brand can't stop it. He gets left behind while the others are transported back a thousand years to the founding of Hogwarts.

While in transit, Luna stays more aware than Ron and Pansy. She'd been good with the uncanny, but sliding through the universe opens her mind further, making her a seer and putting her in danger of insanity. Luna directs her place in space a little and passes out while Ron and Pansy get shoved underground and have to fight their way out of entombment. Just as the three begin to take stock of their situation, they're found by a Groundskeeper. He doesn't speak English, but since Pansy was hurt during her escape, he leads them to the infirmary. She gets left behind and watched over by a house elf while Ron and Luna get led somewhere else.

On the other end, Burke-Brand loses a hand to the ritual. He manages to save himself by freezing and numbing his arm. In shock, he apparates to St. Mungo's. When he wakes up, Harry and Hermione have come to investigate the disappearance of Pansy, Ron, and Luna. Burke-Brand says he lost his hand to a failed apparition. He thinks he can determine what happened before he gets himself thrown in Azkaban. Harry and Hermione don't believe him, but since they can't prove the connection, they can only get an Auror to confiscate his wand. Pansy's other friends are also suspicious and confront Burke-Brand before he leaves.

Luna and Ron are escorted to the great Hall, where the founders are holding the first of three tests to measure the skills of every prospective student. They fight a troll, and Ron gets the attention of the founders for his combat talent. Luna also proves herself in a lesser fashion. The injured are taken by Helga to the infirmary, so Luna and Ron follow. Godric tries to speak with Ron and calls over Rowena to try out a lot of different languages. They are curious about how the three could know to come if they couldn't speak a common language. Eventually, Luna gets the gist of what they're saying through her newly improved abilities and smooths things over enough that the three are allowed to stay in the castle anyway. Ron and Luna see that Pansy has fallen asleep in the infirmary, and leave to get rooms with the rest of the students. All the students are older teens or adults, so they have their own rooms like a college.

In the morning, Pansy wakes up to a filled infirmary. The founders have conferred with one another and realized that none of them invited the three to be students. They get suspicious until Luna comes up with the excuse that she can see the future. This cements her place in Ravenclaw, while Ron is claimed by Gryffindor (both unofficially until the other two tests are over). Pansy, on the other hand, has no special skills to impress them with and missed the first test completely. When the founders asked who Pansy's family was, Luna made them think Pansy had no notable family because she's Muggleborn. This makes Slytherin unhappy because they had not extended any offers to Muggleborns, only aiming to teach high-level magic, not basics.

The groundskeeper looks over the arrival site of the three and finds Luna's wand. He can not connect it to them, but wands are valuable during this age, and it is suspicious that one would have been left lying around. Luna tries to look for her wand, but the groundskeeper has already taken it.

Part 2: The next few days introduce the students to other successful adults in a tournament/fair setting. It is a way to assess the prospective students and to generate interest in the school, so there are a lot of games that give them opportunity to show off their skills. Three days after the troll test, the second test begins. This one is an extension of the preceding games in that the students all duel against each other and a winner is named.

Ron and Luna become engrossed in trying to do well in the competitions, but Pansy takes a more serious view of their circumstances and spends much of her time investigating and documenting the symbols she remembers from the ritual and ways to get back. She starts off not caring about the tests, but Ron convinces her that they all have to stick together and that Hogwarts is the best resource they have. Still, her duels do not go well because she can not compete with Ron and Luna's field experience and prescience.

Burke-Brand encounters trouble with the law while he tries to figure out how to get the three back. His house is searched, but he realizes that his phantom limb pains are actually sensations from his amputated hand. While at the ministry, he sees that Pansy's friends think he's guilty. He asks Harry for help accessing the ritual site.

Part 3: The third test involves one-on-ones with the founders themselves, where they ask the students to do specific feats of magic. This gives them a better chance to suss out which students they would like to teach, while also letting any overlooked students show off their unique skills. After the test, Ron is accepted on the spot, Luna's invitation is delayed until her test prediction about Peeves showing up comes true, and Pansy is graciously given a place to stay by Hufflepuff because she's supposedly Muggleborn. However, Pansy isn't invited to any classes.

Because Pansy has the most free time, she leads the charge with researching how to get home. She concludes that to understand the time travel ritual, she needs to remember everything she saw and sets about mastering the pensive memory spell. She learns the spells practically single-handedly because Ron is distracted and Luna is growing increasingly flighty with her visions of the future.

Gryffindor is the founder least suited to teaching in a classroom. The plight of Muggleborns gives him the opportunity to get out and teach his students in the field. Ron gets preoccupied with helping Gryffindor save Muggleborns, while Slytherin gets increasingly angry that Gryffindor isn't doing what they had agreed to. He leaves when it becomes obvious that Hufflepuff agrees with Gryffindor. Pansy argues with Ron over him not focusing on getting home, but he insists that saving people is more important. Luna helps find the Muggleborns with her natural talent for scrying and is more coherent when she does.

Luna falls into a coma because of her visions. This kicks Ron and Pansy into gear, and they find a pensive so Pansy can view her memories. They see that Burke-Brand's hand went over one of the ritual lines and might have been cut off. They dig it up, and once they do, use it's connection to the future to reactivate the ritual.

Part 4: Luna gets sent back to Burke-Brand, Harry, and Hermione with the hand. Once back in her own time, she stops having visions and comes out of her coma. She'd gotten a better understanding of time travel through her prescience, but wasn't able to communicate it before. She tells Burke-Brand that he's the gatekeeper to the parallel universe, and that he can open the gate again, but Ron and Pansy have to step through. Luna can now direct where the gate opens, so she needs to stay with Burke-Brand.

Ron and Pansy are left behind, but they can't explain why their friend has gone missing. This makes the founders suspicious enough to investigate their employees. They find an extra wand in the groundskeeper's home (Luna's dropped wand). He explains where he found it and leads them to the ritual site. This obstructs Ron and Pansy's access.

Luna and Burke-Brand get a message to Ron and Pansy to get to the gate at a certain time. This is difficult with the founder and gatekeeper's increased security. Pansy also has to convince Ron to go because he likes his life in the past. Pansy gets the help of Ravenclaw's daughter to evade the founders, and she and Ron make it through.

*** I'm never writing the fic, so I figured I might as well post the outline I made in case it sparked someone else's imagination. I hope you got some enjoyment out of reading anyway. I tried to make it easy to picture what the story would be.
