** Well, it's not complete but my fic The Serpent Master is next gen. Doesn't focus on any of the next gen kids, instead we have 3 OC's as the main characters but next gen characters do play a part and are active in the story. linkffn(The Serpent Master) EDIT: There are more chapters than the bot say's there are fyi

** Well I'll be, my obsessive reading of Marauder's fics finally has a use! linkffn(7286177) linkffn(3927882) linkffn(7012597) linkffn(5048579) linkffn(2795240) linkffn(3555029) linkffn(271744) linkffn(928550) I'd have more but I only recently started staring fanfictions I've read/wanted to read. :( EDIT: Trying to get the bot to refresh. ffnbot!refresh

**** I've tried putting them individually, let's hope that works! (If it doesn't, they're all favorited on my fanfiction profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3742838/]]) As far as why I'm so obsessive, it stemmed from my love of James and Lily (my original OTP). I was a little kid and I (also) wanted nothing more than for Harry to have his parents and grow up that way. I had a hard time finding those fics 6+ years ago, but that led me to the many many romances that people write. I read one that was something cupid that I really wish I had faved because it was amazing. It was the Marauder tale with an 'additional' (but generally canon compliant) character that was a girl who made it rain when she cried. It was OC Sirius Black and it was amazing.

I just love the characters! The Marauder bond is something I admire, and the fanfiction and fandom surrounding it can be very funny. It's a little more lighthearted than the Harry Potter series, but it can also be pretty serious. With something that's canon but has so little material, people really go in and flesh out the world around them and when it is done really well it is amazing.

Which is my favorite, :O, would you choose your favorite child!!! Also, seriously though, characters change so much from fic to fic I really can't give a solid answer there. :(

****** If it doesn't, you can find the links on my page and download them with fic save. :) And no, I don't, which sucks because it was amazing. It followed everyone until the war, and then followed the OC until it ended.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** I just gave some recs in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/49srtw/looking_for_next_gen/][other next gen thread]] that are all complete! But they're all on HPFF which doesn't have EPUB, but you can export a PDF from the print preview page? I do have my own fics on ffn--one complete next gen novel and another that's an epilogue away from finishing, along with oneshots.

**** What are you having trouble with? I usually just download the webpage as a PDF or find some converter online to convert to whatever format I need. For HPFF, I use the print preview link on the top left of the main story page.

**** OH HEY! How embarrassing :D I should be working on that epilogue.

For your EPUB issue, I can't say I have a solution unfortunately! There might be some free applications that also do conversion, but I can't vouch for any. I kind of just suffer with my PDFs (I had a 90-page one the last time I went on vacation)

Speaking of that 90-page PDF, if you like etc, you should totally read what I was reading--[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]]. It's long and nuts and daring and after you get 10 chapters in, you can't leave. The lead is very Clemence-ish and it's one of my favorite complete fics ever.

****** Welp, then I probably don't have recs for you! Most people here don't read HPFF at all, so usually all my recs are unknown.

I've been telling everyone who's worried about the epilogue: there are /sunflowers/ in it! That's how happy it is. Anyway, I'll just try my best not to take 5 years to write it (really, aiming for next month).
