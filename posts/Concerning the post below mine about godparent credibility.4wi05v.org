I always found it odd that anyone in HP had godparents in the first place. Doesn't it say in the bible "Thou shall not suffer a witch to live". It could, of course be that Lily came from a religious family and decided that god would still love her even if she was a witch but it still seems pretty strange to me.

I'm an atheist, so no godparents but please enlighten me:

Can you get a godparent even if you don't believe in god? (It says god literally in the name, I know but I'm asking just in case) Or maybe is it that Sirius was just asked to be godfather in the sense that it was something like surrogate father and not at all to due with religion. Can you do that?

Do you (as a christian) find it offensive that people in the HP books would have godparents or go to church, even if they were wizards?

Do you need a special ceremony to become godparents? (I know I could google this) Or are you just asked and then agree and then BAM you are?

Do you find it believable that people in HP even have godparents and/or believe in god? Or do you think this was just Harry who got one cause of Lily?


** Yes, of course it is believable.

Godparents are just a failsafe mechanism. "Hey, friend of mine, would you care for my offspring if I die so that my name may carry into the next generation?"

While yes, in our western cultures the godparents are something deeply enrooted in the catholic and hence, christian churches, the idea is a worldwide phenomenon in almost every culture where names carried social- and/or political-weight. Calling them /god/parents is just a remnant of our christian-influences cultures and languages.

*** To expand on that, the practice of godfathering was a common enough thing amongst Roman legionnaires ... it simply wasn't actually known as “godfathering” because it was before that term started coming into use as one of the effects of Christianity's spread.

And the way Sirius is Harry's “godfather” is closer to the Roman one rather than the Christian one.

** Religions say a lot of strange, and, sometimes, contradictory things. It's all about how you interpret and are taught your faith's holy book. In the time Lily was alive, the whole witch thing being a sin/abomination likely never came up in any sermons or sunday school classes she would have gone to growing up. The world she lived in didn't believe in magic or witches or wizards, so it would have been irrelevant to preach about the horrors of witches and it's quite likely she wouldn't have known the church's stance on them because of it.

Her intimate knowledge of Christianity is also dependent on how religious her family was. They could have just been regular, Sunday-church goers who participated in church milestone, such as baptism, (when godparents are named traditionally), communion, and confirmation and cared little about it beyond that.

I don't know for sure if someone who doesn't believe in god can give their child a godparent, though, I would think it doesn't necessarily have to be a religious thing. It could just be an honorary sort of title one friend/sibling/cousin/ect. gives another after their child is born.

As a Christian-raised person, I don't find it offensive that witches and wizards might have godparents or go to church. It'd be little different than being openly gay and still being an active member of church, as far as I am concerned.

I think it's believable wizards and witches could believe in God. Especially Muggle-borns and half-bloods. They could have been raised by devout parents and carried that faith with them to Hogwarts and beyond, perhaps even passing it on to their children, their grandchildren, and so on.

** I am my nephew's godfather, and I've been an atheist for as long as I've been able to have an opinion on religion. My nephew and his parents are catholic. At the baptism I was asked three questions: 1. would I accept the responsibility? 2. Would I reject Satan and all his works? and 3. Would I commit to raise him in the catholic faith if I had to take over from his parents?

Mostly, I find the godparent thing in HP to be really weird. I choose to believe they're just designating an alternate parent or something like that. My headcannon is that wizards and witches are mostly godless.

** My nephew and niece have 'godparents' apparently - though as far as I know they were never christened. (Unless they were and I wasn't invited. Quite possible). It's a thing that I always have found inconsistent in the books: That there is no apparent religion - they swear by Merlin - yet we see Harry's parents buried in a Christian graveyard and the church at Godric's Hollow feels like a significant place. It's a wizarding village and we see people going to church, singing carols if my memory serves? Almost as if JK didn't fully think it through. Perish the thought. But as inconsistent as I find it, the connection with 'that old-time religion' or at least religious tradition in the 'Merrie England' sense is a theme I've enjoyed using myself and might do again. Cause it's Canon doncha know.

*** Actually, the village is a mixed one, I believe (some wizards, some non-wizards). With that, and with the fact that in some locations the only cemeteries are church-affiliated ones, it would not be complete nonsense for their graves to be there.

** I think it's a bit of author tract seeping into the narrative. JKR has said, "I don't believe in magic, but I do believe in God" in response to stories of a few churches protesting the themes in her series.

Godparents are just a natural extension of her personal beliefs that don't make any /real/ sense in the larger magical world.
