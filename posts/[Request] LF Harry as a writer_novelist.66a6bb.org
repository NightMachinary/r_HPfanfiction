Fics where Harry writes books. Any books.

I've read "Again and Again" linkffn(8149841) where Harry writes politics books and has his column in pollitics journal for articles

I've read "Crumbling Pedestal" linkffn(1922112) where Harry after his trip in time, meeting with founders and becoming Slytherin's brother writes potions textbooks for Hogwarts in 1990s

I've read a fic (though not english) where Harry is back to Mesozoic era and has to learn everything and how to live in isolation. When it is finally 1990s again he makes a personality of author of books and writes a few about ancient runes, charms, transfiguration etc.

I want something like that. Maybe even like Poison Pen linkffn(5554780) where Harry has his own column in Quibbler but I'm not sure.


** linkffn(Blindness) includes Harry and Hermione publishing research and opinion under a pseudonym.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Auror Harry Potter was hunting a criminal that caused lots of death. Just what he didn't expect was ending in the past, thanks to said criminal's actions. He was never one to sit by while injustice happened, so sitting still until he found a way home wasn't really going to happen. No matter what Hermione had told him about time-travel. One-Shot

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
