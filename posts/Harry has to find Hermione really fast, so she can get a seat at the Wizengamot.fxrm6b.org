It was a scene where Harry, who was already MW (Member of Wizengamot), find out that if he delivers Hermione in half-an-hour (or some period as short as this) to the Ministry, she will get some recently vacant seat. He runs to her parents' to find her, and he is in such hurry, that she all the time believes she will get a seat in the visitors' gallery, not The Seat. Not sure, if it was even Harmony, perhaps not.

*** Right that's it. Again, I am not very enamoured with old-crow and bashing gets really old really fast (here, he declared that starving of Ron Weasley to death by The Death Eaters is his own fault), but this scene (and the following one in the Wizengamot) is really great. And I am really lost about Harry/Susan pairing: I don't see why there should be any problem with it, but it almost never works well.

**** I wonder if half of the authors we all liked "back in the day" had less to do with quality of work versus quantity.

It wasn't the best stuff, but it was there, longish, and frequently updated.

  Post OoTP Harry's life takes an unexpected turn when Fawkes provides Harry with a means of mobility. Ch 32 concludes the final six-chapter arc. Forget Book 7.
