Free to a good home.

Wormtail follows Voldemort into the Potter's house, possibly planning to try and kill or memory charm Lily if Voldemort spares her as Snape requested, to protect his own cover.

When Voldemort tries to kill Harry and gets exploded, shattering a piece off his fractured soul, the soul fragment instead attaches to Wormtail.

Wormtail, knowing that Sirius will know the truth about his betrayal, and that he can never return to his old life, snatches Voldemort's wand and runs.

How would the story unfold if Harry was never a pseudo-Horcrux?
