I love a good HP/Fallout crossover fanfic, which are too rare, and was thinking about how an educated wizard would actually fare in the Falloutverse. I think they would be able to do quite well for themselves but I also think they would struggle with others and technology especially if they weren't Muggle-Raised or Muggleborn. What do you all think?


** Putting aside combat spells for a minute. The basic book(s) of spells, household spells, and some transfiguration would set them up for an economic cheat.

- Non-irradiated water costs how many caps? AUGAMENTI!
- Oh shit, we use caps for money here? Lemme transfigure a bunch of 'em.
- Go looting in ruins and go Reparo-happy.

Muggleborn, half-blood, or Muggle-raised would succeed. Purebloods most likely not. They would die of culture-shock.

*** Yes Nyan they would be set for life there, super easy! :) You do not even have to transfigure caps! Just create copies of a single cap. :)

*** Some of my thoughts were, of course, repairing things and fresh, clean water. Also although food cannot be conjured it can be duplicated. Items can also be duplicated for trading. They could create containers that can keep food fresh, cold/warm and from spoiling and sell them.

Perhaps there are even spells or wards that cleanse or repel radiation? Charms against fast moving objects(spears, arrows, bullets). Spells for making animals docile for herding, butchering or as guards. Enchantments(Fanon!Wards) to keep away people without magic or who wish to harm those under them. Also those that repel beasts and pests. This could allow the witch/wizard to create true safe havens for themselves and possibly others.

Main weakness I think of a witch/wizard in Fallout would be their wand. Wandless magic /is/ possible but they use wands for a reason. If their wand gets broken then they are going to be a lot less effective. Hell it wouldn't be a leap for some bad/jealous guys to figure out their wand is important when they see them using and they would try to destroy or steal it.
