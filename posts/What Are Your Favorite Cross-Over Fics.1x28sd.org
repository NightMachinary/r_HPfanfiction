I am looking for great cross-overs. I don't care what the other source is, if its well written I'll give it a try.

The best cross-over I've ever read is also one of my favorite fics of all time: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] by nonjon


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Renegade]] and the sequels, Denarian Knight & Denarian Lord. Harry Potter/Dresden Files crossover. Fairly original, with strong characterization and writing. The fic introduced me to The Dresden Files, which would be enough to make it my favorite, even if it wasn't actually great (which it is).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]]. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but the 77k words are still worth a read, if only for something different. It's a Culture series/HP crossover, and very different than most HP fics. If it was finished, I'd probably say it was on par with Denarian Renegade.

Go and search through DLP looking for crossovers. Use tags and you'll probably come across some good stuff.

**** Nah, I didn't. It's mainly HP, with a few small elements of DF included. I believe Shezzah explains almost everything that you would need to know in the fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]: This isn't a crossover with a specific book or film franchise, but with the entire Dungeons and Dragons universe. If you are familiar with RPGs, you will probably appreciate it. A Death Eater summoning ritual goes wrong, and a character whose magic obeys the laws of role playing games is cast into the Harry Potter universe.

Well written, great OC (my favorite of almost any fic) and a lot of D&D vs. Harry Potter tie-ins. My second favorite after Brown Coat.

** Although it's been a while since you were looking for crossovers, here are a few of my suggestions:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654318/1/Happily-Ever-After][Happily Ever After?]] by muggledad is my favorite HP crossover with the DC universe. Well, I don't know very many of that particular crossing of fandoms, so it's not that difficult to find the best one. Still, I feel the story is written well and I've had it on my list of favorites ever since.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5931066/1/Oma-s-Choice][Oma's Choice]] by jacobds requires in-depth knowledge of Stargate SG1 (and also Atlantis to some degree) to make sense. Although the abrupt ending was a bit of a let-down for me, everything else earned it a spot on my favorites list.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]] by Tellur is an as of yet unfinished crossover between the Harry Potter and Mass Effect universes; or rather they both find themselves in the same one. A young Harry Potter comes to the attention of a young Asari researcher (Liara T'Soni) and things continue from there. Hints of the existence of magic beyond the planet Earth and how that fits into the big Mass Effect back-story seems to be one of the larger upcoming story-arches, although we've only been teased about that sparingly so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elder-Sect][Harry Potter and the Elder Sect]] - Clell65619 has written some good stories and this is one is certainly among them. The crossover with Bewitched and their brand of magic makes for a very entertaining read, just don't take it too serious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth][The Queen who fell to Earth]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186304/1/On-the-Wings-of-Dragons][On the Wings of Dragons]] are the first two completed stories of a planned three-part series that crosses Harry Potter with the Dragonriders of Pern books by Anne McCaffrey. A whopping 650k words so far, it's certainly an interesting read and, in my opinion, one of the best attempts to merge two different fandoms I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4944819/1/The-Wizard-on-the-Edge-of-Forever][The Wizard on the Edge of Forever]] (WIP) - rpnielsen writes a very interesting story where Harry suddenly finds himself in the future on the classic Enterprise of Star Trek: The Original Series. Without spoiling too much of the story, what happened to the Wizarding world will be explored as well. It's too bad that the once regular updates have been very long in coming for a while, but as far as I know, the author plans to continue/finish.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster][Wizard Runemaster]] by plums and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957264/1/The-Next-Great-Adventure][The Next Great Adventure]] by ThatGuyYouKnew (both WIP) are the only two HP/Warcraft crossovers worth reading in my opinion. Granted, they're very heavy on the super!Harry side, but if you don't mind reading that every now and then, these stories can make for a lighthearted afternoon.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-9332/AnimeRonin+The+Other+Redhead+In+His+Life.htm][The Other Readhead In His Life]] by AnimeRonin is a bit different than expected. Without spoiling too much, it's all given away in the first chapter anyway, Xander from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer does something rather stupid by calling on a higher (or lower) power, which ends with him being born as James Potter in a different universe without his memories. This story deals with what happens upon is death after Voldemort has killed him, because he's obviously not in the afterlife, but instead back in his original BtVS world.

These should last for a while, I hope ;)
