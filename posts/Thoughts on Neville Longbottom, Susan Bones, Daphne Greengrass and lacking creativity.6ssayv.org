While looking for new stories to read it is inevitable to come across a lot of stories where those characters play a major role. And without reading them it is still easy to predict what is written. Neville is going to be a "brother in all but blood" within six months and he'll start exercising with Harry in order to "become the wizard he could be". Befriending Susan makes it easy to contact the ever fair Madam Bones, who is able to either get Sirius name cleared because she is or has been in love with Black or help against Dumbledore. And the walking trope called Greengrass will be the badly characterised ice queen, which inevitably will develop feelings for Harry after hating him at the beginning because the marriage contract was not enough drama.

It is sad to see so many good ideas go to waste because the author, while having an interesting plot ideas, uses the same old tropes we've been reading for years. Would it be that difficult to name your OC Mandy Brockenhurst or Ernie McMillian? Why always use the same five characters when you have dozens to choose from?


** I think you need to look at the benefits each of the blank slates have and you can see why its the same ones that rise up time and time again.

Susan Bones is the easiest to do. Her aunt. her aunt is supposedly fair and competent. A lot of people look at the Ministry's incompetence and want it changed. Amelia Bones is the clear choice. How does this tie to Harry, Susan. Why choose Hannah Abbot, Megan Jones or any other Hufflepuff when You can have Susan Bones and her aunt. Why do people pick Susan, because she has more to add to a story, lazy? Perhaps but fanfiction is written by amateurs using existing resources.

Daphne. Harry is pigheaded and rushes into things. People can't be bothered to write from first year Slytherin Harry so they need to interject a Slytherin mindset into the story. Welcome Daphne. Why Daphne over Millicent, Tracey Davis or even Pansy? Well Pansy and Millicent are ugly. Pansy is mean and Millicent is troll-esque. Daphne has a nicer name than Tracey and her pureblood status over Tracey's half-blood. It can open up new avenues on blood-purity and the wizarding world.

They're the most interesting blank slates and ones Harry doesn't call out in the book. They provide more than the others and to make the others as interesting takes effort and some talent. Fanfiction writers are amateur working on their stories in their spare time. They have neither the time nor does everyone have the talent to create well developed characters. Fanfiction leans on the works of others JKR primarily but as evidenced by some of the posters here, people read enough fanfiction that they develop their own ideas. Daphne has no character but she has a character in fanon. Like it or loathe it, it exists. You might think you have a better idea but the majority will use the fanon characterisation simply because its easy.

Because they read them, like them and want to use them in their own version of what they read.

Lord Potter fics work in the same way. Its as if there is some sort of "Lord Potter fic generator" out there somewhere.

Creativity isn't just /there/. The creative genius is a myth. To a large degree, creativity is learned, either by yourself and hard work or through your upbringing. I would hazard a guess that a lot of these fics' writers are young and are still learning to "be creative", or are mature and have never learned to be so. As with other things, most people start their creative journey by blatant copying. Therefore, this.

** I would like to see Cormac McLaggen use his family's ties within the Ministry to seek a pardon for Sirius Black, all because the former has true feelings for Hermione, yet is unable to artfully act upon them in any sensible way. I think that would be cool instead of using the over-tired Bones path. I like Neville, though if a fic doesn't include him, that's fine by me. And any story with Daphne Greengrass I skip altogether; it's just not my thing.

I started to skip story with her as a main character as well. (Although I've used her in two stories myself - in one she is a dizzy blonde who simply doesn't seem to get that the Boy-Who-Lived is not interested in her (although she grows up some). And in the other she joins the Death Eaters without really wanting to, just as a reaction to other events - like her parents ending up as collateral damage of an attack on Death Eaters.

I got a bit sick of "Crusader for Justice" Bones who rights all wrongs, so I wrote a version who truly is strictly enforcing the law - and that means whatever laws the Wizengamot duly passed. Which quickly out her at odds with the Order of the Phoenix, including Harry and co.

** The best Daphne stories I've seen depict her as being friendly, albeit rather coy, with an innate ability to read other people and to navigate around back-stabbers. It's when she gets turned into the "Ice Queen" that the story starts to go south.

I don't see anything wrong with authors using any of these characters, but you are correct that these tropes recur like clockwork. The difficulty is that, when a character is a "blank slate" (especially Daphne, who is mentioned in approximately three or four sentences maximum in canon), it's up to the author to fill in the blanks - and if they aren't yet experienced in character-building, they're just going to stick to the same pattern they've seen other authors using before.

Poor Astoria didn't even get mentioned by name once, though - although she does appear in the epilogue, where she's referred to as "Draco's wife". +And she also appears in /Cursed Child/, but who cares about that?+

** The reason I use those characters instead of other ones is, in fact, due to their popularity in the fandom. As you pointed out, very little is known of the Greengrass sisters or Susan, and so if you want an OC in those houses it's pretty easy to just have that OC be a canon character who is a blank slate. Personally, I tend to err towards not sending a brand new character to do an established characters job, especially if fanon already provided that framework.

Edit: That said, I don't have a murder boner for anyone in particular either, and there needs to be a reason for me to off someone as important as Daphne.

Note: I did have a murder boner for one particular character, but we solved that already.

** I don't see how "I want to write a story involving this character, who comes from fanon" is any worse than "I want to write a story involving this character, who comes from canon". Someone sees and likes a fanon take on Neville and decides to write a story with that character. Why is that less creative than writing a story with canon-personality Neville?

Of course, some people write lazy, tropy fics with these fanon characters. But some people write lazy, tropy fics with canon characters.

But the point is that they aren't OCs. There are firmly established fanon personalities for these characters. Call them IceQueen!Daphne or BrotherInAllButBlood!Neville if you don't want to confuse them with (Canon!)Daphne and (Canon!)Neville, but they aren't original characters of the umpteenth person to write a fic about them.

/Yes, they are./

I disagree with you. No matter how many times a fanon character is used in exactly the same, poorly-inspired way, it does not in my opinion cement a character identity. People like Daphne aren't characters other than names in canon, so when they're used in fanon they're OCs every time, and all I see are people recycling the same tired, uninteresting, poorly-written OCs over and over and hiding behind the excuse that the OC in question is an, as you've said, /established fanon personality/.

My real issue over all of it is just the quality of writing that accompanies the usage of these characters in the majority of stories, to the point where I just ignore stories with Daphne and stuff like that in the character list because it isn't worth the time loading and reading the story when it seems like it's statistically likely to be yet another recycle of someone's OC.

** Neville makes some sense, given what we already know about him and his family.

His parents fought against the Dark Arts and stood against Voldemort in the Order. And he was born only one day before Harry. It's not out of the question that he and Harry would have known each other had things been at least a little different.

Adding to this the fact that Neville had unfair handicaps, including using his father's wand, a wand that was not suited to him.

Neville is used, because the writers know that he can be sculpted as a character.

*** Any nearly blank character can be sculptured well. And I get the reason why many authors use the established fanon characters. But it gets boring rather quickly and in 9/10 cases you can guess where the story will go when these "trope characters" are involved. After reading a lot of fanfics those that defy the fandom headcanon generally stand out of the mass of rather mediocre stories. Add to that the often poor and rushed execution of recycled plots and you see the cause of my frustration.

For example "Ice Princess by Luan Mao is by a large margin my favourite story with Daphne Greengrass in it simply because you get to read something new and entirely unexpected.
