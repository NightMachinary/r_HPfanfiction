:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading about this fanfic where Ron is most likely a seer and he sees vision of Fred being killed in future. So he was studying hard to prevent this from happening and even before he joined hogwarts he already learnt first 2 years worth of hogwarts education from Percy and Charlie. He was sorted into Slytherin and the professors seem to think he is a prodigy. Yesterday I closed that fanfic from my browser and I couldn't seem to find it again. Could you please help me if you know what the Fanfic name is so that I can find it? Thanks .

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
