On pure skill. Keep in mind she went to prison around the age of 30


** Given that in HP academic prowess equals competency(unless you're John Dawlish) Voldemort can probably defeat Bellatrix by the time he takes his NEWTS. Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald were all prodigies, and given that Grindelwald was expelled from Durmstrang he still became a renowned dark wizard.

*** I disagree on the issue of Dawlish's competency. He scored all outstandings on his NEWTS, and was assigned to accompany the minister. I doubt Fudge would have accepted anyone short of exceptional for his own personal protection. He was assigned to defend Hogmeade as well. He's ready to move on Dumbledore, despite Dumbledore's reputation. Sure he blinks (foolishly according to Harry - a biased perspective) when the man who took down Grindewald (and has been smeared for being senile and unstable) casually threatens to "hurt" him. I think it's more telling of his character that he's the first to start stirring, and is the first to "chase" after Dumbledore, even though he had just put down two aurors and some ministry employees. We see hints that Dawlish is a quite capable auror. Being an auror is impressive enough.

His appearance of a lack of competency seems to stem from his behavior under confundus charms, which he has been victim to many times. It seems understandable, however, that having one's mind altered many times would lead to a reduction in ability.

**** Oh I don't have a problem with him losing to Dumbledore twice, that's expected. His other showings unfortunately don't bode well for his competency. He was one of the four Aurors present to confront McGonagall according to Hagrid, in which Hagrid also says they wouldn't have been able to take on McGonagall without the element of surprise. Neville also says this about Dawlish:

"Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn't need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway, Dawlish is still in St Mungo's and Gran's on the run."

Given that Neville was at Hogwarts and not in the Order, he couldn't have known that Dawlish was confounded and still says he isn't anything special. The straight Os student in NEWTs got hospitalized by a woman who failed her Charms OWL. So much for magical special forces when one of their top operators is more mall cop in efficacy than anything resembling SOF.

***** I think the issue is that those commentaries hardly come from a position of neutrality.

You have Hagrid, who's hardly unbiased at the best of times. If there is such a comment, it's hardly good evidence. I couldn't actually find the quote in question in OoTP or Halfblood Prince with a cursory command F search. Would you mind sharing it? I could find this:

#+begin_quote
  Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face. â€œAs if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight!
#+end_quote

Given that McGonagall was known to be fiercely skilled at magic, I don't think it's a mark of incompetence for a biased perspective to have doubts about a single auror's ability. In any case, I think it should be disregarded for bias as well.

I'll admit I'm a little confused by using Neville as evidence as Dawlish /was/ confunded when he went after his grandmother.

Of course he's going to have issues with Dawish's competency, especially from his position of great bias. If anything, this supports my argument as the lack of competency Dawlish seems to demonstrate here is because of confundment. For confundment and bias, I don't think this make for good evidence.

Dumbledore states he has no doubt about Dawlish's abilities as a side note, but it's hardly unbiased evidence either.

Dawlish's outstandings on 5 minimum NEWTS, when the aurors only require exceeds expectations, is impressive. Dawlish's personal assignation to the minister and Hogsmeade reflect a measure of skill as well. He gets a bad rep because he doesn't join the order, like many other aurors, and gets confunded quite a lot and because he's placed in situations where a less skilled auror would have done just as worse if not worse.

****** My issue with Dawlish is that his skills aren't put to show, we're told he's badass but never gets a chance to prove it. There isn't evidence that being confounded repeatedly makes you weakened over time. Given that Snape confounded Fletcher who's not powerful and yet Fletcher still has the presence of mind to disapparate when confronted by Voldemort and remain undetected until Kreacher caught up to him. Not to mention I'm sure Dumbledore knows how to pull his punches when hexing Dawlish, I doubt he would want a top Auror weakened when Voldemort is back.

There isn't anything in canon that shows Dawlish being a badass. Moody was defeated by Dolohov and got locked in a trunk for a year, but Voldemort still targets him first during Harry's extraction and Snape avoided showing Moody any overt animosity. Contrast when Snape was talking to Moody in GoF where he gets flustered by Moody's "spots that don't come off" comment and where Snape is interrogated by Bellatrix where he keeps his cool. For Dawlish, its a running gag that he gets taken down over and over, which isn't a good look for magical special forces. Then again, Aurors never really did get much of a chance to shine, they only captured Stan Shunpike post OOTP.

** Excluding the time between Halloween 1981 and his resurrection (with potential exception of him possessing Quirrell) I'd say by the time he was taking OWLs he would have beat literally every other witch or wizard we know of other than Dumbledore and Grindelwald and by the time of NEWTs that wouldn't be the case.

** 30 yr old Bella? Any time after he turns 17.

50 yr old Bella? Probably early 30s, though mid 20s shouldn't be ruled out. If all evidence points to gray-haired Amelia Bones putting up a good fight against 70 yr old Voldemort, 50 yr old Bella shouldn't have too much of a problem with a teenage Riddle, barring a bout of intense arrogance of course.

** At any point in his life, I suppose, unless you're adjusting their ages, seeing as Voldemort is presumed to be older than Bellatrix, so Voldemort would have always had experience on his side.

** Its hard to say, because we never really see Tom duel, or hear of him engaging in any notable duel, until the wars. We know he had formidable knowledge, skill, and power when it came to dark magic even in school (he was apparently using Unforgiveables and made at least one Horcrux prior to graduation). So its possible he could have taken Bellatrix as early as his fifth or sixth year, if not earlier. On the other hand, none of that demonstrates that he had honed the reflexes, instincts, and experience necessary to be a top tier duelist, where being able to think on your feet, react fast, and cast quickly and effectively under pressure is going to be at least as important as what spells you know or how much raw power you have. I'd note the fact that in his memory, Aragog got past him and Hagrid was able to jump him during is sixth? year suggests he wasn't as focussed or fast in a duel as he was later on.
