Preferably complete but if not at least long Voldemort /Riddle is either the protagonist or the deuteragonist. He can be good, evil, morally ambigous whatever. This can be like a full AU or canon deviation or just canon doesn't matter.

But he can't have a love interest. If its like a one sided thing like making someone having feelings for him he doesnt ever return thats fine. But he can't have romantic or sexual feelings for people. Friendship is fine though.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)
