** I checked the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/killing-curse/][Harry Potter Lexicon]], and there was no mention of severing the soul. It's probably just fanon.

The Killing Curse seems more like it simply changes the thing it hits from "alive" to "dead". The body just stops working instantly. Creepy enough without any mention of the soul.

(A cool fact: it is described as sounding like something huge and invisible is rushing towards the target)

  I'm not 100% sure that it is canon that the killing curse kills by severing the connection between the soul and the body,

its not, its fanon. the killing curse kills, its magic it doesn't need a method like ripping out the soul or stopping the heart. Muggle who investigate the cause of death are also unable to find one.

but Voldemort describes feeling himself getting ripped of his body after he "died" the first time. its much more likely that dying itself causes the soul to leave the body.

** Yup, ripping the soul apart or whatever is just fanon. Avada Kedavra is like a binary switch. If it hits, condition is changed to "dead". Theres no cause of death, its just "this living thing is now dead".

** I saw a fanon explanation that had the Killing Curse be an extremely high powered obliviate but instead of removing memories it removed all motor functions. Some things would be immune to "mind magics" such as the dementors.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons) it is Based on the assumption that the Killing Curse erases instantly all Memories (e.g. breathing, muscle-memory, etc.) and therefore you are instantly dead.

** The Killing Curse is /also/ a powerful jolt of magical energy, on top of unceremoniously kicking the soul into the Beyond. Remember, when it hits something which it cannot kill the regular way, it doesn't dissipate, it causes an explosion. I would say that someone Kissed could easily be killed by a Killing Curse because a Killing Curse would make them explode.
