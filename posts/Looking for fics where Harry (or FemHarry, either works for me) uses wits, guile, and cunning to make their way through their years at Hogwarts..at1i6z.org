I guess I'm just looking for fics that feature a Slytherin (fem!)Harry using the traits that Slytherin House should be known for, rather than it's penchant for breeding Blood Purity beliefs. Don't really care about the paring, but would rather avoid (fem!)Harry/male if possible.


** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has fem!Harry deceiving the entirety of Hogwarts into thinking she's a guy (her cousin) so that she can attend Hogwarts. Tons of misdirection, clever thinking, and lying involved in this - she mostly keeps her head down re:blood purity, but in fourth year she starts to push back against them. No pairings as of yet, though a few different ones have been hinted at imo.

For gen!Harry, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) and linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) both feature a Slytherin!Harry who's openly opposed to blood purity and focused on restoring Slytherin's reputation as the house of the cunning.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
