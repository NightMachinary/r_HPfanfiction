What if a magical child who was deaf or blind developed some form of instinctive legilimency to compensate? What if no one ever really noticed their blindness/deafness as a result?


** Because you can legilimize objects? Children are left alone. Itt's probably going to be obvious to the kid when they slam into a wall that something's not right.

*** Unless there is an AU element to the story, like having this instinctive form of legilimency be capable of interacting with the "soul" of an object, which is often used to explain how a transfigured object is not just that object, but is always called "transfigured". So by doing this, the child would be able to percieve objects and people around them as clusters of thought - objects as very simple, very basic "I am a chair" or "I am a table", plants as stronger, slightly more complex versions of the same, animals as more complex, moving clusters, and finally sapient creatures as blindingly complicated, extremely complex arrays of thought that are constantly moving and changing.

There would be a lot of things one can do with this.

- because the child has no reference point, their legilimency does not originate from their eyes, but rather their brain, meaning they would likely be able to "see" all around.

- Because of how they percieve objects, there would be nothing transparent (save air and water, which arguably is the same "thing" all across the planet/its lake/river.

- They might be able to percieve magic, too, but I would develop this ability over time rather than just put it in the story for shits and giggles.

- They might have to learn that legilimizing people, even passively without consent is wrong, and learn to "percieve" everything /but/ sapients, instead seeing them by the hole they leave in their perception.

- They might even have this as a code of morals themselves

- Legilimency of people takes practice and is a harrowing process, so I wouldn't give them the ability to mind read just willy nilly. In the beginning, they can only see that someone is /there/, but their mind is too complex and has too many unknown, moving parts to actually invade.

- They might be able to percieve other legilimencers, too - their mind seems to be less contained, spiking outwards.

- They would not be able to read - at first. It might only be a matter of perspective: instead of seeing the ink and the paper, what if they saw the ink on the paper?

**** Right, so it would take many many nonsensical changes to make sense, which is a bit of a catch-22.

Little confused through. Are you implying that objects have souls in the canonical HP world or that they would have souls in an AU designed to support this concept? Because souls in the canonical HP world are limited to the sentient (and even more limited than that). For example, ghosts who have memories and are sentient do no possess souls. Neither do paintings. No souls in objects, though I would agree that there is a "fundamental nature" when it comes to transfigured objects, however permanent the transfiguration may be.

The original prompt is a cool showerthought but it falls apart from even a little bit of consideration. That's okay but it is a bit indicative of the plague of low-quality prompts Taure posted about recently.

***** This was a ‘shower though' type prompt. I didn't expand very far because I wanted to see how other people would explore it. A lot of really good points were raised, so thank you.

I agree, this concept would not unfold well in canon. There would need to be a significant AU element for this to make sense. On a different (rather more realistic) note, I was honestly interested to see what ideas people would have about disability in the HP universe.

****** Given that moody has an upgrade of an eye, and that bones can be healed with a flick of a wand, I doubt disabilities are ever truly a problem. It takes dark magic for injuries to develop permanence and prosthetics seem to be sufficient replacements. The only true disabilities seem to be mental.

** I've seen this done in a fic before. Disability fics are of great interest to me, so I apologise for the long and rambly psot.

My opinion is that it's the sort of thing people without disability come up with 'because it sounds cool' but is actually quite offensive. It falls very much into the myth that having a disability gives you some sort of superpower to compensate. It doesn't.

In some cases, it makes it more likely that you learn or develop a skill. For example, I'm a very good lipreader despite never being formally taught, but it's exhausting and often inaccurate. I also have enough hearing to be able to do this. Interestingly, I was probably though not certainly hoh from birth but nobody picked up on it until I was 6. In any case, my parents thought there was something off about me - maybe autism. It did turn out that I had autism too, though...

Similarly, deaf people are typically more responsive to stimulus peripheral but not central vision than hearing people, but it's most pronounced in those with experience with British Sign Language a visual language. As opposed to simply because they're deaf.

​

Regarding blindness:

" So what about the sighted viewers? What did they take away from watching the series? The fact that this guy is a superhero sums it up: you can't be independent unless you have some kind of exceptional powers. This also encourages the myth that blind people have super senses (which is false -- we simply rely on them more as we don't have vision). "

The problem is, if you put a character with a disablity into a fic but then immediately - or shortly into the story - give them a super hero then it comes across as just using the disability as a sympathy bid.

Still, let's suppose it's done with consideration.

You have a baby born deaf, they have no concept of sound and likely miss the crucial period for learning spoken language as a 'first' language without intervention. They're not going to naturally learn legitimacy because they're too young to understand that others are different to them.

So, then they grow older and slowly, with great difficulty struggle learn to legitimise. You have two major issues:

- Many people perceive their thoughts in a language. Certainly, it seemed that Harry had access to Snape's memory as a fixed event, rather than as a perception. In that case, can you legitimise a thought in another language?

- If you are legitimising current thoughts as thoughts - do you perceive what the speaker says, or what they wanted to say? If someone is actively thinking about what someone else says, do you understand what they say or what their opinion/interpretation of that was?

So, perhaps you need someone who gradually lost their hearing after they learnt to speak but young enough that they learn legitimacy naturally. (Adults tend to need to be taught lipreading.) Potentially, in this case, the person never fully realised they went deaf until after they'd lost all their hearing - it seemed to them that other people were mumblers or so on.

The most common hearing loss is a slope with high frequencies the most deaf and low the least. So, they can still here some sounds quite well but carry the common misconception that deafness means you can't hear at all.

In this case, you probably end up with a period where they couldn't legitimise and slowly became more accurate. The result would be gaps in their language which may or may not go unnoticed. *Maybe some people thing something is 'off' but can't quite put their finger on it.* Plus, the character has a weird level and focus of eye contact. (Much like me concentrating on lips, lol.)

Much like lipreading, they use it to fill in gaps in what they can hear except that maybe it only works when they're looking directly at them, especially if it's a 1 to 1 conversation. Group conversations could be tricky because the speaker keeps looking at different people, so this person tries to keep to the best spot to manage eye contact with as many people as possible, except it can be quite dizzying because every so often those people go off on a tangential thought and suddenly you're led into potions class last Tuesday.

Maybe the person has a struggle trying to filter out the thoughts of a person, as sometimes they respond to what the person thought and not said, plus trying not to be too offended by the inside thoughts of many.

*** You make a really good point about the sort of daredevil-like tropes that seem to pop up in fiction with disabled characters. I understand that the myth of ‘super senses' are often a major issue with the portrayed of disabled characters, so thanks for pointing that out.

I was more posting this as a prompt because I have read fanfic that attempts to do this, and becomes instantly cliche. I think I read something where Harry went blind and then somehow acquired the ability to sense the ‘magical signature' of objects. Essentially, it completely erased the impact being blind would have had on him/his character arc and was, as you pointed out, a sympathy bid.

I also read something where Tom Riddle compensates for his difficulty understanding emotionally-driven actions by using legilimency, which made more objective sense and fit his character. I was wondering if someone had insight into how something similar would play out with a deaf/blind character.

Your response was sort of exactly what I was looking for, as in, how would something like this actually play out? Under what circumstances might this occur? What impacts/implications would it have? Etc. So thanks! Appreciate the long, thorough response.

**** I'm glad you found it helpful, I quite enjoy having to think around ideas.

The fic with Tom Riddle sounds very interesting. Do you have a link?

I agree that it's very hard to find fic that manages to cover disability without it becoming cliche. There's a few good ones but they tend to be hard to find, especially for blindness or deafness.
