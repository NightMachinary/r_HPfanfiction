** It happens midway through linkffn(7539141). Probably my favorite chapters in this story because they give a face to Harry's OC love interest who was nothing but a name until then, and a few other reasons.

*** I've heard that this is a fantastic story, but I've never been able to finish it. Is there a turning point where it gets interesting, or am I just the odd-one-out here?

**** The St. Mungo's bit was something of a turning point, but I wouldn't say that the story changes drastically after that. I'll also admit that I'm not the biggest fan. (Spoilery rant ahead).

For starters, I'd expect a zombie apocalypse story to be rife with suspense as the characters struggle to survive, but I don't see how lumbering, mindless zombies would pose any threat to a wizard equipped with Apparition and all sorts of spells. This is backed by the fact that the wizards are carefree enough to continue politicking in the Wizengamot and having fancy business dinners. (Despite that, people from Harry's team /did/ die to a zombie bite when scavenging for food, and this was before any of the [[/spoiler]["fast" zombies]] showed up too. Go figure.)

This changes in St. Mungo's flashback, where Harry and co are [[/spoiler][locked in a burning building, with all magical transportation blocked off]]. In this situation the zombies become a believable threat - I genuinely enjoyed it, but it's too bad you have to get through half of the story to reach this part.

Then there's the fact that I didn't give a damn about the Muggle OCs, especially considering the crap they pulled (even though, I get it, they were just trying to survive). Which in turn makes it hard to care about Harry's struggles in trying to help them.

Lastly, it takes the whole story for Harry to [[/spoiler][tell the Wizengamot to fuck off]], when his opponents weren't playing by the rules from the very beginning.

Well. Maybe I just have shit taste ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

** I don't know one about St. Mungos activating any defences, but I remember one about Healers being definite 'do not attack' during the wizarding wars.

The basic concept of it was that Madame Pomfrey had students in the Hospital Wing at Hogwarts sign a contractual agreement to not harm any healers ever, and if they did break it, then she could call upon it to undo all the healing they had ever received.

I didn't particularly like that fic, but it did remind me of something I saw once in a Simon Green book, where a sorcerer basically cut someone open, then sealed the wound with magic for 24 hours, then sealed it again for 24 hours, and again, and again, basically forcing his victim to come back every day and be his slave so he could get the healing and avoid dying of blood loss.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.
