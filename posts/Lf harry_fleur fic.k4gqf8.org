Cant remember much about the plot as a whole but it was set in 4th year and i think harry meets a girl onnthe express who just transferred to hogwarts. I believe shes a succubus and fleurs cousin. Inthink theres a rivalry between them as the both want harry. I never finished and I know this isnt much to go on but if anyone has any idea I'd be much appreciative.


** No idea, but you might try [[/r/harryandfleur/][r/harryandfleur/]]
