** I think it would be hilarious if they used "human" the same way. Like:

  I could barely control myself.... her pulsing vein was so distracting, my inner vampire wanted to rip her neck apart and spend all day relishing in her blood

** Honestly, the fanon creatures are way too tame. Gimme some real monsters which dig up graves to feast on the dead and wipe out entire villages and are consequently hunted. Gimme proper monsters and not some shitty urban fantasy. Hell in canon werewolves are a walking biological weapon, fanon makes them a shitty civil rights case which is condescending af since they need the MC to get things done.

** Indeed, most creatures shouldn't even realise that they are doing something "veela/vampire instinct". In a story of mine, animagus transformations leave psychological changes, and I wrote it so Hermione didn't even realise that she was acting more like a stereotypical cat after she mastered the transformation because it felt completely natural to her (and she was sure she wouldn't be affected anyway).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Crap. I always read that as “my veela (x) made me claim them” where I just figured they had left out the obvious (in my head) part of the sentence, as in “veela instincts” or “veela magic” or “veela-iness”...

Now that you've pointed it out I will never be able to read them the same again.

** Honestly I have pondered upon it often, considering I do like well written creature fics.

Additionally also Soulmate fanfics, they are prettying diverse (also not one-sided mostly unlike the fics we are discussing where only one character is a creature) but I am getting sidetracked.

Creature fics. Most of the writers want that ‘desperate love' ‘meant to be' stuff, like that one and only true mate, etc. I admit even I am guilty of reading a few of those (but only the well executed ones, well at least comparably). Also the instant attraction...

I often think writers justify creepy, weird acts by making them seem like an instinctual behaviour of the creature. (Edward the vampire anyone? I mean honestly if it was a normal older man sneaking every night in a girl's bedroom to watch her sleep, I doubt she would do anything but scream; and no, not the good kind.) Fantasy genre gives us a lot of leeway and it's not like I haven't read my fair share of those, so can't point fingers.

Also the varied concepts behind the creature fics, while some are tolerable, others are just; no, nope.

The one you are talking about is a wildly read trope. So it's there to stay, all one can do is filter according to the preference. Lol

** It can be used well as a tool to show how a character who isn't happy about the transformation conceptualises the changes. Disassociating the creature instincts from who they are bc they don't view themselves as being that creature, they view themselves as human with these frustrating additions. Then as the fic progresses and they come to accept the change, they'd start acknowledging and referring to the instincts as their own

** I'd really like vampires who slowly /dies/ as they try to resist drinking fresh blood, who can't drink blood from blood pack of a hospital, because it lacks magical life force or something ; I'd love werewolves who looks almost dead every time, not because they are miserable but because resisting their instincts is actually harder than just thinking "no, eating people is cringe" ; Veelas who can hardly resist their carnal urges, and whose anger threshold is so low even 5th year Harry would tell them to chill the fuck out.

I'd love sphinxes as mysterious guards created to rip apart a human easily if they cannot answer their riddles, whose sole concern isn't to live but to guard things ; chimaeras with only one throught process, to rip and tear and kill and bathe in the blood of the fallen enemies.

I'd kill for acromentulas as these intelligent, giant spiders with no concern for human life, where Aragog didn't listen to Hagrid because he hatched her but because she couldn't defeat his giant heritage as a child, and so was stuck into this lifelong servitude contract ; mermaids who cannot accept humans going underwater to explore their cities for no reasons ; centaurs as this mystical, forest-dwelling specie who tolerates humans because of ancient history, and only that.

​

In short, I would totally dig a story where creatures have a *story*, an *history*, and are not just victims of wizarding society.

** The only good Veela fanfic I've ever read is The Wrong Strain, which is a dramoine fic (not everyone's cup of tea, I know) but it was remarkable how well it was handled there. Reading this one actually highlighted to me the exact point that you're making.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.
