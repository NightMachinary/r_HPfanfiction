This is a pretty common trope I think but I found this one specific story that was quite well-written - and unfinished :(. I think it was only on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. In it, a young Harry accidentally apparates into Sirius' cell. This is before Hogwarts, so he abruptly learns about magic. Sirius tries to keep him entertained and safe - Harry runs laps around the cell, draws on the floor, stuff like that. I know there's also something about the food - him not liking it. Then one day Harry tries to run out the door when the dementors bring food and Sirius chases him to save him from the dementors and then they escape. I know that after escaping Sirius tracks down Remus and at one point Harry tries to put salt into hot chocolate.

If anybody could help, this has been annoying me for over a year and I'm only a few steps away from trawling through [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] with a fine-tooth comb.

Edit: Found it - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8588360/1/The-Dream-of-a-Waking-Man][The Dream of a Waking Man]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/321772/SashaBatTzion][SashaBatTzion]].

AU Complete. Sirius is suffering in Azkaban with 4 yr. old Harry, but not for long. Harry needs to go to Hogwarts. What about the Dementors and house elves? What about Remus? Can certain secrets be kept? Can Harry be kept safe?

Sorry if it's not, I just read the summary.

*** Ah I did it! Of course I find it the day after I post a Fic Search! It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8588360/1/The-Dream-of-a-Waking-Man][The Dream of a Waking Man]] - I'll warn you, it's still not finished.
