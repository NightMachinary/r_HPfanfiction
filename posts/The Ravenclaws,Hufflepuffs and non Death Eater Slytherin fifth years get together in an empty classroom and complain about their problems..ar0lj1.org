** "So, where are the other Slytherins?"

"You told me that I should only invite those who do not believe that Umbridge or the Dark Lord are right. Third year and above. And that means me and Lilith," Tracy Davis pointed out with a nod at the redhead next to her.

"Surely there have to be more," Padma replied after a long silence. "What about that cute sixth-year, Hobbs or something like that?"

"Hobbs wants to replace Montague in Umbridge's band of idiots."

"Greengrass?"

"Her parents make a lot of money with shady business, mostly poisons. And she is Parkinson's best friend. Do you really want to take that chance?" the second Slytherin asked evenly. "Zabini is the same."

"Surely there have to be more people in your house who complain about the state of things," Megan Jones threw in.

"Why should they? Most families have good connections to the Ministry and are supporting the Dark Lord on the side. For them, everything is peachy."

**** I try to give her minor antagonistic roles whenever possible. So far I've written "works for Voldemort to get her sister away from Malfoy", "overall bitch in the background" and "started the idea to make Harry a squib by preventing him from participating in the first task".

** The non-Death Eater Slytherins realise quickly, after talking to the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, that their problems stem from the fact that they don't do anything against the Death Eaters in their house. They decide to remedy that. A couple of "accidents" later, their problems are solved.

**** The prompt talks about Death Eaters in Slytherin - those are mass-murderers. Not "bigots" or "bullies". Not "mean girls". Death Eaters. I don't think there are too many of them around, and as the ambush in the Ministry showed, even the most skilled and experienced Death Eaters have trouble with a bunch of fifth years half their number. So, if the majority of the Slythernis gang up on the couple murderers in their house, it shouldn't be hard to deal with them.
