:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember this fix where when Harry gets selected instead of being jealous Cedric asks Harry ‚Äú So I guess we know how your going to get killed this year‚Äù and more or less Krum and Fleur go wtf and Cedric/ Harry one of the two explains Harry's Hogwarts career .


** Were Cedric and Harry friends before the triwizard thing? And was it a Drarry fic?

  COMPLETE: What if Harry and Draco were really friends behind all the insults and fights with each other? When would it have started and where would it end? Major spoilers for books 3,4,5,6. DMHP, FGL, BZSF, OWOC, HPCD
