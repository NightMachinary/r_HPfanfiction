**** Hmmm, that's a really hard fic to find ones similar to. Here's a really obscure one I remember [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9255377/28]].

 

Other than that check out the stories linked in this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4l2mep/lf_stories_like_deprived/]]

 

For ones where harry is a good duelist check out these two:

linkffn(12740667) linkffn(10752276)

 

In this one (Part 1 of 6 part story) he grows up in an orphanage and ends up killing with accidental magic and comes to term with killing and becomes more than ok with it later on. It's actually my favorite series I've read in a while. linkffn(12867536)

Edit: Bot isnt working for last one here it is, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]]

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Shezza's denarian trilogy fits this pretty well. Dresden files crossover though, and it is rather old and the originator of a bunch of tropes so it may feel a tad cliche. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]] (I've been told FF bot doesn't work on mobile).
