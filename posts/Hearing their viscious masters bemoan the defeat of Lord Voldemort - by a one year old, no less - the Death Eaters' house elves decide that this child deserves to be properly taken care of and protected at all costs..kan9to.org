** The Day After Voldemort's Semi-Death (Not that they know this, of course)

After overhearing their various bad masters complain, whine, moan, and groan about the Death of their Master, a full fifteen perfectly healthy house-elves decided that Harry Potter, whoever he was, needed to be protected and cared for, especially since his parents were dead. The elves met when they were out grocery shopping for their master's homes.

In order to know what happens next, one must understand something about house-elves. House-elves, unlike wizards, are incapable of restraining their magical auras. However, their auras are on a different frequency than wizards, so wizards can't feel them, but they can feel a wizard's. Their auras allow them to act like telepaths when they are in each other's physical presence, eliminating the need for speech and creating the beautiful chaos of a place like Hogwarts Kitchens. This is also the second reason for their bad grammar, besides the lack of education.

They communicated among themselves, but none of them knew any Potter Elves, nor did they know where the Potter child had been taken or who had done the taking, so they didn't know how to find him. Then one brilliant elf had the idea to send an empty envelope with an elven-tracking spell and a mail-ward slipper (to allow the owl carrying it to find the boy through any wizard mail-wards. That wouldn't work if it was Goblin Wards, but they didn't think there would be any, because that would mean a Goblin knew his location. Goblins couldn't be ktrusted to keep.

*** I must say, the house elves here kinda remind me of the Handmaids from The Handmaid's Tale. Weird thought!

*** any secrets without a stringent contract. They'd sell them to the highest bidder without a thought, and the elves knew it.

So the owl went on its way. A full eight hours later, they found the child under a powerful but already weakening set of Blood Wards, in a /closet/, of all bloody things. He was dirty, hungry, cold, uncomfortable, had several adult-sized hand-shaped bruises from where the /insects/ in this house had been rough with him. They agreed to call in the oldest elf they knew (for his expertise in wizard wards).

When he got there, they explained the situation to him. He promptly stripped all the Wards off the boy except the Blood Wards, then anchored the blood wards to the beating of his heart rather than the presence of his mother's blood and their love. This way the Wards would continuously gain strength every time the boy's heartbeat. They wove together general Anti-Portkey, Anti-Apparation, Anti-Broom, and Anti-Floo wards around him, where the only ones that would work would be ones he intentionally allowed to occur. Then they added a Dueling Dome, a Stealth Suite Stripper (removes all stealth spells in range), and a Harmful Hatred Hater (to protect against those with malicious intentions, it would be like he was under Fidelius or a powerful Notice-Me-Not). Only after all this was done and blended into the Blood Wards did they tug on the strands of magic bonding him to the three remaining Potter Elves.

**** Following the strands, two lead the elves to what was once the Stately Home of All Potters, left a charred ruin when Harry's Grandparents died suddenly during a Death Eater Attack 'Of Dragonpox.' (Saying that they had disagreed with a dark lord and died agonizing deaths just wouldn't do in polite company.)

Harry's Grandparents were old and not afraid of death when it came for them, ordering their elves to preserve the family legacies and themselves. One of the elves was buried under rubble, but caught himself in a stasis charm. The second is inside some vault, beyond the skills of the elves to reach. When the dying elf is awakned, an elvish oath convinces him to release the locks so the second elf can serve the last member of their house. It is his final act of service to House Potter.

***** The third led them to a very young female elf being raised by the pair of Longbottom Elves. Very conveniently, today is the day that Bellatrix and the others broke into the Longbottom Manor for information.

The five elves on property managed to defend the place and the Longbottoms, capturing all of the Death Eaters (including Barty Crouch Jr, who, in canon, originally escaped during those arrests, and was arrested some time later)

** Huh, maybe the house elves were the ones protecting Harry from people wanting to kill him. (I refuse to believe that everyone sent to kill him was stopped by blood wards that do not protect Harry when he's at school)

*** That's interesting because I wasn't really sure how Kreacher in particular would behave. On the one hand, he does seem quite loyal to the Black family, but Voldemort is the reason Regulus died, after all. Decisions, decisions
