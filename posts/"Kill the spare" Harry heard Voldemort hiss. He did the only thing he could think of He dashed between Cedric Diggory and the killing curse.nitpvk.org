Harry frowns, looking around at what appeared to be Kings Cross.

"What? What happened?" He asked, confused. He looked around, "Hello? Anyone?"

Suddenly, two figures appeared.

"Mum... dad!" Harry cried, tears in his eyes, as he rushed up to hug them.

"We are so proud of you, dear." Lily murmured, petting Harry's hair.

"You were so brave, you really showed him!" James said, a proud look on his face, his chest puffing up with pride.

Harry pulled away, rubbing the tears from his eyes (When had he started crying?)

"I'm... dead, aren't I? Is this it then?" Harry asked unsure how to feel about it.

"Well... it can be, if you would like for it to be. But, you get a choice." Lily said, giving Harry a small smile.

"A choice?" Harry echoes, confused. Suddenly an inhuman wail was heard, causing Harry to shudder violently. "What was that?!" He asked.

James grimaced, as he looked at Lily. "Apparently, that night when Voldemort fell, his soul was weakened and he unknowingly created a Horcrux inside you." James told him.

Harry's eyes widened comically wide, and opened his mouth with a perfect O of surprise. "A horcrux... that... that explains the bond I had with him!" Harry said, shuddering at the thought of being connected to a monster like Voldemort.

"Yes, it isn't common for a person to create as many Horcruxes as he did, and so it weakened his soul. Horcruxes being dark magic, definitely didn't help." Lily told her son.

"How... how do you know this? Is this real or....?" Harry trailed off uncertainly.

"It's as real as you want it to be." James replied.

Harry frowns, but doesn't press further. "What happens now?" he whispers.

"Voldemort's soul inside of you has been destroyed. You should no longer have that connection with him. You may go back to the land of the living, or you may move on. The choice, is yours." Lily told him, a small smile on her face.

Harry frowns, uncertain as what to do. To see his parents again... but Ron, and Hermione... he couldn't leave them. "I want to go back.... sorry." Harry says softly.

"Never apologize for that, Harry." Lily says.

Harry gives them both a hug, lasting even longer than the first.

"No one will expect you to come back, so that will be used as an advantage. But we will show up, if you connect your wand with Voldemort's, together, in order to protect you." James told him, ruffling Harry's hair, causing him to turn away, but smile.

"Thank you, both of you, for everything... I love you." Harry said.

"We love you too, son." James said, a smile on his face.

"Go on, now." Lily said. "Make sure to use the trophy to get back." Harry nods, and in a flash, he's gone.

Edit: In this, I'm using the fact he has an extra soul be the reason why he returned to the living. I also mean that Harry didn't know what a Horcrux was, but I suppose I should have had James and Lily explain what they were better... if anyone knows of a way to have them explain what a Horcrux is better, please let me know and I will add it in.


** But wasn't the fact that Voldemort used his blood in that ritual the reason why Harry lived ?

*** Yeah. I think that was Dumbledore's theory and why he thought there was a possibility Harry would survive being cursed by Voldemort.

But in fanfic we can come up with other theories. (Some would even be arguably better than this.)

*** That's fanon. Other theories include: Harry was the Master of Death, the killing curse only takes one soul the other can to back, prophecy fate bullshit, Deus ex Machina magic bullshit, horcrux anchor each other..

So really it can be whatever you wish, of course him being the master of death wouldn't work in this prompt because the only hollow he came into contact with is the cloak.

**** “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!” - Dumbledore, Deathly Hallows

It is absolutely canon that Harry lived because Voldemort used his blood to resurrect himself.

**** So Dumbledore's own plan is Fanon? Dumbledore had a victorious gaze when he heard Harry's blood had been used in the ritual to bring back Voldemort. I don't see why that wouldn't be the reason why Harry lived if that news made Dumbledore so happy.

** I'm of the opinion that Harry probably wouldn't have survived that curse. The good news is that Cedric might now be able to take down Pettigrew, and with that, capture Voldemort's "main" soul and prevent his return.

That, in turn, would prevent the whole civil war and takeover and save thousands of innocent lives. But, it hinges on Cedric being able to take down Pettigrew.
