Not that it's changed, but where his canon teaching style has a reason and isn't just him being incompetent.


** Prince of Slytherin runs with the OWLs and NEWTs being literally the same as what he does in class. The exams are "here is instruction, now make potion," so his teaching style essentially mimics that. The potions made within the class can have volatile effects, but nothing we see isn't quickly fixed with magic. You can learn the techniques by rote and succeed in the standardized exams, which are structured in a similar manner. Learning about interactions, creating new potions and whatnot is upper level stuff for 7th year students and not actually covered in the NEWT, which is still rote creation of complex potions. This is mostly explained when Marcus asks Snape if he can take the NEWT level potions class and Snape claims that it's unnecessary if he just wants the certification from the exam.

Think of it like real life chemistry- chem students in high school learn about functional groups, naming, some stoich and math, and some basics about acids/bases and titration and whatnot. It's all rote memorization. They do some fairly limited experiments to give them broad exposure to certain topics. But learning about /why/ certain interactions happen, the theory of making new compounds from scratch, some of the more complex physics and math isn't covered until college level chemistry. And there's so much more to tackle with stuff like computational chemistry, high throughput assays, entire subfields like Physical Chem and Biochem, which are very unlikely to be mentioned at all in high school level chemistry even though those are critical to "real" chemists.

The mobile game also shows his teaching differently, but that's not exactly a high degree of canonicity.

** I mean snapes teaching is shit. With some small changes you could turn him into a good no nonsense professor but he is not a good teacher in canon. Giving no theoretical knowledge in an extremely volatile class, as we are shown, is dangerous.

*** It's not really canon to say that, out of all the classes we see it's not like JKR describes all the classes, she really only goes into detail when something of relevance happens. Snakes class was probably more like a chem class with labs and since that's when all the accidents and brewing happens that's the only time she writes it. In fact, the first potions class Harry ever takes points towards Snape lecturing as a basis before brewing and then criticizing their work. Sure, he's still a massive dick when he does it but its a deeply integrated fanon concept to say that's all he does. And that's ignoring the fact that reading for homework along with numerous essays they complain about also points towards it being a respectable class just with an incredibly mean and biased professor.

*** Canonically they do get theoretical knowledge- IIRC we see the main characters complaining about having to write essays for Potions class, which implies that there is /some/ theoretical background that they're expected to understand, even if it's all on the application side. There are entire books on single charms, it wouldn't be odd for there to be a similar level of material available for potions. As the readers, we just don't get the specifics.

** Are you asking for fics that don't bash Snape, or for ones that prominently feature potions?

*** Nothing so specific as that. Just any explanation as to why his teaching method might be reasonable - even if only by contrast. We only have Harry's perspective in canon, and he's biased from the start by their animosity.

It doesn't have to be a main plotline or anything. I'm mostly just curious to see if anyone has tried to explain it rather than change or deride it.

**** Snape's teaching method isn't treated as bad in canon. It's his being an asshole that makes him a poor professor not his inability to teach.
