I'm looking for any kind of story that focuses on either Dobby or Harry and dobby doing dastardly deeds and plotting ponderous schemes together and generally having fun and/or heart warming moments together. Bonus if it's related to Christmas and at least 50k+ words.


** Hermione took her year mates (4th or 5th year Gryffindor) to the movies and saw Revenge Of The Sith, and Harry takes it to heart.

A few months later Harry summons Dobby. Dobby appears in a white armor with yellow markings and Harry tells him to execute order 66.

Over the next few weeks Hogwarts actually became the safest place in the UK, while every pureblood and Half-Blood with the Dark Mark gets gun down. Dobby use a Barrett M82A1 with the 50 cal bullets to tear Voldemort into shreds. Because of not using magic (besides on the sniper so it didn't kill Dobby) his horcruxes just stop working Phantom Menace style.
