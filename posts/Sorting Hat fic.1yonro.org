I enjoyed The Lie I've Lived ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]] ) and wondered if there are any fics that portray the sorting hat similarly. Can anyone give a rec please?


** I didn't find many sorting hat centered fics in my library, and I think they are all fairly short...

    There are people who are easy to sort, and there are people who are more difficult. And then there's Fred Weasley... Well, how hard can it be to sort him?

** Forests of Valbone has a very active Sorting Hat. Angry Harry and the Seven had some interesting sorting hat at the very end.

** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6238824/1/The-Sorting-Hat-s-Stand][The Sorting Hat's Stand]] by landstradd. It's abandoned though. And it has a few silly elements like way too many familiars, but it's ignorable. It also features a similar triwizard tournament to jbern's. One of the action chapters for the triwiz is possibly the most awesome I've ever read in fanfiction.

He started a rewrite that fixed some of my gripes about the first one, but quit over a year ago before he got to the good parts.

*** Lanstradd rewrote that story. Though that seems to be abandoned as well it is edited a little better and advances the story a bit further. I'll just link it here so people willing to read it can get the most out of it.
