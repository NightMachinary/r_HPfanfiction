** ...and any sufficiently analysed magic is indistinguishable from technology!

/\/self promotion**

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] series, Kryptonian-tech is so advanced that it is best described as Clarktech/borderline Magitech, able to generate and direct pure magic with a side-effect of FTL optical data transfer.

In the Star Wars crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]], Nicholas and Perenell Flamel come out of retirement in order to meet a real alien, Ahsoka Tano, and join her quest to return to the stars. Cue the use of magic to (temporarily) replace Star Wars tech for things like blasters, LAAT/i's and AT-TEs.

*** You ever thought about doing a sequel to Harry Tano? I'd really like to see them return to the SW story and completely change the Rebellion.

BTW I really like your stories, except for the Institute Saga, which I could never get into.
