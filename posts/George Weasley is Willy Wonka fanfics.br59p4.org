Okay, so I don't know how many of you have heard that fan theory, about George Weasley going back in time and becoming Willy Wonka of the Chocolate Factory, but it intrigues me to no end. I was wondering if anybody had any fics that use that idea, preferably going through when he chooses to do it, and how he does it.

â€‹

If anybody has fics that are like that, I would greatly appreciate links to them. Thanks in advance.

** That seems like it would be incredibly sad if you use the part with familial estrangement like in the 2005 movie. I can't really picture such a oneshot as anything other than really really sad.

**** Wikipedia says otherwise, and I remember watching it when I was about 7. It's a Depp movie too.

** They don't look much alike, by the books' descriptions.

I like the idea though. Could it have happened in an attempt to save Fred?
