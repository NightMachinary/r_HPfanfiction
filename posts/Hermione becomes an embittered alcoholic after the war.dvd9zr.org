*** Why not have both? Drunk Hermione starts complaining loudly at the pub, and some people start agreeing with her. They start organizing and ask her to join as she was the first person to raise the issue in their minds. Hermione is like fuck it why not and goes asking for the ride.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
