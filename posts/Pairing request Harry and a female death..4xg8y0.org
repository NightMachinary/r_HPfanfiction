***** Sandman is a graphic novel series by Neil Gaiman, and possibly one of the greatest comics ever written. (Seriously, it's up there with Maus and Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns.) It's the other half of the crossover above. The titular Sandman (also called Morpheus, or just Dream) is one of the Endless who are basically the anthropomorphic personifications of the fundamental forces of the universe, and Dream basically both governs and *IS* everything to do with sleep, dreaming, and boundless creativity. Death in the comic and the story above is his big sister. She's awesome. Does that answer your question? I could talk about Sandman all day.

  "Words have a magical power. They can bring either the greatest happiness or deepest despair." For a magical-less child, this truth is alive in shocking clarity. Squib Harry has been rejected by his world, his family, but is he really as magic-less as they believe or will he find a power in words that has never been known? Death is determined to show his Master his true worth and purpose.

  There was no such thing as the Master of Death. By collecting the three Deathly Hallows, Horatia Potter became the Heiress of Death. It was only a matter of time before she became Death herself because Thanatos wanted to retire. Meanwhile, Hades had tired of his charade of marriage.

**** With crossover fics this isn't even that far out there. They put it in the world where gods and incarnations are known to be able to have physical forms. It's an idea I actually like and I can't be the only one, so of course someone with some actual talent has made a fic of it. Like the other fic that was been posted in this topic.

  Harry is the Master of Death, but what if he became its Master earlier than book 7? What if Death was a woman? And what if she came to visit him? Not only does this change his perspective on life, not only does it shift his attitude but it also removes the veil of deception from his eyes. Watch as Harry becomes the Master of Death. And nabs several hot babes on the way. Harry/Harem
