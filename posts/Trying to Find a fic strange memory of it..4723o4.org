I'm trying to find a certain fic that I know i've read in the past two months. I remember something COMPLETELY Random from the story as well: Harry makes oatmeal and bacon sandwiches in the morning. I THINK he isn't sorted into Gryffindor, but I could be wrong. Harry was raised... differently too. I don't remember if it's a time travel fic. Harry is very blase about ... everything. But ugh, oatmeal and bacon sandwiches.
