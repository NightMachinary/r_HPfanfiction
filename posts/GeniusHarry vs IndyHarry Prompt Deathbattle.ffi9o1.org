Who would win. Write a short story about these two battling it out, either due to misunderstandings, or something else.


** Indy!Harry, hands down.

His plot armor is almost as impenetrable as his basilisk-hide armor.

*** If basilisk-hide is impenetrable, then how do they make robes out of it?

**** Didn't you know? The Hogwarts Library has a spell for it! And there's even a spell that returns the armor into hide form. You know, in case you grow up or something.

Oh shit, that means GeniusHarry knows the spell.

GeniusHarry wins!

** GeniusHarry, his logically impossible ability with magic, hight intellect and cunning would let him shot-down IndyHarry in the middle of the mandatory three pages discus about how he suffered more than anyone else in the world and thus deserves to win the fight

** Genius Harry may have an unreasonably high IQ but there is one thing he doesn't have... A dimension spanning, time altering, sentient training trunk courtesy of a long dead relative guarded by only the most bloodthirsty of warrior goblins, who's name indy Harry remembered!

** Well !Indy harry needs to get strong enough to kill Voldemort in the next chapter; so the 30 chapters after that can be dedicated to building !Indy's harem, and making people like Dumbledore, or Ron, look dumb and wrong. So I would say !Indy harry fuses with !Genius harry using a spell they found in book laying about on the ground of their vault. This forms !Super Harry, and then they fuse with Riddles horcrux. Going even further beyond, and transforming into !Super Harry 3.
