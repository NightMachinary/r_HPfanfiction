I am reading a fic and wondering if it was canon, with Sirius constantly on Harry about girls. I don't remember him talking about it in the books, but that could be just fuzzy memories. But I know that a lot of fics harp on it (constantly) Sirius' obsession with Harry getting laid.

Also Sirius immaturity, was it really that blatant or have I just glossed that over in my memories as well. I know the Snivellous thing and Christmas depression, yes, but I mean the constant, I am a two year old throwing a temper tantrum thing.

That's probably at least partly, if not mostly fanon. Sirius himself never broached the subject with anyone that I can recall. That being said, I suspect that may be based on the presence of faded Muggle posters of girls in bikinis in Sirius's bedroom at Grimmauld Place(per /DH/).

Yeah, if the fic has got Sirius throwing DJT-style manbaby-tantrums, that's definitely fanon. Sirius was more mature than that apart from the continued animosity with Snape, and Snape was no better in that respect.

**** Neither do I. I mean, there was probably at least a certain degree of interest - what boy that age /doesn't/ show interest in that sort of thing? I know I did. But that alone doesn't make him a womanizer.

And yeah, I also think that it was at least partly, if not mostly, something he did just to piss off his parents.

***** Most boys will show interest, but not all boys have multiple girlfriends at once because they're attracted to multiple ones at the same time. Sometimes this cliche stretches to such a wide extent that he becomes a cheater because he's attracted to everything that moves. I mean come on.

**** I have very little experience with /South Park/, but from the little I have seen, there's not much difference between the two examples - if any.

Now then, to get off that tangent and back to Padfoot, I honestly don't understand why anyone would want to make him either a playboy or a whiner, because he's certainly not the latter. He's deeply troubled, but not a whiner. Not in the least. As for the former...well, he was handsome and popular as a teen, but I've known guys who were both and definitely were not the womanizing sort. And there's no evidence in the book that supports the idea that either he or James were womanizers, though I'd imagine they probably didn't have too much trouble in that regard.

** Sirius was stated to be very handsome, implying that lots of girls wanted to date him. However, nowhere whatsoever does it say that he was a womaniser or a borderline pervert. Just because someone is handsome doesn't make him a womaniser. Period.

Also, Sirius isn't JUST a womaniser in fanon. He's sometimes downright portrayed as a pervert. A good example of this is Every Other Midnight and I don't like that fanfiction in general for multiple reasons. But the way Sirius is portrayed? Something as innocent as teaching a class for a single period turned into a pervy class. No, just no. Nothing indicated that in canon.

He had multiple posters in his bedroom walls, but it's implied that he hung those up to piss off his mother mostly. Harry once wished that Sirius would pop up and give him advice about girls but that was just in a moment of panic and feeling pretty frustrated. It was a pretty random line as well.

Fanon Sirius on the whole is pretty messed up. He's always this frustrating cliche that is so far away from his Canon self. He acts like a child, is a pervert, an idiot, untalented, foolish and stupid and his humor is so far off from his Canon self taht sometimes I wonder if these people have read the books.

It's mostly found in the Wolfstar ship where people really want a strong Sirius/Remus contrast but just because Remus is mature doesn't mean that Sirius should be a child. He can be more light hearted, which he is in the books, but it's not just Wolfstar, it's most ships in lots of fandom that have this wide spread notion that opposites attract and that means they have to be opposites in a very exaggerated and stark way. I never liked this tbh.

** Almost entirely fanon. As others have mentioned there are the bikini posters in his room, but we also get this line in Snape's Worst Memory: "a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he [Sirius] didn't seem to have noticed."

** Oof, you definitely opened a can of worms here. Excuse me while I rant:

One of the things that has bothered me since Order of the Phoenix dropped was the hateful response towards Sirius and the love/sympathy for Snape. I almost wondered if I had read the same book because I was so completely baffled by it.

Sirius is an insanely complicated character and, I would argue, the most human. A privileged child who breaks away from the values pushed on him since birth to do what he thinks is right is an amazing show of morality and strength of character. That being said, he's doesn't come out unscathed and perfect. And honestly, most of his faults can be traced- and not outlandishly so- back to those events. Sirius is mean to Snape; that's true and fair. But at the time, he was desperately trying to push away everything that Snape represented and as a teenager, probably did not handle that in the most mature and reasonable way. As adults, there is still animosity there, but Sirius still acts at least somewhat professional by letting Snape, a man he does not trust, into his home and exposing his whereabouts for the greater good. Sirius is mean to Kreacher; that's also true. However, Sirius is forced back into his childhood home where he experienced loads of trauma and has to deal with a house elf who idolizes the one responsible for that trauma. And it's not like Snape and Kreacher are exactly innocent victims either.

As a convict who spent thirteen years locked up on a false conviction trying his best to set an example and be there for his best friend's son, he in no way does a bad job of that. He takes Harry seriously which is something that Harry obviously appreciates as he expresses many times wanting to talk only to Sirius. He never writes to Arthur Weasley, who J.K. proclaimed is the "only good father in the series", he doesn't write to Lupin, he writes to Snuffles. Sirius may be a bit hypocritical but after everything he's been through, the fact that effort is always there is, at least I think, commendable.

But he bullied Snape as a teenager in the 1970s, so the only thing that his character is worth is a potential gay relationship with Remus and to help Harry with the ladies. And it genuinely bothers me to see one of my favorites reduced down to that in the fanon.

*** Thank you for writing very much what I feel. He's my favourite character and the one that for all his flaws, brought me into fanfiction and kept me here. I always want to defend him in these threads but I feel like a one-trick pony when I do (I am. But anyway I enjoyed your post).

*** People also forget that he was insanely calculated, intelligent, and downright cruel in his moments. He wasn't some goofy, head-in-the-clouds jokester that he's always portrayed as.

He was referred to by many people-along with James-as being among the cleverest and most magically attuned students Hogwarts had in a while. People just kinda gloss over that bc, “XD dogfather random.”

** Pottermore had a backstory/short story snippet on Remus and Tonks' relationship before they got married, and at one point, Tonks tries to confess her love to Remus, who is shocked at being the object of her affections, and remarks he would have thought that she'd be going after Sirius instead of him, the disgusting, too old, werewolf. It's been moved or deleted, but here is the quote:

#+begin_quote
  Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend *(‘He always got the women.').* At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You'd know perfectly well who I've fallen for, if you weren't too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.'
#+end_quote

From [[https://www.hypable.com/tonks-lupin-relationship-history-remus-patronus-pottermore-jk-rowling/][this secondary site.]]

So it's /kind of/ canon that Sirius likes ladies. Also canon that Sirius is 100% A STRAIGHT MAN, because fuck anyone who liked the idea of Wolfstar before JKR got on Twitter.

*** I think him believing Tonks was referring to Sirius was not just that Sirius could get any girl he wanted,but also seeing himself as worse than he was while putting Sirius on a pedestal.Sirius spent 12 years getting the SUCC from dementors and was obviously very depressed and cynical.(which most fics seem to gloss over because immature manchild=le funny XD)

** He was handsome and popular in his school years, funny too. So I guess people assume he must have been a man slut and would try to pass his view down on Harry. Maybe they also assume he and James had that dynamic, until James met Lily and settled down.

I don't think there is direct support for it in the book, but Sirius we meet is quite troubled and the books are quite chaste.

** Definitrly fanon. Sirius didn't even ask Harry about the Yule Ball (HP's first ever date) when he meets Harry in the cave. And later, in OotP, he was only concerned with HP's well being, both physical and mental.

Sirius being obsessed with sleeping around is one of the shittier fanon tropes, along with Fred&George being "pranksters", James and co being "pranksters", Veela allures, and Sirius somehow being reckless and/or irresponsible.

Sirius made exactly one decision that was reckless - chasing after Peter without letting anyone know of the change in SKs. Even then, he'd just the dead bodies of his best friend of over a decade and his wife when he started hunting Peter. And he certainly didn't expect Albus and Remus to throw him under the train either.

** His "obsession" with Harry is canon! We are talking about a guy who managed to evade the Aurors and had left Britain (he sent Harry a mail-carrying parrot, those aren't nativ to Britain!), but returned later on to be closer to Harry in case he was needed (seriously, my good man: Clear your freaking name first, then you can talk about helping your godson!
