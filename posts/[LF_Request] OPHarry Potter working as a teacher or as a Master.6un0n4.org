#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** At first a lot of people (including me) recommended it here because IMO it's not a bad story. Then seeing so many recommendations, people started reading it with very very high expectations and because the story is just an above average one, it didn't met those expectations. Also last few chapters are... meh. Not bad but could be better. So those who got disappointed with the story started saying that since this was not the very good story they were expecting, everyone should stop recommend it.

I enjoyed it but my tastes are different from the majority of this sub I guess. For example I don't like the 'A Black Comedy by nonjon', the most recommended story here, so... Wind Shear was not the best story I read this year or something but it was a nice one.

****** That is best asked to people who have actually read it. But I imagine this fic is the typical heavy-handed OP Harry story in which the world and characters exist to wank Harry's awesomeness. It is a common fandom disease, and very prevalent in fics of this type. And I have followed enough discussions about it to know that the writing and dialogue are very mediocre.
