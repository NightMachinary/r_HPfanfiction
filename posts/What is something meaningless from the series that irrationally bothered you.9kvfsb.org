What is a meaningless event from the series that really irritated you? Not a plot hole or a person necessarily but something that just rubbed you the wrong way. You don't have to have any reason other than just I wish that hadn't been said/done/etc.

Personally, I was always really pissed that Remus and Tonks didn't wait for Harry to get married. I mean, Harry is the last remnant of Remus' friends and he is Harry's last connection to his parents. They make him godfather when Tonks gets pregnant! Now Harry can never tell Teddy about their wedding. And just ugh. They couldn't wait a few days/weeks to get married?

excuse me for not wanting to believe that the Potters were utter morons and fools. Giving away their "get out of jail free card" (cloak) and not even writing a will, when it's likely that they both die and have no close relatives (and in fact have some relatives that they want nothing to do with) is completely unbelievable, unless they have some kind of severe brain damage.

Edit: Regarding the letter from Lily to Sirius: Sometimes I wish Rowling hadn't tried to cover her plotholes with ridiculous rationalizations (there's a lot of that in DH too, like the Ghoul in Ron clothes). If this didn't exist I could make up something on my own, like that the cloak was lost or stolen and Dumbledore found it later, claiming that he "borrowed it" in order to spare Harry the story. Anything is better than "Yeah, Dumbledore was just using it as a legwarmer, while it could have been useful to us, but James got real antsy about it, so it all makes sense!!111".

In fact, we don't even know what Gamp's law is. But it is related to how food can't be conjured from nothing. So we can speculate that there are four other things that can't be conjured from nothing or transfigured from something that doesn't possess its special quality.

Honestly, while I agree that Harry and Ginny don't have many scenes together, whenever they do talk (at least from book 4 onwards) they actually do have the kind of dynamic you'd expect from a future couple. There aren't really any rememberable grand gestures, but they have a tendency to laugh at each other's antics and just have fun when they're in a scene together, which is arguably one of the most important qualities of a functioning relationship.

I think the reaction to Ron's poisoning overshadows ingesting the love potion more than anything. Harry is quite worried about Ron before he takes him to see Slughorn as he notices something is off. Perhaps love potions are normally obvious so it's clear to most people that something is wrong so they can get it fixed. I'm also pretty positive its noted that they would wear off eventually (or you have to keep replenishing the victim). We don't have much experience beyond Merope using it and Ron.

Love, as repeated again and again, in the series is just as powerful and dangerous as any other force. That's the backbone of Rowling's story.

He gets upset with Umbridge when she grabs Marietta's shoulders to start shaking her a bit. Apparently he takes the well-being of his students extremely seriously and doesn't want anyone even slightly abusing them?

But then a few minutes later he congratulates Kingsley on mindscrewing Marietta with a well timed Obliviate, so I guess he doesn't actually care about protecting his students at all.

I get the impression that Rowling doesn't take the problem of mental sanctity seriously. The world of Harry Potter seems to think that removing someone's free will, even their entire identity, by altering/deleting their memories is no big deal. In reality the concept ought to be horrifying, a fate worse than death.

They can heal and regrow bones with a potion, cure most surface wounds with Dittany, but issues that have a neurological or behavioral basis are beyond them. Putting it down to stagnant technomagical development sounds too much like Mugglewank, aka the "Muggles Do It Better" trope you often see in Indie!Harry and Indie!Hermione fanfiction where they end up dual-wielding wands and guns.

I could probably make a list:

- Arianna Dumbledore's "fits" after being physically assaulted.

- Tom Riddle and his fear of psychologists. Mrs. Cole /knew/ he needed help.

- Most patients in the Janus Thickey Ward.

- Ginny Weasley's post-Diary recovery.

- Dolores Umbridge and the "clip-clop" sounds played for humor.

Bertha Jorkins is quite thoroughly Obliviated by Barty Crouch. An incorporeal Voldemort and Pettigrew are able to 'break' the Obliviation, allowing them access to the memories of Barty Jr being alive and not in Azkaban.

So whatever memories they cover up are still in there, they're just very well hidden. And when it comes to trauma, that's not exactly a recipe for great mental health.

Sometimes the brain can do this itself in cases of trauma. Repressed memories are the controversial one but dissociative amnesia is heavily linked to trauma. But that doesn't really do anything to stop any other trauma symptoms.

I don't find it so ludicrous that in the Wizarding World, they are behind where we think they should be in this instance. Also keeping in mind that the books take place in a world that is 20-30ish years behind (the action of the books occurs between the years 1991 and 1998).

You're right for the rest of it but as Kodiak said... Horcruxes, the Resurrection Stone, /Priori Incantatem/, ghosts. Souls definitely are a thing. The question is how they work.

And I don't think there's much rationalisation needed for hand-me-downs either: in all the transfiguration classes we see, only Hermione really ever succeeds in fully "completing" a transfiguration such that the resulting object has no trace of the original object. It's not a rationalisation or retcon to say that transfiguration is incredibly difficult to master, it was always a fact of the series.

It'd be more realistic if they banned expansion charms on houses in muggle areas, or on houses without muggle repelling charms. I don't see a reason why a place like Malfoy Manor would ever have visiting muggles, or why adult wizards can't have expanding luggage if they're careful.

Voldemort only needs one warm enemy body for the resurrection. He'd prefer to have Harry, but if plans go awry then the other contestants are enemy enough to make do. Thus, Cedric is a "spare".

Since Sirius Black is the obvious choice and who could probably evade capture from everyone except Voldemort, using him as the focus of Death Eater attention worked as another layer of protection on top of the Fidelius.

1. Mayhaps the Fidelius Charm was improved between 1980/1981 and the use of it during Harry's "school" years.

This makes sense. Dumbledore may have already been Secret Keeper for the Order (though not at 12 Grimmauld Place, though could it be modified in runtime?), and maybe a soul only "has room" for one secret - much as, say, an Arduino has only room for one sketch at a time.

Now, why didn't James/Lily become the secret keepers? I think it's in case one of them went crazy and went out - simply walking out of or in through the door would have revealed their location to anyone who happened to be watching. Having someone else as secret keeper would mean that if one of them went out for whatever reason, they wouldn't be able to divulge the secret accidentally.

Both of these quotes are taken from Pottermore or the Wiki. And there are apparently 11 old, established schools but we only have knowledge of 8 of them.

So I don't think it's too much to presume that the majority of Indian and Chinese wizards attend some large institute and many others are home schooled. We don't know what the population of wizards are in these countries are.

No worries. I haven't read too too much about the Wizarding Schools but I am rather fascinated by them. I wish we would eventually get a story set in Japan or something :) I think there's a general risk of exposure for every child. Clearly magical education is somewhat of an issue in the greater world.

** Thestral invisibility criteria - Why didn't Harry see thestrals after Quirrel's death? Is it just because he passed out before he saw him die? What about the dead unicorn or the basilisk? Diary Tom? The dementor memory of his mom's death?

Speaking of which - Quirrel actually died at Harry's hands. While the possesion basically guaranteed the same outcome, I'm still annoyed how lackadaisically it was brushed over by Dumbledore. I didn't even get it when I was reading the books as a kid. This ties in with the lacking approach to mental health the Wizarding world seems to have in general.

House elf magic. Okay, so supposedly it's different enough from wizard magic that the same rules don't apply for them (Kreacher disapparates from cave), but somehow the Ministry detected the use of magic by Dobby (floating cake) and mixed it up as Harry's magic use. And Winky is presumed capable of using a wand. What?

Pranks. Is this a boarding school thing?

Parseltongue as a magical gift from the horcrux. I think Dumbledore was projecting here instead of making the sensible connection to it being tied to specific family lines (magical heredity), like, oh, I don't know, metamorphagus Tonks when neither her parents nor grandparents had the gift. In regards to the whole /what is a soul anyway/ thing - beware, wild speculating : do all soul shards have the exact same magical footprint as the original at the time of the horcrux ritual? Because the diary also spoke parseltongue and Voldemort also retained the gift. How can it be a "shard" then anyway? Is it just a copy of the current self? Then if the soul gets destabilized by murder, does it mean the impact of it emotionally and mentally throws the current self into flux and so it's in essence a death of self.. caught in a container? Because the person that walks out of it is irrevocably changed. Does it even require a murder or would any emotionally upheaving even that in essence leads to a death of the current self do just as well? And IF Harry's parseltongue did originate from the horcrux, how is it possible he received no other ability? Like, say, whichever ritually-assisted powers Voldemort received in his long run as someone who experimented on himself.

​

Not really meaningless but treated as such - the underlying problems of the Brittish magical society pretty much remain unadressed. The war is mainly fought between two extremist groups - light and dark, black and white, two comparatively small groups of people, while the average citizen remains a mystery.

*** Just going to say two things:

1. Pranks are definitely a boarding school thing. I went to boarding school for 5 years and that was a big part of dorm life and a general outlet for cooped up kids. There was one boys' dorm in particular that would do something totally crazy at the end of every term. And at the end of the year they would create a structure (for lack of a better word) of all the benches/chairs that were outside or accessible. Dorms would compete with each other and play tricks on their common rooms, etc. We didn't have points like the houses did at Hogwarts, but you lived in your dorm for all the years you attended so there was loyalty there.

2. I'm not sure I'm reading your grievance about Parseltongue correctly. But Voldemort had the ability to speak it because he was a descendent of Slytherin. Harry was able to speak it because he had a piece of Voldemort's soul in him. Just like the diary enabled Ginny to access the CoS through its own horcrux. So Harry/Ginny were able to speak it because of the horcruxes. Voldemort on the other hand always had the ability - he didn't gain it from creating the horcruxes, which is how I'm reading what you're saying. He'd always been able to speak it. So when he fractured his soul that ability would transfer to all of his horcruxes if someone was possessed by them. He wouldn't lose it. And he doesn't have any other innate abilities like being a metamorphogus so Harry wouldn't "get" them. It's also not the same thing as being a animagus because that's a learned skill not a trait passed through oneself. As in, it's not innately part of someone's soul (or DNA I dunno what the term would be). Anyway not sure if I'm reading your comment correctly or not. So feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!

**** 1. Ah yes, thank you for clearing the pranks thing up. I guess when you're stuck with the same people day in day out you have to let out some steam somehow. And, at least your example sounds fun (except for those required to clean up afterwards) and not like someone annoying you when you're just trying to do your own thing. I'm probably channeling fanfics here when thinking of more malicious connotations.

2. Just a case of miscommunication (I did ramble quite a bit). I'm aware of the Slytherin connection passed trough the Gaunts. My point of contention is that based on how it was said many magical family lines intermarried, it's entirely possible some distant Potter relative (or even another line that married into the Potters) married a Gaunt and the gift of Parseltongue was passed on and not expressed (as far as we know) until Harry came along. It's entirely possible someone else had it and just kept quiet about it, because of how it was perceived in society. I think Dumbledore is far too easily seeing connections where he wants to see them, because of his belief in the prophecy. Good catch on the magical gift vs. magical ability (animagus) part. I guess I was thinking along the lines of Voldemort making changes to himself, aquiring abilities/magical strenghts and not actual gifts, which then would not be transferable. Though there is menton of things such as "talent for Transfiguration" running in families, so I'm a bit iffy on where the line is.

   The rest of my horcrux rambling is basically guesswork on what they even are, because of how intangibly defined the soul is - I'm not buying into the whole "can't be defined" thing -- if there's rituals invoving it there have to be some underlying rules of magic/nature as to what it is and how to manipulate it. I think the books basically saying it requires "unspeakable acts" is pretty much the same as saying "it's magic!" as if there's no pattern and sense to it. There would be no sense in rituals even being a thing if there wasn't some kind of model framework with an expected, set outcome to them, which means the variables (the soul) have to be clearly defined as well. I don't know, maybe I'm looking too deeply into it and getting caught in my own vague guesswork, haha.

***** 1. It was never very intense - also considering it wasn't a magical boarding school haha. But it did lighten the grueling hours of work.

2. I definitely concur that anyone else who might have been able to speak Parseltongue wouldn't have made it public knowledge. But I don't necessarily think that in Harry's case that's true. I would like to think James Potter would have used this ability to his prank-vantage for some Slytherin themed pranks. I also don't get the impression that the Potters were the type of wizards to hide something like that out of fear.

I'm not sure if I want to say parseltongue or being a metamorphagus are part of someone's DNA, but it's not a learned skill. It's an innate ability that wasn't "added" to them by magic, practice, etc. Being good at quidditch is a bit different - not something you can't necessarily work on, but some may have a born talent for it. Again the line can be blurred in certain cases.

I think the innate "talents" some people have towards a certain subject is very much a human thing. Not sure if it's nature or nurture, but if your family has a certain penchant for charms or cooking and you grow up alongside that, you'll pick up on many advanced skills than others who aren't raised by your parents. Whether intelligence is something that can be passed down genetically is another matter. But we're shaped by our parents so it's not surprising that if X's parents was a skilled potion master, they'd be more inclined to be good at it.

I remember reading a theory about horcruxes and how to make them, which might answer some of your ponderings. Rowling has said she won't disclose how to make one (which she may or may not even have come up with, who knows) because it's disgusting. One user (I believe on reddit, but I could be incorrect) suggested that after killing someone which detaches part of your soul you must engage in cannibalism to push it beyond just straight up murder. This is the theory that I somewhat prescribe to and makes me think about horcruxes differently: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3amjh7/harry_potter_voldemort_was_a_cannibal/]]

****** I agree, it is quite complicated and the line between nature and nurture is not always clear. I guess the question is whether magic can be tied to genetics and specific gifts being a part of that (being either dominant or recessive genes). Considering magicals can reproduce with non-magicals and have viable offspring they are genetically not that dissimilar.. unless every non-magical like that has a squib ancestor. But I've derailed this thread enough, so thank you for playing along, aridnie :)

That does sound disgusting, though I can't imagine Riddle willingly ingesting parts of his relatives. Unless he might consider it a form of ultimate dominance over them / just retribution. /shrugs/ It's an interesting theory.

***** Hermione was in a clear position of power over Cormac McLaggen: She was smarter, a much better student, and Cormac was playing a game and completely unable to defend himself - if I recall correctly it's against the rules for quidditch players to have their wands on them during the game. (Which raises the question as to why Harry didn't get in trouble for casting his Patronus at Malfoy, but that's another discussion entirely.)

I would argue that using magic against a magic-user who is completely blindsided and wandless is just as 'despicable' as using magic against a similarly helpless muggle. To be fair.

******* Just because something might turn out to be bad, doesn't mean you kill it when it hasn't done anything bad. That's the entire point of linkffn(Realignment). Just because Voldemort was horrible in the future, doesn't mean you can murder him in cold blood when he's a student.

Also, McLaggen didn't smash Harry's skull. He knocked him off the broom while "wrestling a Beater's bat away from Jimmy Peakes and attempting to show him how to hit a Bludger." Sure, he's a douche, but if you apply your rule, apply it fairly. Don't make double standards because Hermione can't do anything wrong, except when she needs flaws to prove a point you're trying to make.

** The lack of parental involvement, particularly from muggleborns, in the education system.

​

I mean I get that it is based off of Boarding schools, which have less involvement, but since there is only one and magical kids all attend, you would get a lot of parents that want to be intimately involved in their children's education.

​

Hell, skipping over (or just lacking) the pushback on removing kids from a parents life at 11 pushes the limits of believably. I've always operated on the assumptions that "Those who reject Hogwarts are mindscrewed, there is some spell causing muggleborn parents to slowly forget/give up on their kids, and there is some spell causing muggleborns to disconnect from their parents". There is only so much you can attribute to culture/brainwashing. (This was played with in the HP-inspired "Magical Diary" game).

​

The fact this is... completely not addressed always bugged me. ... You can even expand it more generally to "The actual policies needed to really enforce a worldwide Statute of Secrecy are horrifying". Others have mentioned the blase attitude taken toward mental problems (Obliverators, Love Potions, Mental Health), but the kind of society that could have a world as described in the books and still have it kept a secret would have... a very horrifying underbelly.
