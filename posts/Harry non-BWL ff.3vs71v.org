Looking for fabrics where Harry has a brother that is claimed to be the BWL, harry ges neglected so he runs away and gets all powerful and stuff. (from the ones I've read most take place around GoF, so throw 'em on me.)

*** I'll admit that most of these WBWL sibling fics seems samey, but I'd be interested in a reading something where Harry, after being neglected or abandoned, rather than plotting revenge and swearing on his life to end his former families life and plunge Britain into darkness, decides to act like a normal person and move on with his life.

"You're my parents, you're not really dead, and I'm a wizard? ...that's great...really. Hogwarts sounds nice and all, but I have scholarships to other schools, so...bye."

** Barnes Potter vs Harry Potter

A typical example of the type of fic you're looking for.

Oblivion

In all seriousness this is a story I've really enjoyed. Hopefully it's updated soon. It has pretty much all of what you're looking for with a few twists. No real knowledge of The Elder Scrolls series is required, although it doesn't hurt to look things up now and then.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
