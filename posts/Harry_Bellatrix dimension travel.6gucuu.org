So a while back I read this fic where harry goes to a dimension where he married Bellatrix and everyone thinks he's in azkaban and a death eater. If anyone knows what this is called, I would love to know.


** I guess it sounds a lot like this one, Harry was in Azkaban for doing his duty, Bellatrix was in cause she's Bella, They escape and get struck by Lightning while using point me, Harry lands in the body of his Death Eater Alternative Self, Bella lands in a similar situation, Harry tries to end the war by himself and figure shit out. Way to much in the way of unnecessary action scenes though.

*** I got one chapter into it and I dropped it immediately. I lost it at the part of he rose to the rank of Lt Colonel. The higher you go in the military the less fighting you'll actually do. You'll do more planning and strategic ops. Even though the author is right as Lt Colonels are the highest rank still on the front line, it's still a senior officer rank and they will be commander incharge of the entire battle group. And the fact that he "quickly rose through the ranks" was so off the mark of any real military that I dropped it. Rant over, soldier out.

*** Chapter 3 he cuts a spell in half with a Katana.

The entire time Harry's just fighting everybody. Even if it makes /no goddamn sense/. Its like some weeb tried to make a best-of compilation of his favorite Shonen fight scenes with the HP universe.

Welp... thats it for me.

  The War ended when Harry finally killed the Dark Lord. His reward? A cosy cell in Azkaban next to Bellatrix Lestrange. But a pact is made & during an escape, an accident puts them in another universe. Realising violence is the modus of survival, Harry fights to find his way in a world where enemies lurk in the shadows, trust is a scarce commodity & Death is just a heartbeat away...
