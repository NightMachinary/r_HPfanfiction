Honestly i feel like James Spookie writes the best Harry/Daphne stories that doesn't portray a OCC Harry and/or a sub-par/one dimensional Daphne. With that said any recommendations that doesn't suffer from poor characterization, plot can be anything that isn't time travel. oh and please no soul bonds, that troupe annoys the hell out of me and IMHO is just a way for writers to avoid writing a development for a pairings relationship, speaking of which...realistic portray of a relationship would be really nice

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
