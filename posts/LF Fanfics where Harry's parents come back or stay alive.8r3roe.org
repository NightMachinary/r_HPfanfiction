but I prefer when they come back cos it makes it more interesting IMO. This is because it's slightly more heartwarming but both can make for a good story. I'd much prefer if there was some sort of ship in there my favs are H/Hr, H/G, H.D. Thanks!

  Fourteen years ago, their slate had been wiped clean. With no memory of their pasts, they built a new life, but after an owl delivers a strange letter to their daughter, the life they built is beginning to crumble around them. With help from old friends, Lily and James Potter remember their pasts and return to the Wizarding World while Harry faces his fifth year at Hogwarts.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
