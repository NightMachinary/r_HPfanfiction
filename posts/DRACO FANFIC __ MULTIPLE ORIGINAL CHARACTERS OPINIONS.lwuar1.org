So I'm currently working on a Draco Malfoy fanfic, and it would be between Draco and an original character of mine. I have also included some original character friends (only about 3), and I was wondering...

Do you (as a reader/writer) take the story less seriously/professionally when original character friends are included? I would be incredibly grateful to hear your thoughts :)

I'm second guessing myself, as when I read fanfics, I have to admit, I do tend to take it less seriously when original character other than the main character are included.


** I'm actually the opposite. I will avoid fics with an OC as a main character (but a lot of people like them), but I support creating background OCs to flesh out the Hogwarts community. I think it's all fine!

** OCs as a concept don't make me think anything either way. I'll generally only stick with a story if those OCs meet two criteria - they have a reason to exist and a specific niche to occupy. I copy-pasted my answer below from one I gave the last time this question came up. If you need any clarification on any of it, feel free to ask. :)

  Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. Other than that, anything goes. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

  Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

  I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people) and where her interactions with the various other elements of the world (people, resources, places, etc) make sense.

*** Thanks for this answer :) I think what you said about them having a reason to exist and a niche to occupy is a very good point. 1 of the side OCs has a fairly important role in the story and contributes to the breakup of the relationship between Draco and the main character, but the other 2 people I included aren't too important. Again, thanks for your answer and thanks for the help :))

**** Sure. Happy I could help.

And it's not so much importance as it is distinctiveness. They have to feel like interesting characters, rather than "My name is Alice and I'm a Gryffindor and I have blue hair."

And well, if they aren't those things and you agree they should be, you can always work to make them that way. Plenty of ways to make characters more interesting and important, if that's what you want 'em to be. :)
