Thanks for the good response on the first chapter!

My second chapter is out now, and this story features a more riddlesque Harry where the horcrux in Harry's head will be a lot more effective and can manipulate Harry's actions and speak to his mind.

Harry pretty much has an alter ego, so without spoiling too much. Please check it out! Drop a review if you can as well!


** Read the first chapter. Looks promising. üëç
