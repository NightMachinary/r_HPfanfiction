Probably a one shot comedy fic with Luna now commentating in the english quidditch league, the board of directors for the league think she is ruining the sport with her tangents and one sided favouring of Hollyhead Harpies and their new seeker(one Ginny Weasley ;) )... However match attendance and wizard wireless ratings of people tuning in to listen to games have risen to extraordinary heights since Luna took up her new position and they struggle to get rid of her. (Edit just noticed i hit self promotion instead of 'Prompt' like an idiot... sorry lol )

  "Hello there, and welcome to the Quidditch match that nearly everyone's been talking about. The nargles have been excited too; they forgot to throw my socks out of the dormitory window this morning. It was rather nice, as my toes are warm now. Cosy. I quite like having warm feet. They're like toast. Maybe I'll try it more often." More of Luna's legendary Quidditch commentary.

** My only problem with this is that Ginny is obviously a chaser, not a seeker

***** Ginny actually tells Harry in /Order of the Phoenix/ that she would try out next year for chaser because that's what she preferred, so you're not remembering it wrongly.
