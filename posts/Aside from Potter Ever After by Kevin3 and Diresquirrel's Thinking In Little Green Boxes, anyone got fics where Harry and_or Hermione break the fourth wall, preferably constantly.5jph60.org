NOT Read the Book stories please. Other protagonists would actually be fine as well but H and Hr are preferable.

...I haven't actually read it through, but the author is the one behind Weasley Girl and from looking at the first few lines there's absolutely no fourth wall whatsoever, I think.

Not exactly breaking the 4th wall, but close enough where it might count.
