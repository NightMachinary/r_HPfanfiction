*** Oh it's damn sad that you felt like that. I really liked this fic and found that, not knowing the ship in advance felt more real. Rarely your first love is the last and as much as I like better HP/NT than HP/FD (and not by much) the fact that Harry had to go through multiple relationships seemed so much more real (like the disastrous HP/CC from cannon). Too many stories miss this point and give the protagonist his first love to be the definitive one. In my opinion it made for a much more realistic story and added to the progression of the characterization. Le high and low of any relationship be it of romantic love or friendship.

As for the magic it was interesting to see something new with a strong Harry without him being a OP Marty Stu.

I would have loved to see this story being finished and the community finds itself only poorer from its disappearance (curse on the shipper nazis). It's sad to know that you lost your drive but maybe better to stop than forcing yourself and delivering lackadaisical work.

Anyway I bid you good luck for whatever project you may have and hope you'll write more (whichever the universe) for your work clearly deserved acknowledgment.

*** Hi,

I have to say that I always enjoyed your story, mostly for the realistic characters and the worldbuilding. However, only towards the end I started to realize some of the stuff you were trying to do, and now that I see the full picture I have to say that it was really great.

I especially love your symbolisms, and your interpretations. Just some examples, the first two from this comment:

- Harry, the eventual Master of Death gets the deathstick not by taking it forcibly, but it is willingly given to him.

- I love that Harry's "Horcrux" is Eikthyrnir. While Voldemort tried to tether his soul to the earth taking lives, Harry's was tethered by giving live, showing that love and compassion are the stronger magics.

- Harry using the old magics was always fitting to me, as Harry's power always came from the outside, be it his mother's sacrifice, (in canon) his twin-wandcore to Voldemort, or the sword of Gryffindor. It is always said that true strength comes from the inside, but it is not that simple - your potential can't be realized without outside factors.

- I love the role of Tonks in all this, because all his live he was basically inside and alone - but then she brings him out, and only when he truly interacts with the world for the first time, he starts to using the magics of the world.

These are just some of the points that I love. It was one of the fics where I always looked forward to updates.

I am kinda sad that you pulled everything, because removing one of the best fics of the fandom is rather sad to see - newcomers won't be able to enjoy it in any form. Notheless, that is your decision.

Maybe you'll come back to this fic someday, I would quite enjoy it, even when I'm spoiled now :)

I do wish you the best, and I hope you don't give up on writing altogether, because the story had all the signs of a great author.

**** Didn't think anyone gave a fuck about that one!

That characterisation was so fun to write because in my head I just thought 'what would 13 year old me think was cool?'. But he can't actually be cool or it would be pointless, so he's this pathetic little loser.

He goes to the ball, people talk about him but he finds that being in public is worth it as long as he's with Hermione. Hermione attracts Neville, but Harry's hurt by it. He leaves, returns to how he used to be. Later, Hermione confronts him about what was going to happen, they have an argument and he admits he likes her. She takes a while to come to terms, then they get together.

Hope that's satisfactory.

Honestly though, I have no idea why. But, the author happens to be on this subreddit so I'd recommend asking them. [[/u/TheGeneralStarfox]]

******* I mean, I get it with ships that are kind of contentious with each other. It would make sense if the author got a lot of hate for advertising a Harry/Ginny fic and suddenly turned it into a Harry/Hermione fic. But H/F and H/T are functionally the same thing in concept: boy wizard shacks up with attractive older witch. It seems weird to me that you'd get a ton of hate for that.

******** I can absolutely understand being upset with it, particularly if it's clearly marked as one pairing and ends up being another.

I don't subscribe to shipping wars, and OTPs and all that bullshit. I don't care if you like Harry/Ginny, Lily/Severus, or even Draco/Harry. You can read what you want to read, and like whatever you want to like. I'm not going to bash people for their preferences.

I do read for pairings, though, because I like romance in fics. Sometimes I'm picky about the pairing. Sometimes I'm not. And if I go into a fic in a mood to read HP/FD, and expecting to read HP/FD because the fic is marked as HP/FD, and it ends up being HP/HG I'm gonna be displeased. If it's /not/ marked with a pairing, as far as I'm concerned it's free game and the author can do what they want.

FFN /really/ isn't set up for people breaking up and moving on to other people, though. They basically have to put that sorta information in an AN or the summary. So I tend to give people leeway, and I've never mentioned it to an author. If I don't like what's happening, I stop reading.

****** As of the latest chapter, it actually looked like it was setting up a double curveball. After a period of getting to know each other Harry gets turned down by Tonks and ends up with Fleur. Then, after Harry and Tonks reconcile and are able to be just friends, he comes upon reason to doubt Fleur's motives when she was advising him while he was attempting to court Tonks --- back then Fleur told him to take a chance and go for it, but he has a conversation with another character who reflects that his infatuation was very obviously one-sided. Harry is hurt that Fleur would set him up to fail like that and confronts her and they break up (?) over it, i think setting the stage for him and Tonks to start to get together for real

maybe people felt too jerked around by it? i honestly like both pairings so it was fine to me. the author did change around the marked pairings as the story updated

******* I couldn't have been the only one that saw this coming right? I mean, I was suspicious as fuck with Fleur the entire story and it seemed like blatant manipulation so she could swoop in afterward. I was honestly waiting for Fleur/Harry to explode like this when Harry found out. People are talking about being jerked around, but this seemed like it was a long time coming.

Either way, it's a damn shame what happened. I could honestly care less about the pairing itself, I was just really into the Northern Magicks aspect of it.

****** Did he advertise it as Harry/Tonks first? Because some readers pick up and read these fanfiction for the pairing alone, believe it or not. And if the ff advertised Harry/Tonks then it turned out it's apparently not then some people would be upset, specially those who really hate the pairing it turned out to be.

It's not really rational in the perspective of creative writing but that's what you have to deal with when cater to strangers on the internet. Your audience wouldn't exactly all be the sophisticated reader type.

******* FF.Net isn't really set up for fics where the characters go through multiple relationships without any single relationship being THE "pairing" in an OTP sense. Which is hilarious because that's how real life romance works.

Anyway, I feel like so long as Harry/Tonks does happen in the fic, it's not deliberately misleading readers if they happen to break up later. It's just the limits of FF.Net.

It's not that hilarious because it's appropriate for literary romance. It's not like Harry Potter fanfiction is some kind of black sheep and most other kinds of fiction portray romance realistically, having their protagonist date a bunch of people and then settle for someone who's at least bearable in the long term.

***** I actually really liked that! It was pretty clearly marked as the pairing being Harry/Fleur, iirc.

I like when that happens, people don't find the perfect person for them on their first date. Or even their first serious relationship.

I thought it was pretty well done. They were good friends. Tonks was fine with leaving it there, and Harry wanted more. That didn't work out, and that's okay. It's good character development. I thought that him getting with Fleur may have been a bit rushed, though. It's been awhile since I read it, so I can't really be certain.

That said, I can definitely see why people would be upset if they were reading it for HP/NT.

I'll admit the last chapter was kinda weird with the whole fight it kinda came out of no where literally Harry went from “I know now I need to connect with her more then just hanging out” to just a sudden burst of anger and yelling. Still the story had amazing promise especially with the whole northern Magic's hope they bring it back.
