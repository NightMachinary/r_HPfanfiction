the idea of Harry animating a Giant elemental golem and then riding into battle on its shoulder is pretty cool.(sort of like in shrek 2 were they ride on the shoulder of mongo the giant gingerbread man)

I have been watching The Anime Black Clover and a lot of then seems to make elemental constructs/golems to Ride into battle which I find cool.

Also any black clover/Harry potter crossovers would be cool ?


** The creation and riding of a golem occurs in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) but much later on in the story. Other than that I have no idea, however perhaps some of these threads might provide results?

**** I agree. I have my fair share of problems with the story itself, but the tasks and set-up of his tournament was awesome. I want more fics where the Triwizard is different than cannon.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
