** Is is just minor subplot in the series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]“, but the main character befriends Snape in the very critical life-threatening situation, and she is since that moment his fanatic fangirl. And everybody who knew him long time are like “Snape? Really? Awesome? Are you sure we talk about the same person?” Perhaps not for this subplot, but generally the series is great in my opinion.

** It's not the main part of the fic but it does happen in linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) which is a delightful read!

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
