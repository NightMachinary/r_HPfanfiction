So we know Rowling originally planned for Arthur Weasley to be killed off in book 5, and when she reconsidered, she had him live. It was in part because of this decision that she killed off Lupin and Tonks in the Battle of Hogwarts.

What would be different in the final two books if Arthur died? Would he be killed off and Sirius kept alive instead? (I personally think that if Sirius was still alive, the Regulus plot of the last two books would be more effective, because having Sirius alive would mean he gets to discover what his brother did, and reflect on it. It's obviously something that would lead to character development for him, making peace with his past, his family and baggage and maybe feeling he should not have given up on his brother in favor of James) Or would things go a different direction?


** Tbh, I think Arthur dying could have been the perfect catalyst not just for the Trio to take a really active role defeating Voldemort, but also bring in the complicated stuff with Dumbledore sooner rather than the sudden out-of-nowhere info dump in book 7.

If Arthur actually dies when Nagini attacked, it would impact Harry deeply, but not like losing Sirius. Arthur is not Harry's father figure, he's Ron's dad, and despite spending so much time with him, Harry never connected with him like he did with Sirius, so while painful, it would be an impactful death more like Cedric's. Sirius dying is a blow mostly to Harry, no one outside the Order knew he was a good guy, and apart from Remus and Tonks, Harry was the only other one that would consider Sirius something close to family. He was on the run, a former convict, the caretaker to a headquarters and basically nothing more. Removing Sirius makes little impact to anyone outside of Harry and Remus. But Arthur dying impacts the Order and the Weasley's massively. The Weasleys have an extremely cavalier attitude to being a part of an underground rebel group, and Arthur needlessly dying for something as pointless as the prophecy would recontextualise everything for them all. Same with the Order, they tried to trick Voldemort and it got someone killed for no reason.

Arthur dying from Nagini would change a lot imo, and could give so much more with Ron developing a personal vendetta against Voldemort, Harry would have a mentor to train him and confide in outside of Dumbledore, Dumbledore's sketchy motivations get questioned earlier, the Ginny romance could be giving more depth than Chest Monster, and so on. Tbh, having Arthur die in book 5 would have been a fantastic move since we would see exactly what a child losing a parent would be like compared to Harry who never knew his parents, so that if JKR still killed off Remus and Tonks in book 7, we would know exactly what that pain and senseless death of a parent will look like for those left behind.

** I kind of wish we got the more extended darker version of Harry Potter Rowling alludes to many times. More child abuse, alot of the events she's said she planned that didn't make into the books at all/ characters she cut, more deaths. Ron's cursing, how exactly the horcrux is made. It would never have made as much money as the magical children's story but having read her adult work I think I would have found it far more interesting.

** I think Sirius was going to kick the bucket anyways, it made perfect sense.

I think we would see some of Harry's guilt that surely happened with Fred, but now "on screen". More character than plot changes in Harry's side though, as Molly would have make him come to his senses eventually.

The real changes would be on Ron who would have matured earlier. Not sure how that affects his personality and HBP storyline

I don't think so. Rowling keeps having characters say Sirius is reckless and a liability...which didn't come up in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ or /Goblet of Fire/, where despite being on the run, and a wanted fugitive he managed to cover his tracks admirably, and without any help whatsoever snuck into Hogwarts several times. That's obviously a clumsy way to set up Sirius' death and also to say, "Eh....he was kind of asking for it" all of which is there to offset the reality that Harry was himself responsible for that death and that responsibility comes out of a ridiculous plot contrivance and stupidity...there is nothing more frustrating than reading the finale of Book 5 where you have the mother of all coincidences leading to the climax of the DA charging to the Ministry...and then Rowling had to go and remind us with the Mirror that Sirius gave him, which means that had Harry not listened to Mrs. Weasley and Hermione talking smack about Sirius and simply listened to Sirius and used that mirror, he would have been alive.

And killing Sirius off in Book 5 and having his part of the story contribute to the main plot via Kreacher (introduced in Book 5) and Regulus, a posthumous character (whose actions prove that Sirius was right about him being a "little idiot"), is just bad in terms of dramatic structure. Sirius was given huge buildup in book 3, and the horrible contrivances to get Harry into the Department of Mysteries are just absurd, and then we are supposed to cheer when Kreacher, that scumbag elf who betrayed Sirius, goes into battle crying for Master Regulus the Moron (the guy who found out about Voldemort's Horcruxes and decided to do his asinine scheme rather than go to Dumbledore and end the war then and there, deserves nothing but scorn).

**** I am not talking about plot. Character wise it made sense for Harry to lose all father figures. It elevates drama and stakes. For the main story is about Harry, not Sirius. And Sirius totally needed to kick the bucket before Dumbledore.

JK Rowling exchanged Arthur's death with Remus' and Tonks', so Sirius would still be dead.

*** I am pretty sure she wanted Arthur to die in Book 5 not 7. So she did switch Arthur with Sirius. The reason she did that was because she feared that losing his father would lead to Ron maturing to quickly.

She wanted to kill of Ron in Book 7 - I think that was the switch that was made with Remus and Tonks.

**** No, actually, she decided that if Arthur was going to live, Lupin had to die. She decided that when she wrote OoTP. She wanted to kill of Ron when she was in a bad place.
