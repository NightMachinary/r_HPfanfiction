I've read a few fics like A Second Chance at Life, Bloody Skies, Leaving it all behind, where Harry goes to a 'dangerous/elite' school to learn special magic like blood magic or death magic, but I only found a few like these, and most of them are incomplete. Can you recommend to me some fics like the ones I mentioned previously? It would be preferable if it is complete but incomplete fics are fine as well.


** Radaslab's '30 Minutes That Changed Everything' a post apocalyptic Harry sends a ghost-like version of himself back in time to meet his 8 year old self to act as a mentor and to hopefully prevent the end of the world. They manage to free Sirius, meet Hermione and the Weasleys, find his long-lost sister, and eventually Harry and many of his friends go to a Japanese school of magic for intensive magical (and non-magical) schooling (under a type of time magic that allows about 4 times the learning that otherwise would be possible in the same period of time) that some of which could be considered dark or otherwise frowned on in Magical Britain. Part One was completed but part 2 was not. Actually many of Radaslab's stories I quite enjoyed, although Harem War was over the top, but apparently his stories have been abandoned, last update was like 2013 or so, might be worth a read though.
