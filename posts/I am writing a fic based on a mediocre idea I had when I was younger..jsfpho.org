When I was a tad bit younger, I had an idea to write a fic where Hermione is a Primarch from Warhammer 40k.

This idea seems meh to me now, but I think I could do something with it. Sort of a 'Lets take a terrible idea, and make it good' sort of a deal.

My idea is this:

When the Primarchs were being created, in canon, Malcador suggested to the Emperor that He make female primarchs. The Emperor rejected this suggestion, but in my story, Malcador was more...aggressive in how he approached Him. The Emperor relents to /one/ female Primarch.

I don't want to go through what planet she landed on, or even what her Legion was like. But needless to say, she took over her planet, just like every other Primarch. Her name in that universe was Leyla Darkwalker. During the Heresy, she sided with the Loyalists.

After the Heresy, she and her Legion returned to their world, after she fell out with the other Primarchs over splitting up the Legions. The planet came under siege by the Thousand Sons, and Magnus ended up wiping her mind, reducing it to that of a newborn. She was de-aged, as no-one wanted to take care of a Primarch-size infant, and they theorized she would grow up all over again. Her second-in-command realized that no-one in the Imperium would raise her without expecting something out of her. Without treating her like an object, even her brothers.

So, he used an experimental Warp device to find a version of Earth in an alternate reality. He found a peaceful Earth, and gave her to the Grangers, on their doorstep.

The story would start, however, during Half-Blood Prince. Hermione is beginning to remember minor details from her other life, though how she is remembering is a spoiler.

What do you guys think? Is this terrible idea of youth salvageable? Or is it just plain groxshit?

EDIT: Oh, and Hermione when she was Leyla was far shorter than the other Primarchs. Her power was mostly Psychic.


** You may wish to consider the example of Jim Butcher, who got into a "heated discussion" about whether it was better to have a good idea as the basis of a story but have the actual writing being mediocre or to have a cliche idea and put forth a good piece of writing based on it. The "discussion" ended with Butcher challenging his opponent to give him /two/ bad concepts to turn into a story.\\
The ideas were /the Lost Roman Legion/ and /Pokemon/.\\
The end result was the 6-book bestselling Furies series where element-wielding Legionaries and blood-magic using wolfmen fought parasitical insects (and each other, and their own factions...).

The ideas themselves may be important, but what is far, far more important is how you use them, the spin you put on them and the care you take. So long as you consider how the ideas you intend to use will impact on the world that your story is set in, you have a good chance of writing an interesting story.

Just remember that while most people know about Harry Potter, Warhammer is a bit more niche. You will probably need to slot some infodumps into the story to explain the whys and hows, but it should be do-able in a variety of methods. Hermione's resurfacing memories would make a good vector for showing the readers what new skills she's developing and the history/reasoning behind them.

*** A couple questions:

How should I introduce the information that would be needed, as 40k is niche?

How quickly should she regain her powers and memories?

Also, when she goes back to the Warhammer universe, she finds out her planet had become a dystopia that makes most planets in the Imperium seem tame. It went from a peaceful garden world, to one giant milataristic factory fueled by hatred.

**** 1) Probably as and when needed to understand what's going on or what just happened. Hermione examining resurfaced memories or other characters trying to deduce what/why from what they know would probably slot into the story best, but explanatory paragraphs from an observer's viewpoint could also work, so long as you keep track of which characters know/have no clue.

2) Fast enough to give her a chance at surviving, slow enough that she doesn't curb-stomp all the bad guys without giving them a chance to prepare.

3) Can't help you there. All I really know about Warhammer is that the Emperor is a psychic lich and the setting is grimderp. And I may be mistaken on those.

***** Another idea I had was for an SCP Foundation crossover.

Basically, the Foundation discovers the Wizarding World, and at first assumes it to be a Keter-Class anomaly. However, they attempt to use a Scranton Reality Anchor on it, only to discover that it does not work on it. They decide to treat the Wizarding World the same as they do the muggle one.

The Foundation realizes that they need several MTFs for policing the Wizards. They attempt to ask the Ministry for some aurors, but are rebuffed, being referred to as 'strange muggles', with the MTFs ending up obliviated, which the Foundation manages to reverse.

In case you aren't aware, the Foundation is /extremely/ powerful. In some canons, its more powerful than any other faction in fiction.

Anyway, the Foundation hears reports of the Order and Death Eaters. The Head of the British Foundation suggests to his superiors that these two groups would make excellent MTF Units. They just need some training, and the Foundation has turned less willing people into, in some cases, the pride of the Foundation's MTF.

His proposal is accepted, with reservations, and the Foundation kidnaps the DEs and Order. They are then taken to the Greater London Containment Center, and are trained to become MTFs.

The story would focus on these two groups, now known as MTF Unit Sigma-9, and Sigma-12, as they deal with various threats to humanity and the Foundaton.

But they would also suffer from PTSD and depression, due to them being essentially taken from their homes against their will and trained to become something completely foreign to them.

What do you think?

*** Really? I thought it was just the random musings of a less mature individual(Me), on little sleep and in a bad place emotionally.

Care to elaborate?

**** Well, I think it can set up a lot of conflict, especially in HBP. I don't know much about Warhammer, but I searched up what Primarchs are, and idk, it would be really funny to read about Hermione, who's horrible at dueling and extremely socially awkward, dealing with memories of being an almost perfect being as powerful as a god. Would she tell Harry? Would she use her knowledge to aid the war? How would her old personality mesh with her new one? There's just so many possibilities for this story!

***** Well, she might eventually tell him. Her memories are intermitent at first.

The Primarchs were not morally perfect, mind you. They killed xenos by the billions.

She'll return to the Warhammer universe eventually, maybe in a sequel. She'll join up with Roboute Guilliman after his ressurrection. She'll basically be the De-facto Empress of the Imperium, as the Emperor is stuck on the Golden Throne.

Basically, she goes from a young Witch, to a woman who is literally worshipped as a demigod by an entire Galaxy.

Her two personalities will merge, combining Leyla's memories, experience, etc. with Hermione's humanity and compassion. I don't know if she won't still have Leyla as a voice in her head or not, though.

She'll obviously be quite perterbed by people referring to her as 'My lady', 'The Lady Commander' or 'Blessed Primarch.'

This here is a modified quote from Guilliman. I replaced it with Hermione's information. She said this to Voldemort, and the Death Eaters, just before unleashing her fully restored Psychic powers on them,

" I am Leyla Darkwalker, primarch, gene-engineered Daughter of the Emperor of Mankind. I am the Gardener of Gathsmere, the Unifier of the Seven Systems, the Torch of Reason, the Iron Queen. I am the Lady Commander of the Righteous Imperium of Mankind. Empires tremble before me. I was made one hundred centuries before your birth, millennia before your kind existed. I have fought daemons and defied beings that call themselves gods. Species have died at my hand. Now, tell me again, do you not fear me?
