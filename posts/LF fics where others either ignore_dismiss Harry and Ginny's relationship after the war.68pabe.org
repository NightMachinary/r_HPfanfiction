I've read a few and I'm blanking on the basic premise that Harry and Ginny get back together after the war but their family and friends either 1) are oblivious to them being together 2) dismiss them as a serious couple or 3) actively try to intercede and keep them apart for whatever reason. I'm also ok with Harry and Ginny purposefully being coy or keeping their relationship from others.

I know this will bring up a lot of Weasley bashing and I'm ok with it. I think sbmcneil had a couple stories like that. But I can recall a good story by a different author like it's on the tip of my tongue and it's annoying me.


** Why would anyone do this though? I'm sure people who don't know Harry well would expect that he would date a Weasley, considering how close he was to that family and people who do know Harry would be very happy for him. I'm pretty sure all the Weasleys were okay, if not outright pleased, that he was dating her. This just seems like a way to introduce tension to Harry/Ginny pairings, something that canon lacks.

*** Oh it's completely OOC for sure but Molly bashing is a guilty pleasure of mine so I'm fine with it. Totally agree it's not plausible within canon. I just remember reading a couple that I really liked even though I had to suspend disbelief
