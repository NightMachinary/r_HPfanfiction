It's been bugging me, and I figure you guys are my best hope.

Snape has been teaching his usual terrible lessons, but Snape gave a book to someone (Dung?) To give to Harry in the summer which was to explain it all.

Harry never gets the book, and when Snape realises this, becomes sick, realising without this info, he has violating Harry.

Can anyone pinpoint the fic?

Thank you.


** Can't think of the fic name (but I'm still trying), but yes it was Dung who was supposed to give him the book. Snape lures Dung into a meeting at a seedy bar, and threatens him that he (Dung) needs to get that exact book back to him OR ELSE. Snape slipped him a potion, presumably the first part of a two-part poison, as insurance.

** I make notes of fics that I want to find again and I made a note that sounds almost exactly like what you said. I think it's “dragon kin” by fyreheart (on ff.net)

Edit: chapter 22. Also Harry is so goddamn smug in this fic??

*** Glad you found it.

In my search, I also found one where Kreacher was the one who was supposed to give him an occlumency book. Snape's reaction was not as strong as in this one. The Black Legacy by SueMonroe linkffn(3155902)

** I recently read something similar to this. I'll see if I can find it.

But here Snape left the books on the kitchen table at Grimmauld place and Molly hid them because she didn't want Harry to learn such dark/dangerous type of magic.
