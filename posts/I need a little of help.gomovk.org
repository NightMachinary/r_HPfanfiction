Hello everyone! So I just recently remember about a fic but I don't know if it is in Spanish or English, the only thing I can remember is that severus is taking care of little Harry and he decided to remove the horcruxes and put it on animals, I think the animals were a dog, a cat or something like that.

Any help is appreciated!! Thank you
