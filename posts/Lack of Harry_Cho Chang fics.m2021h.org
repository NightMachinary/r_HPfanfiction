For years I have been reading Harry/Luna fics, but since there aren't many long, good ones, I decided to look for some Harry /Cho fics. I figured since Harry and Cho were a pair in cannon, there must have been plenty fics that explored that relationship more, but I actually found way less than I did with Luna. I only found about 6 on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] when I found over 20 for Luna. Why is that? Or am I just looking in the wrong place. If you know of any good ones, please let me know.


** I don't have any recommendations beyond the Autumn Swan, which I'm sure you saw and it wasn't something I truly enjoyed anyway. To answer your question, though, it's mainly because people don't like Cho. While what she did in Madam Puddifoot's was awful, I do think the fandom is a little hard on her. Then again the fandom is hard on all but 2 female characters.

*** I think it's because JKR didn't like Cho, and wrote her in a way that made her very unlikeable after book 5 (as rightly or wrongly as that is - I agree that the fandom is too negative on her)

****** Canon Luna is fine, though probably exhausting to deal with on a regular basis. (Like most die hard conspiracy theorists). Fanon Luna makes my eyes want to roll out of their sockets. Especially Seer Luna.

** There is “The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14031036), but that's just a one-shot which makes the reader want more.

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
