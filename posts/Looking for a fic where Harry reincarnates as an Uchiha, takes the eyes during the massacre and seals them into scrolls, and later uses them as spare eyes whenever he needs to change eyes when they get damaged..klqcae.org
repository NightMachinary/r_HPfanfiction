:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi!! I've been looking for this fic for days and it's really frustrating me. It's been a long time since I last read it and I've probably mixed up some details. Like, I'm not actually sure if it was a Harry Potter crossover? ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌

Anyways, I'm just gonna tell you guys what I do remember from the fic. During the massacre, before Danzo can get his slimy claws on the Sharingan, Harry takes them instead and soon it became public knowledge that dead Uchihas' eyes were stolen. After that, the Hyugas hear about it and all of them started wearing the Cursed seal on their foreheads, including the main family. Harry joins ANBU and there's this scene where during a mission, Kakashi sees him die and he uses Izanagi to rewrite his death and he gets up like nothing happened. Kakashi's reaction was like, wtf. Harry's eye gets destroyed after using the technique and he casually takes out a scroll and replaces his eye with another.

That's all I can remember! If any of you know this fic, please reply to this post. Thank you! (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ


** I think you mean Kaleidoscope by TotoroX92. From what I remember of it, it is pretty much exactly what like you described, excluding it being Harry and not an OC.

*** Yeah, I think that's it. No wonder I couldn't find it, I've been looking at the wrong tags. o(〒﹏〒)o

I thought it was a crossover reincarnation fic like Uchiha Fukurou. Turns out it was an SI. Thank you for clearing it up!! ＼(⌒▽⌒)
