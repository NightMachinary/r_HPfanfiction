The idea is to have a third group of humans trying to commit genocide against both Wizards and Muggles. This would cause a world war, starting in 1996, resulting in a third world war. Both light and dark wizards join with Muggles to fight against this third group, called something like, I don't know, the Army of True Humanity(Not it's acutal name, just a placeholder i came up with). The story would be very grimdark, with the atrocities committed by the ATH being far worse than anything Death Eaters have ever done. Like, Imperium of Man from 40k level of bad.

What do you guys think? Is this a bad idea, or a good one?
