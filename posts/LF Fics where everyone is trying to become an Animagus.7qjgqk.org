Want to read some fics where the students are focusing on becoming animagus. Also want to see what type of animagus every student becomes.


** I know a fiction that is planned to be a trilogy, and I /think/ the author stopped late into the second fic. The second part definitely covers animagus and almost everyone included tries to get their forms. It is set in a brutal environment, so expect MC and companions to be brutal and efficient, and OP animagus(es?). It also has a crazy plot, and a /lot/ of worldbuilding. Absolutely nothing tops Rahkesh Asmodaeus in terms of disguises , so watch out for him too.
