** " I do hope you can forgive me and Danvers for waking you up at this ungodly hour " . Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon stared at the posh young Hufflepuff not knowing how to respond

Dudley who was busy eyeing Justin's expensive clothing and watch grunted " S'no problem " as what little social cunning he had began to formulate a plan to get himself a rich friend.

Justin clasped his hands together and gave a charming smile that would one day earn him the attentions of one Romilda Vane " Shall we be off Harry ? "

Harry had been sitting at the kitchen table with his mouth hanging open in mild shock at the fact his classmate had pulled up to Privet Drive at the crack of dawn in a limousine . His driver,a nice old man named Danvers was currently outside glaring at the nosy residents of the drive who had come out to gawk.

He jerked back to reality and gave a grin . " Sure , just let me go to the loo first ",he left the kitchen,not heading as Dudley walked up to Justin and began to regale him with stories of Dudley's ( non-existent ) social heroism.

Harry went to the toilet upstairs thinking to himself how he should probably get Ron and him to spend time with more boys when school started up again. Justin was very nice and according to him,his dormmates Ernie,Wayne and Roger were too ( although Smith could jump off a cliff for all anyone cared ). To think that a guy he had barely spoken to was nice enough to bring him to Muggle London to get some Muggle clothes that actually fit warmed Harry's heart.

Just then he heard the front door slam open and the barking of a dog he knew all too well . He waited with bated breath as Aunt Marge strode into the kitchen where she came across the Dursleys and their houseguest .

" Hello, Ma'am " greeted Justin with a bow

" Who's this posh little wanker ? " grunted Marge .

Not great but I may continue it.

** Colin rang the doorbell, feeling especially apprehensive.

He hoped that the expensive wine his parents had given him was enough to allow him to enter Harry Potter's house.

His palms were sweaty, and he hastily wiped them on his shirt. No way was he screwing this up.

The day he had woken up from his petrification, he had vowed that he would do whatever it took to become Harry's friend. Those bright yellow eyes still terrified him in his nightmares.

Why was it taking this long for them to open the door? Did he accidentally came to the wrong house? But how was that possible? He had checked the address three different times befo---

The door opened to an ugly looking woman with a long neck staring down at him.

"How can I help you?"

"I'm a friend from your son's school, just wanted to thank him for helping me last year. Can I come in?" Colin asked, being as vague as possible, and hoping the woman would get the hint and let him inside. He didn't want to accidentally break the Statute of Secrecy.

"Oh such a sweet boy you are. Come right in. Dudley, your friend---" "Colin" "Colin is here! Get down here quickly!" The woman shouted

Colin thought that Dudley was a weird nickname for a boy named Harry, but decided not to judge.

When Dudley came crashing down the stairs, Colin thought he had made a mistake.

"Doesn't Harry Potter live here?" he asked innocently.

The room turned noticeably colder.

"Oh. So you're from that freaky school of freakishness. The boy is in the first floor in his room. Now get out of my face." That said, Mrs Dursley turned around and went back into her kitchen.

"Invite friends, will he? I'll show him tonight. Let Vernon come home," her murmurings could be heard by Colin.

He was well and truly in shock. Surely that woman was joking, right?

"Get on with it! Do your business and leave the bloody house!"

Colin jumped and ran up the stairs.

He found Harry reading /Quidditch through the ages/ sitting on a dirty and old bed inside a tiny room, with his owl Hedwig snoring inside her cage.

"Colin?" Harry asked.

"Harry? What are you doing in this... room?"

A flicker of emotions crossed his eyes.

"The more important question is, what are /you/ doing at /my house/?"

"I just wanted to thank you for killing the Basilisk. I tried to send letters, but you never responded so I thought you were busy..."

"Did Aunt Petunia see you? Please tell me she didn't. Please." Harry was almost begging him. Colin never thought he would ever see Harry in such a vulnerable position. He was supposed to be the saviour, the Boy-Who-Lived, for Merlin's sake!

"The ugly lady with a horse face?"

Harry lost all colour in his face. He started rocking back and forth, murmuring, "This is not my fault, Uncle Vernon! I didn't do this. Please don't hurt me."

Colin fell down where he was standing.

Harry's guardians were abusive? His parents had told him about kids who were abused at home. They had told him to always help however he could. But this wasn't a random child, he was was Harry bloody Potter.

Slowly he shifted closer to Harry.

"I'll help you Harry. Listen to me, I'll help you." He tried touching his hand.

Harry violently shrunk back from the touch.

"No! Just--just go away! Leave me alone!"

Colin decided that would actually be for the best, so he slowly took the worthless wine back with him to his cycle. He would tell everything to his parents. They would surely help him, he had faith in them.

*** "They abused him, mom!" Colin burst through the door in his house, and fell into his mother.

"They bloody abused him!"

His mother was silent as he explained it to her.

"His Uncle will beat him tonight, mom! We need to do something soon!"

"Don't worry love. Dad will surely take care of him, don't you worry. Are you sure, though?"

Colin nodded.

"Then go back to your room and get some sleep. I find it easier to deal with trauma after getting some sleep, okay?"

As soon as she heard the sound of his door closing, she called her husband, Inspector Daniel Creevy.

"Can you do something about it?"

"I'll look into the files, and do what I can. Don't worry, Harry Potter will be safe by nightfall."

If only his job was that simple.

His seniors won't accept 'My son thinks he is being abused,' they would need solid evidence to arrest Vernon Dursley.

Digging into the files, his face contorted into shock, then horror, and finally rage.

Multiple complaints had been made against the Dursley, and each time it was ignored. This implied an inside job, or...

Or...

A wizard. He was many things, but stupid he was not. When Colin was first admitted into Hogwarts, he had read up on the laws of the Wizarding World. He had learnt that they would all be 'obliviated' if he chose not to send Colin to that school.

Researching about 'Obliviate' had been harder than before, but he struck gold in the end.

It was a memory erasing spell. The very existence of such a spell almost managed to convince him to take his family and run to Australia, but then he had seen how happy Colin was with learning and enjoying magic, and decided to stay.

So... Someone was messing with the memories of the whole police department. Just to keep one wizard trapped in an abusive household.

His fists clenched. He couldn't act quickly, he would have to be clever.

First thing he did was write himself letters and hid them in all sorts of places around his office, and also a few in his car. If a precaution was necessary enough to take once, it was necessary to take a hundred times.

Then, he came back home and told his wife everything, and to be wary of him suddenly forgetting about Harry or anything else.

She nodded fearfully, yet resolutely.

It was the least they could to save a boy who had risked himself to kill that beast.

He worked long into the night to collect and prepare all the complaints he managed to find, and presented it to his senior the very next morning.

"This does seem very suspicious, Dan. Fine, take a car and bring in this Vernon Dursley. We'll discuss more later."

As he was being arrested, Vernon smiled, actually smiled, and said, "You think this is the first time I'm being carried in a car with blue and red lights flashing, officer?"

"I'll see to it that you never again do, you piece of scum."

Dursley just smirked.

They reached the police station and Dan dragged the Dursley into an interrogation room.

He explained him his rights with as much disgust as he could manage, when Aspen, his senior, entered the room.

"Show me the complaints again, Daniel?" He asked.

Daniel handed over his file, his attention focused solely on Dursley.

"Do you confess, Mr Dursley?"

"Listen, Dan. I don't think we would've ignored so many different complaints just by mistake. I think it's an inside job."

Dan didn't know why the other officer breaking protocol, but he played along.

"I reached that conclusion as well, sir."

"Interesting. Because you didn't seem like the stupid sort to me, Dan. Why would these complaints all be ignored over such a long period of time? The officers regularly get shuffled around."

Daniel knew the answer, magic. But he couldn't very well say it.

"I think an outside force may be responsible for this. Stay vigilant, Daniel."

Why would he say that...

Suddenly, it clicked. Officer Aspen had been in the department for more than fifteen years.

He hated the fact that he had left his revolver outside the interrogation room, protocol be damned.

"Expelliarmus! Petrificus Totalus!"

Daniel fell on the floor as stiff as a board.

"Stupefy! Obliviate!" He could see Aspen fire the spells on the Dursley.

And right before his eyes, Aspen morphed into a female.

"I have nothing against the kid, Daniel, you understand? I'm just following orders."

His eyes twitched, the only thing he could move in his body.

"Why? Because that's what our world needs, Dan. Harry needs to be kept beaten. Only then could we hope to kill the Dark Lord."

When his eyes just kept twitching, Tonks sighed. "Finite. Imperio. Tell me what all precautions you made."

The whole Creevy family was interrogated and obliviated in due time. Whenever Colin thought he should thank Harry somehow, he started clicking pictures instead. His skills improved immensely, so much so that his parents bought him a new Wizarding camera.

Harry kept crying into his bed. Another promise broken. It had almost become a habit at this point. He ignored the feeling of anger he felt towards Colin, instead focussing on his friends. Because they had kept him alive so far, they won't leave him now.

****** Harry lived in a cupboard, that count as abuse . But They never beat him to blood. There were some incidents as Petunia almost hiting him with a pan or Vernom rougly pushing him in the cupboard. But they were rare and Harry reached Hogwarts without any sign showing physical abuse (fear of adults, flinching at any physical contact. ...) They didn't starve him. Book 1 say they never stopped him to eat but Dudley rushed to his favourite meals. He only "starved " starting year 4 when Petunia forced all the family to follow Dudley diet. And as all of them he cheated, hiding food in his room. . They never punished his school results. They never supported him but could not care less as long as no freakiness happened. . Harry admit himself he didn't have the best study habits but was doing fine. In the end the most violent of his relatives was Dudley. You can be a terrible parents without being a bone breaking monster. The way they put Harry in a cupboard and ignored him is enough to be abuse. The way they spoiled Dudley also count as abuse.

******** I'm going to assume it's been a long time since you've actually read the books. The greatest indicator of how the Dursley's treat Harry is how Harry thinks of the them. He's not afraid of them, he doesn't even really hate them. He thinks they're ridiculous people. He's openly antagonistic, he's sarcastic, he mocks them. He undoubtedly has a bad home life, and is certainly abused by any reasonable standard. There is no indication that Harry was ever beaten. There are many evidences that he wasn't.

The super abusive Dursley's in one of the most pointless and frustrating tropes in the fandom. Except is an exceptionally small number of fics Harry being abused doesn't add anything to the story. It's pointless bashing of these people that goes beyond the scope of terribleness for any bashing, due simply to the fact that it only exists to make people pity Harry. It only exists at the beginning of a story as a means to get Harry away, then it's dropped. Which adds nothing since justification already exists, and is I believe insulting in the fact that you're addressing this issue only to ignore it. Or it's brought up only as a means for someone to feel pity for Harry. Which is both bad writing and extremely out of character.

If a story wants to address abuse there is fertile ground without making shit up, is what I'm saying.

Other than the word 'demons' that I think could describe people housing children in cupboards I can't see how you could have meant anything else. Harry IS called a freak in canon and shows lots of signs of getting hit. He thought McGonagall would beat him with 'wood' in first year. Petunia with frying pans. I'm pretty sure Vernon picks him up and throws him out of the room in the envelope bit.

You seem to think that fanfiction overemphasises how bad they were, which it sometimes does, but the books give us plenty of evidence of the Dursleys being really, really bad people.
