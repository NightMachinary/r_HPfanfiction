I'm pretty sure I don't remember reading this story for almost a decade (most likely 8 or 9 years) on ff.net. The premise involved Harry discovering that he could trap elements (the key one that I remember is that of a dementor) in a sphere and essentially infuse a part of his body with them. The fic has to be something along the lines of a grey/darkHarry because one of the few scenes I remember reading is him using the dementor mana on Dumbledore, who drops like a ton of bricks. Thanks for the help. I have no idea where this could have gotten to.


** You're thinking Materia, or perhaps Junctions? (Materia is from Final Fantasy 7, Junctions are from Final Fantasy 8[i think])

*** The term Materia sounds familiar. Any idea about a story based around that?

**** Materia from Final Fantasy 7 are spheres that contain the knowledge and ability to cast a certain type of spell.
