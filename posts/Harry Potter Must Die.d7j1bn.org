Start with the ending of most Indy!Harry Harem Lord stories. Y'know, the ones where he's got multiple lordships, multiple wives, owns Hogwarts, has more gold in his multiple vaults than what's been mined out of the Earth for the complete length of Human civilization, etc; and then suddenly, all of the women in his harem decide "No, this is not okay. I will not put up with being little more than a sex toy for Potter to slake his lust with.". Maybe one of them wants to immediately storm off and reduce him to a bloody smear across the floor of the Great Hall, but they can't because it's your cliche Indy!Harry who out-dueled Voldemort, Dumbledore, and a time-displaced Merlin all at the same time. So they have to be careful, go about it sneakily, wear him down bit-by-bit, little-by-little until he's been brought back down to the level of mere mortals; then they will make him pay for his transgressions.


** And then it turns out it was just a nightly fantasy of Snapes, (we all know he is delusional) and all is right with the world

** Harry Potter, SCP-Foundation style Type Green reality warper:

#+begin_quote
  PHASE 4: The Child-God: Sadly, the majority of Type Greens will eventually progress to Phase 4. During this phase, the reality bender becomes obsessed with the power it possesses and will attempt to utilize it for personal gain at the cost of others. This phase is marked by reduced empathy for other humans, inability to accept personal faults, and increased megalomania.

  Although warning signs are numerous, the key aspect of a Phase 4 is the use of their abilities to manipulate other humans. Teenage and young adult Type Greens will typically use their abilities for sexual purposes, while children will attempt to make strangers their "friends." Older adults may attempt to manipulate others for love or financial gain. Although a few cases have resulted where the Type Green then reverts to Phase 3, 99% of them will remain at Phase 4 until eliminated. For this reason, Phase 4 Type Greens should be considered Threat Level 5 (Immediate Threat) and eliminated immediately, as they represent a major threat to all aspects of the Fivefold Mission.

Of course, this differs slightly from the prompt. A Type Green is capable of warping the minds of everyone around them; Indy!Harry is only capable of warping the narrative. However, I mention this because it provides an interesting narrative explanation of how Indy!Harry happened, and because the ways of terminating Type Greens are often over the top and involve launching them into the vacuum of space after teleporting them to the moon.

*** Why teleport them to the moon instead of the sun? Seems like a better guarantee of destroying them to me.
