Are there any fics where the rules of magic are delved into and developed into an actual system with clear limitations, where the characters train hard to get better at, eventually using what they learned in exciting and challenging duels/fights?

*No unexplained power-ups or general OPness.

*the training has to lead to actual satisfying fighting, too many fics have one but lack the other.

*Have already tried "Hogwarts battle school", it was barely readable.


** linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) has the best fight scenes in my opinion

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a well-developed logical magic system where Hermione invents quite a few spells of her own and uses them in combat. There's quite a few neat ideas, like modifying light spells into laser spells to blind enemies or even burn (not blocked by shields that block magic but let light through). Action really gets going in the ministry battle in year 5.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Hermione training in secret with Fletcher and Harry with Dumbledore, there's some very good action later on, both brutal battle around Azkaban and in the Ministry and sneakier larceny, and a pretty good broom chase scene too.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
