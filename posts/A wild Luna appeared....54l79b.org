So, a strange thing happened to me today...

No, seriously. I was writing a "First ride to Hogwarts" sort of thing, and since one of my protagonists was feeling competitive and challenged by Ginny, three seats on the boat were taken easily. I just needed someone else, preferably a girl, to fill in the space... So I used one of the background characters.

It took me some time to realise, that I was describing Luna. And then, I realized, that she actually integrated herself into the story already, in fact going a couple of scenes back, before I even decided to specify this character. She was just sort of... in the background, never receiving a detailed description before she needed to make an appearance.

And she is actually pretty great. She was never a part of the treatment I wrote for the fic, yet her help in at least one plotline is already priceless, resolving a motivational issue I couldn't get my head over for a while. Right now she is actively chewing the scenery with Ginny, fleshing the victim/antagonist out - something I never really knew how to do.

Finally, somehow her appearance helped me to finally get one of my protagonists. In the first chapter I pretty much winged it, but now I finally have a firm grasp on both of them, as well as differences in their perception of the world.

So, yeah, a wild Luna appeared. And by Merlin, I needed her.


** That's fascinatingly surreal. I'd love to read what you've written!

Chapter 1 is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12162388/1/Colin-Creevey-and-the-Son-of-Batman]]

EDIT: Both chapters are up, since I shall have to skip town till next week. Read the one on FFN, it's a bit improved.

I hope you mean this literally and she picked some magical blueberries on the way down to the boats and is now eating them.

** back in the 70's there was a guy who could walk through anywhere and find things to eat, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euell_Gibbons][Euell Gibbons.]] He was a character, and in some ways a fringe person like Xeno Lovegood.

** I hate to point out the fact, but in editing you might want to edit your mentions of her. In canon they know each other before Hogwarts. They are old friends and playmates. The only reason I say this is because I read a lot of stories where either Ron or Ginny never seem to know of her.

*** My protagonists are Colin Creevey and Damian Wayne - it's a Batman crossover. Colin is the PoV for this segment (I am using "third person PoVs", popularized by Martin), and he has no idea at that moment, who Luna is.
