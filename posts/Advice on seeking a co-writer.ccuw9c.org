So I've been brewing an HP fanfic idea for quite a long time but never managed to develop it into some basic story outline. I've been sitting on it unwilling to share anything until I had it somewhat laid out, but it's been years now and clearly I won't be able to do this on my own.

It's an idea that's somewhat of personal value to me, and I am in no rush to just craft it carelessly. Still, I realized that if I wish to ever make it happen, I'll need some other input. Not just a beta reader, but rather someone to actually co-author the story.

I've only just begun searching and haven't exactly reached out to any HP betas on FF yet, out of a slight... intimidation. The fact that it's still so much in the plane of ideas, and it might not even be that great of a story setup makes me not wish to waste just anybody's time.

That said, what advice could you guys give me on this? Where and how should I start? Is seeking help a good idea or should I hold onto it longer?


** I'd say join the hpff Discord and start chatting with folks. You might come upon someone you gel really well with.
