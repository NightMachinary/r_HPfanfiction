I don't know why but this week I am having inspirations for so many fanfictions. Today I decided to post one about HP/DxD/Campione/Danmachi crossover. Now I know that a big crossover and it will become a mess. But please just listen to it. PLEASE and give me your opinion if there is something similar. Here it is:

James and Lily are having trouble making babies. Lily desperate makes a deal with the Fae Queen Vivian of Avalon. It goes like this " I Fae Queen Vivian will help you Lily Potter to have twins, the first will be your and James child a full witch/human and the second will be the child of me Vivian and your Lily a half-human half-fae, and in return, you will watch and love both of them equally. ".Lily accepts the deal and she has babies.

After the babies are born, Dumbledore comes with the prophecy. Lily is panicking and start searching for a way to protect them. When Lily becomes desperate Vivian visits again and offers to do a ritual to protect them, but the catch is that Lily will remove her memories of these rituals.

First, goes Harry's twin and the rituals gives him/her the ability to reflect all instant-death spells.Lily deletes her memories.

After that is Harry's turn but because he is Vivian's child she makes the ritual really special. It goes like this:

" Bones of the mighty Titans give him unbreakable bones.

Heart of the undying Phoenix give him your regeneration.

Muscles of the ancient Giants give him your mighty strength.

Organs of the divine Gods give him your limitless energy.

Skin of the nightmare Hydra give him your invincibility.

Tounge of the infinite Ouroboros give him your divine abilities.

Soul of the forgotten Spirits give him your unique soul."

After that, she does another ritual that seals the powers that the previous one gave him because she knows that Dumbledore may use him as a weapon and makes it that only when Harry is 6 years old or is in a life or death situation may the powers be unlocked.

Voldemort attacks when Lily and James are not home and tries to kill Harry's twin because he sees special power in him/her( the ritual), he uses AK and it backfires and kills him and part of his soul attaches itself to Harry. Dumbeldore sees this and under the pretext of Harry needing to be safe, needing them to focus on the B(G)WL and Harry needing to be away from magic so the dark magic that is attached to him(Horcrux) to fade, Dumbeldore convinces Lily and James to leave Harry in the Dursleys.

Five years late the Dursleys go to Japan for a vacation and take with them malnourished and emotionally stunt 5 years old Harry Potter( he is not physically abused ). While exploring a Japanese forest Harry is divided from his relatives and is attacked by a monkey(Sun Wukong). Harry runs from the monkey which screams in human language that he wants to kill the abomination(Horcrux).On his last leg and desperate Harry with all his strength punches the monkey and at that moment the seal for his power is broken it kills the monkey(Sun Wukong) and it forms a space tear in which Harry falls.

In a forest, we see a red-haired 5 yrs old girl, a black-haired 5 yrs old girl who is crying, and a woman in a maid outfit. In front of them opens a space tear and out of it falls an injured black-haired 5 yrs old boy who gives intense waves of magic. The red-haired girl seeing his injuries places a black queen chess places piece on top of him.

In a dimension full of light we see Pandora the mother of all Campione. She seeing her new child(Harry) trying to be turned into a devil decides to help Rias. She explains that Harry is in a new world and not being native in it the world is trying to kill him and by letting him be turned into a devil he will become a native of this world. And since this is a new world with strange gods she instead of giving him the authority of Sun Wukong she strength his existing abilities( I will give a list about them in the end.).

Eleven years later in a rating game, we see Rias's peerage which consists of "Rias, Harry, Akeno, Koneko, and Asia" vs Phenex's peerage in which Harry absolutely destroys them. In a span of a few months, we see them going through the plot of DxD with few differences. They are Kiba and Issei being the peerage of Sona Sitri, Rias's peerage dominating all enemies. We learn that Harry using one of his abilities is sharing his power with the rest of the peerage. When going through the plot we see how Harry and the girls fall in love with each other and how his Harem forms. Then their enemies release Trihexa(666) the Beast of Apocalypse.

Harry and his Harem are fighting it. Overusing his powers Harry delivers the final blow. Trihexa unwilling to grant them the victory self-explodes. Harry forcing his powers to work contains the explosion in a small area, but that creates a space tear that consumes them.

When falling into the space tear Harry sees that it will kill them uses everything he has to protect himself and his Harem. When falling through the space tear Harry sees that it's de-aging them.

Exiting the space tear 5yrs old Harry barely conscious sees a blond woman protecting 5yrs old blond girl and in front of them 25yrs old man fighting a one-eyed black dragon. The dragon seeing Harry and company attacks them and the man tries to intercept the attack. Harry seemingly drawing power out of nothing punches the dragon and kills him in one shot. The dragon with his last breath self-explodes freezing Harry, his Harem, Ainz Wallenstein, and her parents in crystal.

Thousands of years later we see the goddess Loki finding the crystal, freeing them, and while they are unconscious adding them to her famillia as if compelled(Pandora) making all of them natives of the world.

Harry waking up find that his powers are damaged and nearly nonexistent because of his overuse. Harry seeing one man level up sees a way to recovery and that starts his, his harems, and Ains Wallenstein's journey to the dungeon.

Going through the plot of Danmachi with few changes, mainly Ains wanting power to protect her living parents, Bell falling in love with Tiona, and Ains falling in love with Harry and becoming half-devil/half-spirit, we find out that on the last floor of the dungeon there are near-infinite amounts of essence that can make one GO.

In the end, Harry and his harem ( that includes Ains Wallenstein ) become gods and make their own pantheon, have their own dimension from which they can travel to their own worlds and they get married and have kids. END

In my head Harry's original powers are as follows:

Immeasurable Strenght, Agility, Vitality, Endurance, Durability

Near Invincibility

Magic Absorption( granting him complete magic immunity )

Having the ability to share his powers with his loved own

Able to generate his own mana/energy

Immortality( infinite lifespan )

Having the ability to turn dreams into reality and reality into dreams ( small scale and really energy-intensive )


** Sounds terrible

I don't think it's logical for Dumbledore to be stepping into the picture and calling the shots when all this time Lily was asking for help from Vivian. True, Lily doesn't remember that the rituals for protection were cast but there was the earlier deal helping her and James conceive children, which, looking back at what you've written, shouldn't be part of what was erased from her mind.

This notion of the Potters having twins (or children other than Harry) then neglecting one for the other because of Dumbledore has been done [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Wrong-BoyWhoLived/18135/][a hundred times before]], it has become uninteresting.

Perhaps you could straight up have Lily and James give Harry back to Vivian after Voldemort's attack since he really is her child anyway? Then make him encounter the monkey and the tear while wandering away from his safe spot in fae land and have him go on all the adventures you listed afterwards. I didn't understand what you wrote because I don't know any of the original sources you were referring to but with the long list of things you outlined, your Harry's already interesting enough even without the tragic "neglected twin sent off to the Dursleys" background.

*** I wanted him to go to the Dursleys so he can go to Japan and meet the monkey. They are irrelevant, just serving as plot devices and your idea of him going with Vivian is better!
