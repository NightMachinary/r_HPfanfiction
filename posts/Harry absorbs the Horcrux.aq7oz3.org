As the title says, I'm looking for good fics where Harry somehow absorbs the Horcrux within him.

I'm fine with there being some negative consequences, but I prefer if Harry overall benefits greatly from it. I realize it could be considered a cheap power-up, but I like Harry to be powerful, this shouldn't do more than even the playing field against Voldemort, and I think that it's one of the most reasonable ways to go about a power boost.

I've read (or at least tried):

What's a Little Death between friends? by kathryn518

Samsara by Countess Millarca

Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart

Probably more, but those are what come to mind.

 

Any recommendations?

Thanks.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** Harry absorbs all of the Horcruxes he encounters, starting with the scarcrux, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]].

Harry gets some power from the Horcruxes, but mostly they seem to alter his perspective slightly, making him ruthlessly pragmatic and motivated by self improvement. Eventually his hard work pays off, and he becomes strong enough to handle Dumbledore and Voldemort as he sees fit.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay.
