Anyone know of a good fanfic that follows the below criteria:

- Al is sorted into Slytherin

- Rose is sorted into Ravenclaw

- Scorpius may or may not be in Gryffindor

- Rose/Scorpius pairing will be an eventual major focus

- The story starts from the very beginning (I don't want stories that jump to Year 3 or Year 7, for example. I wanna read these characters chronologically grow just like our original trio starting from Year 1)

(OPTIONAL BUT I WILL BE VERY GLAD IF THIS NEXT POINT IS PART OF THE FIC)

- Harry/Hermione pairing is developed and eventually they become a couple. Ron or Ginny are either dead or perfectly amicable with the divorce (kinda like How I Met Your Mother's ending)
