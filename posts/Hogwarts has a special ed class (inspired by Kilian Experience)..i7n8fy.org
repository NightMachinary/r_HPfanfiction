I was rewatching Garbage Restrospective to Harry Potter and got up to the Hufflepuff is a special needs class joke when I decided I wanted to actually read something like this. Sometimes I like to look for such and such is Autistic fics but they usually just feature the one character. Any genre is fine.


** Yes HUGCAT this would be so great to read! :) I was in special ed all the time when I was at school. Hogwarts has GOT to have something for their mentally disabled and even physically handicapped kids!!!
