I'm not sure if there are that many but it just came to mind as something that could be interesting to read. Emotions clearly influence certain spells, and I remember reading once that depression can negatively influence magical capacity. Anyways, looking for fics that address mental health and how that relates to magic in any way.


** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) kinda has this, a bit, and linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) does as well.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** canon is packed with it. Riddle/Snape/Harry/Sirius/Neville/Luna were all abused imho. Harry with Riddle packing his head with nightmares..

Poor Ginny, possessed by a maniac for a year and gets a hot chocolate.

I'll read the hell out of it, it's one of her glaring blank spots. thanks for the links y'all.

**** I think it's implied in canon, but that's my reading of it, could be headcanon. I do think Azkaban is at least abusive. Tormented by demons for 12 years qualifies him imho.

How could Hermione go off about house elves and not about Azkaban?

** I don't know of any examples, but given that witches/wizards have the ability to override mundane illnesses I wonder if they'd be immune to conditions like mania or any of the Axis I personality disorders. That being said, a story featuring a protagonist with mental health issues could be quite interesting.

** There are several that go into mental health issues/soul sickness in fanfics involving Tom Riddle as a main character, though it's not the main focus of them usually. Also try Gray!Harrys, though I've sadly read too few of these to be able to point you to a good one.

** Not sure if this is what you wanted exactly but its a Haphne story, but daphne has a magical illness that cuts her life span in half but pretty much doubles her magical core.

  5th Year AU - "There are those who believe that we should obey the 10 Commandments. But as our names suggest, Mr. Potter, Ms. Greengrass, we decide to follow an 11th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Speak. You have piqued our interest. We will be watching." The Dementors weren't the only ones to show up that day. NOTE: This story is not about religion or religious circumstances.
