Have a question and need some help.

Question: Who remembers who acted as Cheif Warlock in Harry's fifth year during Dumbledores Deposition?

Also, I need to come up with a name for a Private Security Firm in the Magical Comunity. As a Side note, if you're unaware, Security Firm is a not so secret code word for "Mercenaries for Hire"

If I Use the name in my fic the one who provides it will be credited.


** Samhain Security Services could work. Samhain is the gaelic term for Holloween.

Alternitively, you could you a cannon character's name to tie your fic to cannon, e.g. Finch-Fletchly Security Services, Fort Nott etc.

** Don't know about the Chief Warlock position. The Wiki (which I'm sure you've already checked) doesn't say for sure.

There are probably enough fics with companies that have Marauder in the title. Same with some version of Wolf for a werewolf-based guard. Maybe something with Protego, or the variation: Protego Totalum? Really depends on what they're going to be doing, hunting death eaters, providing security, treasure hunting, bolstering the aurors, fighting the aurors...
