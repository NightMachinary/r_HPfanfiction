I recently read Harry potter and the marriage contracts ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Contracts]]) and really enjoyed it. Does anyone have any more stories where harry goes back to hogwarts for 7th year after winning the war? Obviously I'm not too concerned if it's AU as long as it's not slash.


** I just remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7291057/1/The-8th-Year][The 8th Year]] a couple of months ago. It was pretty decent for me.
