  Cassiopeia Black may prefer research to family politics, but she refuses to allow her family name to be ruined after the events of fall 1981. With the help of a routine obsessed house elf, Cassiopeia sets out to spin the Black family's largest PR nightmare in 100 years with a lot of old magic, some luck, and her Squib brother's family... the Grangers.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** Hang on..Towards the end of Basilisk Born? That one isn't close to ending. Got a new chapter a few days ago and another one coming up soon. Haven't read much of it though so I guess maybe there could be more than one called that.

***** Yes... ended as in there weren't any more chapters, I did mention it was unfinished and I didn't know whether or not it was still uploading, I didn't spend a huge amount of time trying to word the fact that the idea was being shown towards the end of what was currently uploaded and I didn't get to see it really explored yet because there were no more chapters after that but it's not finished yet and may or may not still be updating. It really holds about no importance to my post at all, I could have left that entire part out and am slightly starting to question myself for not doing so lol

tl;dr my bad it was confusing/misleading, I didn't think it was important
