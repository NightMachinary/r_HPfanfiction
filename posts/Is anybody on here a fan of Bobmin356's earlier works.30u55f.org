Particularly the Sunset Over Britain and Spirit Crystalus series.


** I've only read the first one and a few pages of the sequel.

Other people on this subreddit have said they don't age well and I'm inclined to agree. I often see the authors paint themselves into literary corners and use all-powerful Ancient Native American magic to get themselves out of a big mess. I'm very out of my own element with this but IIRC in Sunset they brusquely run roughshod over Irish naming conventions and legends. While I understand that creative license can excuse some ignorance, they didn't handle it very well in that story. The characterizations would probably fit better in a story written by robst: Mary-Sues everywhere.

That being said, this is just my own opinion and it has been a very long time since I read Sunset Over Britain. Many other people enjoy them immensely and I hope you get replies from some of them.

** I thought Mutant Storm was good enough to read twice.

** Sunset Over Britain has been recced hundreds of times on this subreddit, and will be recced hundreds more times. I like to read Bobmin's fics, leave them for a year or two, and re-read. You might consider asking this subreddit what they like to read, in the context of "I like Bobmin's fics, what else do you have that would be good?"
