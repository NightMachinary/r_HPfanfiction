I just read my first fanfiction and it made me feel many different things. Satisfaction at having more storyline to read, addiction--I couldn't stop reading it, guilt that it wasn't real Harry Potter, and finally frustration as I tried to pretend it was an actual continuation of the series but couldn't really convince myself that the amateur writing was that of J.K. Rowling.

That being said, the happy feelings I got from it were too overwhelming and if anyone knows of some decent, true to story, Harry Potter-all-grown-up fanfics, I'd really like to read more.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][This]] one is fucking beautiful. Aftermath oneshot.

Summary: "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.

** This fic picks up right where JK left off, and feels fairly true to canon. It mostly deals with the aftermath of the battle.

That said, it's hardly "all grown up."

*** I know this is an old comment, but I'm only on chapter two and I'm crying a little. The George part is just so heartbreaking. And Harry, just falling apart. Or jesus, just all of it. goddamn.

** I'll offer you a recommendation and a plug.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][This]] is probably my all-time favorite fic that begins right after the final battle. It's brilliantly done, and it has the advantage of having an amazing [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][mini-sequel]]. Full disclosure: I did not write either story, I'm just a huge fan of both.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][This]] is my current writing project. The story begins about 50 years after the final battle, and includes canon and next-gen characters, as well as a third generation of the family.

Good luck and happy reading!

I just wanted to say that I /absolutely love/ your fanfic. I read through most of it in one sitting a couple weeks ago and now the wait between new chapters kills me! :P

**** Looks like the site took its monthly maintenance outage last night, so I'm afraid it will be a bit longer. But chapter 26 is basically ready to go into the queue.
