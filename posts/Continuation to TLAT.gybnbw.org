I just finished TLAT(Yes, a tad bit late, I know) and I heard that it was officially abandoned by its author. Is there any other fanfic that seemingly starts from where TLAT ended? Or that focuses on the seventh year and beyond up until Lily and James' death? I need something to fill the gaping hole that the incomplete ending of TLAT left.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** I finished it years ago and I still can't come to terms with the fact that there's no ending. Especially with all the teasers thrown in I don't think anything else can fill the gap :((( I love this story so much.
