Basically my tittle.

Quick Examples like

- *The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles* and *The Fire that Swallowed the World* where Harry died on that fatefull life of Halloween. In the first one it's Tom Riddle's Hocruxe living the life of Harriet Potter without realizing that she's not in fact Harriet Potter, and in the second one it's a Fire Elemental that took control of the Husk that was Harriet when Petunia snapped and tried to burn her niece lifeless body

- *The Riddles of the Soul* Where Diary hocruxes fused with Harry's hocruxes in the climax of TCOS, and took control of Harry's body after his emotional breakdown following Voldemort's rebirth.

Preferably something where Harry is either completely dead or unable to retake control and not truly present into the story.


** Frik I need that first one to continue, it stopped in such an annoying spot

*** Well the author is not dead, since his/her other stories are being updated so it's just a wait and see game. I heard that the story was controversial because it's inspired from other fictions (that I never saw because they seem to have been deleted for a while already, I'm supposing from my infructuous search to find and read them) I don't really see the problem because it's not the first time that fanfiction authors took ideas from other fictions, but that might explain why the author is not updating anymore, too much drama.

**** Ugh I so want to go curse the idiots to hell and back but sadly I can't, if you're going to write a fanfic then people being dicks should only make you determined, not sad or something (unless it really hit some spot) I learned that from writing some short stories on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]]

Happy that the author isn't dead, dissapointed that it isn't updating any more

** I can think of several fics where this occurs with other characters, but you listed most of the ones that I know of involving Harry. I do know of a couple that involve Harry sharing a body, ex.

Her Mother's Love Linkffn(12760426)

Lily Potter lives on as a sort of pseudo-horcrux inside of Harry, and sometimes has control of their body. This isn't exactly what you're asking for, because Harry (Hazel, in this case) still has control most of the time.

Would you mind linking the fics you listed above? I can't find the Riddles of the Soul, and I don't think I've ever read it.

Edit: I just remembered this one!

It's pretty much exactly what you asked for, but it's set post-deathly hollows.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.

  At the end of Harry Potter's second year, something extraordinary happens: when Tom Riddle comes out from the Diary, he merges with the Horcrux that is inside of Harry.A few years later, this event will bring strong repercussions. Tom Riddle's soul will finally take control of Harry's body at the end of his fourth year. This means, Tom will pretend to be Harry Potter in front of the people that know him best. But Tom's plans won't go as he expected. The soul is a tricky thing.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
