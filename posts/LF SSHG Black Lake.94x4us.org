I read the beginning of a fanfiction where dumbledore tells hermione that snape will never like her and she jumps in the black lake. It is then hinted that she becomes queen of the mermaids. I thought it was called queen of the black lake but I cant find it. Reposting from a month ago one last time before I give up.

Thanks


** No problem! Anytime. I've been in the pairing for an embarrassingly long time, so let me know if you have any others you're trying to find. :-)

*** The only other one I could never find was a very long fic where severus trains hermione to be a spy like him and they wield dual knives. Fairly dark. That was a long time ago however.

** Doesn't sound familiar to me (which is a bit unusual), so I posted your request on one of the fb groups I'm in. I have a friend who says it might be Lake Effect Snow or On Greenstone Lake? She's got PDFs of them in a drop box if so...

*** No Ive read those although a good try. I read it on archiveofourown and I think it must have been deleted because Ive been back through the archive page by page and havent found it. A little further information [[/spoiler%20Hermione%20intends%20to%20commit%20suicide%20by%20jumping%20from%20a%20tower%20into%20the%20lake][trigger]] and then the professors goto have a meeting with the merpeople and they hear they have a new queen of the black lake. There were two chapters posted before I lost track of it. Thanks for the help!
