  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** I'll approve this post, but if the story is solely on DLP, then it's not allowed, and posting this is violation of /Rule 6/. If it's on a public site, then it's fine.
