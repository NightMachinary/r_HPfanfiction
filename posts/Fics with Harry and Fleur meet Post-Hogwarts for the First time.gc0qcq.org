Whether Canon happened or Voldemort and the War never have been doesnt matter. What i would like to know is if Harry and Fleur meet Post-hogwarts. And he might get a little attracted to her. Its not important, that she has the the same with him. Well, it doesnt have to be a Harry/Fleur fic, but the attraction on his side might be there. I leave it to the Fic, if they get intim, but decide to stay friends or not and there is just the (onse-sided) attraction, but i would like the intimacy.


** So either Fleur would have decided not to come to Hogwarts, Harry was missing that year OR the Tri-Wizard Tournament never happened

** Can only think of Harry Potter And The Escape To New York.. that said, it is a crossover with Beauty & The Beast (1987 series - but I never saw it and could easily follow, as the crossover happen after the series' plot).

You should also know it is a Harry/Fleur/Hermione story, so probably not for everyone. I greatly enjoyed it though.
