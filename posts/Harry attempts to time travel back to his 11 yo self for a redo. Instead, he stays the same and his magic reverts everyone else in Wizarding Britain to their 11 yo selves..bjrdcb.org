*** However you want to play it. Obviously minds, but maybe bodies as well.

If Voldemort's alive, then definitely him as well. I have no idea about the horcruxes, I didn't even think of them

** Considering the amount of magic necessary to pull this off, he should also pass out for a bit of time, which gives everybody the opportunity to sort things out somewhat and lets you tell the story of "how things are now" instead of having to sift through the chaos of "how did this happen" (since we already know how it happened but the characters do not) You can always tell small little anecdotes about how X person reacted to it later during the story-telling

*** tbh, I'm pretty sure that moving matter through time would be less complicated/energy intesive than changing matter and obliviating a few thousand/million people.

** I'm pretty sure that would be more catastrophic than the Thanos snap.

All of society would crumble if suddenly everyone was replaced by a 11 year old who hasn't gone to Hogwarts yet.

Nobody would know any magic, except for little bits kids picked up from parents.

The food supply chain would be completely broken and the muggle world would experience a weird phenomenon of tens of thousands of hungry 11 year olds with no parents and weird delusions about magic appearing out of nowhere.

Maybe other magical countries would intervene and kidnap the majority of the people turned into children. Maybe letting their versions of the DoM try to find out what the hell happened in Britain and how to undo it.

If they don't, the statute of secrecy would pretty much get destroyed. 11 year olds aren't responsible enough to keep it secret, especially not if they are hungry and there's no food left in the Wizarding World.

*** Hahaha. And if they keep their memories ...

Imagine wizards with all the knowledge of adults, but the endocrine systems and hence moodiness and poor impulse control of children on the cusp of adolescence.
