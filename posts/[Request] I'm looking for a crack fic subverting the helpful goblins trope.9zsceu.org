It's not especially funny, but it does have goblins being bad guys and trying to scam muggleborns...and in an unwise decision, Harry Potter.

** Heck yes. I hate helpful goblins. I don't remember the name, but I seem to recall a fic where the Goblins drowned anyone who wanted anything in so much paperwork for things like claiming the vaults of dead families that they'd never get anything, thus stealing the contents of said vaults.

There was another, again I don't remember the name, where the goblins had picked the weird numbers of wizarding currency (how many knuts to a sickle/sickles to a galleon) specifically so that wizards wouldn't be able to understand their own finances. That made me laugh, because I've always thought figuring out how much things cost in the wizarding world must be a nightmare with how the currency works

*** it really is. you can (faitrly easily) setup World of warcraft to use the HP amounts for coins. And i basically gave up on doing maths on anything less than a galleon.

** ~sigh~

I was going to write a short snippet here, drawing on my knowledge of Evil Genius (the game). Basically how no matter how much evil the goblins do (fraud, larceny, people trafficking, sponsoring dark lords, etc), they're bewildered that wizardkind seem to completely forget in 24-48 hours and go back to banking with them as normal.

But I got hassled by one of those redirects to a page which beeps loudly at you, and my writing mood is ruined...

** Well, this does subvert the helpful goblins trope but not in the exact way you are looking for but it is still interesting enough.
