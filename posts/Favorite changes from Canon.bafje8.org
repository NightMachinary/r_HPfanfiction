** Major changes. Give me Voldemort coming back to life on first year because he gets the Stone, give me someone else getting the diary and perhaps even Tom Riddle revived through it, give me Harry not being chosen to participate in the Triwizard Tournament, give me new adventures that we never saw in the books...

Essentially, I like the concept of having one very small change mess up the whole series of events from early on, slowly accumulating more and more divergences.

*** The change is permanent, but that doesn't mean it's consistent or uniform. Hogwarts transfiguration lessons are full of silvery matchsticks and metallic colours beetles. Which is kind of necessary quality control for anything you'd want to eat or use as a tool/toy/furniture. If an average wizard changed water to milk, I wouldn't drink the milk. If an average wizard transfigured a tree into a flight of stairs, I'm taking the elevator.

Of course there are wizards whose transfigurations are perfect or close to it. But I don't think this is a large part of the population, and also most of the goods we see for sale in the books are magical. We are never shown a transfigured object having magical properties, so it's probably safe to say that if you wanted a magical tool or object (flying broom/vanishing cabinet/wand/etc) you needed to make it the old-fashioned way.

Daphne Greengrass. She has a clearly defined personality in the world of FF, is usually written roughly the same, and is genuinely one of my favorite characters. Looking back i don't think she has a single line in canon. It's amazing how so many people can write her the same with that in mind.

I love any bit of story that gets kinda nerdy bout wards. Funfact, wards aren't canon.

****** The term 'wards' itself is never used. It's a fan made creation. The stones are also a fanmade creation. So yes, technically speaking you could argue since it's a fan made creation, that fan made definition would stretch to cover any sort of protective enchantment in an area. But that's not what most authors seem to consider wards, and it's not what I would consider wards when I'm talking about what I'm interested in.

That said, I'll amend my previous statement.

"The term "wards" and wardstones are not canon".

Hopefully that's enough to keep everyone happy.

Well the bold part isn't canon, Harry is told his father and Sirius were the cleverest students of Hogwarts, he heard from McGonagall that the two of them were /extremely bright/ but it is never said that Lily was a charm prodigy. However Slughorn described her as /one of the best student he'd ever had/.

Otherwise I agree that Harry should have been more motivated in learning magic, I feel like there is a shift between the first books and the last books in that aspect

**** Yeah, and with Slughorn I'd wager that "best" really means well-connected and resourceful. She was a pretty, popular girl who maybe had help from a friend who really /is/ brilliant at potions (Snape), which are all recollections made fuzzy by years of dead-hero-worship and messing with his own memories to assuage his own guilt. I guess I just wouldn't take Slughorn's statement at face value.

***** I do not subscribe to that theory, Lily was brillant in potion from first year to her seventh year, she cut ties with Snape at the end of fifth. Slughorn would have noticed it if her apparent skills had decreased, no that theory comes from people having a hard time accepting Snape not being the only brillant potionner among his peers.

For all we know Snape's recipes altering might have come from Lily.
