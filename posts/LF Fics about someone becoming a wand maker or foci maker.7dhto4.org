Hey I'm looking for fics about someone crafting wands or other magical foci. I have looked through this reddit for a while and can't seem to find any. Well not entirely true I have found some that have a small part of it about it but that is not what I'm looking for. I want fics that have the main character have a passion for foci crafting or wand crafting and it being the main focus of the story.


** Damnit, I've read a story where Draco is a wandmaker and came up with an idea to use precious stones to amplify the wands. Enough thought went into the idea that the story worked. I'll see if it's lurking in my bookmarks, but it is H/D which is not everyone's cup of tea.

** There's a story called "Apprentic James" (with the misspelling) that involves Harry as Garrick Ollivander's apprentice.

I can't recommend it. It's pandering to men by never using a female character when a male character would suffice. It's got some crud about magical familiars. It uses wandcrafting as a means to make Harry too powerful. It doesn't go into the mechanics of it enough.

But it very thoroughly exists.

  Harry goes willingly to face Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. When Death shows Harry the eventual failure of his quest, Harry discovers that Voldemort has twisted much more than his own soul with the Horcruxes. At the same time as Harry's decision to re-enter the Living, Time and Magic throw another resurrected hero in the mix, the slain Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

** I know I've read something like this on Sugarquill a LONG time ago. The 5th book may not even have come out yet so no Luna or other characters introduced during the 5th book onwards.

Basically during the summer before 3rd year, when Harry is staying at Diagon Alley, he becomes a tag-along of Ollivander. It discussed the history of magic. It went on to discuss how wizards came to have wands.

The fact that I can't remember how this story ended probably means it was left unfinished. I can't remember its title or who the author was.

Edit: FOUND IT! It's COMPLETE! [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2332&chapno=1][www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2332&chapno=1]]

It's not quite how I remembered it. That history of magic part was actually the history of the Ollivander family so there's a lot of wand lore there, though since this was written before the 5th book came out, things are bound to sound different from what JK Rowling has come up with.

** in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) Harry has added wandmaking to his repertoire. He also has a vast collection of other people's wands that had been gifted to him.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
