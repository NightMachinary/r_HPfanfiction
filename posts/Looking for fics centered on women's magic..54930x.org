It's not something I see a whole lot of but it's proved to be endlessly fascinating to me. Some fics I've read make offhand comments about it now and then (see The Changeling by Annerb linkffn(6919395) ) but I don't often see fics where it's a pivotal plot point.

The one exception is The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie linkffn(12058516) which is great, by the way, but sadly not complete yet although it is still updating. I've also read The Twenty by Leyna Rountree linkffn(1844462) although that was ages ago.

I'd appreciate any recommendations! Anything is welcome.


** Darth Marrs' Firebird's Son trilogy does something like this. There's a lot of focus on the Wizarding World being matriarchal for a variety of reasons, but I won't get into why in case you want to read it. I don't want to get into spoilers. There's a conspiracy-ish vibe throughout.

I could be remembering incorrectly, but I think this story also had some sort of spooky thing where older magicals started to glow for some reason, which was also kind of different.

I personally didn't love it, but that has more to do with his style of writing than the content. It's been a long time since I've read his stuff, so don't let that affect your decision to check it out.

They became less human and gained a fear aura (close range, Muggles only).

Their genes changed over time so they were genetically compatible with Muggles at birth but stopped being able to interbreed around the age of forty. Genetics doesn't work that way, but magic, I guess.

I hated how inconsistent the worldbuilding was. Society's most pressing concern that had been a problem for nine generations, but the society didn't look anything like how it should if that were actually happening.
