I was wondering if there is any Back to the Future type Harry Potter fanfic where Harry goes back in time to his Parents time, but more like Back to the Future storyline.


** I don't know any, but bumping because I want to read this! (Without the Marty-almost-fucks-his-mom side plot, please. Not interested in that for Harry and Lily, lol.)

** The closest one I've ever read that was half decent was linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) but even that isnt the BttF story. Harry goes back, meets his parents and has to... deal with things? He ends up in a photograph and people think he fancies his mum (he doesn't but people think that)

Its a good laugh fic! A better timetravel fic if your interested is linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) where he doesnt meet his parents at all and does his own thing. Its just a genuinely brilliant story.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
