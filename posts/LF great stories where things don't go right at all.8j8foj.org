Like, the protagonist loses, or there's lots of suffering and manipulation and sacrifices, like, even if they win, it's at a great cost and leaves you empty inside at the end... You know?

I'm looking for emotional suffering more than actual gore and torture, but I don't actually /mind/ it. Much.

(I'm just going through some stuff and could really use the catharsis of some good fictional suffering)
