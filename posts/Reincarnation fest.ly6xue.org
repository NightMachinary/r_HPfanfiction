Basically a bunch of people get reincarnated in the HP universe as one of the characters

Preferably no bashing but only if it's mild. Also if there is any evil characters they have to be a reincarnated evil character or canonically evil.


** Do you mean HP characters being reincarnated or SI/OCs?

** What if the one that dies looks for a new body as fast as he/she can? So, death date and birth date of new body should be really close by or the same day... Let's say Wormtail gets reincarnated as Teddy Lupin
