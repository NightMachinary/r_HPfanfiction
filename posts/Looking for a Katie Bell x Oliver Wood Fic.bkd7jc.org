Hi all. I remember reading this really good fic about Katie and Oliver. I can't seem to find it anymore though. I was wondering if you can help me.

The story is kind of told from Oliver's POV and starts off at the Puddlemere qudditch practice where Oliver catches an owl telling him that Katie got cursed by the necklace. And Oliver visits her any chance he gets. The Puddlemere team visits Katie. and Even Oliver's older sister and niece visits.

I love this story and I'm sad that I can't seem to find it anymore. Please help!
