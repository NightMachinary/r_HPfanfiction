Story: The Shadow of Angmar [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/26]]


** In other news, I'd rate the chances of another update in about a month or so to be better than even. Currently I'm being waylaid a bit by my editing my new HP/DC crossover, but that will be concluding in about three weeks and hopefully my attention can turn back to SoA fully.

Edit: My second gold ever. Thanks kind stranger!

*** Hi, I noticed a spelling error in the first chapter and thought I'd let you know, around the start like the 5th or 6th paragraph of the story it goes "The battle had been long and hard fought. Many Men and Elves had /falled/ in the battle or had been dealt a mortal injury,"

I think it should be /fallen/ or /been felled/.

**** I typically don't respond to reviews any more, mostly as a result of the large number the story gets. I read through them all, and always take on board comments, but attempting to give meaningful responses to them would take a lot of time that I don't really have. I know it's not ideal, but in the past I have spent my entire weeks writing time responding to reviews and I figure people would much rather such time went towards writing more of the story.

If you have questions about the story, you can try asking on reddit (I may be away from reddit, but if I'm around I'll try to answer), or, if you have an account on DarkLordPotter, I try and answer any direct questions in the Work by Author thread there.

Finally, I can lately be found on the DLP discord, and, much more recently, the hpfanfiction discord. I'll respond to pings in either.

***** Regardless: please know that you're writing one of the most beloved stories in fanfiction, and that your work is appreciated. I understand that responding to individual comments probably takes too long; the fact that you're still writing is response enough.

Edited to add: I realize asking anything of you is probably unreasonable, but: one small request. Can you post to AO3 as well as [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]? I realize there are more readers on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], but some of us vastly prefer AO3's interface, and like supporting the site because it is run by fans and not by a fairly indifferent commercial entity.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** Harry is accidentally summoned into Middle Earth by servants of Sauron, who then proceed to imprison and torture him when he isn't what they wanted (they were hoping for Morgoth). He's eventually rescued when Carn DÃ»m is overthrown, and sets out to see the land and try to find magic that could take him home. However, Middle Earth magic is very different from his own, and he doesn't have his wand, so he's starting from scratch. Fortunately, his Master of Death status makes him apparently ageless.

His actions have caused some small but significant ripples from canon, which are only now starting to really be felt.

****** If you want to fully appreciate it. At least Lord of the Rings level, even though this goes way further back in the history of that world. Of course, if you've never read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings I really recommend you do that just for your quality of life and the pop culture references.

You could still read it without that, though.

****** No, it is not necessary. As Harry is new to the world and everything is from his POV, you learn about the world along with him. But yes, knowing LoTR would greatly enhance your enjoyment out of reading it. It does not overlap with the movies yet, happens in a different era mostly, which might change in future. But knowing the characters and places would be fun. On the contrary, you can still follow the story and Harry's journey easily even if you dont know much about LoTR. And I might say, this fic could possibly make you want to read Tolkien finally if you are still holding out against it.

Um...there's very little resemblance between Tolkien's books and the movies. At least, books 2 and 3. So, I'm not sure that it matters whether Shadows of Angmar overlaps them...
