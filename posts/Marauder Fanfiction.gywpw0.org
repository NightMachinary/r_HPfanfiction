Anybody have any fan fictions about the marauders at hogwarts? And recommendations would be lovely. Last thing, I prefer long stories longer than 100k words.

Thank you in advance


** There's linkffn(White Flags by MarauderLover7), about Lily getting magically stuck to Sirius for several days and thus having to get to know the Marauders a bit better. The same author has written an excellent series where Sirius escapes from Azkaban early and raises Harry from age eight (first four books complete, book five regularly updating).

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is about Harry being briefly sent back to the Marauders' time, and is pretty decent.

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** Casting Moonshadows is one of my favourite Marauders fics. It's long and well written but unfortunately it's not completed. I still think it's worth reading, there's 86 chapters of it (394k), so while it isn't complete, there's plenty of plot threads and subplots that get expanded and resolved. I believe that at the moment the marauders are in sixth year. The narration is mostly in Lupin's p.o.v. linkffn(3378356)

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

*** Sorry, forgot to mention that the author also has another story where the marauders and Lily play a big role, but it's set post-second war and Harry is involved. linkffn(4238196)

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.
