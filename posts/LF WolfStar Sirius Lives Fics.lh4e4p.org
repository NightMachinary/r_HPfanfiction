:END:
So I just devoured All the Young Dudes and now am on a WolfStar and Marauders kick. Can anyone recommend some other great fics? I would also love fics where Sirius lives past OOTP.

Thank you!!!


** linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) is probably the best one. Stick with it, trust me! It is quite explicit at times though.

â€‹

Not Sirius Lives fics but some other fics I would highly reccommend if you like ATYD are:

linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian). This author writes excellent Remus&Sirius fics looking at both their lives both apart and together. Its excellent if you want just more good Remus Sirius content and their stories are incredible.

linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) is a Raising Harry fic you probably have read? If not its veery good.

linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89) is also just adorable. A muggle AU but you'll cry its just lovely!

Oh!! And a SERIOUSLY underrated fic is linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies). Its really brilliant. It follows Remus and Sirius separately during the 12 years in azkaban then brings them together at the end. Its veeery angsty and the ending is very Grant/Remus/Sirius vibes which was just brilliant! I just love it.

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)
