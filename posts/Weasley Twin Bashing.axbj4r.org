*** They apparently shoved an Umbridge collaborator into a vanishing cabinet, but I thought I remembered that there was a guy in book one that got stuck in one for weeks, and that they had something to do with it?

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** Yes, almost killing Ron by making him swear an unbreakable vow, scaring him with a spider so badly that the boy develops arachnophobia, locking Percy in a cursed tomb for shits and giggles, experimenting on unsuspecting people, manipulating eleven-year-olds into testing potentially dangerous, experimental magics... What a charming duo.

Nah, man. I always disliked the way Rowling practically ignored just how dangerous those two sadistic fucks were.

At least she gave us a sort-of happy ending by killing off one of them.

**** Rowling has a soft spot for the Weasleys. Arguably most of them are problematic as hell but fandom loves them.

***** Hell, no. Arthur Weasley is one of my favourite characters, like ever. The guy knows what he wants in life and has accomplished it. He has the life Harry dreams of having. Molly is cool too and so is Charlie and Ron. Bill would have been just as well-written if Rowling hadn't try to create the ultimate cool guy with him and absolutely bollocksed it up.

No, I think her mistake was not showing two sides of the madalion, as they say. Twins are funny when their jokes are on someone else's expense and she showed us that but what happens when it is you who is the target? When eating a meal becomes a stressful adventure? She failed at that, I think.

****** Okay, "most" was a stretch.

I'm too sick to write a list of issues with Molly Weasley right now, but others have written long essays on all the issues with her character. I have no issue with Arthur/Bill/Charlie/Ron, but Molly, the Twins, and Ginny all seem to get a pass in canon for being hurtful/harmful and people just go with it.

JKR doesn't seem to really think through the consequences of the actions of the plot favourites sometimes. Like I love Hermione, but she permanently scarred some girl's face and it's just...okay? Like wtf.
