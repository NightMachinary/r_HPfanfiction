** Harry drew his wand.

"Quirrinus Quirrel?"

"You, uh, must be mistaken. I don't know this Professor Quirrel."

"You know", Harry said grimly, "I never actually mentioned that he was a professor."

"You have no right to accost me! I have done nothing!"

Harry held up his Auror badge.

"Well, you're either an undead servant of Voldemort, broke all the regulations on time travel, or you're impersonating a dead man. Whichever it is, I'm placing you under arrest until we sort this out. Now are you going to come quietly, or do I have to stun you and carry you back to the Ministry?"

Quirrel's eyes darted about, seeking an escape route. Then his hand flew toward his wand. He never made it. A silent stunner hit him in the center of his chest and he slumped over the table, unconscious.

"Sorry about that Miss", Harry said, turning to the frightened Muggle. "And about this. Obliviate." He levitated the unconscious Quirrel, gripped his wrist (careful not to touch his skin, in case it still burned), and apparated them both back to the Auror Office. He reflected sourly that he'd have to send Ginny a message informing her he'd miss dinner tonight. Damn it. This was going to be a lot of paperwork.
