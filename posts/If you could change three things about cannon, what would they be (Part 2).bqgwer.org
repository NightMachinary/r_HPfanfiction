I'm conducting this survey again so coupled with my other one around 4-5 months ago I can put together a graph or something and determine the most controversial Harry Potter topics. JK is a great author and world builder, but far from perfect.

I post this in the HP ffn because I think finding a combination of things we want to change will lead to good Fanfiction and ideally the perfect Fanfiction! Because it would help pinpoint what it is that made us want to find alternative HP in the first place. So please share for data collection!

Personally 1. Scrap the Harry and Ginny pairing or at least offer a lot of buildup and let her be an important character from far earlier. (Chamber of Secrets would've been the perfect setup) Or don't even include romance because the bond between the three was love enough for me. I think Harry finding a family with those two was ‘the power of love' and not some whirlwind romance with his brothers sister

1. The way that Snape is some sort of hero doesn't sit well with me because regardless of doing one thing out of love for his lost love he was a terrible person and basically did it for selfish reasons. I know this one is controversial because there is a cult following of Snape. But I stand by the belief that his cannon character was just a terrible person.

2. Dumbledore not training Harry in anything but history was total crap and kind of made the final battle anticlimactic as the magic was pretty basic compared to Dumbledore vs Voldemort which was epic. This has to do with JK wanting Harry to be an ‘Everyman Hero' rather than a true Hero. Which seemed to be her intention since Harry showed flashes of power through book 3 and 4.

Let me know what you think!


** The excess letter "n".

In seriousness:

*Change #1: fix Harry's character arc in HBP to restore the hero's path*

Consists of:

- Making Harry take to non-verbal magic instinctively, in the same way that he was naturally good at resisting the Imperius.

- Removing the mentions of Harry's increasing struggles with his classes, replace them with mentions of his classes beginning to make sense.

- Showing Harry learning the combat spells and the campsite protection spells which he is using in DH.

- Having Harry learn things from the HBP Potions book so that he actually gets better at Potions rather than simply following different recipes and learning nothing.

*Change #2: More war*

Consists of:

- Having Harry work his way up to Voldemort, defeating a primary Death Eater antagonist in each of OotP and HBP. This showcases Harry's progression but also adds more depth to the Death Eaters.

- Fleshing out the specific actions Voldemort is taking to gain control of the Ministry, and the counteractions the Order is taking.

- Emphasising the search for allies, including at least one ally who is gained via less-than-noble means.

*Change #3: Alternative climax*

Harry's realising that he's a horcrux and walk into the forest is perfect as the emotional climax to the series. But the physical climax needs some work. There needs to be a better way in which Voldemort is in fact defeated, ideally directly connected to Harry's stint in limbo, destruction of the scarcrux, and return to life.

"Harry gains Voldemort's magical skills by absorbing the horcrux" is a curbstomp premise which removes conflict when it comes at the beginning of a story, but I do actually think it would make a satisfying /ending/ to the series, and reasonably foreshadowed - the multiple times Harry is said to be like Tom Riddle, the fact that he has already gained some of Voldemort's powers (parseltongue), the prophecy describing them as equals, and then the realisation that Harry is a horcrux.

In canon Voldemort is so much more powerful and skilled than Harry that it's actually unbelievable that Harry could win. Harry absorbing Voldemort's skills could power him up to a place where he's more reasonably close to Voldemort while still appearing weaker due to additional scruples etc that hold him back in a way that Voldemort doesn't.

** 1. Agree with you on H/G. Develop Ginny as a character. She was awesome in OotP and then she was relegated to only being Harry's love interest in HBP. If she was a better character, I could maybe go for her being with Harry.
2. Harry's training! Yes please! It was clear to the Order that Harry had to fight Voldemort since OotP. Even if they were hoping to let him "stay a child" and not push his destiny on him, he was still in danger. He had survived at the end of GoF by pure accident. Why not teach him a few tricks to at least keep himself safe? They had multiple aurors in the Order. None of them could be bothered to say "Hey Harry! Here try this spell. Might help you stay alive"
3. Have Harry ask for help. I understand that it is a usual "hero" thing for Harry to go off alone in the search of Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione and is essential for the plot. But I find it a bit moronic that he would not ask the Order for help. They didn't have to know why they were looking for things. Just that it is a locket or a cup. Aurors could have been useful in getting the locket from Umbridge. Bill might have had connections at Gringotts.
4. Not name Harry's kid after Snape. I personally love Snape and his arc throught the books but from Harry's perspective, he was still the man who had made his school life miserable. Being on the Light side did not make him less of an asshole. And yet, Harry decided to name his son after the man, forgetting about Remus, Fred and all the other people who died that were closer to him.

** I would say;

1. Make Voldemort a better villain. Canon Voldemort is the typical childrensbook villain who is evil, powerful and fails because of his ego. Grindelwald and Umbrige are so much better villains and they aren't even supposed to be the main ones.

2. Give Ginny a better character arc. In a way, she is only there for Harry, which is weird.

3. Let others point out what cruel things Hermione is capable of. It is never spoken about and always swept under the rug.

4. Expand Ron's character arc.

5. I've got the feeling JK Rowling got herself inspired in the last two books from the movies' portrayal of Hermione and Ron. Quite the lost opportunity.

6. And lastly get some representation of the lgbtq community into the books. I dunno, emphasize for example Albus' crush on Grindelwald or something.

But why though? Generally speaking the magical world is quite backwards. It would make a lot of sence that they don't accept lgbtq couples and, as such, we don't see them.

In the context of the story it doesn't make sence to get a lot of lgbtq representation nor is it logical that Hermione is black (talking to Rowling here).

** 1. Most importantly: the series is presented from the start as though it's a coming of age story about a young wizard who, by learning, going through formative events, and growing up, will eventually defeat the great evil villain. Instead, in the last two books, Harry becomes an almost complete puppet in Dumbledore's extremely convoluted plan, even to the point where Dumbledore is basically running the show even after he's died. I would either make it into the coming of age story we expect, with Harry slowly growing in power over time so he can believably defeat Voldemort, or I'd make Dumbledore's role in the last couple of years much more explicit by presenting him carefully laying the groundwork /and/ somehow involving Harry enough in it that Harry isn't just a marionette for a dead man. Either way, Harry should be much less passive and much more the conscious and involved agent of Voldemort's doom.

2. If the real desire is to have Ginny become Harry's believable love interest, she needs to be a real character. If you're not willing to give her enough space that the reader actually knows what her personality is like and why Harry might like her, then pair Harry with someone like Luna or Hermione who /does/ play a significant enough role in the story that we know them well. Or, don't have a pairing at all. But please, if you're going to pair the main character with someone, let us understand why they find their love interest interesting.

3. The plots in the series are often pretty terrible. Just a few examples that have always stuck in my craw.

   a. In Chamber of Secrets, no one, among all the experienced expert wizards in the castle, can figure out that the problem is a basilisk? No one? Really?

   b. In Goblet of Fire, Fake Moody could have handed a portkey to Harry to kidnap him and get him to Voldemort any time over the course of the academic year, and instead is operating an insanely complicated plot to have Harry win the Triwizard tournament just so that he'll touch a portkey at the end when he wins. This is silly. Hell, Fake Moody could have just stunned him and stolen some of his blood at any time, too. (The entire Triwizard tournament is silly; it's supposed to be deadly, but a sense of real danger isn't there through most of it, the events are kind of lame (except maybe the dragon) and the rules are silly, plus everyone is cheating with inside information.)

   c. In Order of the Phoenix, we presume the adults/experienced wizards all know about veritaserum, pensieves, etc., but no one tries doing something like getting a reporter to look at Harry's memories or having him interviewed under veritaserum or any such? No one at the ministry wants to try that either? Sure, maybe we claim they could all have been faked, but they would probably go a long way towards convincing people of what is going on. We have to assume that in a world where people can look at other people's memories that this would be done routinely when something important is witnessed by a lone individual. Furthermore, 80% of the plot is driven by idiocy. Dumbledore knows more or less what's going on with the prophesy held at the ministry but never bothers to tell Harry enough, Harry never talks to Sirius (who is supposedly a father figure) with his mirror, etc.

   d. I could go on and on about the plot, but I won't, I've said enough...

*** On point 3b, the reason a random object wasn't made into a portkey is that, aside from it probably not being possible to create or bring in unauthorised ones for security reasons, Voldemort's return was meant to be a secret. If Harry had just vanished one day, people would have noticed. Whereas, even if Harry escaped, he'd have returned with no real proof, because memories can be tampered with and veritaserum can be overcome with occlumency. Memories and beliefs are sometimes just mistaken as well. I think the plan was for Harry to be sent back dead and people to presume that something in the maze got him, or for somebody else to become him and go back in his place. Barty Jr could have either continued as Moody and spied - remember, Voldemort thought Snape had abandoned him at that point - or at some later point, taken over as Harry. It could only have been him or Pettigrew. No other Death Eater aside from Snape really knew him. The others I'll give you.

This makes no sense. Voldemort intended to kill Harry after the ritual and had no worries about him escaping, and it makes no difference to secrecy whether he's kidnapped mid-year or at the end of the year. He could have been sent back dead at any time, and even if he disappeared, there would be no particular reason to believe Voldemort was responsible. Whether he was kidnapped mid-year and escaped or kidnapped at the end of the year and escaped, the same rules would apply to any story he told about his absence. Thus, this hypothesis explains nothing.

***** He could have been sent back dead at another time, sure. But if he just doesn't turn up to Charms one day and someone finds him, I don't know, lying out in the corridor when the lesson is over, then it'd be investigated and Voldemort could have lost 50% of his confirmed supporters and the potential for the gathering of further information. Whereas, if it happens in the maze (or at least in the second task) there wouldn't necessarily be one, or at least not such an in-depth one, because to most people the cause of his death would have obviously been something in the task itself. It would ruin the reputation of the Ministry and of Dumbledore himself. I suspect this is a part of why the third task specifically was selected. - More witnesses to Dumbledore's failure. We also don't know how that potion was made or how long it took to brew. Some potions, some ingredients even, can only be used or collected at certain times. It's all speculation until JKR gives us more information, but a lack of information doesn't necessarily mean that the plan didn't make sense. We just haven't heard all of it yet.

** Hm, let's see. I would...

1) Have more competent and well-balanced adults. I understand why so many of them weren't, but there's a point where the number becomes a little silly. I'd give the surviving ones a boost, have a couple more survive - in particular, have Barty Crouch Jr., who I'd have either escape or spying as Moody. He would have made things a lot more challenging for Harry and the Order, which is probably why JKR shoved him out of the way. But it was a huge wasted opportunity, IMO. Particularly since, having been so careful and methodical all year, I find it very out of character for him to randomly lure Harry away and start monologuing. Also, I realise that not everybody is going to have the same level of maturity or handle things in the same way, but, for example, Lupin's behaviour (Best friend's kid entered into a death match against his will? Should I write? Nahhhh. / OHYAY I'm no longer alone. ...Better abandon them and go off on my own, then.) to be highly irritating. And don't even get me started on Snape.

2) Dial back Harry's shinies a bit. - The youngest Seeker in a century, possessor of multiple unique and mythological items, Parselmouth etc. I realise some are required for the plot - the ones I would keep, even if they ended up adjusted a touch, - and he's the protagonist and all, but honestly, sometimes it seems like a bit much. I'm much more interested in a hero who wins despite being extraordinarily ordinary. Actually, I'd allow some of the other characters a little more involvement in general. Not to the point where they take over, but we don't even know the official canon names of the other two girls in Harry's year. One hundred and ninety nine chapters and we don't even get their names.

3) Pairings and the names of their kids. I would not have almost everybody end up with someone they went to school with and I would change many of the latter. Snape does not deserve someone to be named after him and I'm a little dubious about Albus also at times.

** 1. A different ending. Either forego the "Harry has to die" arc or give him a heroic death like Leonidas. Don't turn him into Jesus.

2. A better thought-out Battle of Hogwarts. Just the mandrakes alone should be enough to kill the entirety of Voldemort's forces within a few seconds. Perhaps nerf that plant somehow. Have the castle matter more, have strongpoints fought for harder instead of just some battle happening. Take inspiration from the Battle of Stalingrad if you are out of other ideas. Or the Siege of Vienna.

3. No Ron/Hermione. They have three things in common, being Harry's friend, being in Gryffindor and fighting Voldemort. That is not enough to base a relationship on, at least none which lasts longer than a weekend.

** 1. *Giving Ron an emotional arc*.\\
   At the start we saw his biggest desire was to achieve not just what any of his brother accomplished, but to do all of it. Head Boy with the Quidditch Cup getting all the adoration. So, essentially he starts off measuring himself based on other's achievements.\\
   He should've gone through a journey of self discovery and finding his own worth that doesn't compensate his brothers or his family member's have already done.\\
2. *Team Balancing.*\\
   Oh you know? Like not just having one member of the team doing all the work while others just hang around moping. Each of the three friends should have something unique of themselves that the adventure required. Hermione's thinking, Harry's instincts, Ron's... well, it should've been common sense, but Hermione gets that as well. Go figure.
3. *Harry stepping up to be the hero.*\\
   /"When you can do the things that I can, but you don't, and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you."/ - Peter Parker.\\
   Yes, I know, JK wanted Harry Potter to be an everyman. An everyman who also happened to be the youngest seeker, an almost prodigy in flying and defence and the youngest to cast corporeal Patronus.\\
   Harry's arc should be about him getting better. Not awesomely powerful mind you, but he should at least be trying to get to a better place. Otherwise we wouldn't have a last minute save from Dobby with gillyweed.\\
   This will also put forth a good message about how if people start to act more responsible then things can get better.

** Three things are hardly enough, but I guess it encourages prioritization.

1. Give Harry and Ron, especially Harry, gifts or talents that are equivalent to Hermione's intelligence. Hermione went from a valuable member of the trio in book 1 to the wondergirl who saved the day and ran the show in book 7 and then who supposedly became Minister for Magic while tolerating her drunk loser of a husband. Hermione, the girl who prefers books to people, offends people as easily as breathing and has a cruel streak a mile wide that she doesn't care to hide somehow becomes the premier politician of her country. It's pretty obvious that Rowling just starts heaping positive traits and accomplishments on her because girlpower and Emma Watson's rising star by the end of the series. Had they remained balanced, the story would have been better for it and epilogue related stories would be much more tolerable. Harry should have shown an intuitive talent for Charms or Transfiguration, and it should have affected the story at important moments. He should have been shown as a young wizard who was quite powerful for his age. Ron's supposed strategic genius from book 1 should have been built upon in the later books, as well as giving him more to do than being decoration for the last few books.

2. Include Ginny, Neville, Luna and other secondary characters from the beginning. Neville comes and goes but Luna just suddenly appears in book 5. She could have been used earlier to colour in the wacky Wizarding World. Ginny needed a lot more character development and shading in to be more widely accepted as a good pairing for Harry. Friends and allies from outside Gryffindor, bonus points if from Slytherin, would have further fleshed Hogwarts out in canon.

3. Harry suffered three straight years of defeat after defeat until he beat Voldemort in book 7. Instead of building Umbridge and then Draco Malfoy of all people up in books 5 and 6, there could be a particular powerful Death Eater that Harry and his friends come into conflict with and manage to defeat. The identity and actions of each senior Death Eater defeated could match with a theme against one of Harry and his friends.

** I spent a long ass time writing an answer here and then the reddit app closed when I accidentally hit the home button because my phone has the RAM of a dying chihuahua so here's the abridged version:

1. Rebalance the trio: make Ron the sociable, charming one and keep Hermione as being hideously socially inept as per her introduction. In the later books, Hermione is constantly explaining social implications to Harry and Ron, and honestly, the whole thing comes across as Rowling going "lul boys r dum and Get It (tm)!" Honestly, and I'm really showing my age here (I'm just shy of 23, for the curious), it makes me think of Shoes. Y'all remember Shoes? With Kelly? Anyways, there's this point in the song where Kelly just says "stupid boys, stupid boys, let's get some shoes, let's party," and every time I think about Hermione (the character who introduced herself by saying "hi, I'm a bossy know it all with no tact"), say, carefully breaking down Cho's complex and volatile emotional state for the Dumb Guys, I'm taken right back to fucking 2007. Or was it 2008? God, I'm old.

2. Don't do Harry/Ginny. Assuming that we're going for relatively minor/realistic adjustments here rather than broad, sweeping changes, Harry/Luna is really the only pair that I would've been happy with as an end game (or is it endgame?) ship, since none of the other female characters would've really made sense and none of the male characters were ever on the table, but him hooking up with a Slytherin would've been great, albeit not any of the ones we know in canon since they're all either terrible people (every Slytherin student we meet, all of the Death Eaters, Snape, who wasn't a Death Eater by the time the story starts but who spent his adult life abusing children) or old (Slughorn, the only explicitly adult Slytherin character who never joined the Death Eaters (also Snape stans don't @ me I know he defected but that doesn't change the fact that he willingly joined them, and the only reason he left was that they threatened someone (probably the only someone) that he personally cared about, and he was 300% willing to let her husband and infant son die if it meant she would live. Also it was insanely hot today and my apartment is still 80+ degrees and I'm not in the mood for your shit.)).

3. Give us a clearer picture of who Lily was as a person. In canon, she's more of an unimpeachable symbol of perfect maternal love than, like, a person. We learn a fair amount about James, we get to meet his closest friends, hell, PoA was more about the Marauders than it was Harry. Lily doesn't really get that, though. The only people who really talk about her are Hagrid, who adored her, Slughorn, who adored her, and Petunia, who resented her but is also an abusive prick who is never once treated as a reliable source of information on anything, much less something about which she's so obviously biased. I think the thing that best sums up my issues with the unequal portrayals of the Potter parents is how people compare Harry to them:

When Harry goes after Ron in PoA, Sirius says "I thought you'd come for your friend. Your father would have done the same for me." James' closest friend is directly and favourably comparing Harry to his father. It also makes explicit the parallel between Harry and Ron's friendship and James and Sirius' that the book has been building up ever since it revealed that Sirius, as movie!Harry is wont to tell us, WAS THEIR FRIEND!

Meanwhile, in DH, Snape rants that Harry is "his father, all over again," and Dumbledore counters "in looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother's." Here, Dumbledore is telling Snape something very obvious that he's too selfish and stubborn to realise, and Harry isn't even present. The line also serves to foreshadow Harry's sacrifice and the protection it gives the people defending Hogwarts, yes, but it doesn't really tell us anything new about Lily.

Honourable Mention: don't treat dark magic as inherently evil. Harry uses it all the time in the later books with basically no consequence (dude successfully​ casts the fucking Imperius Curse on his first try and when the guy tries to fight it off, he's all "OHP GUESS I DIDN'T DO IT STRONG ENOUGH," and just casts it again like it ain't no thang), but someone liking or being interested in dark magic is somehow a mark against their character? I don' geddit.

*** I completely agree with how fucking hot it is and I love your points. Only things I disagree with are as far as Ron goes I never found him particularly charming, he is more of the clueless type who has NO idea on how to talk to women with major jealousy issues. But I COMPLETELY agree that Hermione should not be some kind of social god when she only has two male best friends and her only female friend is her male friends sister! Makes no sense, she's supposed to be book smart and not socially smart. It would've worked well if the magical world was slightly more medieval and Ron knew all about the proper greetings and social interactions that way, otherwise I don't think Ron even gave af enough to try being charming, he kind of just expected people to like him.

And yeah Snape is a slime ball who deserves no redemption in my eyes, I really don't think I have to even explain why, you seem like minded on the subject. As far as romance goes, it probably wasn't necessary PERIOD because I think the whole friendship thing actually worked incredibly well, which is odd for me because I generally only read fics with some kind of pairing, but JK built their friendship so well it could've stood alone.

And yeah Harry's parents

James: pranks, smart, funny, social god Lily: smart, kind, Hermione basically

You're telling me that if you had an orphaned boy, and you knew his parents well, they were your best friends, your students, or anything! You wouldn't tell him all about them!! Let alone never even been asked! Their whole lives have been categorized from their traits, rather than their actions and it's total crap. I could've gone without vivid descriptions of Harry and Ron bullshitting their way through divination (albeit it was incredibly funny) and have actually fleshed out the world and characters a lot more...

Well I guess that gives us a reason for Fanfiction, thanks for the reply!

** 1. Harry/Luna

2. The tasks in the Triwizard Tournament get changed to the Jbern ones.

3. Nicolas Flamel plays a bigger role. The most criminally underutilised character in the entire series, by a wide margin - and when they finally did use him, they turned him into a fuckin joke that doesn't even make sense, the Philosopher's Stone is supposed to produce an elixir of life, not turn you into a bone-man who breaks at the lightest touch.

** Remove the epilogue. There was so much potential for post war Harry Potter. I have always disliked the way the series ended up so neatly. The world should have been a bit of a mess. I've always felt robbed by the epilogue's 'and they lived happily ever after.'

More of Harry's parents. Flitwick passing on some of Lily's old charms essays to Harry and them making more sense to him than Hermione or the textbook. I'm not after pranks or any of that, frankly I find it annoying and a reason to close the story when I read it but I would like to see Harry picking up bits of magic from them. James' annotated transfiguration books or something. Just making Harry a bit better of a wizard in small ways and fleshing out the world a bit more.

Have the troll kill Hermione. Removes one of the most obnoxious characters and drives home to Harry that the magical world is dangerous. Opens up for more adventure and less Hermione read it in a book as a plot device.

** 1. H/Hr instead of H/G, imo H/G only really suits as a pairing if Ginny was "added in" with the Trio for a lot more than we see in canon. Alternatively it could also work if there was focus on how "broken" they were due to Riddle's influence via horcrux.
2. The whole walking to death thing should not have happened imo and is one of the stupidest things i've seen in canon. IMO they should've baited the brother wand effect then have every able person blasting Riddle with AK's especially Neville as we could make the case that he was also marked (emotionally) by Riddle and the DEs
3. The Complete lack of training for Harry. I mean the entire plan for Riddle's destruction hinged on him being the one to kill Harry. Suppose Riddle does the smart thing and after countless failed attempts and destroyed Horcruxes decides to say fuck hubris and tells the DEs to just kill everybody and bring back Harry's body

** 1. Harry and Hermione should have ended up together, possibly being a couple from the earlier book (3rd, 4th book maybe ?). Ron doesn't really serve a purpose in the story anyway so it's fine if he stays celibate.
2. The fights are made less boring somehow. Idk includes guns maybe ? I can't understand why the wizards never use any.
3. Change the setting to america.
