There's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2512457/chapters/5580866][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/path-to-victory-%E2%80%93-a-severus-snape-story-worm-hp.22564/][Path to Victory]], but are there any other quality, hopefully reasonably-lengthed Worm/Harry Potter crossovers?


** I've actually been keeping a lookout for HPxWorm for a long time and... there's a surprising lack of them. I want a clear cut MOD!Happy-arrives-in-Wormverse-and-handles-shit, but nope, still haven't found it.

The one I've read most recently is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][Yer a Witch, Taylor!]], where Taylor manifests the ability to use HP spells (HP is an actual book series in there and the scenes of everyone having to rely on Vista's book knowledge is cute). IIRC, I think there's a weird SSxRune pairing in there or something, which was extremely strange to me, but the fic does have its good moments.

** Oh, I forgot [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/salve-worm-hp.353642/][Salve]]! It's been so long since it updated though.

Bonesaw arrives in HP-verse, basically, due to a summoning by Death Eaters. It's really good.

** Thanks for linking to Acromantulas! I'd forgotten it existed, and it's a few months worth of updates ahead of where I'd stopped reading.

I have no idea if this is any good. Honestly I have know idea what "Worm" even is. But DLP usually has quality writing and I saw this so there you go.
