1. After rereading some of the books i can realize alot of people demoinze poor Ron. Hes not the best character but hes not as bad as fanfic makes him. Alot of the characters get shit from how you saw them when younger or remembering bad fan fic. Reread some now and alot your ideas change

2 the main reasons i dislike cannon pairings are some dont have enough substance <harry and ginny> or seem out of the blue from off page < tonks and remus> or wish fullfillment <ron hermione > but now i see some arnt as bad. Its more ghe way it was written and seeing some good ron/hr fics or such can be a good fit

1. Fanfiction is free and often imperfect but same time so much fun. Be kinder to all the writers. I had one i did alot of but due to learning disabilities i am shit for grammar. Even with grammarlys help lol. Got alot of flack made me stop for a long time but i realize alot still loved it


** 1. Get a beta or put in more effort. I don't know who the person who writes the fic is, but if you cannot be arsed to make the thing readable, with mostly proper grammar and spelling, I'm going to assume the rest of the work is also a low-effort, low-effect piece of crap.

There are things that you shouldn't (IMO) criticise authors for - pairings, artistic choices, plot development (as long as it makes modicum of sense), premise, romance, slash/not slash (I won't read stuff that's about gay romance, but I don't care if someone writes and enjoys it)... but if someone can't write properly, they deserve to be corrected, and if they don't improve in spite of that, criticised mercilessly

*** I don't want to read something with terrible spelling and grammar, either. But terrible spelling and grammar (unlike, say, a pairing I hate or bashing of a favorite character) is obvious at first glance. It takes seconds of my time to know the fic isn't for me--- it was provided free and I got what I paid for it.

I understand the purpose of a polite suggestion to proofread better. It helps someone improve, maybe.

I don't understand merciless criticism. Constructive criticism is always merciful or it ceases to be constructive.

Being merciless is just mean. Why be mean to a stranger who could be going through any number of struggles in real life? Because you wasted a few seconds? The nasty comment would take much longer to write than it took you to realize the spelling/grammar weren't up to snuff in the first place.

It fascinates me that “be merciless at my own expense “ is such a popular point of view in a fandom based on books about the power of love.

**** It was a figurative expression. I don't go around berating people for shitty writing.

But I've seen people argue that stuff like spelling and grammar aren't important, and, well, they should go fuck themselves, cause they deserve the critique. And I'm sure someone out there will mercilessly harass them, and feel better for it. And that would be justified.

That last quip - well, it's the magic and mystery parts that gets you in, the power of love is something you can bear through ;)
