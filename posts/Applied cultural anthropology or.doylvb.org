** No, I've seen fics coming back to life after 4 years hiatus, for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]], linkffn(8823447)

*** I mean true. But it's one of the only Dark hermione fics actually out there with decent writing (and what seemed to be ) a decent plot.

I haven't actualy finished lady of the lake. Tbh I wasn't able to get more than a few chapters in... Idk it just wasn't for me. Too Harry Centric?

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** I'd consider something like this the exception rather then the rule though. 9 times out of 10, it is abandoned.

** Jacobk still writes stories, so the chance they'll come back to it remains. But they need to stop having ideas first. And also to move to a resolution of the Tanya story.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Jacobk has a history of randomly updating stories even after years of inactivity. I would consider it very dormant, but we're fairly likely to see an update some time.

** The author is still active, so there is hope, but I agree, it doesn't seem all that likely. He seems to have moved on to other fandoms (Youjo Senki currently)

** I can't remember the name of it but an author once surprised the crap out of me by updating something from 2013.

So, take that with a grain of salt.
