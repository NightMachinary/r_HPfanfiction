/“Oh Harry, you are such a stud. Pull out your wand and cast a spell all over me.” said Draco./

“Hehe this is hot stuff,” Ginny said, as she dabbed her quill to her wet tongue.

“What happens next? What happens next?” asked Moaning Myrtle, as she circled about the second floor girl's lavatory in a state of extreme excitement.

“What happened last?” murmured Ginny, stupefied. The wet ink had dissolved into the parchment of her newfound diary. “The words have disappeared!” She turned her head to Myrtle, alarmed, before casting her eyes back to the book. Ginny flipped through the pages.

Myrtle did not seem to notice her panic. She was on her back in the air, with her hands behind her head. “You know, Gin. I can see what's happening here. This whole book is actually about you and me. I mean, Draco and Harry? Obvious placeholders.”

Ginny stared into the blank diary. /Pervert./ She was astounded! The word had materialized onto the page as if by... magic. But just as quickly as it had appeared, it disappeared.

/What happens next?/
