Presumably, either Ted was a Boggart depicting someone in the Black family's fear of a muggleborn seducing one of them, or Andromeda was a Boggart depicting Ted's fear of Bellatrix. Somehow, they fell in love.

** This is hilarious! I didn't connect shape shifting with boggarts, but I'm writing a fic where the Black family has a touch of Veela. Cissa got the looks - a blonde in a family of brunettes. Tonks and Siri got the transformative abilities - Veela humanoids transform into birds. Bella got the temper - flying fireball flinging females has got to be a beautiful sight, unless the fireballs are aimed at you. I pulled a little from the Veela mate trope for Andi and Reg but I'm calling a Veela's mate his/her Complete Compatible, (s)he can survive or whatever without the CC, but they won't be as happy.

If you write a fic for Tonks being a Half Boggart I want to read it. My vote is Ted's the Boggart, a Black is crazy enough to marry a Bogart to PO the family, I think. He claims to be a Muggleborn so no one looks too closely at his home life.

** I mean I read a fic and all magicals got their powers from creatures (basilisks, phoenixs, dementors, etc) who were able to create and sustain a human form for 20 years so they could have children and raise them. The descendants would be able to use the special abilities from that creature and they considered it 'family magics', Harry had a basilisks eyes for example with an extra clear eyelid so he could look at people without killing them. This would have worked really well in that fic!

** 'Momma, where did mommy come from?''I'll tell you when you're older, dear.''That's what you said last time! I /am/ older!' Teddy Lupin stomped his feet. His grandma, who he tended to call 'Momma' to differentiate her from his dead 'Mommy', didn't seem to budge. Angry, he transformed into his late dad. 'I have a right!' he insisted.

​

She sighted and sat down. 'Fine.'Teddy followed suit, changing back.'Your mother came from Granddad and me.' Teddy began to tell her he already knew, but she held up a hand and he shut up. 'And your granddad came from your aunt.'

​

'EEEW!'

'Not like that!' Momma added hastily. 'See, your aunt Bella -'

​

'The insane one?'

​

'/Yes,/ the insane one,' his grandma said impatiently. 'In hindsight, we should've known... she was quite imaginative as a child, you know. Always running downstairs screaming about the M- /Muggleborn/ under her bed, just /waiting/ to steal her magic and turn her into a Squib... even after being accepted at Hogwarts that was her biggest fear. And as she grew more and more fearful, she grew ever more cruel... Of course, neither of us guessed there really /was/ something under her bed, and that our parents kept it there. All I knew was that they seemed proud of her fear and mildly encouraged it. But I had no idea how /wrong/ that is, until I met Ted -your grandpa-, near the garden.'

​

She paused, lost in memory.

​

'One day I stepped out of the backyard, to see a handsome blond boy lingering near the fence. I made to tell him to go away, but he greeted me very kindly and familiar, as if he knew all about me. Said he knew Bella, so I decided not to send him away. Such a smooth voice... we met up after that, and he learned me how fucked up my upbringing really was, so I left.' Teddy giggled at the cursewords and she startled out of it, hastily continuing, clearly hoping he'd forget; 'and so I left, and married him, much, much later, and all that showed that he wasn't your ordinary muggle was the fact that my daughther was a metamorphmagus who married someone with a strange affinitity for Boggarts.'

*** 1) that was awesome, and made a crack prompt even better by making it realistically possible

2) ngl that little bit about lupin at the end kills me, never even thought about his "affinity" for boggarts with the theory that tonks was half boggarts. Now I'm just imagining a running joke about tonks' family and boggarts similar to the "all potters fall for a redhead" fanon (one which I personally love)

3) what if in the same vein, the original werewolf was actually just a myth, no reality to it. Or at least, until someone who's greatest fear was being turned into a werewolf encountered a boggart, and it made his fear into a reality. Then all werewolves have an affinity towards boggarts bc of their origin. (this is more crackish bc technically in canon a boggarts can't actually do everything a real creature can, ie dementors kiss, iirc)

  One of the dementors shucked off her cloak, revealing a body that would make a Vela feel inadequate. Silky black hair, softly glowing, blue eyes and flawless, pale skin with lush curves, suddenly filled his view. He stared at the naked dementor and then looked over at the one still wearing her robe, a skeletal and rotted visage just barely visible under the hood. Both dementors giggled, before the other removed her cloak, revealing another female form that could cause young boys to hit puberty half a decade in advance with just a wink.

  "How, why, huh?" he stuttered unable to form a coherent thought.

  "We're the Velas' dark sisters, where they would inspire lust, we inspire fear.

** I've been saying for years that the Blacks are just the right kind of insane to intentionally splice their DNA with a boggart. The first metamorphs were flighty and animalistic, but a few generations mellowed out the magic and allowed new members of the family to shapeshift while supposedly not having the evil tendencies.

It seems like it could be one of the driving forces for why the family is so fucked up, together with a bunch of incest and constant exposure to dark magic as children.

I feel like quite a few plot holes would arise, so I feel like there would have to be some other shapeshifting creature pulled from mythology, but I like the idea that there's a small trace of shapeshifting blood in the black family line that somehow resurfaced with Tonks. I could even explain why Narcissa Malfoy was born a blond that feels “right” for her in a family full of people with very dark hair.
