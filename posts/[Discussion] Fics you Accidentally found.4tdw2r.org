When I first started reading fanfic a few years ago, I was perfectly capable of finding good material on my own. And then I found this subreddit. I haven't found a piece of gold on my own in months, until the other day when I uncovered The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel. So I was wondering, how often do you all find fics you like without the assistance of HPfanfiction or some magical recommendation generator/database thingy?


** All the time. I find it quite important to go into ffnet and use the filters. There's so much gold to be found it's not even funny.

The most common thing I do is filter by:

1. Sort: favourites
2. Time Range: 24 hours
3. Rated: All
4. Language: English

And boom, start looking through. There are a few ultra-favourited fics that seem to be updated daily, but once you're past them it can start getting really interesting with short stories, good premises or simply excellent fics in their early days as well. I'm a little addicted to fanfiction at the moment, so I'm discovering stuff all the time.

One of my favourites in recent times was linkffn(11967877) , which is clearly just a fic on the up and up.

It can be tough finding finished fics, that's true though I find looking through a great author's list of completed fics - such as White Squirrel's for example - often works.

*** I do this with all the HP crossovers, but... there's not many new ones to be found most days. Guess I'll start looking in the regular fics again.

** There is one fic I quite literally found accidentally about three years ago--as in, just loaded up FF.net, went to Harry Potter and there it was. linkffn(In Atlantean Caves)

Now the quality of this fic can be debated. It was amazing to me three years ago, and I do still love the concept, but the execution is a little shoddy.

It happens fairly often that I will come across a random fic with some slight filtering and read it, but it's a rare thing for me to remember a random, unknown fic after all this time.

** It's been years since I've found an actual readable fic in the wild. Like, every few weeks I'll dig through H/FD or H/DG on FFN, but it's just full of the same nonsensical shit that it's always been.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

** I'm almost exclusive on ff.net. I finish a story I like and go to the author's page to browse their favorites. I have found treasures that way. That's how I found (Fantistic? Fabulous?) Elves and Where to Find Them.. and Doghead13's stuff. 'The Book of Dobby' is a lot of fun. His elf counting system always makes me laugh.
