Sorry, noob question, but can a wizard essentially be chosen by two wands? Like, in case their first wand broke. I don't know if this is supported within the cannon or not. Can someone confirm?


** Ron used Charlie's old wand originally and a new one made specifically for Peter at the end. So it's likely that Charlie found a new wand that choose him after wearing out his first. Peter having a wand made for him might mean that anyone can get a customized wand, for the right price/motivation, unless it didn't work very well for him like stealing someone else's.

But if you think about there being hundreds of wand makers around the world, there can't only be one wand you're destined for, and it just happens to be made near where you live.

Since not everyone goes to Ollivander's, or even goes through his entire stock of wands to see if another might choose them. It's reasonable to assume each wand store would likely have one wand that might choose an individual, and possibly more than one.

*** Can't that also mean that a wizard can have two wands?

**** That was what I was hinting at, yes.

But only if there aren't any unstated laws about two wands or some flimsy unknown magical conflict to using two at once.

Though, since no one ever carries two wands in the book's wizarding universe, it must be very strong social pressure not to, or some other unmentioned reason. Because it would be common sense to carry around a back up wand if you were ever worried about your safety, or simply as a precaution.

I use this idea in my story actually, and it is common sense to get a backup or specialized wand for some people, but everyone keeps quiet about it because it's become a taboo subject to carry more than one.

***** This is especially true because wands are cheap. Not quite pocket change, but not a huge purchase either. 7 galleons each, with 1 galleon equalling 5 pounds sterling -- that should be under a day's wages for Arthur Weasley. Aurors are supposedly well paid, so I'd expect Alastor Moody to have three wands on his person, three more at home, and a half dozen emergency caches each containing at least one spare.

****** That is also a concern people have, and some have thought that your first wand purchase is subsidized by the ministry to be seven galleons, being the traditional price for new students, while another would be more expensive.

Which might help to discourage having more than one.

** In DH, Harry had a few wands after his broke. Draco's was far better suited for him than the Snatcher's. And the Elder Wand owed him allegience as well. His Holly wand, after repair, also suited him. It would seem that having multiple wands' allegience is canon.

** As much as they harp on "the wand chooses the wizard," it's never stated that you can only ever "bond" (my word) with one wizard.

** A wizard can be chosen by another wand, but it isn't mentioned if a wizard can be chosen by two wands at the same time.

** As far as I know, there is nothing that says a person can't be chosen by two wands simultaneously. We also don't know if the "first" wand that is matched is actually the /best/ match. Maybe the next wand would match even better? Wand choosing in HP is a bit broken, IMO.

**** Still. Not assured to be the /best/ match. A very broken process, from a functional standpoint.

** So I'm fairly late to the conversation, but Ollivander does make a wand for Luna in DH (chapter 26) after hers was destroyed at Malfoy Manor, and she was able to do some fairly strong magic with it.
