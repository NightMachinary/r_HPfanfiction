I'd like to say that I don't trust FF.net's filtering system, but in reality, I'm just lazy. That, and there are so bloody many fics published in such a short amount of time.


** Honestly finding new stuff that's good is a pain. Anything in the last few months that will have a lot of favorites or follows is filled with bad tropes and cliches. You have to dig before you come across anything worth reading.

I'd suggest looking at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8gisek/best_fics_of_2018_so_far/][this post]] asking for the best 2018 stuff.
