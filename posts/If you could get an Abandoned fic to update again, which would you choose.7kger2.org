It is pretty common to feel frustrated when you are reading a very good fic and it ends abruptly. Doubly so when it is years since its last upload and you still think about how it could have gone ( I'm thinking about you linkao3(3390668) ).

What is the one story that sometimes still floats in your thoughts?

**** Oddly enough I never started reading fanfiction until I read Cursed Child. My literal thoughts after finishing the story was 'God that was terrible, I bet fanfiction is better than this.' It just kept getting worse and worse, I read it in one sitting and wanted to give up after the encounter with the trolly witch, and only finished it purely because I wanted to see how bad it could get.

Honestly I regret reading it.

Still, I recommend everyone to read this fic if they like the Marauder Era (or maybe you just don't know that you like reading fics about it yet. The Marauder Era is seriously the best, and tlat is an amaaaazing fic)

I won't spoil it but as far as I can tell the thing you want to happen all story has now basically happened. All that can really happen now is that it keeps happening or stops happening.. Either way it's going to be less about magic and more about mundane stuff. Personally I think when that happens a story stops being a proper Harry Potter story. But it's a good read nonetheless.

** I'm very surprised nobody mentioned Ectomancer, so I'm gonna do it myself.

Also, probably not up there with the bests, but I'd really like to see Contemplating Clouds update again and be completed.

Finally, some people mentioned Nightmares of Future Pasts, and I'd love to see it updated but according to the author's blog, it's still in progress, even his progression bar increased maybe 2 or 3 months ago, so I won't consider it abandoned. However, I'd be absolutely delighted if his other Potter fic, Blackwand Chronicles updated.

And probably a ton of other ones I forget.

If you've never read it, it's incredibly well written, but easily the most horrible, disturbing, saddening and heart wrenching fic ever created. The reason why it needs a revival is because just as things were looking up in the story, and things seemed to be getting better for Harry the author abandoned it.

** Waaaaayyy back before book 6, there was a story called [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewuser.php?uid=1425][Ginny's Journey]] by Oddish. In which Ginny Weasley is not allowed to return to school after the events of book two. So she has to go to school In America.

I was fairly compelled by the world building in this one. In it there are 6 wizarding schools spread out through North America. And a North American quidditch league between them. There was also a lot of wand lore, and something about California being a magical dead zone, so magic folk born there never realize that they are magic. They're just a bit odd. Which explains a lot about culture in some parts of California.

The author had completed the story and posted it all on one (now defunct) archive, they were in the process of posting it on other archives when they just stopped. So I remember the ending, but I can't go back and re-read it for fun.

Still, what's there is a good read. Especially to compare with what canonically is out now about wizarding North America.

** Yeah, that's not unlikely. I've been keeping up with her tumblr for a while, and a long time ago she would answer some of her anon asks, and they could be so mean and vile. Calling her selfish +++ :/ I hate to think it's the fans who made her stop, but it's probably true

** Two spring to mind right away. Not as much as an unfinished fic, but an unfinished arc. JBern's 'lie I've lived' and Ruskbytes 'order of the Phoenix/ well of shadows'.

Hopefully, lie will get a sequel one day, but I'm assuming that JBern is focussing on his writing that actually earns him the money!
