  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** linkffn(fanfiction.net/s/10561760/1/What-Happens-in-Vegas)

This is a Fem Harry/Raven pairing where both characters remain fairly within bow cannon says they should act. Very subtle slow romance that never frustrated me by advancing to quickly or to slowly (the scene outside the door is absolutely adorable). Also gonna say that despite first impressions, it's not a soul bond fic. I definitely recommend this one.

** linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai), though it has some suboptimal decisions, IMO. (In particular, bad guys are made worse-than-canon, as if to make the protagonist's revenge more justified.)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) (if he ever gets as far as actually 'shipping them).

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** I just read linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing), which coincidentally answers pretty well to this description. In fourth year Hermione, who is very sure she and Harry aren't meant to be together but feels very close to him platonically, tries to protect him with "Merlin's Blessing," a bit of very ancient magic she doesn't understand at all, and as a result nearly blows up spacetime.

What I like about it relative to a lot of H/Hr---especially the stuff written in the last three or four years---is that the author doesn't seem to be a hardcore H/Hr fan, and in fact has a lot of reservations about the ship: No romantic connection, tendency to get on each others' nerves, lots of anxieties on both side. So in writing their H/Hr story they set about---very gradually and in-character---addressing and working through all those problems. (No Ron-bashing, either.)

  Explores the close, loving friendship between Hermione and Harry mainly from Hermione's viewpoint. Is it enough to form a devoted life-partnership even if they're not romantically in love? Might their love be just as true? And if so, what could bring them together? The story is fluffy, sometimes sensual, but never smutty or crude, and, of course, has the touch of magic.
