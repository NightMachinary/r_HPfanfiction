Just interested if people have any favourite scenes from any stories? Something that really stands out in your memory. Could be anything from an epic duel, to an extremely well written dialogue, or just a short one-shot.


** There is a scene in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards With Purpose]] where Harry and the Weasleys go to Azkaban. I won't say more, for fear of spoilers, but it is one of my all time favorites.

*** I love the scene after that where they're all drunk and laughing about Voldemort being a virgin. And then the Weasleys come

*** BWP has some really amazing moments. Some people dislike it because it is rehash-y -- but damn, so many of its moments are awesome and emotionally touching. The fifty patronuses at the end comes to mind.

Also, Molly and Arthur finding 13 year old Harry with his hands in 12 year old Ginny's pants was really amusing. The scene that followed was quite heartbreaking though.

** I'm pretty sure it was in One Hundred Sixty Nine- Sirius and Remus drunk off their assess talking about the future and death by drapery.

Not necessarily #1 favorite, but definitely up there.

** The only problem with this topic is that it is incredibly spoiler heavy.

For me, its the end of The Firebird Trilogy, specifically the fate of one of the main characters. It's like a dagger to the chest =, (

Similarly, the St. Mungo scenes from both Restoring Hope and The Dementors Stigma.

Humor wise, chapter 17 or 18 of A Black Comedy.has incredibly amusing name pun scene.

**** I gave up on that fic when Luna was /cured/.\\
DM can definitely write, but he sketches horrible worlds and his fics all seem to descend into torture porn (at least, up to Firebird. I don't read him any longer).

***** Its the only fic I've read by the author. There are parts of it I absolutely loved, but parts of it, like the Luna part, and the end left a really bad taste in my mouth. It was uselessly cruel at time, did nothing to enhance the story, as you said torture porn.

** One minor scene that sticks with me is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/35/The-Life-and-Times][ch35 of The Life and Times]], when Adam finds out about his sister. It's so sad but so beautifully written, especially the lines about Fairy Lights.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10339852/6/The-Many-Harry-Potters-of-Little-Hangleton][This one-shot]] the rest of the collection are humorus but it really is this one i find to be the best because it makes sorta fun of the entire WBWL concept. (I like that concept) and the way the one-shot is setup with only dialog really gives the one-shot charistma.

** While I'm definitely not convinced of the rest of the fanfic's quality (or even if it's actually Harry Potter. The more I read, the more it seems like original fiction wallpapered over, there's so little it actually has in common with Harry Potter beyond character names), Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality's Battle Magic army fights. They're very imaginative and very funny, something that, regardless of any shortcomings, can be applied to the rest of the story.

*** Yeah there are many fine points in the story, but if there is something that will stick with me forever, I will have to say it's the scene when Harry casts the Patronus for the first time. Just beautiful and awe-inspiring, evokes goosebumps every time I read that part.

Read Ender's Game, if you haven't. I think MoR's author “convenienced” that from there.

** The scene in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against The Moon]] when Sirius affirms his friendship for Remus even after finding out he is a werewolf. The emotional buildup to this moment is incredible, probably my favorite chapter in my favorite fic.

** I particularly love the beginning of "Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen", when Harry makes a Sirius/serious joke in front of another dimension's Sirius, and that Sirius says something like "Oh, crap. He even knows my puns".
