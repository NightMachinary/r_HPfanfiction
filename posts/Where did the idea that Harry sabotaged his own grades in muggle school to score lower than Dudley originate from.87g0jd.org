So I've noticed that in a lot of hp fanfiction, at some point it will be mentioned that Harry scored lower in his muggle schooling because if he scored higher than Dudley he would get in trouble. This is usually used to justify writing Harry as "smarter," but he had just been in the forced habit of lazyness for so long that it takes something else (some event, resolving to 'focus on schooling for real this year', or the author wanting to pair him with Hermione) for him to show his true intelligence beyond his canon self.

But I was reading book 1 again, and in chapter 4 there's this section when Hagrid is getting mad at the Dursleys:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy - this boy! - knows nothin' abou' - about ANYTHING?"

  Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.
#+end_quote

Although "weren't bad" is a little ambiguous, this section at least says that Harry thinks his grades accurately represent what he knows. So I was wondering if the 'Harry gets in trouble if his grades are higher than Dudley so he sabotages himself' idea is just a popular explanation fic writers can use to justify Harry being 'smarter' in their story, or if there was any other canon material I'm forgetting that implies Harry sabotaging his grades happened. Like in the movies, or the later books? I'm rereading book 1 right now, so if there's any small details in the other books about this I don't remember it. I'm just really curious where this trope originated from, and why it became so popular vs other explanations that could have ben used to make Harry smarter.


** It's just an easy way to make Harry into whatever the writer wants him to be without having to make the story AU. (My definition of AU is that a story that diverges from canon before the story starts it is AU. If it diverges after then it is just fanfiction.)

** This idea is Fanon, just like Harry getting nearly killed every other week at the Dursleys and "You are from a long line of purebloods so you have 28373828362928373928 galleons"

Someone used the idea for a fic to explain things, and everyone liked it so much that they used it too.

Well to be fair, from what we have seen of that "family", it is dangerous to Harry's wellbeing. In book 1 alone, child services would be tearing their hair out. But this has been discussed way too many times.

But, yes, statistically fanon abuse is worse than what /other/ people perceive to be canonical abuse.

That's why I detest canon Harry. He just leaps into action without a single thought, a stereotypical Gryffindor. That cost him a Godfather. He even refuses to listen to Hermione whenever she shows intelligence or reason.

He's completely spineless. He's just thrown around by circumstances without ever trying to get control over his own life. He's got no bite, and doesn't even have a bark until he goes all caps after several years of bullshit.

** It's because people want Harry to be smart. In the books he was an average student, getting the equivalent of (basing this off his OWLs) mostly B grades, with some C grades, and a couple of failing grades, maybe sometimes getting an A. Doesn't really read like the next Dumbledore, does it? But JKR wanted an everyman for her protagonist, not someone who was the best in everything.

It might have been in /Nightmares of Futures Past/ or in /Oh God Not Again!/ or maybe in one of robst's stories (back when I was young and foolish). It was one of those things that people mistake for canon because in its milder forms it's so believable.

** It's a very reasonable extrapolation from from Harry's upbringing at the Dursleys. Any academic curiosity or ambition would surely have been squashed, particularly when it exposes the inferiority of their own bratty spawn.

Also both of Harry's parents were pretty smart... not really a stretch to believe that he could have been an outstanding student in a more nurturing environment.

** Because scapegoats are usually punished for overshadowing the favorite child in pretty much anything, whether with physical punishment or with belittling excuses that explain ‘why' the scapegoat isn't /really/ doing better.

It's pretty easy to extrapolate that Harry was never academically encouraged by the Dursleys. However, the Dursleys don't talk about achievements based on measurable standards, just about morality/social skills-based ‘achievements'. So it's doubtful that the Dursleys ever cared much about Harry's academics, aside from calling him a nasty cheater when he scored particularly well over Dudley. They just don't care enough about academic goals as opposed to social goals.

A set of Dursley parents that talked more about grades/tutoring would be the type to cause Harry to deliberately sabotage his grades.

** I have no idea either.

Although the quote from above seems to imply as to when Hagrid questioned him about his parents and magic in general and that was the response. Bloody hell it's been years since I read the actual books. Everything is a little hazy. Certain plot points stick out as being memorable and I would assume that's why it seems like everyone follows canon so closely in thier stories. It's the only thing they vividely remember, while the little details falls to the wayside unless they re-read and can thus reinterpret.

** Remember, the first book was written by a relatively unknown author intended for children, so not that much thought process was gone into this relatively minor detail. But just have a look at human nature, even in a normal house ( not Drusley normal) with one child of their own, one from another relative, if the other one do well in school and their own didn't do that well, there will be a inherent jealously from parents, even though many will not express it. I have seen one lady openly rooting for her nephew to fail in the exams. So, it's not a big stretch to imagine Drusleys being not happy with him ( not necessarily beating ) or if they express their displeasure to Dudley he in turn expressing his displeasure on Harry in school, so its a possibility he dumb down in his studies, it goes something like this " Who cares if I get a good marks, just passing marks is enough". Although whether he is secretly intelligent is up for debate.\\
OP States " author wanting to pair him with Hermione ", but in most cases it is actually wants go get away from her shadows.

** TBH, Harry is a mediocre protagonist to work with. Very little drive, very little talent beyond defense. It's pretty much a requirement to change facets about him to make an interesting lead for a story. That's not to say, everyone does it and you can't make a good story with an almost-canon Harry, but it takes a good deal more time and effort than most people would like. It's easier to make a Harry with some defining feature (like intelligence) that people can root for.

** Dursley abuse, "precious Diddy-Dumbkins" (Petunia seems to believe her son will amount to anything, despite the fact that he seems pretty dumb, so it's not a stretch that she would think Harry was cheating if he had better grades than her precious Duddley!)

Sure some of it is justification for making the slacker (note: I hate canon Harry with a passion and think he should have stayed dead, it's not as if he will amount to much! Hell, he only gets into the Aurors because of bias in his favour and hero-worship! He doesn't even have any NEWTs, so if the aurors don't work out he's basically fucked! I also blame him for a lot of deaths (no, not Sirius but Moody etc. - Why would Harry need to be escorted anywhere? Hell, why even return to Privet Drive? Dumbledore is dead and a location under the fidelius is safer, especially if the secret keeper lives under another fidelius and can't be caught in a raid/fight!) because if he had applied himself more and stood up for himself (Harry basically fights for everybody, but he tolerates abuse that would have most of us up in arms (Snape for example! They'd have to drag me to his class in shackles if he treated me like he did Harry!) and clearly has a low sense of self-worth...hell Dumbledore admits that this is what he wanted, a sacrificial lamb!) into a better version of himself!

Then again: Would Hermione with her insecurities (she derives a lot of her confidence from being the brains of the trio, after all she'd be a total outcast if not for Ron and Harry!) tolerate a smarter Harry? I don't know...for that matter: Would Ron? I mean that guy is even more insecure and he hates being in the shadow of his more talented brothers (despite the fact that they applied themselves and he does not, not really...he takes the easy electives, he coasts through class, copies homework from others etc. etc.)

I am not saying that Harry really dumbed himself down in canon, but it's possible and fanfiction lives from possibilities :) (they spark the interest of writers!)

Hell, for all we know wanting to be "just Harry" really does dumb him down (without him actually knowing it or doing it consciously!) because becoming a teacher's pet would mean more attention!
