:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It is obvious that the relationship Ron and Lavender have in HBP is completely dysfunctional and unhealthy in the long-run. However, what would happen if after being poisoned Ron's reaction was “What the hell I am doing with Lavender? Life is too precious to waste it on licking each others tonsils, I would more thorough and deeper relationship like my parents have (and lick tonsils as well :)). And, actually, I like Lavender this way. What should we do to make it work properly?” So, the final pairing actually is Ron/Lavender, but with the relationship which is more mature and believable.

Does anybody know about such story? There is a bit of this in linkao3(568303) (which is awesome, BTW!), but did anybody develop this more thoroughly?


** I unfortunately do not. However, [[https://windschildfanfictionwriter.tumblr.com/post/182811252478/nice-things][I do know a oneshot where Ron still appreciates her and they break up on very good terms]].

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

*** Also, I forgot to mention linkao3(4876630). Yes, it is a fem!Harry, and yes it has many problems (it is too smutty and it has some horrible tropes of that kind ... magic increases libido), but it has nice Ron with OC, which is a quasi-Lavender (why the author didn't pair him with Lavender directly is my question), but this quasi-Lavender ends up with Ron (actually, he knocks her up and makes a decent thing, so they are really hitched together), and it is very sweetly written.

** An issue is that she was brought in canon as a way to bring tension to the Ron & Hermione dynamic.

But I think the idea has potential to grow Ron, Lavender's, and even Hermione's character if done correctly.

***** Somehow describe it? “Roller and perm against the powers of Darkness”? “Only Pink can conquer Black!” You have to know what it is truly about. Is it somehow “Legally Blond at Hogwarts” (actually, that could be very funny)?

I really liked Lavender Brown in stories by Northumbrian: combination of pink, sexy, with werewolf and smarts is awesome.

****** Hmmm... that's probably true. I'll have to give it another shot. Summaries have never been my strong suit. And it's a little bit Legally Blonde, with a dash of murder mystery/government conspiracy thrown in. Though Legally Blonde wouldn't exactly fit.

And I'll check out Northumbrian! That sounds like a really great Lavender Brown!

******* Start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian), particularly chapter 12 relates to Lavender in the Battle of Hogwarts. I really like linkao3(Grave Days by Northumbrian), which is the what-happens-immediately-after-The-Battle, but Lavender is mostly in the background (a bit of her is in chapters 9-12). Then seriously Lavender related (and probably one of the best stories by him ever) is linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), and then there is whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][series of M.I.T. stories]]. Then there is a series of her personal stories in linkao3(Bare by Northumbrian) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123]] .
