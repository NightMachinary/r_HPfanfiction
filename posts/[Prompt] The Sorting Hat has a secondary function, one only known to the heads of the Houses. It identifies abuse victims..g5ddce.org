It's a telepathic hat, and its sole purpose is to root through kids head. Of /course/ it can find abused kids.

I see the heads of House meeting up after the Sorting with the Hat to hear who they need to keep an eye on. The Hat then tells them what it learned. Or maybe just a list of names if it can't tell what it saw?

Anyway, meeting happens, and the Hat puts Harry's name out as one of the latest kids to watch out for. This, I feel, would have a lot of interesting ripple effects, but there's one I think would /really/ be obvious: Snape.

Warned that Harry wasn't some pampered prince, that he was actually in a situation much like him, he actually starts /looking/ at Harry. And sees the effects of the Dursley's work.

Not Severitus, because I don't see him going /that/ far, but I could see Mentor!Snape, or at maybe Confidant!Snape. Not adopting him or anything, just watching out for another kid that needs it.

I'm curious about why you say and believe this; that Snape would change his behavior towards Harry if he knew Harry was abused.

It's canon that Snape found out and knew /for certain/ that Harry was abused at least by the Occlumency "lessons" in fifth year. There were several of Harry's memories that he viewed about the Dursleys' abusive treatment.

It changed /nothing/. He was still just as unfair, cruel, unprofessional, petty, abusive and hateful towards Harry after that. I wouldn't expect him to be kind to Harry but at least he needn't be cruel.

You know, I totally forgot that Snape /had/ chances not to be a piece of shit. And happily waved at those chances as they passed him by.

*** You do recall why those lessons were necessary, right? Riddle could get into Harry's head. Now what would happen if Severus changes his behaviour towards Harry, and Riddle sees it? Too big a risk.

**** Oh really? I thought that was just bad writing on Rowling's part!! I must have been mistaken that information of the prophecy and Voldemort's horcruxes was more important than Snape! /s

If Voldemort could get inside Harry's head after failing to possess him, do you think it was wise to tell him about both the prophecy and the horcruxes? If Voldemort found out that someone was hunting his horcruxes, their war effort is /fucked/ beyond repair.

Snape is an asshole; this has nothing to do with his "spying" whatsoever. Nobody is expecting Snape to be all rainbows and sunshine, but a teacher is expected to be professional, not cruel.

He can simply tell Voldemort that Dumbledore is leaning heavily on him to behave himself with Potter after Sirius Black's death. A spy is expected to keep his nose clean.

Edit: An additional point and clarification.

***** No, I don't think it was wise to involve Harry in the Horcrux mess. Be aware of it, yea, but not a part of it. As to the prophecy, that's on Dumbledore. Harry should have been told much earlier.

Severus was never professional towards Harry before OotP, doing so after would be a, noticeable, change in behaviour. Again, too big a Risk. Now that I'm thinking on it, Where in HBP was Severus an asshole towards Harry? The detentions after the Sectumsempra incident don't count. Those were beyond justified.

And I gave a very plausible excuse for why he should be. You should read my previous reply again.

Do you remember when Tonks escorted Harry to the castle after Malfoy had attacked him? Go and read that part again and you'll realize how nasty he was to both of them. Then there's his first lesson with Snape that year where he tried to curse him in the guise of "teaching".

Just as much as the ones Malfoy received for trying to cast the Cruciatus on Harry? After attacking him first? Wait, that didn't happen, did it?

*** There are ways around that. Some headmaster(say phineas, for example) confunded the hat into forgetting that particular function. And it's only when Harry gets there that the charm is lifted.

*** Canonically, Riddle doesn't seem to have been abused. His orphanage actually seems to have been on the better side of what could be expected for a 1930s orphanage. Its just that institutions are really not the place to raise children if you want them to be well adjusted, its pretty much inherently emotional neglect. It would hardly be a stretch for him to have been abused, of course, but all we see in the books is him abusing the other children.

** Did Snape really suffer abuse? Honestly, I don't remember. I remember that his home life wasn't good. I think his parents didn't have a good marriage and maybe his father even hated his mother. But that doesn't necessarily mean his father was abusive.

I... thought so? I distinctly remember a really shitty childhood, and for some reason my brain just slots him into the "abused" category. I might be wrong though...
