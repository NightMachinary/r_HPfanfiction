If I recall correctly, Arthur was supposed to die in the Nagini attack that Harry witnessed in his dream, but Rowling later changed that so Sirius was the one to die in the battle of the Department of Mysteries.

I'm interested to see if there's fics out there that explore how the story would go on if she didn't change her original plan.


** This happens in /On The Way to Greatness/. Of course, it's a Slytherin!Harry fic so mileage may vary on your experience. It is a very good story though. linkffn(4745329)
