The first fanfic I read a long time ago. It was Hermione/Draco pairing. I only remember the begining and the end. It starts with Hermione making dinner at Grimmlaud place for the Order, Draco was there in the shadows, he was a spy and he was at the meeting and proposed to Hermione. Voldemort was winning the war. At the end Draco and Hermione had three children (girls) and I think Hermione was headmistress of Hogwarts and Draco was to become Minister of Magic. That's all I remember, the fic has been on my mind a lot lately and I can't find it anywhere. The second is about Draco being a Veela and Hermione is his mate. Draco stumbles upon Hermione in the summer break, they start to spend time together, Hermione goes to the Manors' library for some books, the go to a carnaval/fair together with Hermiones' muggle friends, at some point Dracos' eyes turn black. At the end there is some drama with Narcissa lying that Draco is going to die and Hermione goes to the Manor and they get together. I hope you guys can help me find them. Thanks.
