** Damn, it's finished?? I was a bit let down at how the situation in the woods resolved itself, but overall it's been a great, high-quality fic. I gotta go see how it ended!

P.S. As I understand, 'James and Me' is a sequel to Strangers, although I'm not too sure.

*** Sort of. All of the authors stories are in the same "universe" so technically they are all sequels but 'James and Me' focuses on James Potter and Annabel getting together like 15 years later. Its probably the closest to a direct sequel.

** It actually was up on [[https://siye.co.uk][siye.co.uk]] a couple of days ago. Figured I'd let someone else break the news though.

Now I guess I should really get around to reading it.

*** O.o Thanks for the info! I don't really follow fanfic on the less populated platforms, so I had absolutely no idea the fic was even up on another site.

**** Eh, a couple of authors I am reasonably interested in post there only or at least early, so I usually give it a check once a week or so. Nice to see deadwoodpecker getting started up again, too.

Now maybe northumbrian will be able to finish some of their other incomplete works too.

*** Well a couple are admittedly somewhat lacking in the later quality seen, particularly Grave Days.

** I'll admit, I stopped reading the fic about halfway through when I began to feel that it was outliving its premise, but now that its actually complete I just might have to go back and read the rest of it

** This is a very well written fic. I was a bit disappointed when I realized that none of her kids were going to end up being muggleborns. Nothing against the story, I just wasn't into it that much after that.

*** Yeah, I'd genuinely hoped for that - the story was starting to feel a little untenable with regards to Harry and Ginny maintaining the statute of secrecy. Making one of her kids a muggleborn would have allowed the Charltons to be brought into the secret and allow for more interesting ways to bind the families together.

**** I thought her daughter was going to be a muggleborn since she always had her daughter with her when she went through the wards in Ginny's home. It seemed like the logical solution to the mystery of how the main character kept bypassing them. Then we could see the wizarding world through the eyes of a muggleborn's mother (I don't think I've ever read that perspective before).

**** I mean, there is a distant sequel with James and Annie, but its not finished either

I also like the idea that not every character needs to know about wizards. Most relevant muggles in fics learn about magic at some point, and I can think of very few exceptions (Recnac Transfero?)

***** I don't think /every/ character in Strangers needed to know - Jacqui and Mike keeping their kid's secret plus Harry and Ginny keeping theirs from the gossipy townspeople could have been an amusing side-story.

***** It explains that Annie might not be a Muggle. The plot is a little chliched and the romance stuff is only passable, but the characters are a lot of fun. Especially once you get to the Seven and their shenanigans.
