** Already been done: There's the D.S.S. Requirement by esama, and Xerosis by Batsutousai, just off the top of my head. I vaguely remember a Stargate crossover too, but not the name of it.

*** D.s.s is unfinished and is only worldbuilding with a smidgeon of plot. Xerosis is fine though ;) But they are all old, i want something new and exciting too :)

**** I am currently writing a Marauder's-era space fic, actually, but it's going absolutely nowhere because I have no friends who care enough about HP to beta for me, and no time. I feel you on wanting something new...

** Mischief heir fits the bill [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

Harry made an Explorer club.. It started as a private Neville and Harry revenge club(aka chosen bros before jealous hoes), that turned to a legitimate space program as time went on. Like using sonar to find secret passages in hogwarts, playing zero gravity in room of requirements. Etc.
