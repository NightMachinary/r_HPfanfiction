#+TITLE: Has anyone here bought the Creature/Artifact/Character Vault books from a few years ago? Are they worth having as movie companion type books that give info on the movies or are they mostly just art books and information already in the wikia?

** I'm unsure which ones you're talking about. Do you mean the Hogwarts library books for Comic Relief?

** I have the creature vault book and it is gorgeous to look at. There are many tidbits of information on the creatures, the shape shifters, etc.

How they conceptualised them, pictures of these concepts, when they where in the movies etc. Tons of pictures and text on the single creatures that where used in the films and also the books. I think most of the info can be found on the wiki, but it is nice to have anyways. :)
