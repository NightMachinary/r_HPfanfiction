****** That's a bit of a loaded question, really. It's not like I thought the prompts were bad or anything, they just weren't things that really drew my interest. I almost wrote a Dumbledore one, but felt it would have been a little spoilery of my current fic and didn't really want to do that.

For this month I think two of them came directly from request threads, and I didn't think those threads were that interesting, so seeing them as prompts was a bit off putting to me.

That being said, I do think taking such ideas and turning them into prompts is really a good idea. I just think that those specific ideas weren't my cup of tea, as it were.

Personal preference wise, I prefer more slice of life things. I'm also not really a humorist when it's anything more than snark, and this month seemed like the prompts were trying to cater to humor. So that put it a bit out of my wheel house, as it were.

** *Directed:*

No-one ever questioned the role of the Hat in the Sorting process; it was one of profound historical and magical significance. Generation upon generation, back to the time of the Founders, had placed the Hat upon their head and followed its advice. No-one too ever questioned its age or, more accurately, its strangely unchanged, unravellable countenance. The Hat was, is and will be, Sorting.

Of course the Hat knew these things. It wasn't just imbued with the magic of the greatest of the Founders - the bravest and most daring - oh, no. In its hundreds of years placed in the Headmaster's office it had continued to learn and grow, to gain and test its understanding. The first Headmaster after Godric passed, the son of Gryffindor, was easily persuaded to change the Sorting from an apprenticeship for the final years to a ceremony on the very first day - the Houses would be family.

The Hat sat on the head of every British witch or wizard thereafter, and each time it grew, and /pushed/. After all, ot had been made by Godric Gryffindor himself, it was only right the Hat ensured that legacy. The most daring and brave went to that House, and the most kind and loyal went to the House of his sister, Helga. The cleverest, but not the most sly, went to Ravenclaw; the slyest, but not always the cleverest, went to the House of the betrayer Slytherin.

If sometimes a child needed a little push one way or the other, it was efficient to just reach into its own Magicks to mould this way or that. And if the Hat stole a touch more Magick for itself here and there, well, wasn't that /daring/.

** A take on the freeform challenge set at some point during the HBP school year and a tentative first step into the world of fan fiction, I'm sure there are some grammatical errors but I'm probably not going to find them on another read through so I'm hoping they're well hidden at least. Hopefully you enjoy reading it anyway!

He'd spent almost ninety-eight years wallowing in his guilt over that dreadful summer's night. His initial grief had become a rage unlike anything he had known before but which left him feeling hollow. This anger had shifted after his strained relationship with Aberforth had been shattered so publicly at Ariana's funeral leaving him to deal with the pointed questions and false sympathy from those who had never made the slightest effort when his mother had struggled to contain Ariana's magic on her own. Worse even than the snide muttered comments made by people, seemingly uncaring whether he could overhear them or not, was the new sense of self-loathing he had come to possess which had taken his impotent fury and presented it with a new, readily available target -- himself. But, finally, he had the opportunity to discover the truth after his failed attempt to achieve his end with the resurrection stone the previous summer.

Albus knew that he would be unwise to alter the outcome of that warm afternoon in Godric's Hollow though, he admitted to himself, that was not the purpose of the journey through time. Nor was the fact that it was supposedly an impossible feat, yet another piece of miraculous sorcery to further cement his reputation and dazzle others as he had done in his foolish, youthful days. No, he told himself, this was all to help Harry in his quest to finally defeat Tom Riddle which he knew by now was going to require his sacrifice, hopefully at the wand of Severus if he was not going to have the luck to slip across to the other side quietly and naturally in the coming summer. But to give him the strength to face his coming death he had to know before he came across his family again as he knew he must one way or another.

His wand swept through the air in a complex pattern and with a muttered incantation he felt a gentle pull on his arm as he turned and stumbled. It seemed to last an eternity, the darkness pressing around him as he flailed with no idea of when the journey would finish or even what he would discover when at last he reached his destination whether the ritual had been a success or not. After a further wait which seemed to take forever he began to feel more settled as though he was standing on solid ground again.

Slowly, the late afternoon sun settled across his vision and he glanced around the unkempt front room of the Dumbledore residence as he heard raised voices coming from the garden at the rear of the quaint, old cottage. Carefully disillusioning himself he crept through the kitchen and through the open door in time to witness Gellert turn the Cruciatus curse onto his younger brother.

His gaze swept across the immaculately kept lawn and fell onto his younger self's torn countenance as both Albus Dumbledore's took in the scene before them. His teenage self reacted in seconds and leapt in to duel Grindelwald with no effort made to protect himself from the barrage of curses which flew towards him from the other's wand even as Aberforth unsteadily regained his feet and began to launch the strongest hexes and jinxes he was able to muster at his torturer.

In the midst of their duel neither of them heeded the cries of Ariana as she bowled across the lawn, desperately trying to stop the vicious display of magic from the three older boys. When it became clear that her anguished cries were continuing to be ignored by her brothers, she attempted to intervene in the way her mother had done on several occasions in the aftermath of the attack. As she closed the gap towards the unsuspecting duellists Albus began to feel the pull of his magic, an insistent tug on his withered arm which surely signalled the end of his time in here.

Despairing at the prospect of returning without the knowledge of who had thrown that fateful curse he completely forgot himself and his earlier declaration not to interfere in the outcome of the duel. Tears threatened to obscure his vision and his arm wavered as he unsteadily pointed his wand at Grindelwald's back.

‘Avada Kedavra,' he choked under his breath as he prayed that this would do it, that this would save her from her terrible fate. However it was not to be as Gellert twirled away from the curse which impacted on a bone-breaking curse which had been coming from his eighteen year-old self's wand. Then the dreadful impact came and Ariana lay sprawled across the tended lawn, her bright blue eyes wide and unseeing as both brothers dropped to their knees beside her and the wrench of magic finally tore him back through the fabric of time and into his office.

As he collapsed into his high backed chair, his legs unable to support his weight any longer, his body was wracked with sobs he was unable to stop as they continued seemingly without end and then he felt it as it grew in him once again more intense than ever before, that crippling sense of self-loathing had returned and this time there was no doubt whatsoever that it was deserved.

** *H*e was suddenly standing in his old bedroom, and by the calendar on the wall, it was December 1978. Without any further thought, he disillusioned himself. Suddenly, his younger self walked into the room. He suddenly remembered that Albus. This Albus was tired, slouching, with limp unwashed hair and walking with no purpose. He watched himself sit down on the bed.

*A*lbus couldn't tell when this was. He was stuck to his place on the floor, trying not to make a noise. He couldn't exactly remember this period in his life because all the days ran together. He remembered how this Albus /felt/, but not much else.

*T*he young Albus was sitting on his bed, and pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket. He started playing with it, flicking the lamp on and off, alternating the room's main light source between the lightly curtained window and the lamp. His listless flicking made the disillusioned Albus stiff with anticipation. The next ball of light stopped in front of the young Albus, confusing him. He kept flicking the Deluminator, but nothing was happening. The ball then slowly came to Albus and went inside of him, his face showing surprise and a sudden sense of purpose that shed his despondent eyes and mouth.

*H*e stood up, and apparated to Aberforth's bar. Albus still stood in the corner, with a smile on his face. He remembered how they both spent Christmas that year, reforging a brotherhood that combined the strain with a reactivated loving undertone that hadn't been there for a long time.

*A*lbus decided to try something. He apparated, and reappeared in his office at Hogwarts, back to where he was before. Then, he wrote down that Ron would get the Deluminator.

** When he got the news, he was shocked. It took him three months of constant research, constant magical theory creation and refining. Three months of effort from a, in his humble opinion, brilliant wizard. Finally he would be able to fix it. Finally he would be able to continue moving forward, instead of being stuck on the past. But first... First he would go downstairs and firm his resolve.

Severus Snape sat beside the hospital bed in a daze. It wasn't meant to be like this. He was supposed to be like her, not like a vegetable. He wasn't meant to be only sustained by the magic in his body. All because of one thing... Severus trembled as a flash of rage blazed through his thoughts just as the Hospital Wing doors opened softly.

Dumbledore stared at the helpless thin body of the boy who lived, and his eyes hardened. He would fix this... right now. With a flick of his wrist, his wand appeared in his hand, and Severus jumped to his feet.

A mumbled incantation, knowing the risks, Dumbledore vanishes in a blast of blue smoke.

The icey breeze tangled the hair of his beard as he faded slowly into existence. His other-self tensed, sensing the strong magic of his counter part. "Gilgamesh was a terrible wizard. He hated candy" Current Dumbledore spoke swiftly the words that he knew that he knew were the safe words for a time-traveling encounter. "Why?" His other-self asked as he cradled the young child. "It's too cold... and they were too cruel. They didn't take him in, in my time... He... he suffers so much." The current Dumbledore's face crumpled in pain. He could handle not knowing who killed Ariana, he could handle his brother hating him, he could handle his lover being a mass murderer, he could take the world's hatred.. But he could not stand to see that broken child lay unresponsive on a bed any longer. "Place warming charms on him. And a compulsion charm for them to take him." The current Dumbledore pleaded with his younger self.

"It has been proven that compulsions on muggles are extremely polarizing. They will do for short times, but then they will amplify the emotions that they are repressing. Surely you know this other-me?" The other Dumbledore replied.

"Better cracked, than broken. We won't be able to live with ourselves otherwise." The current dumbledore slowly became blue smoke as his words echoed.

"Albus?" Minerva asked. The aged headmaster shook his head softly as his glazed eyes firmed. "Sorry Minerva, I was having a conversation with myself."

"Either way, I do not think these muggles are good people Albus!" MInerva started.

"I know exactly how bad they are... so we will run interference." Albus pulled a letter out of his robes as he laid the bundle of happiness on the door step. With several flicks of the wand, and a soft smile, Dumbledore tapped Harry's head. "Maybe this will save you young one... I'll check back in the morning.." With a knock on the door, and a tap of the wand, Dumbledore and his Deputy disappeared from Private Drive.

** Freeform prompt:

I was faced with a tough decision and an incredible opportunity. Never in my whole life would I have thought that I would be given a second chance. I regret many things of my life, and standing here in what I assume is King's Cross Station, with a train willing to take me anywhere in my past, I am unable to choose where, or perhaps should I say, when.

Perhaps I would go back to that fatefull night whence I met Gellert. Fell for his charms and the promise of a challenging mind. Maybe this time I could save ourselves from our youthful and power-driven quest. Maybe I could convince him that our love was more important than conquest over death. I wish I could say this was out of my need to save all those countless lives he destroyed in his ravaging war. Alas, it is true I never fell in love with anyone else, and I missed him more than anything in this world.

No, there would be no redemption to those terrible mistakes of my past. Let Magic judge me truly for who I am. I boarded the train and asked the driver to take me to the night of my death, right to the moment where we landed in the astronomy tower. I was weak, I remember the weakness. Holding on to Harry's shoulder. I looked at him in the eye, his wonderful green eyes. Harry. Strong, loveable, wonderful Harry.

"Harry," I said, in my weak and raspy voice, "look me in the eye Harry," he turned to me, with concern all over his face. "Be strong Harry, I am so sorry for not doing enough. For not being there enough. I am so sorry. Don't blame Severus,"

He was so confused, I could see it clearly in his face, shocked to silence. "I love you Harry, never forget that" I said as I heard steps climbing the stairs, petrifying and silencing him temporarily and throwing his invisibility cloak over him. Alas, the rest was history, and I smiled at Severus as he cast my end.

** *Challenge*

Tim the tentacle monster from Rorschach's Blot's linkffn (3695087) enters SpoonandJohn's fabulous linkffn (11634921) and then crack occurs. Sorry, it got a bit long.

“Potter!!”

“Yes Professor?” Hari looked back from his desk where he had one arm raised over a line of open books as his other arm appeared to be casting a page turning charm.

“I'm not going to ask what you're doing, I don't want to know. However something else has come up that has become my problem and as such, it is also yours. Please come with me to the Headmaster's Office.”

“Of course Professor.” The books snapped close and Hari shrugged the sleeves of his robes back into place.

Upon reaching Dumbledore's office Snape stared at a forlorn looking tentacle monster slumped in a pink chintz chair opposite the Headmaster's desk. “Ah, Professor Snape, Professor Potter. Good of you to join us. Allow me to introduce Tim.”

“A pleasure to meet you Tim,” Hari nodded at the sighing monster. “What seems to be the problem Professor Headmaster?”

“I found Tim earlier this evening when I felt him cross the wards. He was down by the lake. I initially assumed he was one of your guest instructors Professor Potter, but he was apparently looking for the giant squid. They seem to have had a relationship in the past, in a different dimension.”

“Albus, how in the world did this become my problem?” asked Snape.

“Ah yes, I have decided that anything that ventures into the realm of odd is Hari's problem, and as your problems are his problems, it's easier to make it your problem first so that you can find him and bring him to my office. Lemon drop?” He offered up a bowl of damp candy.

“No, but thank you Professor. So Tim, you're from a different dimension? Oh, portkey incident, that's too bad. You were an Auror? Tough break on the tentacle. Oh, they grow back? That fast, really?” Hari carried on the conversation while Snape looked on, not allowing his utter confusion to show, as Dumbledore seemed to be keeping up quite easily. “Professor Headmaster, I believe I need to go on a field trip with Tim, about a week perhaps?”

“That will be fine. It was a pleasure to meet you Tim. See you soon Professor Potter, Severus.” He dismissed them while staring at his candy dish mournfully.

~.~

“Hari.”

Hari's head came swooping to the door of his room in a slightly wobbly fashion, his neck extending from his bed. “Still working on that. Yes Uncle Pein?”

“Aren't you supposed to be back in your school?”

“Technically, but I'm on a field trip. How did you know I was here?”

“Three things gave you away.”

“Oh?”

“Hidan came running into my office screaming about leather, tentacles, paper, and ‘Not again!' before he passed out by the spark sparrow upon seeing the latest addition to my office, which was my second clue. Finally, I received a gift basket from Orochimaru thanking us for the contributions to his research along with a bill for the equipment stolen. I noticed that the tank containing the two tentacles in my office was labeled ‘Property of Orochimaru' and it all seemed to come together in my mind.” Pein bit out at Hari's bobbing head.

“Two tentacles? Already? That's great Uncle Pein!” Hari's head slid back as his neck shortened to normal length. “Come on in, I'll have to check on that soon, are they both the same size? Are there any buds?”

“One is quite small compared to the other as of now, I didn't inspect it too closely. Hari, I really don't want to ask, but why do you have another tank with a tentacle in your room and are those sharingan on it?”

“Yeah, they must slow the growth process down as this one has yet to sprout more tentacles. I'll have to sort that out. Maybe I should use a Senju bush with some Tim juice.” Hari jumped from his bed and started scribbling in a notebook.

“Hari, let's pretend I have no idea what you're talking about and you tell me where these tentacles come from, why Orochimaru is sending me a thank you and a bill, and what happened to Hidan this time.” Pein tried to remain calm, watching as his “nephew” bounced around like a mad scientist on a sugar high. “Please sit down while doing so.”

Hari sat down and began, “I was at school and there was a dimensional teleportation accident which resulted in a tentacle monster named Tim stuck at the school. I couldn't send him to the Eldritch Plane and they gave him to me to deal with. So after I discovered that he had really great regenerative powers I told him I could bring him here and it would only cost him an arm and a leg, well, technically two arms and legs, er, make that four tentacles, I'm trying to work that out, I think Uncle Kakuzu might get a chuckle-“

Pein interrupted, “You brought an Eldritch Horror to the Elemental Nations and convinced it to let you chop off its limbs for payment?”

“Sounds about right.”

“Continue,” Pein felt a massive migraine coming on.

“Well, I wanted to experiment on the limbs to see if I could reverse grow a tentacle monster from a tentacle, which seems to have started showing promise in your office, I hope your Animal Path can use it, and Orochimaru has the best labs, so I broke in, left him a tentacle and some notes along with a bit of Tim juice, then took a couple of tanks for us to use here. Before you say it, I hadn't come home yet so I didn't leave here unaccompanied and I left Sasuke alone this time.” Hari stated proudly.

“So you left one of our enemies a piece of an unthinkable, regenerative monster as well as notes about its origins and ‘Tim juice'? Why would you give that to Orochimaru, and what is ‘Tim juice'?”

“I left it with Orochimaru because I won't have the time to do all of the experiments I want to on my own while I'm in school and, though he isn't as refined in his techniques as I am, when I come back, I can steal all of his new research and take things on from there. Tim juice is something I made from the fourth tentacle, a sort of regeneration liquid.”

Pein counted off the points in his head. There was still one issue, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to know the answer. “And what about Hidan?”

“I really can't be sure about that one. Based on what he said though, my guess would be that he tried to visit Aunt Konan without knocking.”

“And why would that... please tell me you didn't.”

“Tim needed someone to stay with, and he's on the rebound. Based on Konan's books, it seemed to fit, strangely so did the harness she broke out when I introduced them. I wonder why she's splitting into paper though, huh,” Hari mused. “Anyway, I only have another day before I have to get back to school, did you need anything else?”

“No. No, I think that will be all. Hari, from now on, please get my permission before bringing guests home with you, even and especially if they are in pieces. Also, when you return from school, you will come home immediately without stopping by any of the other Hidden Villages, labs, or anywhere in any other Elemental Nation. Is that understood?”

“Yes Uncle Pein.”

“Thank you Hari.” Pein left to go have a long lie down before making Itachi deal with everything.
