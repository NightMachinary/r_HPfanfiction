This request was on [[https://hd-ficsearch.livejournal.com/479774.html][Livejournal and had no responses]], but it sounds like it might be good so I was wondering if anyone here knew this fic.

- It's post-DH
- Narcissa is in Azkaban and writing letters to her sister. The letters are censured and become ever more so. Eventually, communication is forbidden entirely.
- Draco lives at Andromeda's and has a hard time adjusting to his new life where "his" side lost the war and he has to contend with blood traitors and the child of a werewolf. At first he sort of only exists inside the house and not all that graciously at that. Very gradually, he starts to view Teddy and Andromeda as people, as family.
- Harry was in there somewhere but I feel his role was fairly minor. The focus was on Andromeda, Draco and Narcissa.


** It's not Harry/Draco, so I'm not certain it's what the original poster was looking for, but it sounds a lot like Vae Victis by V.M. Bell.

** I noticed it was posted to a HD Fic Search group - does that mean that it's probably a Drarry fic? That would be a key piece of info to include to narrow down the possibilities
