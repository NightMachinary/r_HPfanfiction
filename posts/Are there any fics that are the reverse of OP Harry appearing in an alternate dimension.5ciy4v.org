Like are there fics where an average, maybe even canon Harry is switched with OP Harry, and the focus of the story is not-OP Harry's struggle to handle the giant shoes and maybe even the realization that there are some things that universe's magic does that he just can't. And if there aren't any fics like that, would anyone want to read one because I might write it.


** linkffn(3959072) Its an older story but it checks out, or at least I think it fits your description. It is however, the third story of a trilogy which follows the OP Harry before the whole dimension swapping business so you might want to read those first.

** I currently try my hands on one of those. Its a HPxFairytail crossover where he soon finds out that Fiendfire is fine and all, but Natsu does the same damage with a sneeze, that Aguamenti is Juvia being a bit moody and in general his magic is not exactly on par with the sheer devastation a FT mage can summon. Harry has to become increasingly creative with his spellcasting, especially when he meets the enemies of Fairytail.

Naruto crossovers also seem to have an increased amount of low-power Harry's, if you want to investigate in that avenue.

If you write this make sure to post it here for all to see.

** might try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen)

Harry is so magically screwed after a time jump he passes out when he waves his wand in Ollivanders. He's still pretty bad ass but.. magically gimped for sure.

Another one is linkffn(A Switched Chance) Harry and Hermione time jump but end up in each other's body, with each other's magic. I thought the writing about body/mind/soul/magic was more interesting than average.
