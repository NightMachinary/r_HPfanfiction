:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a while ago that switched POV every chapter. It had people like Hogwarts professors, classmates and I think his aunt. I also think it could be classed as a dark Harry fic.


** Do you have any more detail? This could apply to a lot of fics.

*** Sadly not. I do remember that it was finished and I think that no single character had more than one chapter.

Edit: it has been a while since I read the fic and I read for a couple of hours a day.

**** That's a shame - it sounds like an interesting fic. Was it a chaptered fic or a drabble series written to prompts (i.e. not connected)?

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

*** No, I just read that one and it reminded me of the other one. The one I'm looking for was finished and novella length
