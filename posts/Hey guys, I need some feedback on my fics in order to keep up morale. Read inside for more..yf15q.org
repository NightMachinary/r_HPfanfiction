I recently finished a massive fanfiction (Around 200,000 words). I started it when I was like 16. But, since it's finished, many people feel less inclined to review. It's hard to write when you're not getting feedback, so I thought you could help. Also, reading is always great, am I right?

You don't have to read the longest one. I have a few very cool stories that are on the shorter side. Just let me know what you like because I have quite a few different writing styles.

I just need a pick-me-up, you know? It's hard to write when you aren't getting any feedback whatsoever. If I can entertain one of you for a chapter, that would make me happy.

Thanks!

Edit: If you don't like Draco/Ginny, I don't suggest you read, though I've been told that one of my stories (A Beautiful Distraction) can actually make people hate the ship less. That one concentrates less on the ship and more on emotions. Don't try to guest flame me, I'll delete it. And be prepared for a response if you flame me. I hate it when people post stupid reviews like "Oh this is so not the way JKR intended it". Well, yes, that's why we have fan fiction, friends.

*** I'm currently on my account and everything seems fine. So, here's another link to my profile: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2152853/]]

PM me if you need me to send you individual links to the stories. That's seriously strange.

** Ack, that's some pretty dark stuff there. It's well written and rather engaging, but /damn/ it makes one cringe. I can kinda understand why people don't really give you the reviews you deserve on that one, so don't worry about it. As the arbiters of canon have no place in fanfiction, you shouldn't listen to the nay-sayers over this.

I pronounce it as good, real good, but reading two one-shots tells me your stuff is not for me, sorry.

** Hey, I read one one shot "A Beautiful Mess" and I'm gonna go ahead and give you my thoughts on it.

Honestly, I probably wouldn't read your writing again any time soon. I absolutely love everything dark so it isn't the content that's off-putting. You are /very/ wordy. I primarily write poetry and short stories, so I may not be the best opinion on this because I am accustomed to trying to convey big messages with few words. However, it just wasn't working for me.

Secondly, you are incredibly comma-happy. Do you have anyone to edit your stories for grammar and redundancies? If not, I would highly recommend looking into one.

You obviously have a /lot/ of potential here. You have a great command of the english language, and I think that story would have been much more engrossing and effective if you could cut down on repeated words and ideas. It's a *great* thing to be descriptive, but when you've already used one metaphor to describe something, don't continue to describe it. It disengages the reader, and gives conflicting ideas of what something looks/feels like. There's a point where you have to let the reader discern for him/herself in their mind what a situation feels/looks/sounds like to a character after you've already given them enough.

All of that aside, you are /good/ but not polished. I think that may be why some people are reluctant to leave reviews. If something is teetering on the edge of great writing, people are less inclined to be honest than if something is great or if something is terrible.

TL;DR: *This is only based on reading "A Beautiful Mess".* You're a good writer with good ideas, but you are too repetitive and comma-happy to truly engage a reader.
