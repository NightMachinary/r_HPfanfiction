Boom. Here you go, people. Hope you like it at all!


** I feel unsatisfied. I feel like Kylo Ren who is screaming "MORE" over and over again. This story has so much potential, with a pretty unique prompt among the ocean of stories with similar tropes.

I loved that Harry is drawing the similarities between Delphini and his childhood. I was severely dissapointed with the Curse Child where Harry did not tried to reach out to Delphini, an orphan who has gone through a rough childhood like he has.

You seem to have a pretty good idea as to what you want the story to be and I am pretty excited to see where that direction is going to be.

Please continue to write this amazing story.

*** Thanks? xD Yeah I've always loved the idea of Delphi at least, and what they could have done with contrasting her and Harry and whatnot, but they never did anything with it. So here I am giving it a go!

Good news is I hate bashing, so I'll never do that crap, and I hate magical cores and lordships - pretty much most fanon tropes actually - I tend to be someone who likes canon for want of a nails, I think they're called, where you just change one thing and see how it goes? But all the canon details and characterizations stay the same, so...that's what I've got here. Trying not to add extra stuff unless it's necessary or worldbuildy.

I do actually have a bare bones outline of where I want this story to go, yeah. Got it kind of mapped out here, so it should be pretty smooth sailing.

I'm definitely going to keep writing it!

Or maybe this is all just because I love dad!Harry fics... xD Whether it's babies or adopted kids! I just love it so muuuuch. Finally writing my own here!

  The summer after Sirius's death, a grieving Harry Potter receives an unexpected shock, gift, and burden: the Dark Lord's daughter. Born to die in a ritual for sake of growing her father's power, her never-meant-to-be life is entrusted to Harry. But is Harry up for the task of keeping newborn Delphini Riddle safe, healthy, and happy as he goes into his sixth year at Hogwarts?

**** Your welcome. You have a lot of potential for anything in this story. But personally I would love to see a court chase of Voldemort and Harry for custody
