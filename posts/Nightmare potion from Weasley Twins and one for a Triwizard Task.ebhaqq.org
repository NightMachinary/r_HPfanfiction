:END:
This one is about two fics I can't remember the names of, both with a similar element in that a potion was given to Harry that made him relive his worst moments.

The first fic had this nightmare potion thing thrown at him by antagonistic Weasley twins while Harry was off in a side-section of a Courtyard (I think) - fairly certain this was a WBWL or Slytherin-Harry fic since he had pissed them off somehow (they were full schoolyard minor-antagonists/enemies of his, it wasn't just some minor spat) and it was relatively bashy against them and took the Bullies-not-Pranksters view on the twins. He gets very mad at them afterward for escalating their prank war too far or something to that effect, IIRC.

The second was one of those 'more tasks than the canon three' Triwizard fics where they inflicted it (it also could have been a spell, maybe?) on him while they were all in the room that the champions first congregate in during the 'Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire' moment with Dumbledore (the antechamber, I think they called it? - or maybe receiving room?). He complains loudly about being different (ie. too fucked up to have normal nightmares/worst experiences like the other champions) afterward and storms out while everyone is freaking out/being sad. I think the nightmare/worst moment bit he experienced was also broadcast to the Great Hall full of students watching them. It's definitely not The Lie I've Lived, it's just similar enough sounding to screw up my search efforts as that seems to be all I can find.

I can't remember or find the names of either fic. Please help.


** For anyone interested, I found one of the two - the former, to be specific. It's called Ingenio ab Artifex and it's neither WBWL or Slytherin-Harry fic, they're simply jealous over the Tournament. The rest of my recall is also incorrect, there's no prank war or anything else, but saying any more of that would be spoilers. It's a relatively good fic, IMO, so I'd recommend giving it a read. It does get progressively better, quite considerably so, but your mileage may vary.

Still nothing on the second one, but I'll post here again if I find it. For anyone googling later on. :)
