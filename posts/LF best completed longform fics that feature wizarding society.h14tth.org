I'm really interested in reading about wizarding and/or pureblood society. I've devoured PoS and Sarcasm & Slytherin; something along those lines would be great.

Basically I'd love to see what we don't really see in the books--what the adults are doing for those who don't work in the Ministry. Also I'd be interested to read what wizarding children do pre-Hogwarts: are there wizarding primary schools? Tutors? What are the other shops in Diagon Alley that aren't frequented by students?

I'm not picky when it comes to pairing (really don't like Harry/LV, however) and would prefer completed, or at least regularly updated, fics. Old fics are fine! Thank you :)

ETA: more specificity


** Sorry, can you just clarify a bit what you mean by featuring wizarding society? I haven't read Prince of Slytherin or Sarcasm & Slytherin so I can't compare to those fics.

**** Ah okay, now that you mention it I'm curious about those aspects as well. Hmm I don't think linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has all of those elements but it definitely has believable and interesting depictions of wizarding life and what goes on day to day. There's quite a lot of politics like the Wizengamot and sometimes children acting rather mature for their age, so I hope you don't mind that. I'd recommend White Squirrel's fics overall.

** Have you read the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave--seven long books, and they get a bit dark, but a lot of its wizarding society has become head canon for me. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]])

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) explores all of this. You'll also get that power-trip Slytherin snark vibe both PoS and S&S have. Probably the closest thing to those two series.

linkffn(Blood and Water) is in progress and also explores this.

If you're willing to escape from canon linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) fleshes out an American wizarding society fantastically. My favorite series.

I'd also second Accidental Animagus and Claw of the Raven, with a caution for quite a bit of bashing in the latter. Animagus and AQ are /very/ different than the Slytherin fics in both tone and style, so just a warning that you may not like them or have to get used to the writing.

*** I am halfway through The Pureblood Pretense--stumbled upon it last week and I LOVE it and can't believe I haven't read it before! I love Tamora Pierce.

I definitely don't mind escaping from canon and I'm actually plotting an American wizarding society fic of my own, so Alexandra Quick has just shot to the top of my list. I'll also check out Blood and Water! Thank you so much!!

  The common phrase is "Blood is thicker than water." But the original phrase was "Blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb." Peter hoped more than anything that the original phrase is the truth.
