** Yeah, she writes some great stuff. A lot of the characterizations I disagree a lot with, though. For instance, Harry knows what's beyond death. He knows death is nothing to fear. He would not mourn for months afterwards.

** Isn't Draco married to Astoria in canon, not Daphne?

** linkffn(4367121), or The First Day, is one of my favorites in all of the fandom. It's a great look at the year after Voldemort's defeat. I don't normally read slice of life kind of stuff, but this one was really great.

** I enjoyed The First Day, I just didn't like the pacing of it. I was also kinda hoping for more closure with Katie's storyline (at least tell him, you know?).

** I like the series a lot, though some characters i think the author has a better grasp on than others. But it is basically the fic that formed a lot of my headcanon.
