Hey everyone, I'm looking for a good fanfic with Tom Riddle, set during his time at Hogwarts (about : his first year / when he first met and became "friends" with the Knights of Walpurgis / the Slug Club / his Horcruxes...) I'd love to find a story that kind of respects the canon so with no Hermione or Harry Time Travel preferably. I haven't find one yet and I'm still desperately looking for one, sooo if any of you knows one or plans on writing one one day, let me know :) And at best with no OC x Tom Riddle Thank youuu :)


** I am TRYING to write an entire canon-compliant history on that idiot but I keep getting distracted by writing non-canon-compliant humor fics about that idiot. It will happen though. Soon.

*** I am working on one myself... but it's kind of hard to write him in a realistic way mostly because he is described as such a unidimensional character in the books. He's just presented as pure evil and despite trying to add to him some human dimension, I still always end up with some cartoonish machiavellic villain.

** This is something I wanted to write for a long time now. But whenever I try to map out what will happen, I get really scared because I don't think I can write how dark Tom Riddle's mind is. It's too disturbing to think about honestly.

One of my main gripes about ff is how blase some writers portray psychopathy/sociopathy/mental illness/abuse. So I'd rather read AUs haha.

*** I remember reading once a one-shot (but a fairly long one) about him manipulating, seducing and eventually raping a professor who was the wife of the first muggle-born head of the DMLE in order to blackmail him to resign. I can't remember the name but you might find the plot familiar. I thought that story depicted quite accurately how the mind of a charming sociopath works.

**** See, this is why I can't even start writing a Tom Riddle canon-compliant fic. Aside from the obvious bad things he did (like the murder of Myrtle and his paternal family), you have this gut feeling that he did other horrible things... and I can't imagine even writing it down. Because at that time, Tom was essentially still a kid, and entertaining the idea that he did evil things at that age bothers me a lot.

*** This is soooo true. I have had to do a lot of research on psychology and mapping out canon to figure out the whole nature vs nurture thing and external stimuli > adaptation and it is a mess. And actually writing it is very, very difficult.

*** I've been wanting to write about this for ages!! but yeah it's really disturbing haha.

And i completely agree with that, i like AUs as well but they're sadly often to short :(
