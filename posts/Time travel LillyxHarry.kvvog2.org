*** "Here she comes! One more push! And..."

The Medi-wizard froze. /"Huh."/

"What? What is it? Lily murmured, somewhat frantic. "How is she? Is she okay?"

"Yeah, I uh- I think? I just... well. You two wouldn't happen to be related, would you?"

"No? What?" Harry blurted, waving his hands around. "No, not at all. We're both muggleborn."

"Well, your kids got a third arm and is shooting sparks out of her ears, so that'll explain the cramps. But, I've never heard of anything like this happening except for, well- "

"Situations... like that?"

"Yup."

***** You claim she's 13 years old and younger than you, but your profile says you are 12. If that'd your real age, you're trying to cover for these posts. If not, she got your bio too and you should change that back.
