** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]] focuses mostly on McGonagall, but given that Umbridge is, well, Umbridge, there's plenty of rebellion against her to be had, even from the faculty. (And there are students who we see doing their own acts of defiance, it's just that McGonagall is the focus.)

*** Do you remember any more details of this story, such as the author?
