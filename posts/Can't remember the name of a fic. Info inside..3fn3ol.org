Harry Potter in some other universe was a psychopath so when 'good Harry' died they replaced his soul with the evil guy. Was a pretty awful story but I can't find it again.


** Could you possibly provide a bit more info? That's not much to go on.

  If I remember correctly, he also becomes obsessed with his sister and it's heading towards incest, which Lily was strangely OK with.

Rozn was able to provide some more detail. The truth is I don't remember much on account of the story being very very bad. However there was something about it I wanted to look up.

**** I remember that one... I read it about a year ago? I agree, it was terrible and weird as hell. Tbh I think the author deleted it... I'll check through the AU communities on FF.Net.

Edit: Found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806627/1/Sacrificial-Second-Chance][Sacrificial Second Chance]]. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-Alternate-Universes/24249/14/0/1/0/5/1/0/][this specific community]], in case you were wondering.
