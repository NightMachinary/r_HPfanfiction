:END:
I am looking for a story where Sirius unlocks the power of Merlin (I think) as the Blacks are descendants of his and manages to escape Azkaban alot earlier than canon. I am pretty sure Sirius is morally dark in this story as he would do ANYTHING to protect Harry and get rid of the horcruxes (don't remember how he found it or if he found out about them before Regulus shows up in Harrys bedroom at Grimmald Place) but Sirius and eventually Regulus starts attacking deatheaters that escaped justice too. Dumbledore and the Order are trying to kidnap Harry from Sirius, Severus and Remus eventually joins their side (Sirius, Regulus and Harrys side) when Sirius saves Severus after Moody almost kills him and leaves him in Diagonally. I think Harry also meets Hermione earlier than canon too.

That's all I can write about the story for now, if you know it please comment, if you have anymore questions about the story, let me know and I will try to answer it.
