I said something like this on a comment thread, but I want to see how far I can take it.

Blaise Zabini is great. He's also an author's multitool. Because his gender was revealed in Book 6, authors before that guessed whether he was male or not, turning him into the most gender-bent minor character. Because of the community having this kind of built-in from the beginning, you can genderswap Blaise pretty easily now. For pairings, that means he can be male in your M/F, or female. You can use him for M/M pairings, or her for F/F pairings. Why would you use Blaise in place of a character like Draco or Daphne?

Draco suffers from being so present in the canon. To make him a love interest when you /don't/ want your characters to be evil, you have to redeem him first. Otherwise, your character is dating an unrepentant racist, and people are leaving negative reviews. Not fun. Draco's having a canon background is useful though, as it gives you a jumping-off point for the plot surrounding him. Daphne Greengrass has the opposite issue. She barely exists in the canon, to the point where people don't know her hair color. It's easier to write her as a non-evil character because you don't have to work against canon, but her place in the world isn't set in stone. This leads to Daphne being the heir of the Greengrass family, famously neutral, and her dad's a lawyer. Does anyone recognize this backstory? It's not necessarily bad, but it can lead to stilted worldbuilding because you don't have enough of a grounding in canon to know where to go.

Blaise on the other hand has the advantages of both. He has Daphne's 'OC who's technically canon' abilities because we only see one scene with him actually having a line of dialogue. But he has Draco's background in canon, with his mother being a serial killer. His mum being a serial killer gives a lot more than just that piece of information, because it tells you about Blaise's possible upbringings. It gives options, without having to write your own headcanon. For example, if you want Blaise to be part of navigating the political waters of the upper-crust society, his mother's marrying of rich men gives you that in. He's high society. If you want to add lordships, you can give Ms. Zabini her own title, which gives reason for men to want to marry her besides her beauty. If you want him to have knowledge of muggle pop culture? He travels between the worlds while he goes about the world with his Mother.

He has so many options with pairings and a role in the Magical World that can be used. Of course, this only works when he's a character serving a purpose. A Draco or Daphne centric story, built around them in canon or fanon, won't work with Blaise. Context is everything here, as usual. But if you have a fic where you want your MC to hang out with a Slytherin, Blaise is available.


** It's so interesting to me the very different stories we get these characters. I've read fics where Blaise is Draco's best friend and fics where Blaise hates Malfoy.

It all depends on the story. That being said I don't think anyone really writes Blaise as female anymore though I recall reading some back in the day.

My favorite iteration of Blaise is rich, hot, go with the flow type guy, here for a good time not a long time. Like Naveen from Princess and the Frog. It's how I picture him.

*** I honestly miss female Blaise. The stories where she featured weren't great, but it was always such a change of pace to encounter it.

**** It's still weird to me that it was pretty much fanon Blaise was a girl. I mean, Blaise is a man's name. Half the boys in my CCD class chose Saint Blaise for their confirmation, because they thought it was cool sounding.

** I don't like him either - for all the reasons you mentioned. Playbloy Blaise is so boring IMO and usually present in the equally boring "Slytherin good Gryffindor bad" edgelord fics.

Also they make him one of the "good slytherins" even though he scoffs at Harry and call Ginny a blood traitor, he's just as bad as any pureblood bigot so much he even got to replace one of Malfoy's goons in the 8th movie, because the OG actor for one of them was arrested for drugs.

Also whenever I see his name I can't help but read as "Blaze" which just sounds really cringe and edgey (appropriate for the fics he appears tho).

*** His name is pronounced Blaze. It comes from the greek for stammering. Remember that next time you come across playboy Blaise's smooth-talking. His name means /stammering/.

** I don't like him. He always seems really slimy and he's usually used as Ron 2.0 when Neville isn't

*** Occasionally. I'm not a fan of playboy Blaise, and that's a really present interpretation of him. Is that what you're talking about?
