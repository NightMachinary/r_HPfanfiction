*** /My Doomed Children/ doesn't work for me on a couple of levels, mainly because the first-person POV doesn't sound like Snape. Which is too bad, because I'm usually a sucker for angst, or for fics that explore the relationship between Snape and his Slytherins.

It reminds me of another short fic I liked quite a bit, in which the situation is reversed, i.e., canon-compliant. Four of Snape's students meet at his grave and think about the night of the battle and what their head of house meant to them. It's touching but not overly sentimental, and hints at the shades of grey in their attitudes and postwar lives.
