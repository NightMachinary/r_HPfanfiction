I'm reading a fic at the moment (Harry Potter and the Burden of Becoming by fisico), Harry is paired with an OC that appeared to be a muggle but of course she turned out to be a witch. Anyone know of any novel length fics that pair one of the canon characters (preferably Harry or Hermione) with a muggle?


** Paffy's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]]

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after the Department of Mysteries and Harry Potter's about to do something drastic, something nobody expects, and he may not be alone. Following the lives of Harry and the Order as they battle against each other.

Its basically a story where Harry runs away with a muggle girl to escape the war. Very Angsty, and as you can tell, kinda a lyric fic. Maybe a little too based off the movie if you can tell by the title.

*** Thanks for the recommendation; this story ate my day yesterday and is probably the best Canon/OC story I've ever read.

** There is a post-Hogwarts fic whose name I am struggling to remember, but the premise is that Harry left the wizarding world, and has (at the beginning of the fic), been called back to it. His wife, one of the major characters of the fic, is a muggle. I believe the catalyst for his return is that his eldest child is magical.

*** That's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed][Betrayed]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/9744/kateydidnt][Kateydidnt]], one of two fics that immediately came to mind from this prompt.

The other is Paffy's Behind Blue Eyes, which [[/u/whalesftw]] already mentioned.

** Two others occurred to me, but in both cases the muggle-magical relationship isn't the main pairing.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]] by clell65619 tells the story of a Harry leaving one world where he just beat the bad guy, only to fall into a new one where pureblood supremacy had taken hold long before. It's a great dystopia with some Very Terrible Things having changed or broken most canon characters. The muggle relationship only shows up in the last few chapters.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]] by Abraxan is a classic story (and sequel) that starts with Harry working in a local shop over the summer and falling for the shopkeeper's daughter. It has some great character moments within that context, but later evolves into a major uber!Harry epic.

As with most things I recommend, Caveat Lector.

*** The Refiner's Fire has been on my list of things to read, though I'm usually not very fond of powerful!Harry fics. They're usually just not well done and read like juvenile power fantasies. I swear I've read scenes that sounded more like they were describing an episode of DBZ than Harry Potter.

**** I understand and sympathize. I'd say just read the first ten chapters of Refiner's Fire as its own mini-story, then continue if the style and direction still appeal to you.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE
