Voldemort is tired, sick of this cat and mouse play of chasing over Harry and trying to find for a wand that would work. He decides to retire and have some peaceful time at Bermuda, get some much-needed tan. However, he can't let the business unattended, he had to leave someone in charge. So, after revealing himself to the Muggle world, he hijacks a popular TV station and decides to run a reality show to pick his successor. Follow Bellatrix, Lucious, Greyback, Travers, Wormtail, and others as they try to run through magical obstacle courses to let everyone know who among them has really what it takes to be the next Dark Lord. Meanwhile, Snape enters the contest with the task of sabotaging it and making all Death Eaters look ridiculous in Live-TV... after 3 episodes though, Albus is hooked and won't stand being bothered at the show's hour with trivialities such as running a school. He is running a bet poll with the Order members to try to guess who'll win. On the other hand, Muggles around the world know now what's at stake, but their morbid curiosity keeps them giving the show historical ratings. There's also a company that is pushing for push figures of the death eaters and Funkos, also T-shirts are flooding the streets with labels such as "My Daddy will hear about this" with Lucius' picture on them... or "Scabior is my Savior"... "Peter's fangirls won't let Wormtail fail."

** I love this idea.

Also, at the last episode Harry comes in as a co-host, because why not.

*** Could also have Grindelwald as co-host and Harry as either a contestant, being involved in the last task or liking the idea and making something along the same lines.

*** She could do well on a physical test, but she would struggle with answering questions...

Like, have her running an obstacle course, then arrives breathing hard to Voldemort, who is waiting anxiously for her with some cards.

"Very well, Bellatrix, you have done well so far, hasn't she?" Voldemort asks to the camera, "However, can you answer this question? What spell would you use on a mudblood who is afraid of heights? GO!"

Bellatrix's eyes open wide.

"Crucio?"

Voldemort shakes his head to both sides, as a loud noise pointing to her incorrect answer echoes. "No, no, no. What a disappointment. Is that your answer to everything? What a lack of imagination."

**** To be fair, this is coming from the guy who used Avada Kedavra on an /infant/. A fucking diffindo would have done the trick.
