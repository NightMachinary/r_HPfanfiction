howdy yall! i really love reading works where the main character is morally dark or gray; however, in the harry potter fandom that tends to mean a detente with voldemort's ideology. i'm looking for fics in which harry is morally gray or just straight up evil, but still actively condemns the "racist" pureblood platform-- not just once in some sort of half-baked scene where he says that muggleborns are people too and malfoy is an idiot, but more in the sense that he is legitimately undermining the pureblood dogma throughout the fic.

tl;dr? i want a fic where harry is dark/gray and consistently fights against prejudice against muggleborns


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is exactly that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), also fits well, although Hermione takes the lead here and they are never described as dark.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is a time travel in which badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan kill them by the boatloads.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Well, backing the Pureblood bullshit is a "logical" move for a villain, because its an easy path to power and followers.

Long-term, though, its also limiting, as it alienates/excludes talented people who would otherwise be allies/tools.
