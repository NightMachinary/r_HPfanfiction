As in the title, a Hermione (or nearly anyone but harry) that is really good at one subject but only decent or bad in the rest (not arithmancer where she is good at everything but better at some). Would even take a Nevil fic exploring herbology.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Good at sneaking into places and stealing everything. Not that good at covering her tracks or dating responsibly.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

Hermione is a damn potions genius in this one and invents the cure for lycanthropy as a 7th year student's "senior project" at Hogwarts /(almost entirely without any help from Snape. Snape is floored by her abilities I think, but you know, too snarky to say so.)/

Despite how smart and talented Hermione (and by extension Harry) is in this story, I actually believe it, since it's well-written and a lot of fun.

It is Hermione/Snape, but a very slow build up over time, so it felt realistic to me.
