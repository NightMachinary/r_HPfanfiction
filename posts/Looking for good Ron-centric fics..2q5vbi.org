I'm hankering for a fanfic where Ron isn't protrayed as an idiot and actually gets shit done. He doesn't nessesarily have to be the main protagonist, but he should feature heavily, and he doesn't have to be Light or Dark.

Thank you!


** The best I've seen is probably Number Games, by jbern. About a professional Quidditch playing Ron in his last game. Pretty good, decently long oneshot. Worth a read if you're hankering for it. Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/Harry-Potter-Without-Harry-Potter][Harry Potter Without Harry Potter]] features him heavily along with other side characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8218798/1/War][War!]] has an entertaining Ron as well. It pits him against Dumbledore and explores his character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7192398/1/Those-Four-Last-Days-of-the-War][Those Four Last Days of the War]] is pretty much the equevalent of a super!Harry fic. It has him as the one resolving most problems that occur.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2761177/1/The-Man-Who-Wasn-t-There][The Man Who Wasn't There]] is a companion piece to Lost in Parasomnia from Ron's pov. He can communicate with ghost and uses this in the fight against Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2153546/11/Sleeping-With-Hermione][Sleeping With Hermione]] /No not that kind of story./ It has Ron and Hermione doing lots of actions after they lare seperated from Harry during the war(note: this came out before the last book so the war is being handled differently). The last chapter is hilarious.
