Please i need to read sirius x oc fanfics which are really good but not the common ones since i've read almost all of those. But i'm looking for more sirius x oc fanfics which may or may not be popular but are completed or in progress not abandoned ones.


** Most of mine are SiriusxOC either as main characters or side characters, but a couple are being rewritten at the moment. I don't know that they are 'really good' but I can safely say they aren't popular. They are, however, finished.

  Sirius wasn't looking for a new best friend, but James was now spending all his time with his new girlfriend. Sirius was the one left behind, and I was the one he found. And neither of us expected what we found in each other. JamesXLily SiriusXOC
