Ive been looking for male oc fanfictions, Ive read a lot so its hard to found one I read and is very interesting. I like the roc's to be Ravenclaw but you can't be picky all the time. While I wish they had more bib ships, it ok I sent really care about shipping. If you could help me find a fan fiction, it would mean a lot to me.


** My friend and I are writing a double-SI. One male, one female, both in Ravenclaw. Dunno if you wanted self-inserts, but feel free to take a look or not.

*** I really like this fic, read it on RRL and the Author reads the comments, the MC has his own adventurer's and friends, his own goals in life, its long with almost 100 chapters with several story arcs and the Cannon Characters is almost not mentioned, and the author updates every 1~2 weeks.

This is basically the Fic that removed my bias of Harry Potter fanfics and frankly i am still looking for similar fics with OC having their own life instead of either helping Harry or becoming some kind of God.
