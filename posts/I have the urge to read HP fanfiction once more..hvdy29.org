After not reading fanfiction for close to 6 months, I'm back. I read a novel length one quite quickly (3 days) so I'm writing this post to see if I can get any suggestions. I have always enjoyed some of the more realistic/gritty fanfics, specially ones where you see the abuse that Harry experienced manifest into some type of pragmatism. The story must be novel length (200k plus) and if it's still an ongoing story that is being updated even better. WBWL is a trope, but I don't mind a story having that element. Thanks for any recommendations!


** Can't believe no one has responded to you yet. Give me a minute to find some links.

** Okay, here are 3 really great (relatively recent) fics, and my own (figured since nobody was replying, some self-promotion was in order):

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.
