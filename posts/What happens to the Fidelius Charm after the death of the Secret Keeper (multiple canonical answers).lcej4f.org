I was surprised by [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110806065319/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_poll.cfm][this answer by JKR]] Although this answer was captured on August 6, 2011 (so it is a way post-canon), it rather sharply contradicts with the canon. Interesting.


** She seems to have started actually re-reading what she wrote when she turned to the newer Pottermore because she follows the books here (same article from when it was called Pottermore):

#+begin_quote
  If the Secret Keeper dies, anyone to whom he or she has confided the information will become a Secret Keeper. This could involve many people, any of whom might be more willing to share the secret.

** In the books, anyone who's been told the secret then becomes the secret keeper in turn.

*** And even with that there is a problem. The Fidelius charm was active at the Potters, even if all who where in the know became Secret Keepers. Who told Harry ? Or who told the wizarding world at large ?

**** Except in that instance it wasn't the Secret Keeper that died, but rather the subject of the secret that did. I think the charm itself broke/dissolved/whatever the moment that Voldemort, who had been told the secret of where the Potters were living by Wormtail, murdered James Potter.

***** Would not Harry be part of the secret that the Fidelius was supposed to protect ? If the subject of the secret was the Potters, Harry is a Potter.

****** I was more thinking that the Fidelius was broken by the act of betrayal by Pettigrew, which was cemented the moment that Voldemort killed James.

******* Interesting theory. It depends on whenever the Fidelius charm is powered by the fidelity between the secret to be kept and the secret keeper.

******** I think it does, partly because of the name of the charm itself being derived from the word 'fidelity'. It feel like it's very strongly implying that the magic behind the Fidelius Charm only works so long as the one entrusted with the secret remains loyal to the secret being kept hidden. Once that loyalty ends/is broken/whatevs, the charm loses it's power source.

***** That would be true, if after the death of the Secret Keeper not only those in the know at the time of the death become secret keepers, but all people that forward in time were informed by those secret keepers became also secret keepers. Or there is not such transitivity. For Hermione to be able to tell Harry, would need for her to be also secret keeper. No the only way is that the Fidelius has been taken down.

****** Probably and my memory is a bit fuzzy but isn't it common knowledge that the Potter's were buried at Godric's Hollow? So at the very least they knew that they were in Godric's Hollow

It probably was taken down though

** Also an interesting thing from that link - it sounds like the Fidelius just prevents the people from sharing the secret. It doesn't sound like it stops anyone else from knowing it, just 'divulging' it.

** Isnt there also a bit where they say that the charm breaks when the subjects of the charm die? Like at Godrics Hollow, Lily and James were the subjects of charm (not harry? maybe he was too young to count). So when they died the charm broke. But at grimmauld the charm was reapplied after sirius died (they had evacuated for fear of discovery after his death).

When dumbledore died, everyone who had been told the secret also became secret keepers and could tell others. When the trio were coming back from the ministry in book 7 they brought a death eater with them, and gave him the secret. But I think there was an error when hermione said that he would then be able to bring others into the house. Even though the death eater now had the secret, he shouldn't have been able to give it to anyone else. couldn't they just have obliviated him and called it good (or does the secret stay even after oblivation?). That slip always bothered me.
