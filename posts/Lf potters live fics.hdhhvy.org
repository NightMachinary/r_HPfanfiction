Looking for good living potters fics. Preferably that focus on Harry's POV. Romance is a plus as that's my preferred fic choice


** Here is one where Lily lives.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

There's another one that I can't think of the name off the top of my head, set during the Tri-Wizard tournament, where the stasis-bubble they were in collapses when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet. Lily, James, a son and a daughter. It turns out Harry was actually a golem all along but still has to compete.

  “Heard from the pup lately?” “Got a letter from him just this morning, actually. He's doing well, his Potions class is more tolerable after my subtle intervention, and there are some new friends he's considering asking over during the summer hols next year,” Lily said with a smile. “That all sounds good,” Sirius remarked, carrying a couple plates and a handful of silverware into the dining room. “But what's this about you and *subtle* intervention? The way I heard it, you sent Snape a Howler, and somehow got it to him right in the middle of breakfast at the Great Hall.”

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

**** That's a different one. In the one I'm thinking of, they did it on purpose, leaving him behind to take the heat while they hid. They do things like cut him off from "his" vault and make him give the cloak back, because "he's not really a Potter." At the end he sacrifices himself because the Triwizard Cup was filled with erumpet fluid.

**** I'm loving it. The tension between James and Harry, James and Sirius is great, as is the general kick-assery. And brothers reconnecting with brothers. Don't really care for the Ambrose storyline right now, but we'll see where it goes. Right now I'm really looking forward to Neville rescuing Pansy and kicking his parents' collective ass for imprisoning her when he offered her sanctuary in the name of House Longbottom.

***** Honestly, I just finished reading up to the current chapter and that whole bit with Neville's parents slightly ruined it for me. Like it just seems so... off. There's no solid reason for it, and it's now honestly diving into the area that I despise so much: making "master manipulator" Dumbledore into an absolute idiot.

****** I don't think he's being an idiot, so much as he hasn't given up on his plans and keeps reshuffling his cards to try to make his play still work, even though somebody trumped his ace. The thing about canon Dumbledore is that he was so sure he was right that he didn't even bother to tell anybody else what was going on, because it wasn't a democracy and only he knew best. The man actively hoarded knowledge and refused to share it. He was, in his own mind, the person best suited to make all the important decisions. This fic, so far, hasn't really deviated from that.

******* The whole reveal of Potters but still sticking to his original plan makes sense, but this whole deal with the Longbottoms, and completely alienating Harry instead of at least cooperating for information, is just stupid. There was absolute zero reason to keep hiding them. And his side even admits that Harry will be a powerful issue, one that they actually have the chance of somewhat getting along with simply by being a wee bit nicer, but nope. Let's rage.

******** To be fair, the Longbottom reveal definitely didn't go the way they wanted. It happened neither at the time nor in the manner that they had planned, all because Augusta's patronus calling her grandson home went to both boys. They're scrambling, but Dumbledore being stubborn and, again, so adamant that he's RIGHT, he doesn't yet see a reason to reevaluate his overall plan.
