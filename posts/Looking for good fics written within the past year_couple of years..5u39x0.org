I read most of the good fics from back in the day, but recently I've gotten back into fanfiction but have been having trouble finding good new fics, the best I've read recently are "Worthy of Magic" by Sage Ra and "The Art of Self-Fashioning"" by Lomonaaeren. Thanks in advance.


** You are coming back at the right time. IMO, last two years were the best time to read HP fanfictions. A disproportionate number of my favorites were completed during that time. Using 1/1/2015 as the cut off date, here are some really good ones that are complete:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is by far the most popular fic on this sub. I won't spoil too much, just read it and enjoy!

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is an excellent rewrite of the canon story in a very different AU. I like it so much that I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][quite long description]] of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a superb dark!Harry story. It depicted a dystopian post Voldemort magical Britain in which the old regime betrayed Harry and his friends, so that they decided to fight back, with any means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and its expansion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076644/1/The-World-of-The-Accidental-Animagus][The World of The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(12076644;9863146), are great in world building. Readers actually got to see what happened outside Britain, and Year 3 plot was brilliant and very original. Both good and bad guys have been beefed up significantly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), also does a great job in world building. In this AU, Dumbledore was cool, Dursleys were trying hard, Fudge was reasonable, Hermione was effective, Lockhart wasn't a fraud, Umbridge wasn't nearly that bad, but Voldemort was utterly terrifying.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is written by the same author as "Patron". It's another extreme AU where a very cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and had ruled magical Britain for the next 20 years. But Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione. This fic is my favorite Ron/Hermione romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), has Dumbledore taking the aftermath of CoS a little more seriously. What followed is a delight to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), is written by the same author of "Petrification Proliferation". Here, the government of UK took a bigger interest in what happened in magical world. Chapters 5 and 6 are for great laughs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), is a surprisingly good crime/mystery fic. It describes a Voldemort free AU and Bellatrix as a cynical auror/detective, until she met Hermione.

--------------

Several very interesting fics were first published during past two years and are still in progress:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), is the sequel to "The Accidental Animagus". That story is getting better and better, combined with humor and suspense. Draco's character development is one of the best I've seen among HP fanfics. The bad guys are scary and yet their interactions are hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is a super hilarious variation of the 'Read the Books' trope, and is has its own plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has the Ministry selling out Muggleborns to appease Voldemort after Year 4. One Year later, Hermione formed a Muggleborn guerrilla group and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and their sympathizers. But Voldemort also had some terrible tricks up his sleave. This fic is already 426k words long, and has still a long way to go, [[/spoiler][despite Voldemort being already defeated]]. Combat scenes and political intrigues are very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684), has canon Ron reborn in a different universe. He faced great challenges because almost all key female characters were taking on very different, if not inverted, roles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], a Star Wars crossover. This story is a SG1 crossover and features heavily on the theme of civilization/empire building. Seeing Hermione and Luna wielding light-sabers and throwing Sith-lightening was quite fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is a pretty good 'Ginny in the world of Fire and Ice' fic. Generally speaking, HP magic was overpowered for that world, but it's fun to read curb-stomps from time to time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me]], linkffn(11111990), is IMO the best romance I've read in this fandom.

*** As many great things I've heard about Grow Young With Me, I can't bring myself to read it since I can't deal with the premise. Not that the premise is outlandish or awful; it's quite interesting and realistic. But I don't like reading Harry/anyone but Ginny and not only is this that but it also sets it up in a gut wrenching fashion. Plus I assume as some point I'll be bawling like a baby when that inevitable scene comes up that makes Harry understand it's ok to move on.

**** I normally feel that way too but they way the author handles Ginny and Harry's love is beautifully done. I love Ginny - she is by far my favorite character - and the author still captures her spirit and impact on the family without her presence.

I really recommend even to strong Hinny fans to give it a read.

***** I did read a bunch of it and it was good, no doubt about it.

Perhaps what it comes down to is I like to believe in the magic of their relationship in the context of the world Rowling created. I don't quite like imagining Harry and Ginny as a normal, real world couple. In the real world, people unfortunately lose the love of their lives too soon, but then eventually find a new love of their lives. In the real world, there really isn't just one person for everyone.

But in Rowling's world, I like to imagine that these two people belong to each other and no one else. That Ginny first got with Harry because it was inevitable, not that she was tired of Dean and happened to be single when Harry was. It allows be to accept that even after only dating for a few weeks, Harry did love her and that Ginny would wait for him. I just don't like reading about a world where Harry could go through that pain of losing her, after everything he's been through, and then wind up with someone else he winds up loving just as much. Again, not saying it isn't realistic, or that it makes it a bad story, just with all the stories out there, I choose not to read the ones where I don't like the basic premise.

But certainly if you don't have the hangups that I do, give the story a read as lots of people really like it.

Oh, also, since we know for a fact that there is an afterlife in the wizarding world, how would that work when Harry dies if his new love interest dies first. Who does he go to in the afterlife or is Ginny cool with sharing her relationship?

****** The first story sets up the crossover, and is centered on the canon Harry Potter world. I think you'd like that. The second story features Alec Mack, but is set in the same world as "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who lived", and features the trio as well, so you'd probably like it. Though it has a lot of cameos of all sorts. Third story shows more from the verses visited in the first story, usually alternates of the main cast.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** One of the best, recent fics that was completed almost exactly a year ago is "Not From Others."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others]]

It's a "Deathly Hallows Hogwarts" fic, not unlike "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness," only far better. The characters are far more true to their canon selves; the tone is roughly in-line with the original books; the style works for the most part; the pacing doesn't drag unless it's an acute plot point (Ginny's bored out of her skull staying at Auntie Muriel's, for example); the Battle of Hogwarts is simply superb.

** Do you like crossovers? *Of course you like crossovers.* Even if you don't...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][*Child of the Storm*]] linkffn(8897431), a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, asks the question of "what if James Potter was just Thor in a human's body?" and then constructs a world with so many layers and moving parts it's extraordinary. Even better: it's complete it currently has a WIP sequel. Do be warned though, it takes a few chapters for the story to fully find its legs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][*The Black Prince*]] linkffn(11098283), a crossover with Game of Thrones, has Harry 'reborn' as sorts (it hasn't quite explained what's going on yet) as the second son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. While this is definitely Harry, he's also molded by his life in Westeros - and the world adapts to his presence. Currently ongoing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10199392/1/Early-Retirement][*Early Retirement*]] linkffn(10199392) and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11510638/1/What-Happened-Between][*What Happened Between*]] linkffn(11510638), crossovers with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, are a play on BOTH a female!Harry, and Master-of-Death!Harry and how that fits into the Marvel universe. Oh, and this Harry has issues resulting from the fact she can't die. Don't read the third story in the trilogy, pretend it ends with 'What Happened Between.'

Now, this one isn't TECHNICALLY a crossover...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home*]] linkffn(9860311) might as well be a crossover with /The Once and Future King/ and a few other stories. It's simply a beautiful read, and is really an exercise by the author in exploring different cultures and having the female Harry interact with them. Still a WIP but very easy to walk away from and not be totally devastated there isn't more.

These aren't crossovers, but please don't hold that against me:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064) deals with the post-Deathly Hallows world under the assumption that Harry (along with everyone else) developed some massive issues along the way that didn't get addressed. From Harry's point of view it's pretty black and white, but it's obvious the world is operating under shades of grey. Nobody was innocent, some just reacted worse than others. It sort of peters out at the end, but still comes to a heavily satisfying conclusion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][*Vitam Paramus*]] linkffn(9444529) is a MASSIVE slow burn romance between a very realistically portrayed Quidditch star Harry, and Gabrielle Delacour. Seriously, Harry might as well be Cristiano Ronaldo with magic in this. Until it's epilogue was posted I wouldn't have recommended it as it was left with one of the more unsatisfying conclusions. The epilogue gave the fic, and its readers, the release needed.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn?

Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

** Unfortunately some of these fics aren't completed.Still, these are some of my favourites.

'Reign of the Serpent', linkffn(9783012) It's an AU set in a world where Salazar Slytherin has imposed a caste system based on Blood Purity (and has been ruling for 1000 years). Harry and Hermione, the main characters, are very different to Canon Harry and Hermione, so I tend to imagine them as OCs. Nevertheless, the fic is fantastic (very well written) and I adore the world building. (Incomplete)

'Not Fade Away', linkffn(11648754) I really enjoyed [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] by the same author and found myself enjoying this fic as well. It's a Marauders Era fic that focuses on several characters (Lily, Sirius etc.) and the climate at school during the war. (Incomplete)

'Let Perpetual Light', linkffn(12001201) I feel like this fic doesn't get enough attention considering it's quite possible the best written fanfiction I've read. It tells the story of Gellert's time in Godric's Hollow and Ariana's death. It also has a fascinating take on the Hallows, and is surprisingly consistent (it's written prior to the release) with what has been alluded to in Fantastic Beasts. Gellert is also very well characterised. (Complete)

'Put Your Guns Away it's Tea Time', linkffn(12096051) I don't know if you've read Cursed Child, but this is written to be consistent with Cursed Child canon. Nonetheless, it barely alludes to the events of the Cursed Child and is a very good story. It's well written and I personally enjoyed it. (Complete)

** No good fics these past couple years. The SJW movements have caused a slew of keyboard warriors to push out "women empowerment" Hermione-centric fics, where she is essentially a mary-sue that makes ignorant changes in the wizarding world, and suddenly it becomes a utopia that defeats the entire purpose of the books.

Worthy of Magic just felt like a sap fest, the author always wants to complicate something. First it's in the story "Harry Potter and The Elemental's Power" where Dark Magic suddenly fuels an ancient primordial being, so Harry can't use it. Then there's this story where Harry is an apathetic loser that thinks about killing every person he meets.

The Art of Self-Fashioning was decent, but I feel it turning some type of way at this point, and I dislike it. Harry will naturally have the 'group of friends' that he suddenly tells everything to, etc... I honestly feel that so many fics had amazing potential, but Harry is so unnecessarily extroverted in all of them. I'm amazed at how he never has to deal with social issues, especially since most of these fics have him being abused early in life.
