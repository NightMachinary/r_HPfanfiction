It's always Harry and/or Hermione going back, let's make it somebody else!

I'd just love to see everyone's faces when Neville shows up in third or fourth year completely changed. Gone is the skittish push over, in his place is the hardened warrior and survivor that stared Voldemort down and made him his bitch!

It would also be neat to see his father's wand choose and start working for him because his mental state completely changed.

Can you imagine if he just woke up in the middle of the ministry battle and started kickin death eater ass? He sees Bellatrix and goes off, and just destroys her, in turn saving Sirius.

Idk, Neville is such an underutilized character to me. He's either Ron's replacement or just not there. We need more Neville centric fics!


** He hides in the Room of Requirement, only going out in a cloak and mask, making sure certain events play out. Hermione is on his trail though, until she finally discovers the masked stranger's whereabouts.

The door to his hiding spot opens. She finds a room filled with clocks and chalkboards full of dates...
