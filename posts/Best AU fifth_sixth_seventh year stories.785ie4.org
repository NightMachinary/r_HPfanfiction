I love reading fics that speculate on what could've happened in the books. These years particularly interest me. Any year works, the more the better. I'm not exactly looking for anything that changes canon hugely, and it's also preferable if it retains the canon couples. Any fics like this?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has a very AU plot after Year 4, but keeps pairings canon. The good guys waged total war against their enemies after Year 5, but facing them was a significantly more dangerous Voldemort.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I've read a number of those, but they're mostly SSHG. Some of them follow canon quite closely, with the fic's events added in between the events described in canon. I tend to regard them as a sort of supplementary canon.
