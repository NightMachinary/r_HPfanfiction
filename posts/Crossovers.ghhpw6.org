Do you guys know any Harry Potter crossovers that are set in like the real world? where the others have to learn about magic and adjust to protect Harry? I've found two.

Harry/Hawaii five-0 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/305409]] (currently reading)\\
and\\
Harry/criminal minds [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7378531]] (FREAKING LOVED THIS ONE)

I would really like to read more like them.
