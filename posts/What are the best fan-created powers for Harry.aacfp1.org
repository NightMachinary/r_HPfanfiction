Learning from goblins that he's a Shadow Mage, only for it to have no plot relevance. Casting a patronus that destroys dementors. Looping back in time when he dies. Smelling girls' periods. Being able to do literally anything, because no one told him it wasn't possible. Truly, the imagination of the fandom's authors knows no bounds.

What are the most epic and badass powers you've seen Harry wield? The most interesting and original? Maybe something that seems underwhelming at first, but is surprisingly useful given a little creativity?


** I've always had a soft spot for Hate from Deprived. I know it's basically a derivation of Alphonse from FMA, but I've never seen the idea executed as well as it was in Deprived. It truly felt like an unstoppable knight forged in eldritch ways infused with the hatred of a boy.

*** And Hate had a big, glaring weakness. That's the point where authors really fall short when giving HP powers that sometimes have no counters or weaknesses.

The HP in Deprived also lost something else, as we see in numerous instances where he goes completely blank for a few moments from time to time.

**** Yup, it felt like as strong as he was and as OP as he seemed, he had very clear weaknesses as a person. I think Harry at one point said “All power comes with sacrifice.”

I was so looking forward to what it would all build up to, but alas I'll never know.

****** +Haha NBWL, not WBWL for this one. Neville is the chosen one in that one, set in stone. At least that's what I gather the author intended. Not to nitpick, but I'm a personal fan of NBWL.+

+It's kinda weird how WBWL became so tropey and then NBWL emerged as an answer to the tropeyness.+

EDIT: IGNORE EVEYTHING I JUST SAID, I was thinking of a different fic I was reading currently.

You are completely right, well written despite the tropes.

** I don't recall the name or author of the story, but I remember reading a fic years ago that featured a pre-Hogwarts Harry who developed a rare magical gift resulting from extreme abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. His shadow gained a sort of sapience - it could move on its own to unlock his cupboard door, steal him food, or keep him company. As Harry grew, his shadow's abilities expanded and he found he could control other shadows (although I don't recall to what extent).

​

I specifically liked it because Harry's enhanced abilities were beautifully rationalized by the author. Many (but not all) wizards had the /innate potential/ to control shadows, however only those who suffered years-long abuse as young children could develop the ability. It had something to do with the shadow wanting to help its sad, scared, lonely master. I recall that such a power hadn't been seen in England in decades, and that there was a number of Holocaust survivors who developed the ability back in the 40s.

​

I also liked it because Harry wasn't over-powered and because of the ramifications when Dumbledore etc. realized how much Harry must have suffered as a child.

​

Does anyone know the name of this?

*** Could it be that other not-so-famous fic by The Santi? In it Harry also had some shadowrelated stuff/control due to the abuse faced in his youth, and when it was explained why the power was so rare it was mentioned that it stopped showing up after childprotection laws became the norm...Might not be it since it's so long ago i read it and I remember very little of it.

** Personally, I'm a huge fan of A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]) and it's sequels. Over a decade old, but it really cemented my ideas about blood magic, thread magic and a few others. Still stands as a real, solid piece of writing.

For the adrenaline rush, heart pounding excitement of "FUCK YEAH!", nothing (for me at least) competes with Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/]]) Because an Astartes Inquisitor in Power Armor just makes me happy.

It's worth noting that in both of these fic's, the threat level of the BBG(s) was scaled up appropriately to still be a factor, as opposed to some of the OP curbstomp fic's that I occasionally indulge in.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I personally love the system of the Horsemen in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse), it's probably one of my favorite fics and it kills me that it's abandoned.

** The Animamagus from Swordchucks Dancing With Myself, the ability to devour souls and soul fragments to gain knowledge, any potions drunken are recreatable with just a thought, which means blood replenishing potions, bone mending/Skele-grow, Muscle stretcher, polyjuice(although you need to drink a new potion for EACH form), Felix Felicis and anything else can be instantly called upon at the thought of 'I need some X'

Runic Tattoos and accessories, initially from Runic Animagi and then Later A Third Path to the Future. People always look for ways to physically make Harry imposing for things like Crossovers and the like and I always think you have the ambiguous magic of Runes right there. Give Harry some cool full body tattoos, earrings, bracelets, glasses (Runes up and down the legs and on the frame), rings, basically anything like that makes me giddy mostly because they were thought of and gives the author fun gadgets to play with or ways around plain old shitty problems.

I've had a really interesting way of altering the invisibility Cloak to make it more useful and interesting that a weird Cloak that spends most of its time in a pocket

** There's a series where the power he knows not is access to this power called the emerald trance. Makes his magic overcharged. I think he had to get angry to activate it.

** In the R series by Greengecko, Harry slowly develops the ability of the raw manipulation of dark magic and later even the soul. Now it sounds cool and all, but the best part is that it's introduced slowly and it serves the plot -- i.e it begins with curse sense, curse negation and grows to horcrux destruction, "squelching" (exploding a curse as it generates, possibly killing the caster). Later Harry learns how to open portals to the underworld, summoning and controlling demonic creatures, learns how to cure werewolves and even heals the Longbottoms, by unravelling the dark magic.

** It's been so long since I read it so I can't remember the name. If anyone knows please link it. But there was a fic I read that had Harry become a vampire. Other than the typical vampire abilities he was able to transform into a panther (possibly other animals as well) and he could create magical guns (I think they shot Reductors).
