they haven't reread the books in years, and are terribly confused what is canon, movies and fanon.


** They've only read hp fanfic for years and years and keep trying to do stuff that the fandom has made up. Also, they're very confused because Daphne is so completely different from anything they've seen in fanfic.

** I just imagine them writing out everything they know filling a notebook or something and trying to figure out what's canon.

** This had a little of that in the beginning, with the fan confusing HP with D&D and LOTR, but then that part petered out and it got less fun.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
