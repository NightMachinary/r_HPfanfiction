So, I'm trying to find a fanfiction with the United States in it, even if it's just tangentially mentioned (like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]]), where the American wizarding society doesn't give a shit about the ICW, or the Statute of Secrecy, or any of that.

I want wizards who embrace the 2nd Amendment, like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], selling wands to whoever can pay. I want CIA operators with invisibility cloaks and apparition. An NSA armed with the ability to plant listening charms.

Screaming bald-eagles that are actually transfigured nuclear weapons, being dropped out of magically enhanced, silent F-16s.


** In the 1920s, US Wizarding World was very isolationist and tried to segregate themselves as much as possible from the Muggles: [[https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en]]

But then again, Muggle US was also very isolationist at that time, and racial segregation was enforced until 1960s.

Lots of things might have changed since then.

Maybe the ascendence of US to superpower status had something to do with Magicals? Maybe the USSR fell apart because it ran afoul of Magicals? Maybe China's recent resurgence had something to do with them regaining favors from the Magicals? Maybe the loss of the British Empire had something to do with lack of cooperation from its own Magicals?

The possibilities are endless. These are all topics writers can exploit.

*** I could see something with WW2 and FDR strong arming the magicals to help. And the young magical a that got shipped off to war forged strong bonds with the regular GIs and lead to a stronger relationship. I can see FDR as being that forceful personality to do that. Look at Executive order 666 from that time period as well.

** I was reading a fic that had been apparently abandoned until just recently that features an American transfer to Hogwarts as one of the central characters. I had subscribed to it a year ago and in the last few days the author updated it with a new chapter. Doesn't sound at all like what you're talking about though, just a slight correlation.
