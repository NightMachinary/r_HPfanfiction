** I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1762337/1/This-Time-Around][This Time Around]] on my 'want to read list'. It's a Lupin/Hermione Time turner fic so it has a good chance of filling your criteria. You could check it out if you like.

I've also read The Last Marauder and I enjoyed it quite a bit! I am hoping that the above story will be something along the same vein.

It's so funny, because time travel is my favorite trope for Snape/Hermione fics and I have read quite a few but unfortunately, I haven't run across any that feature her as a 5th Marauder (or I can't remember is probably more accurate).

**** Certainly! I have a few I can recommend. :)

Note: Some of these fics are on sites that may require you to login to read.

My favorites:

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] is a fan favorite, although I really didn't care for it all that much.

Others that deal with time travel/de-aging but aren't your standard Hermione goes back 20 yrs to the past fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5352726/1/Second-Time-Around][Second Time Around]] - Snape is de-aged during the canon timeline

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17758][For All Intents and Purposes]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3460114/1/Times_Fool][Time's Fool]] (Good story, but I liked the above two better)

I hope you find a few to enjoy! :)

***** Oh I would have to remember. I re-read the one recommended here (This time around) which was nice, not great, but nice.

I actually use to have a website dedicated to this ship, back in 2005, you know, when Geocities was around. God I had a forum and everything. Here's a list that was the "must read" but I haven't read them since then, so if they are terrible, I apologize. Now you have me all nostalgic so I shall re-read!

"++ Maybe Someday ++ A Time Before Tears ++ There's a Place ++ Before the Moon Rises ++ The Dark Side of the Moon ++ Plain Cloths"

Ones that I referenced back then,

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8706050/1/The-Lost-Lupin]]

*The Lupins fear Greyback's revenge will not stop with Remus, but might spread to his little sister Hermione. They make an unorthodox decision to protect their daughter without telling their son. Remus has been looking for his sister ever since. Time travel, AU, EWE, NON-CANON SHIPS (underline this bit 8,000 times), etc. Please see warnings.*

The "pairing" here is Sirius/Hermione/James and there /is/ some action between James and Sirius, but it is quite a nice fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]]

*Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.*

Pairing here is Hermione/Sirius, though there is some Lucius/Hermione action as well.

** I love these, too. I see lots of recs with Remus or Snape, but hardly any Sirius. Any Sirius recs?

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1983652/1/Out-of-Time][Out of Time]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2404842/1/Shattered-Moments][Shattered Moments]] are Hermione/Sirius, and excellent.

"Hermione's got a convenient new thing called a timeturner that lets her get to classes in third year. But suddenly, a message from herself has her housing a known convict, and it's not so convenient anymore...And for every small change, there is another, and another, and another... Hermione goes into fourth year with a misbehaving timeturner and the knowledge that there is a dark future to prevent."
