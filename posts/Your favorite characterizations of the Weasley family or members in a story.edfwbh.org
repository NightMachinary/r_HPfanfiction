So, I absolutely love the Weasley family, they are my favorite family in the Wizarding World, so many people love to bash them though, or at least Molly, Ginny, Percy and Ron.

So, what are your favorite characterizations of either the entire family or certain members in a story?

The Weasley family can be a major part of the story, or a more minor part, or anywhere in between.

Little to no bashing please.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be as canon or as AU as possible.

*** Loved it! The chaos of the Weasley family and the humor was well done.

If anyone knows any more stories in this kind of whelm, let me know!

** This is a fun portrayal of the chaos of a big family:

Here's some twin angst:

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office. These characters are the property of J.K. Rowling.First Place Winner in the Honorary Marauder category in the Shrieking Shack Society's 2018 Marauder Medals. Thanks to everyone who voted!

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I'm wracking my brains trying to come up with something but I can't think of anything. Probably because I only really read Harry/Hermione fics and those always bash the Weasleys. It's making me want to write a Harmony story that actually treats that family well for a change. Hmm...
