Here's an excerpt from my [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578715902][new techno-thriller]]:

/There was a sparse but steady flow of cars coming back from Half Moon Bay on Highway 92 and, like her, most of them merged onto highway 280 south. It was probably best that Pari was lying on the floor. A clearly intoxicated, lolling young woman leaning her face against a car window would draw attention. At least she was fully dressed. Benita noted that the red stockings were in fine shape, no tears or runs, no stains or smudges, not even a drop of blood that she could see. Lights along the freeway shone on her intermittently, creating momentary vignettes of a young woman on the floor, leaning against a seat. The close-fitting dress draped on her as if she was in a fashion photo shoot with a kidnapped ingénue theme, and a team of assistants had made sure that her clothing was carefully staged for maximum effect./

/Benita twiddled her fingers and started a call to Wilkins through a special app that was encrypted and supposedly misrepresented itself in various ways to the outside world./

/“Yes?” said his voice./

/“I'm coming by with Pari. She happened to be there. I should download at your place. I'll need some help with her.” It had better be encrypted, anyway./

/“Brad mentioned it. We'll be waiting,” he said calmly, after a moment's pause./

I've got some free ebooks for whoever wants to read the rest of the book. Here are a few:

*** Sorry about that. I stupidly did not think about what "HP" meant.
