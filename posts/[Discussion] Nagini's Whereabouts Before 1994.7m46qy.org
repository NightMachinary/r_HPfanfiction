Assuming that she /was/ already serving Voldemort before 1981, rather than following the fan-theory that they met in Albania, where would you say Nagini spent the thirteen years between Voldemort's disappearance and his resurfacing in 1994? How did Voldemort and Pettigrew even find her then, for that matter, before they brought her to the Riddle House?


** I always felt that she was a snake that Voldemort periodically possessed in Albania when being incorporeal got to be too much for him and had Wormtail bring back to England with them.

*** That's just a fan-theory, and as I said in the OP I don't really like it --- I find it more satisfying to think that Nagini has served Voldemort for practically as long as he's been a Dark Lord, than to have her be a relatively new minion in the 1990's. Gives more time for Voldemort to come to trust her more than any other creature in the world and entrust her the secret of his Horcruxes, y'know?

** Obviously, she was the snake at the zoo that Harry let out. After that, she just waited patiently in the Riddle mansion for her master knowing her would return.

Actually I have no idea. I personally think she was more or less a snake Voldemort picked out to serve him after he came back.

** maybe they created her. If you can create a basilisk with a chicken egg and a toad, surely there is a simple way to create other magical snakes.

*** An interesting angle. I kinda still prefer to think she was already serving Voldemort pre-1981 either way, though, so that leaves the question of where she was open.

** Watch SuperCarlinBrothers theory for Fantastic Beasts 2, the one about the Maledictus.

*** Watched it, and, huh.........

- They overanalyze "maledictus". "Maledictus" is based on the same root as the French word for "curse", "malediction", and has nothing to do with Taboos or Parseltongue.

- The word 'Nagini' /can/ mean half-snake-half-woman, but it simply means "female snake" in Sanskrit (Nagin means female snake in /Hindi/). Not at all convinced Rowling was looking any farther than that.

- Yes, Nagini is a magical snake. So what? There are lots of magical snakes who /didn't/ use to be people.

- "In essence divided" /obviously/ refers to the Horcrux inside her.

- Nagini is long-lived, but she's a /magical/ species of snake. Remember that Basilisk live even longer.

Overall not a fan of the theory. I /can/ believe that this character may be Maledicted to turn into a snake someday, but why would that snake have to be Nagini?
