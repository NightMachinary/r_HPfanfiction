Of course, as a preface, I'm not talking about the fics that solely focus on making Harry, "Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Peverell-Slytherin-Myrddin" with a harem of twenty highly attractive witches who are all eager to share his fourteen-year old--and saturated with testosterone--body while Harry outsmarts that "manipulative old coot" and shoves those lemon drops up Dumbledore's "Greater Good."

However, I do find that I really enjoy the fanfics that have Harry as the "Heir to Peverell" or some other bloodline and have him utilize those blood-line related talents and better himself. For instance, I read a fanfic a while back that classified Harry as the "Heir of Slytherin" and had him focus on learning parselmagic--essentially healing but with more "ssss" sounds. I guess I really like the "Powerful, and Competent Harry" trope and I suppose that having Harry focussing on a specific skill or talent is pretty cool. What do y'all think?

***** Hmm, good question! For me, I would say that I've seen parselmagic (offensive and passive), natural legilimency/mind-magic (could explain why Harry was garbage at occluding), elemental manipulation, absorption, polylinguist-esque abilities, wandless manipulation, death magic (really esoteric Peverell stuff lol), and of course, metamorphic abilities being passed down. And one of the requirements a lot of authors made for gaining a natural talent was having a certain amount/strength in magic that would allow the normally recessive traits to pop up.

So, for instance, I once read a fic that talked about the natural skill in mind-magics from the Peverell family and how, even though so many bloodlines descend from them, you needed a specific amount/potency of magic for the trait to re-appear. So, since Tom Riddle had the most potent magic seen in generations and was a descendent of the Peverell family, the ability was passed down to him. And with Harry, seeing as he was "the Dark Lord's Equal," and a descendent of the Peverells, the ability passed on to him. Pretty neat imo.

I'd say that parselmagic, mind-magics, metamorphic abilities, and elemental manipulation are the most common. Personally, I really like the concept of elemental manipulation and mind-magics. Hbu?

******* Sure! I'll have to look through my history for a couple lol. Here's just a few that come to mind that talk about natural talents. BTW I'm not sure if these are all about bloodlines tho--some might just be inherited talents without going into the bloodline at all:

The Mind Arts by Wu-gang

Honor Thy Blood by TheBlack's Resurgence (the author has some very good stories that have focus on inherited talents)

Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence

*/Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes/* by /Peeves' best friend/ (it's been a while since I've read this one so I don't quite remember how good it was but it comes to mind when thinking of elemental stuff)

*/Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power/* by /Sage Ra/ (I don't know if it's any good but it was recommended to me)

*/A Second Coming/* by /Icarius51/ (also recommended so no clue what it's like)

Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin

Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe (not sure if it's a bloodline related fanfic but it goes deeply into old magics so maybe interesting)

*/The Merging/* by /Shaydrall/ (inherited power so interesting)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]] (This one is Time Travel and heavilllyyy focussed on bloodlines)

*/More Than Equal/* by /Ordinarily Prudent/

I'll check for some "heir" fics in my history later on and can then recommend some of the better ones I've read. A lot of heir fics usually pop up in unusually pairings so it's hard to remember a particular "heir" story. For instance, I'm. blanking on the name, but I read a story where Harry was destined to collect the Deathly Hallows as the Heir to Peverell and thus had a lot of control over necromancy. For now, these are some good inherited/natural talents fanfics. I especially like The Mind Arts, and TheBlack's Resurgence's work.

** It's an interesting idea, but even in the one solid fic that uses it more than what already is in canon (Parseltongue, blood curses), it ends up being executed lazily because only Harry gets it (Out of the Night by Raining Ink, the fic, unfortunately, was abandoned but it honestly is the best execution of many cliches).

Give everyone their inherited magic powers. That would be an interesting part of worldbuilding and not just a plot device to power up Harry.

*** Agreed, it's difficult to get this trope to work. I rather like this one concept where these specific magical powers are recessive and come from old bloodlines, but you need a certain amount of magical potency and some fresh DNA in the gene pool to get them to pop up.

For instance, I once read a fic that talked about the natural skill in mind-magics from the Peverell family and how, even though so many bloodlines descend from them, you needed a specific amount/potency of magic for the trait to re-appear. So, since Tom Riddle had the most potent magic seen in generations and was a descendent of the Peverell family, the ability was passed down to him. And with Harry, seeing as he was "the Dark Lord's Equal," and a descendent of the Peverells, the ability passed on to him.

You could also make a case for it in canon. Riddle is descended from an ancient and powerful bloodline that hasn't had a powerful heir in centuries. With the new blood from Riddle Snr. and Tom's inherent magical power, he inherited the gift of Natural Legilimency. Another example could be Tonks who, while exceedingly young, held her own against Bellatrix Lestrange and was an uncommonly gifted Auror. With the renewal of the gene pool through Ted Tonks mixed with the ancient bloodline of House Black and her inherent magical talent, Tonks inherited metamorphic powers to an incredible extent. Just a thought, of course.

That fic had the premise that certain families were good at certain kinds of magic and taking on a new house (such as becoming their leige Lady or being adopted) could change your own natural affinity to that of your new house.

So, I think the Weasleys (or the Prewetts) might have been more inclined towards Charms in this instance, whereas the Blacks had a knack for curses. Ginny had some issues with her magic after becoming a black. I rather liked that fic. I hope it's continued since I last read it.

** If you're interested in reading about great power through hard work and talent - it's not inherited, but Harry is very talented at brewing potions, and single-mindedly passionate about them, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). (She also inherited Parseltongue, but finds that much less interesting.) I find that the story does a good job of balancing whatever power it gives her; her Parseltongue is a clue that might expose her true identity, her unusually large magical reserves attract unwanted attention from Tom Riddle wanting to mentor her (or the Diary wanting to permanently possess her), and even her drive to learn about Potions is what pushes her to enact the ruse and end up over her head.

It's a really original storyline, though it very neatly weaves in elements from both HP and the Song of the Lioness, with plenty of deadpan humour and high stakes without any character-bashing. Even Riddle is a complex character who is sometimes worthy of an "enemy of my enemy" team-up and turns out to have some partially sympathetic goals (force intermarrying with half-bloods to avert the effects of inbreeding and stop the population implosion) mixed with his genuinely bad ones (push Muggle cultural influences out of Wizarding society).

** You could try Passageways by Jerrway69. It's a Harry/Bellatrix time travel fic where Harry is from the Eveningshade family. A grey family known to bypass wards etc and kill any who attempt to harm their family. So Harry learns various family magics that he uses to put the "bad guys" down permanently.

The story is 277K+ words WIP that regrettably looks a abandoned.
