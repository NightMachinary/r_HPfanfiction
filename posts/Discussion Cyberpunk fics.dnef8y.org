As in, stories where the Muggle world (not the wizarding world) has advanced to cyberpunk levels of technology. This new technology works around magic, and is almost magic-like in and of itself. How might the story be different if, say, Hermione and other muggle-borns wore advanced neon cybernetics? Had plasma weapons, etc, etc. How might the Death Eaters and other purebloods react to all of this?


** Some random blood purist would go like this: This, this, utter bastardization of magic! How dare they, the inferior creatures, dare to interact with the force of magic? How! said death eater. Said death eater could also be seen using exploding curses on walls.

** It really would be interesting to see the conflict between traditional magic users and those who embrace technology. I think there would be a lot of older wizards who try and cling to the old ways of doing things, and I could see it being an arguement that Molly and Arthur often have; she's a firm traditionalist while he's open to the idea of using technology, and their children would fall somewhere between their opinions.

*** Honestly, if a war-like situation in this AU ever comes to pass, I don't think the traditionalist side would stand a chance. Unless you have some GREAT amounts of magic at your fingertips, no shield charm can block a plasma rife or plasma edged knife. The modernists would be probably win said improbable war in a couple of days.

*** I thought about what Shadowrun/ Harry Potter crossover fanfic could be, basically Ministry of Magic breaks The Masquerade restructures itself and joins Muggle Ministry as a branch of now unionised goverment, and there is huge culture shock for wizard and kind of metaphorical divide between wizards and rest of the world, even among other non-wand magic users.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

** What comes to mind (which is less cyberpunk and more tech based) is the kind of magic you see in the Irregular at Magic Highschool.

You've got the old school wizards and witches: wands and potions and runes. Then the new generation with magic on C.A.D.s and every spell centering around specific forms of tech.

** When I've thought Cyberpunk I've never really though 'high tech' as such.

Instead I just imagine a world where automated systems are important and dominate society and where the kind of manipulation of technical systems that was possible in the 80s, back when phone systems were hackable by whistling certain notes and computer viruses spread through diskettes. The era of the BBS.

The time period of Harry Potter fits better for such an element than today's era. The characters don't fit this though. I can't imagine Snape, for example, fiddling with phones or being on a BBS. That requires some kind of thirst for companionship or group belonging. Similarly, all the teachers are authority figures and the students themselves are too young.

*** One aspect of Cyberpunk that might fit well in the HP universe if one chose to explore it is all the body modification. Implants, guns for arms, hacking things by literally plugging yourself into them, etc, could be spells as tattoos, runic spells on piercings, "absorbing" a horcrux to have some simulacrum of an AI inhabiting you, etc. Wormtail is all like "fuck this hand, I'ma get me a magic one" so people who are really into that sort of Dark Arts shit could have ghost hands and Moody-eye style body modification out the bum.

I've been working on a Witcher crossover where Geralt spent some time in the Cyberpunk universe and he eventually takes on some magical body modification when he gets trapped in the HP world. It makes sense in my head since Witchers are basically a medieval form of super soldier who use mutagenic potions in a similar way, so implants wouldn't really bother him, and magically tattooing something stronger than the Quen sign to his body seems perfectly reasonable.

**** I suppose that's cyberpunk too. I think having a bunch of late phreakers in the early 2000s running into secret BBS's that wizards have been running for decades and getting into trouble with unknown dangerous adversaries could be fun though.
