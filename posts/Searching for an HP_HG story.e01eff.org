I'm searching for the story I read some time ago and don't remember the name. I don't remember many things from it, but i know that it was very fun and hilarious to read. Only part that I remember is whe some death eaters decide to attack Harry, Hermione and her parents, but her parents defend them with their guns along with Amelia Bones who used Piertotum Locomotor tu awaken Hermione's angel statues and one of them was Moai Statue that Hermione's Aunt gifted her. It was very fun to read and I remember Umbi-AHEM sorry Umbridge had the mental trauma after that.

Please if you know that story comment and let me know. I really want to re-read that story


** Googling “piertotum locomotor "moai" fanfiction” found this? Looks like Chapter 9 has the Madame Bones thing?

  Looking at the GoF Yule Ball as portrayed in canon and movie, one sees a dark bitter jealous side of Ronald Bilius that Hermione sums up in one sentence. "Ron, you spoil everything!" Harry remembers who believed him and chooses Hermione. And that changes Everything! Ron has another bad experience due to his greed, fears, jealousies and Snape!
