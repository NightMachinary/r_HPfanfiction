Write a response where muggles react realistically to Hermione trying to get guns in 90s UK. Points to keep in mind.

- Hermione cannot break the statute of secrecy
- She cannot tell the Prime Minister who then has the army supply her (no easy route here.)
- It's the 90s and the UK. No American gun laws
- Can include Ron and Harry
- Realistic accuracy for someone who has never fired a gun
- Doesn't just have to be firearms, can also be other suspicious items

Edit: I mean this as a humorous prompt. One idea I have going on is:

Hermione attracts the attention of the authorities as a bunch of gun dealers have cash with no paper trail to who bought the guns, so the government think she's some sort of criminal organization. Shenanigans happen.


** Travel to the continent. Confound the gunsmith in Switzerland. Buy the weapons you want. Get training using the same method.

Getting a gun or ten is really easy for a witch in the 90s once you can travel.

*** True.

I meant this as a humorous prompt, not a bashing one. I don't usually like the of muggle weapons in fics because logically it should lead to some sort of enchantment arms race, which really isn't given as much justice as I'd like.

But seriously, I had this idea when I reread deathly hallows and imagined them apparating all over the country trying to buy guns.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has all the logistics worked out:

- Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley contact mercenaries. Uncooperative ones get obliviated; follow up on suggestions from those cooperative.
- Sirius provides funding.
- Switzerland has very easy access to guns, and it takes only a few apparitions to get there.

  More importantly though was the fact that it was very easy to acquire - for a wizard. Practically every second Swiss man over twenty had one at home. There was no need to risk the black market for a Russian rifle of dubious origin and quality if you could simply confound a guy you met in a Swiss disco instead, and relieve him of the rifle at his home.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Meant the prompt as something humorous.

Book 7, the trio never leaves the country, and every fic with this plot device has Hermione suggest it.

** In summer 1997 (when the trio were planning their camping trip) the ban on handguns was new (dating from February that year) and not yet complete. I can't imagine it would be very difficult to confound/steal/obliviate.

** Frankly, I've yet to read a fic or watch a movie where injuries from gunshots are accurately portrayed. Guns are so more dangerous and so much more survivable (contradiction intended) than popular belief.
