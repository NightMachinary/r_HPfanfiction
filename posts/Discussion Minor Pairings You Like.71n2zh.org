Are there any minor pairings that for whatever strange reason you don't like? You might not even be able to explain why you like that pairing, but you do anyway?

Feel free to discuss those pairings, note no bashing the pairings that the person likes. If you don't like the pairing yourself that's fine, just no bashing/hating on the pairing someone else likes.

And if people end up having recommendations for that pairing for people feel free to suggest if you'd like. (Don't have to though).


** Narcissa/Remus - This just has so much potential.

Snape/Lily Doll - He's obsessed with her. There's no way he hasn't tried to fill that void.

Fudge/Umbridge - Nightmare fuel, I know, but it just works.

Sirius/Anything with tits - Womanizer!Sirius is just fun to read, if a little cliche.

Lily/harem - GodlikeHaremMaster!Harry has to get it from somewhere right? Also, I've taken a shine to BadassGenius!Lily.

Bill/Tonks - Much more acceptable age range and they seem like they would get along.

Ginny/Luna - Childhood friends reconnecting trope anyone?

Fem!Ron/Fem!Draco - Involves gender-flipping and blind dates. Have the twin's pranks gone too far?

**** It's hard to explain and kinda relies on Narcissa getting some extra character development. The way I see it playing out is sort of a parallel to Andromeda and Ted Tonks, but where Narcissa follows family obligations/expectations and marries Lucius rather than following her heart, then later something spurs a change in that situation to get them together. You could probably replace Remus for some other character and still make the plot work, but Remus is a developed character and his love life is already an existing plot point to build off of and just makes it a bit more interesting overall compared to Generic-Male-Love-Interest-Number-2.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

The reason why they don't talk much and when they do it's in grunts is due to them knowing each other so well they can communicate using looks and guttural sounds.

** I have a lot of affection for Severus Snape/Argus Filch, primarily because of the work of Delphi. Delphi really examines Snape's working-class, Northern background in a way that a lot of writers don't really grasp, and the similarities between him and Filch are really drawn out in these works.

I think a subtlety of Snape's character that can be hard to grasp when you're not from the UK is that like... So Snape (and Lily) are from a town called Cokeworth, which JKR has expanded on [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/cokeworth][Pottermore]] - Cokeworth is an industrial town in the Midlands, around what we call "[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/uncovered/what_is.shtml][the Black Country]]". Judging by how poor Snape was as a child, we can pretty much guess that Tobias was a worker in one of the factories and earned very little (this was pre-Thatcher, so that would only get worse in the coming years).

Class in the UK is /everything/ at times, and when you're from an area like the Black Country or Merthyr Tydfil, somewhere that's super industrial but started dying down in the 20th century, it really affects the way the world is around you. There's a lot of poverty because you had entire families that used to all be involved in industry, and then they all got the rug pulled out from under them when the mines and the factories all started closing down. You're not even working class, then, you're less than that - you're benefits scum.

So like, growing up, Snape wouldn't just have been hated by his father and neglected by his mother at home; he likely would have had a very difficult time of it in general, and a lot of that would be as a result of his economic class. The worst thing about being working class is how identifiable you are - Snape probably had an accent, he was dirty, he was unkempt, his clothes didn't fit him, etc. It didn't matter how good he was at Potions or at Hexes, because people would see him first.

And there's just a wonderful parallel with Filch, who like... He's a Squib. Class is very important in the wizarding world (we can see that most notably with the mockery of the Weasleys), but if you're a Squib, you're automatically on the lowest rung. What's the point of being pleasant to people if everyone fucking hates you anyway?

Delphi's writing of the pairing is just really great to me 'cause like, you're aware of how unhealthy the two of them are, how buried they are in their own issues and histories, how fucked up they both are - and it's just written /so/ well. Especially given that like...

The thing about Snape as a character is that you can really love him and you can understand what made him the way he is, but you don't have to make excuses for him or act like everything he ended up doing was okay. He can be a complicated, horrible man, and you can /enjoy/ that; Filch much the same.

My favourite fic by Delphi for the pairing is probably ao3link([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2480741]]) , which is Needs Must. It's rated E, but it's not smut, there's just some sex in it, and I really love the way it looks into Snape's psyche and the way they settle into a relationship with each other.

Then, I really like Severus Snape/Lucius Malfoy.

They're really completely fucking different in every way, and I like the idea of Lucius immediately clocking this powerful, genius little ink blotch of a first year and trying to help him along a little bit. The idea of Lucius taking on a kind of mentor-role through Severus' time at Hogwarts, and then after Hogwarts that perhaps becoming a sexual relationship, like... It's so interesting to me.

The way Snape talks in the books is so full of shit and obviously performative - he basically talks in a very quiet almost whisper all of the time, saying all of this dramatic nonsense, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if everything from his neutral accent to the way he buttons up all his sleeves was a distraction he made up under Lucius' vague tutelage.

Lucius is just so rich and aristocratic and so far removed from any real fucking work; Snape is dusted with smoke and smog and has known hardwork all his life. And yet both of them come from fathers who were /exceedingly/ horrible people, ended up very high-up in the esteem of Voldemort, and ended up in positions of heavy influence in wizarding society once we come to Harry (Snape, admittedly, unwillingly).

I just find the dynamic there to be so interesting to think about.

And then Severus Snape/Gilderoy Lockhart. I don't know, I was rereading The Boy Who Died A Lot recently ( linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) ), and there's a bit where Snape is telling himself, "You can't be serious." about being interested in Lockhart, who is such an obscene narcissist...

Again, there's a huge disparity between their positions, their styles, their classes, and I'd just find the dynamic so interesting.

I appreciate that a lot of people really hate Snape, or they only like him when he's placed through this lens that like, he was always the victim (and then pairing him with Hermione or Lily), but like... The wonder of him, for me, is in that he's such a flawed, nasty man who's in so much pain that the idea of people being kind to him is absolutely inconceivable, so why should he bother to try to connect with people himself?

It seems a shame to waste a character like that on two-dimensional portrayals.

** Pairings that I love that are minor: None of these are canon of course, just really like them.

Rita Skeeter/Gilderoy Lockhart. They just make way too much sense together in my opinion.

Luna Lovegood/Lavender Brown: I tend to ship them after the war, when Greyback attacked Lavender. Strange ship I know, but really enjoy it.

Rodolphus Lestrange/Narcissa Black: My headcanon is that Rodolphus had a crush on Narcissa but Lucius asked her to marry him first.

Padma Patil/Anthony Goldstein: I just find the pairing to be cute, the difference in their cultures and everything as well could be interesting to tackle in a fanfiction.

Barty Crouch Jr/Regulus Black: Another weird random ship, but in my headcanon they were together for a bit at least.
