:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fanfic that I believe I read on FictionAlley/Schnoogle ~ 2003-2004, written before we had any info on canon future generation. The details are vague but after tons of googling I am surrendering and hoping someone remembers this

What I think I remember:

- I believe it was novel length. If not, it had many chapters. I think even multiple "books" to this series.
- Main focus was HP's son, I think named Conner? First few chapters at the Burrow. He was learning Occlumency, and I specifically remember scenes of him using a glass object that showed a cloudy sky that cleared as he cleared his mind

​

Details I'm not as sure about:

​

- Trying to rack my brain for additional info and this could potentially be wrong but I have recalled that potentially this fic involved Dudley having a magical son starting Hogwarts the same year as Harry's (non-canon) kids.
- I want to say the author was popular on FA but I was like 11 years old and this was almost 20 years ago now so who knows.
- I thought it was Called Unfogging the Future or something similar, but maybe not.

Thanks in advance if anyone somehow manages to figure out my extremely vague memories! Would love to check this one out again.
