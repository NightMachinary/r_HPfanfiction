Looking for a time-travel story with Harry/Hermione as the main pairing, and set during the Deathly Hallows Timeline. Set after Ron leaves the tent during the hunt, Harry and Hermione get together, then decide they need more time to hunt for the Horcruxes. They go back in time (possibly using the Time Turner that Hermione apparently still has), but not very far, and spend time with Hermione's relatives (not just her parents.) I believe Hermione might be pregnant?
