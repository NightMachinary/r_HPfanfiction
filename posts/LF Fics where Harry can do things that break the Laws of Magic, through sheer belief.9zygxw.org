Basically fics Like [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/][This Means War - Jeconais]]

Harry gets told that something is possible in a lie, and because he doesn't know it's impossible, ends up doing it. Basically giving him Orky Logic. Crackier the better. if Harry believes Red Wands shoot faster, then they do when he's using one. If Harry believes the Disarming charm causes the opponent to actively lose their arms as well as drop their wand, it does when he casts it. As silly as you can get it.

Don't believe the summary. It isn't serious at all.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

  AU. Little Harry Potter knew from the moment he defied the laws of gravity and made a pebble accelerate at a freefall of 8.9 m/s 2, that he was going to have fun learning about the rules of all the known universe... and breaking every single one of them. WARNING: Sporadic Updates.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** Harry Potter and the Avatar's Return pristineungift

Summary:

After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar.

- Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that Avatar: The Last Airbender is a historical documentary.
