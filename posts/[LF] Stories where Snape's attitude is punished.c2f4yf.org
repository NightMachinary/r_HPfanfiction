Snape's attitude in the books would get him fired within a week had it been a school in real life, possibly locked up..

Could i please have some recommendations where Snape acting like a deplorable, irredeemable asshole actually has real and meaningful consequences.


** in 2019 it would, not so much in the 1990's. I had a few teachers not much different throughout the years.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** Hi, I'm working on a story slightly along those lines. It's more about redemption. I'm not quite finished with it, as I lost my beta. If you can message me I can send you a summary and you can decide if it's something you'd be interested in reading. Otherwise these are what I could think of off the top of my head

It has a couple of scenes where Snape is called out on his behavior.
