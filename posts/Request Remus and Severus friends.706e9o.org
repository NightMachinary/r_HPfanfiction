Any fics where Remus and Severus become friends or at least allies with each other? Maybe Remus stood up to James, Sirius and Peter and befriended Severus that way or perhaps it's later on when they're adults that they get along better. Any rating is fine. (Is also fine with slash). Would rather it be completed, but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

I've read this one yesterday and it fits the request.
