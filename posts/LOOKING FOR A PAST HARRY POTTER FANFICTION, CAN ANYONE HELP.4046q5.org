**** It still does not mean you need to make a Vernon impression with your volume. It makes people take you much less seriously than you want.

And before you ask, no, I haven't the foggiest what the story you are looking for is; whatever its quality is or isn't, I hadn't read it.

** Well, as others have pointed out, please don't yell at us, it hurts my ears :P. However, I may have an idea of what you are talking about. 1. Are you sure Astoria's brother saved her from being raped? The one I am thinking of doesn't have any male Greengrass siblings and I am pretty sure that she DID get raped (off camera and all that but it was certainly a plot point though she may have been saved just in time possibly. Ive read ALOT of different stories and they blend sometimes). 2. Can you give more details on the department store scene? The whole "Let's take Harry shopping!!!" thing is a really common event in fanfics

*** uhhh no, harry saves astoria from being raped, theres no male green grass sibling she might've gotten raped in the end but it's really unclear, and I don't remember anything else about the shopping thing sorry. This was a good 2 years ago when I read this, a lot has happened since then XD
