I want stories that are well written, and Harry isn't a horntail-basilisk-eredar warlock - phoenix animagus.\\
Or sure, he can be those, but not if the whole story is a super!OC!wankfest where he's invincible and this becomes a deus-ex-machina


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus;Animagus at War) both fit your criteria, update regularly and are pretty well-written.

*** I've read this. At least the animagi are alright here, writing is good, though they talk too much about feelings (heh).
