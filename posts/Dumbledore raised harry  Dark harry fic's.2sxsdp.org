** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]], Dumbledore mentors Harry. A great read. I can see Harry becoming dark.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3693508/1/The-last-dinosaur-s-roar][The Last Dinosaur's Roar]] is quite short, but one of the darkest out there. Not evil, but incredibly Machiavellian and dark.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Trilogy]] is a */must-read/* trilogy if you want dark!Harry. I can not emphasize this enough. THE BEST dark!Harry you'll read. It's a Dresden crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the Dresdenverse at all to read it - in fact, the story might seem more vibrant if you don't.
