I can't remember if it's as OC or an SI, but she's a powerful seer. While she's exceedingly talented at magic, she is very frail physically. She has constant night terrors in her early years, and dumbledore mentors her I think. I don't know much else about it as I stopped reading at some point, though I can't remember why.


** Sounds like Rose Petal Red by NonchalantxFish.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that? I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister. Oh god. (Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)
