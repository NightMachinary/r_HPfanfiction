** Ah, this is such a unique pairing that I wish had more love. To be honest, I've only ever read one Draco/Luna fic and I absolutely love it! Unfortunately, it is still in progress and the author does not have a regular update schedule and it has not updated since Dec 2014. linkffn(Looking Through Tears by Kailiata)

Despite that it hasn't been updated in quite some time, I still think it's worth a read--as long as you don't mind the torture that accompanies an unfinished fic.

  Things can sometimes seem clearer when you are looking through tears. Scenes between Luna and Draco set within the 6th and 7th book and beyond. Part I - HBP completed!

** I wrote a crossover fic with them using the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (I had to write a crossover for the prompt.) It was the only way I could ship these two, as if their attraction fought through their history only so far, and then they had to force themselves to forget, over and over. I just can't quite make myself explain away Luna comforting Ollivander in the Malfoy cellar. And I have written Dramione, so I am aware this makes me a filthy hypocrite.
