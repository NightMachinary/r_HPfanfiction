when i mean quality, i mean true to character. i don't want to read a draco that wakes up one morning and decides to be good. or super sex god draco. i guess what i want is something realistic...


** The first Draco/Harry I read was linkffn(Eclipse by Mijan) and I remember thinking that the relationship growth was good.

linkffn(Bond by Anna Fugazzi) is another good Drarry starter but know that it's quite angsty.

And I can't recommend linkffn(Turn by Sara's Girl) enough. This one is a bit different from the others story structure wise, and it happens Post Hogwarts.

As far as Draco/Hermione, I thought [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=582][An Aversion to Change]] by Misdemeanor1331 was good for relationship growth (may need to register at the site to read)

and maybe you could try linkffn(Aurelian by BittyBlueEyes).

I also really enjoyed [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]] by DMTABF and thought it had pretty good relationship growth there as well, but this story is more humorous/lighthearted than the others.

Of course, what's "realistic" for you might not be the same as it is for me so I apologize in advance if you hate any of these recs LOL.

**** Huge second for Turn and anything else by Sara's Girl.

Also, Azoth. Quoted from my previous post on this sub.

#+begin_quote
  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]], by zeitgeistic (faire_weather) - HP/DM, rated R

  Author Summary: "Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess. There is a surplus of cats in this story. It wasn't planned, but when are cats ever?"

  My Summary: The story follows Harry and Hermione as they go back to Hogwarts for their 7th year, after defeating Voldemort.

  The characters seem vivid, real, and alive. To me, there's a huge difference in fanfic that writes the characters well and allows them to grow and develop vs fanfic that just devolves characters into caricatures of themselves. I loved the characters in this story. Harry really comes alive as a character, rather than just a medium for storytelling. Hermione has quirks beyond just being a bookworm. Draco is similarly well developed beyond just an aloof bastard. The secondary characters in this fic shine. There were moments in this story that literally made me laugh out loud. The humor is clever, the little details make it work. The story has a lot of charm and emotion woven into the humor scenes. I've read a fair bit of fanfic, but this is my favorite 8th year fic. I thought the concept and plot were fairly fresh, creative, believable, and well written to boot. The aforementioned character development and humor and emotion really sold this for me.

** You should read Isolation, by Bex-Chan on FF.net. It is by far the most realistic Dramione, and is probably the best Dramione story out there, bar none. It's the only Dramione fic I've read where I thought "yeah, that romance made sense."

*** At some point while reading that one I realized that it was quite possible that Draco was just exhibiting Stockholm Syndrome and/or simply latching on to the only person he was able to talk to. It quickly lost all appeal after that.

*** I read that actually I thought the premise was not very convincing though... the two would just never be in that situation, imo.

I really enjoyed The Fallout, Parade of Sun, and When the Bell Tolls by everythursday (on dramione.org) to give an idea of what I'm looking for... but thanks :)

  The Order rescued Draco and Lucius Malfoy after Lord Voldemort turned on them. All the safe houses are full, and Hermione Granger is the only one who can take them in. Will she agree after having suffered a drastic nervous breakdown?

  "Hermione," he practically purred, "you're still in love with me." AU post-Hogwarts Dramione that is loosely based on Franz Lehar's 'The Merry Widow'. Pretty light and fluffy, but rated M for sex scenes and some coarse language. Extended summary inside.
