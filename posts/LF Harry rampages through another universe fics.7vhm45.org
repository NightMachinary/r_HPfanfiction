I've just finished (re) reading The Havoc Side of the Force, and I'm hoping to find other similar stories where Harry ends up in another universe and has a lot of fun. I just want to read something where Harry gets to do a lot of interesting things, maybe screwing with another universe's canon, something like that.

**** Most of kathryn's stories are. I would be fine with that if they updated more often. I usually love long stories because they actually occupy my attention longer than the 2 hours a novel-length story takes me, but when they don't update for months or years at a time (looking at you plums) then it kind of defeats the purpose.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** It's only one particular plot arc, but one of the most memorable parts of linkffn(Core Threads) has the increasingly-godlike main Harry travel to another dimension that happens to be the most clich√©d "evil!Dumbledore" story imaginable. Cartoonishly evil Dumbledore, helpful Goblin King, magic-draining shackles, Fem!Harry, binds on Fem!Harry's true powers, the whole shtick. Naturally, the main Harry solves all that universe's problem in hilarious ways.

*** So I've seen Core Threads get suggested on here a lot. I've had it favorite for a long time but I could never bring myself to read it. Just people's descriptions always put me off the story, I don't really like super OP!Harry stories. However, I just noticed this story is tagged as Humor. Now I actually want to read it.

**** It's also surprisingly normal too, despite how powerful Harry is- he still cocks up, makes mistakes and generally is still very human. Like when he sorts out his ever-expanding magic he starts bumping into stuff that, before, would just get moved out of his way.

** linkffn(Beyond the Veil by NaniteSystems) doesn't quite fit because the universes are combined (Veil brings him back in time instead of to a different universe), but I would say that it still pretty close, even though it isn't /literally/ what you want.
