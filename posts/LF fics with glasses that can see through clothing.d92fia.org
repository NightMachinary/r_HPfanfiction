  His first stop in the 'dark' alley was at the wizard's version of an eye doctor.

  "Are there any enchantments you can put on them?" Harry asked the wizard. "You know like seeing magic; seeing through walls, recording what I see, unbreakable, able to see in the dark, able to see behind me, appear on my face at the snap of my fingers if I lose them..."

  "That'd double almost triple the price of the glasses. Are you sure you're not just trying to get the enchantment for seeing through clothes?" the mage asked, not wanting to bankrupt the boy just because he happened to be an early bloomer.

  "I'm eleven, I didn't even think they had a charm like that," Harry said, shaking his head.

  "So you don't want it?"

  "Of course I want it now that I know about it, I'm eleven!"

That's from linkffn(7597067) but the enchantment is never mentioned again.

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

*** I can not remember which fic it was, but as a prank, Harry and the twins arranged for Snape to see through all clothes but only if the person wearing them is old (over 70?).

Dumbledore couldn"t understand why Snape wouldn't look at him.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** As I've stated, ot only plays a very minor role. Basically Harry gets a see-through-stuff enchantment on his glasses that's inspired by Moody's eye. It's a sort of security measure, but Starfox5 does characterisations well and putting x-ray glasses on a teenager has mostly predictable results.

Overall, I'd be surprised if it even comes up in more than 10 or so chapters out of 67, and even there it's mostly confined to small scenes. Nothing smutty, but pretty much what OP asked for.
