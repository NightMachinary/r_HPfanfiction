We all have great reason to dislike the whole magical core shebang, I think. The whole Lord!Harry goblin inheritance test magic core badda boom shedang. I am not looking for fics like that, I am curious if there's any fics that actually pull off the use of cores and channels really well, and have them as a good accent to the story. They're probably really rare, but I am really interested to see if there are any.

I think stuff like having specific magical channels in your body that a wand connects to is actually really interesting, and makes HP magic just slightly more hard magic based, which I really enjoy. I'd especially love it if the fic would go into the mechanics of magic, but I know that's pretty rare or nonexistent.

I hope you can rec me something I will like!

PS: Please no Core Threads, I couldn't get past the Hogwarts Express in that story :(


** I don't know if you are ok with crossovers or not but if you are then I would recommend Broken angel by I LIKE FEAR 1-2 linkffn(11309606) and it's sequel.

It is mainly a harry potter and naruto crossover (split pretty much 50/50) and my all time favorite fanfic. It features an explanation of magic that I haven't seen in any other story and is definitely worth reading if you want to see one of the most naturally OP mc:s around.

I haven't recommended this one on here yet because I don't really know if it would classify as Naruto or Harry Potter, that's how interconnected the two universes are in this fic.

  What happens when you anger a God? What happens when something once pure, turns wicked and angry? What is left of someone who has been alone so long? How do you ask forgiveness for being so wrong? How do you apologize for breaking someone's heart? This is the story of Slytherin House's Angel of Carnage. Posted on Wattpad and RoyalRoad

** There's nothing about channels, but IMO magical cores are handled well in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. And while Harry does indeed have an unusually deep core giving her a large amount of magical endurance, it's firstly, used to make the story more interesting, definitely not used to make everything a curb stomp, and secondly, it's a hindrance as well as a help. Her core grew that way partly because of her fearing what she might do with her magic from an early age, causing her to suppress emotions and memories and end up with significant control problems (but all that internal struggle has made her magic strong). And she's really only interested in brewing potions, where such high magical reserves are helpful but hardly critical - and standing out like that is draws unwanted attention from people like Tom Riddle...
