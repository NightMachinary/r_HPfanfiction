Not sure how common this trope is, but I've read a couple fics where comparisons were drawn between Harry and regulus and I thought it was really neat.

I'm fine with any length and most ships and tropes are fine. Im honestly not sure what kind of reccs I'm gonna get but the comparison seems uncommon enough that there isn't a tag or keyword to search.


** I'd be interested in whatever fics you've already read that have this. Sounds very interesting if you could give a rec!

*** It's a bit of a running theme in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20719073/chapters/49221263][In Willing Sacrifice]] and it's also mentioned in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]]. It's not really a main thing in either, but it was enough to get me interested in the idea.

**** Ah, I avoid Tom/Harry so I would have missed that.

Evitative is an awesome story though, I didn't remember that detail from it. Really liked the portrayal of dark magic as something beyond just murder and torture

**** Follow up reading that I clicked on due to your inspiration on the Tom/(I chose fem!)Harry tag. Sirius compares the two!

** The regulus lives tag on ao3 has quite a few that do this, but I read so much I couldn't give you a specific title of any

** He's kind of Harry's role model in this Linkao3(5745595)

  REPOST: SLASH LV/HP: AU: Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.

** Regulus and Harry's storylines in this one are amazing. They're kind of compared there, in that they're very bonded over Sirius.
