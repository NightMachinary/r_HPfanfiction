:FlairText: Recommendation
:END:
So, I'm looking for recommendations that have ANY of the following tags/prompts, be it one or a handful: Slytherin!Harry Potter, Ravenclaw!Harry Potter, Harry is raised by other(s), Pureblood politics/traditions/dynamics, politics, magical theory, Time travel, Time travel-Fix It, Lord Potter/Lord Black/Lord slytherin, Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore bashing, crossovers with percy jackson or Merlin adventures *and any you haven't had the chance to recommend but would like to.*

I usually lean more towards harco/drarry, but almost any or no pairing at all is fine. The only other requisite is that the fic, series or one -shot is complete or had the last update some time this year, no matter the lenght. Thank you all in advance!

(Looking forward to anything, really, I'm desperate)

*/And to contribute some myself, here some of my own ((RANDOM)) recs/*:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]]: In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn.

Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure. (Harco)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11036913][If stars died of old age]]: His mother had had six months after his father had died. But it was expected; they had prepared and were already rather distanced. Draco hadn't been ready, and Merlin, he had been so in love. He knew he was counting down in weeks, not months. (Harco)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13948497][How to Interrupt a Monologue: Nico di Angelo Style]]: The Dark Lord's victory speech is cut off by the arrival of a certain someone with kickass death powers and a better title.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/338101][Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven]]: (SERIES) When a more studious Harry Potter enters Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15672978/chapters/36410256][Weekly VOLDIE*]]: /Everything A Decent Death Eater Needs To Know About Britain's Most Belovedly Feared Dark-Lord-Who-Definitely-Isn't-Back/ as reported to you by Harry J. Potter, the Boy-Who-Knows

Harry needs a hobby. Luna offers to show him the ropes in investigative journalism. --- In other words: Luna Lovegood is Luna Lovegood, Harry is so done with the Wizarding World, Ron is along for the ride, and Hermione really doesn't have time to stop Harry from becoming a Dark Lord.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428/chapters/34983008][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]]: The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face. Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move /on/ or go /back/ he does something else entirely.

And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday. Because that makes sense. (No. No it doesn't.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756768][Fruit of the Golden tree]]: (Potter rage series) Thanks to the desperate actions of his wife, Fleamont Potter survived his dragonpox. Now he finds himself awake again in a world where all the members of his family are supposedly dead---except that the Potter family tree tells him that his grandson lives yet. Fleamont sets out on a search for his grandson, and then a quest to keep him safe once he's found him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1733899][Harry Potter and the ticket backwards]]: (SERIES) When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/898773][Yo, Death Wants to Protect You Cuz Some Other Loser Has Got to Die.]]: (SERIES) The Golden Trio had just gone through Cedric Diggory's death and survived the Triwizard Tournament, so when the school year begins again, they only expect the same old jeers from Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson. However, when they come back they are surprised to learn that others have prepared for the rise of Voldemort... or to cover up his return.

Nico's father, Hades, decided that he can't let Voldemort cheat death, especially when the Dark Lord is a loser. So, Nico is sent to protect Harry and quicken up the pace to defeat Voldemort. Joining him are two new demigods to help him understand the wizarding world as they return to their roots.However, things become a bit harder for Nico to complete his mission once he gets sorted into Slytherin...

(ALSO, if you have any recs about Merlin adventures, please dm me T-T)


** I don't feel like typing out the links to these, but a few of my favorite hp fics are:

Gryffindors Never Die (has a surprising deep side among the over the top bromance)

a life of smoke and silvered glass (bonus points for some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read)

End of the Line by shewhoguards (this gives me a philosophical boner and also is just incredibly heartwarming. Short stories about the various harry potter characters after death)

Time to Spare by emysabath (it's relatively Gen but has a lot of focus on harry and Draco's platonic relationship)

Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance (don't see this recced much but it's a pretty solid complete fic)

Snape: The Home Fries Nazi (For sheer 'I don't know why but for some reason this fic fucking works')

Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always (THE standout time travel fic with canon pairings, amazing writing quality, well developed plot and characters)

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Cranmer for Delinquents on the Run (for the awesome drarry)

I tried to pick some personal favorites that I don't see around much to keep my recs a little more useful. Hope you like them!

** I've got a few of my faves and one of my own!

*Slytherin!Harry:*\\
linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree)

*Harry is raised by others (Remus and Sirius)*

This one is my favourite Remus characterisation

linka03(The Boys of Crowhill)

And this one is my own fanfiction in which in a different world Remus and Sirius's lives are quite different thanks to the different choices they made. How is Harry's life affected?

linkao3(A Time For Wolves by Eirene29)

And my current favourite mentor!Snape, *absolute best* characterisation of Snape!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within]])

​

Another *perfect* characterisation, this time of Tom Riddle's obsessive, possessive and manipulative behaviour with Amy Benson. Absolute top fic, it deserves all the love!!

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
