I'm writing a fanfic and for that I need help remembering some details from the books. Harry went out under his invisibility cloak several times, but how many times did he go out in his first three years and what were his destinations? I remember some, but I have the feeling it's only a small portion.


** Check your local library and reread the books.

*** Maybe I don't have a lot of free time and any help would be appreciated. I could push back writing the fanfic a year to first read all the books again, but I was hoping to write it a bit sooner than that.
