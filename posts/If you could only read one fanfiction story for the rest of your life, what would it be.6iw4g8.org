  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

Read this story when I was having a really hard time getting over the loss of a loved one. Still not over it by any means (4 years now), but it will always be the story that gives me hope in a sort of twisted way.

** The Code series by Aduro on ffn.

Starts with linkffn(2750775) The Code, followed by: The Code Breaker linkffn(2989922), The Decoding linkffn(3648321), ending with The End Code linkffn(11603390).

I've been following the story since she started writing it around 2006 and have reread this series (up to wherever it was completed at that point) probably 8 times since then. The author abandoned it during The Decoding but in a fanfiction miracle actually came back after several years and finished that story. Unfortunately, it seems like she has again abandoned the final story in the series (as of last Oct) but I've still got my fingers crossed that she'll complete it.

**** A lot of the sub doesn't like it, and downvote it whenever it's mentioned. It seems silly when there are so many fics that are objectively much worse. Maybe it has to do with subreddit rivalry? [[/r/hpmor]] was the bigger subreddit for quite a while, and even now it's only ~2k subs behind.

****** For what it's worth, I will tell you this: the fic is decent, which means it's better than most of the crud, but it could have been good if not great (check out some of Yudkowsky's other works, he does have the ability to write good stuff) and the only reason it didn't happen was because of the author's arrogance.

I see downvoting any mention of the story just because it happened to be very petty, but I cannot bring myself to say the same about cases where someone downvotes a mention that the story “pokes fun at the absurdity of the HP universe” or anything of that ilk because the way in which Yudkowsky did /that/ is ... frankly, to some degree nauseating, and feels like him saying “see Rowling, I am a better writer than you” which is just ... ugh.

****** Anyone still regularly talking about the fanfic several years after it's finished is going to be a very hardcore fan, as a general rule. [[/r/rational]] is where the people who like HPMOR-like fanfics, but aren't massively fanboying over that particular story, hang out.

I'd also recommend finishing the story before checking out the subreddits, since they don't always properly tag spoilers.

******* Actually, I still haven't finished it. I chose it because the premise is absurd and mostly fun, and it's a fic where you really only want to read a chapter or two at a time. If you have only one fic to read for the rest of your life I wouldn't want it to be a fic that I get through in a week or even a month. If the question was 'pick the best fic you've ever read.' The answer would be very different.

*** My opinion of /Methods of Rationality/ has changed over the years, and not favorably, but it was one of the first fics I'd read in this fandom and it's been a gateway for others too. Have an upvote.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
