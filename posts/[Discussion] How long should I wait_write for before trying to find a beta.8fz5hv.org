So I've recently decided to start being more serious about my fanfic ideas and writing in general, and to that end I posted a one-shot to start. I've currently got an idea for a fairly ambitious, long story. I've just about finished writing the first chapter, which is probably gonna come in at around 3.5k words, and I have the beats planned for the next few chapter as well as a rough idea of where I want things to head short-term.

However, I haven't been able to think of an end goal for the story which really catches my inspiration, and I think having a beta to discuss ideas and characterization with would help out a lot. The only problem with this is I don't want to start working with a beta before losing steam, or even just hitting a wall by myself.

Is there an amount of a story that you think should be planned or written before looking for help, or even before publishing the story? Any thoughts you guys might have would be much appreciated, especially those who have written some longer works!


** I'd work out your end goal and a plan to get there first. Right now it seems you haven't got a story, you've got an idea and ideas are flighty. In my opinion, and bare in mind its just an opinion the ending should be one of the first things to write. It doesn't have to be finalised but it gives you something to work towards. Its so easy to write down the first 3-4 chapters while an idea is fresh in your mind as you explore a quirk that you're interested in, not that its easy to write well mind, just having an idea and putting words on a page isn't hard. Without an end goal its really hard to know if your story has mileage, without something to work towards and a decent plan its so easy to go off at a tangent. That tangent can be really interesting to you, it can be quite interesting to read about but once you get there and you're finished with the tangent you realise you're now completely derailed and have no idea how to get the story back where you want. When that happens, once you've written yourself into a corner its really easy to give up and that's a shame if you've worked hard on the rest of it.

*** That actually does make a lot of sense. While I think I do have at least /part/ of a story, I will agree that writing more without planning a direction is probable a dumb idea on my part. I just think that having someone else look at what I've got so far, they might be able to give me a different perspective on the thing, and help me come up with something to work towards. I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to offload my problems.

Anyway, I will try and come up with an ending to work towards, as well as a rough plan of how to get there.

Thanks for the comprehensive reply!

** Write a chapter or two, make sure you have a detailed plan you are willing to share with the beta, and be prepared for it to change. A good beta will help with more than grammar, and might spot plot or character problems that need to be addressed as you go.

** I would definitely recommend figuring out the end. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but knowing where you want to end up can help with long fics and continuity.

Say you have a great idea in one chapter and think that is the general direction you want to go. That's all fine and good until three chapters later where something else happened and you now want to go this direction and have forgotten that vital thing from before that you had started building upon. Believe me, it happens (yes, speaking from personal experience). You are then stuck with several different plot directions and potential plotholes. It's also possible that you end up writing yourself into a corner and you have no way of fixing it without redoing several previous chapters.

Setting up your ending, isn't as constraining as it may sound. You still have the whole story to plan where you can add in twists and surprises- but you now have the end in mind and know where you need to be.

For more advice on writing or betas, I would also recommend checking out [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]. There's some great topics to browse through on writing, planning, and a few on betas.

** I'd have the general story worked out before doing anything. This will ensure your writing has direction, that it's going somewhere. This allows you to plan better and to write chapters to get you to where you need to be and avoid writer's block more easily.

As for a beta, I personally waited until I had written a chapter or two published before I picked one up. Probably not the best way to go about it, but on the plus side if you can at least have decent grammar and spelling, you can get away with it for a bit.

*** Yeah, I think I'm gonna take your and [[/u/herO_wraith]]'s advice on planning an ending to work towards. I guess I just wish I had someone to bounce ideas off, no one IRL is really interested in this kind of stuff, so it's kinda hard.

**** Are you aware HP fanfiction has a discord server? It rarely talks about Harry Potter but I'm sure someone there would be willing to help.

***** I wasn't aware, but also I've never really used discord before, so I'm not sure how it works. Is it like a groupchat for the sub? Because I've been in groupchats with like 10 people and even those get hectic.

****** So discord has text rooms and voice channels. Its also linked to the Sub's IRC if you'd prefer to use that. There a bunch of different rooms for different things and the messages in discord stay so even if someone doesn't see it right away they can reply later.

** If you're looking for a beta and not a co-writer, figure out the ending first. Otherwise you may drive off beta readers if you advertise for a beta but the work you give them needs co-writing not beta reading.

** Hey, I've been working on a fic myself and looking for someone to bounce ideas off of as well.

Message me and perhaps we can exchange some contact info and we can help each other out.
