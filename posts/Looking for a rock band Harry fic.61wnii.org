I'm looking for a fic I read while ago where Harry was the lead in a rock band, and he knew nothing about the wizarding world. I remember some of the witches from hogwarts snuck out to go see a show of his, and I also remember the Order ambushed them to try and get Harry back.


** And here I was thinking this was a suggestion for a "Harry uses his fame to become a Wizard Rock Star bigger than the in-canon Weird Sisters".

I'm curious about the fic you're looking for now though.
