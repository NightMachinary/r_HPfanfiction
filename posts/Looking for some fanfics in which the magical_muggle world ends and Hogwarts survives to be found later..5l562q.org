Can be time travel or crossover, though I'd prefer one the the HP main characters to live to find Hogwarts.


** In the linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard by Darth Marrs) (a Star Wars crossover) the remnants of the magical community in Hogwarts and a couple of other places on Earth -- otherwise barren of life -- are found and evacuated by Harry. This is a relatively minor subplot of the whole story though.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the raping of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

** Hmm...I remember a Harry Potter/Avengers crossover where Harry goes to another dimension (the Avengers dimension) where there's no magic to be found; at one point he discovered the ruins of Hogwarts, proof that magic used to exist there, and encountered some other-dimensional horrors. I think the Cancerverse was involved?

** In linkffn(A Third path to the future by vimesenthusiast) a harry potter leaves through the veil and finds himself in the marvel comic universe. He find hogwarts sealed with all the dementors inside of it, but not quite in ruins. He restores it and uses it as a school for mutants and magicals.

In linkffn(the forever mage by darth marrs) harry is resurrected by his long lost descendants for /reasons/ on the ruins of hogwarts. He goes on to do stuff in the star trek universe. I dont know if he does stuff with the ruins - he woke up without his memories and i dont enjoy memory loss stories and quit reading a few chapters in.
