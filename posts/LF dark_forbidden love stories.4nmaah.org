Ok that title sounds really cheesy. Basically, my favorite pairings lately have been very beauty and the beast esk. I'm looking for long, well written stories with believable pairings that "shouldn't" work. Like Snape/Lily when Snape is a Death Eater and Lily is in the order, or HG/SS or HG/SB where the age difference is an issue, or HG/LV or HP/LV for obvious reasons... Nothing abandoned, so either complete or recently updated. Some examples:

linkffn(8149841) linkffn(Choosing Grey) linkffn(9234875) linkffn(A Dream Carved in Stone)

Hope those link right. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(Kisses Cursed) linkffn(Mirrored) This is probably one of the most realistic HP/LV fics I've read. I felt that they both stayed really true to their characters and to the pairing. linkffn(The Dance of the Dreoilin)

**** If you find that you enjoy the pairing and you're in need of any HP/LV or HP/TMR feel free to PM me. I feel like I've read every fic under the sun so I can probably recommend you some fics if you're ever running low.

#+begin_quote
  Gently tracing the crease between his brows, the young witch wondered just how much she didn't know about the old wizard lying in the hospital bed before her. Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at her sadly for one last time. "Hermione," He whispered, "come back to me..." - A story involves an unusual form of time traveling and a timeless love.

** Well, I read a lot of Bellatrix/Hermione, which I think would qualify as 'forbidden'? Passionate blood supremacist and 'mudblood', torturer/torturee, one of them is an escaped convict, etc. Age gap, too. Let me know if you want a couple of links, not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for here. You linked slash, but idk, some people can be pretty odd about lesbians, or it might just not be what you wanted.

Likewise, Hermione/Narcissa, though that pairing is less intensely conflicted due to the fact Narcissa isn't an openly mentally ill convict, I guess. She's just married to someone else, from a culture fairly alien to muggles, and there's ofc the age gap thing. Still adorable when people pull it off believably.

*** I've never read a HG/BL or HG/NM, but I'd be open to checking them out lol. So far every time I've said "not my thing" I end up finding a fic that I love that obliterates those preconceptions. Next thing I know I'm googling Voldemort slash fics.... (I started reading fanfic determined that smut was dumb, everyone was straight, and Snape and Draco were the only "grey" characters. My opinions are very open to change lol!)

**** Well, the one that got me with HG/BL was linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites), and if I keep linking this fic, people are probably going to think I'm some kind of reddit fanfiction shill xD

It's a very slow burn by necessity, because the pairing would be heavily OOC otherwise. Naturally, they hate each other for quite a long time. Can be a little slow to update, but still actively being written.

Linkffn(Room 5 by dancing through the madness; Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) aren't exactly high art, but they do provide a decent look at two people on opposite sides of the war hooking up despite the odds, in two very different ways.

On the lighter side of things, linkffn(Murder Most Horrid by Useful Oxymoron) is a heavy AU (Voldemort never existed), but it does touch on the age gap thing, and provides a decent take on Bellatrix's character sans-Voldemort.

HG/NM is... rare. Well-written and in-character HG/NM is rare as rocking-horse shit, but it exists. Maybe linkffn(The Scientist by greysfanhp), if you can get past the occasional misuse of apostrophes. It's mildly AU in the way that it treats magic, but is very interesting in the way it characterises Narcissa, certainly. It's not as 'forbidden' as the above, but heavily emotional, and quite dark.
