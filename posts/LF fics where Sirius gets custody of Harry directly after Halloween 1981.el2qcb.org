Preferably with a lot of exploration on the relationship between them.


** Linkffn(Sirius' Savior) has 68 chapters, and a sequel. Great read.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** I'm not sure that this is entirely what you want but it's the only one I can think of. â€˜The brightest Black' by Enigmaticrose4. I think it may be more Hermione centric but it's been a while since I read it, and Sirius does adopt Harry pretty much straight away.

** There's one where he and Harry go wandering about the globe (The US, Brazil, Japan, etc) before eventually coming back to England - learning shit like Martial Arts and Meditation along the way. Sirius falls for a Brazilian woman and it's a really nice relationship, but I remember it exploring the relationship between him and Harry particularly well.

There's three of them in total (books one, two, and three) and they're all pretty good IMO.
