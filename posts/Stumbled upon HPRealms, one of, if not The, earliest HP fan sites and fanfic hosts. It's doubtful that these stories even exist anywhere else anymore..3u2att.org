#+TITLE: Stumbled upon HPRealms, one of, if not The, earliest HP fan sites and fanfic hosts. It's doubtful that these stories even exist anywhere else anymore.

** Oh my god

I think that's the site where I read my very first HP fanfiction. I haven't been able to find it but *there it is*. Under submitted, "Bent." I don't remember reading any prior to that.

Might just have to reread it.

Edit: holy crap reading the summaries of the sequels brings back very, very vague memories.

** Hahahaha "webmistress" takes me back. I miss my old Area 51 geocities site. Where middle-school me posted the worst Mulder/Scully fanfiction EVER.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny was now 22 years old. She worked at Flourish and Blotts bookstore, and lived at home, because of the terror that was now enveloping the whole of Britain. Because, on Draco's birthday of this year, the Dark Lord died, and his heir rose up one hundred times worse than the Dark Lord himself had ever been. Because earlier that year, Dumbledore had died at his hands. The name which was now substituted with the ominous "You-Know-Who" was Lord Radoc Lafoym - Gnommish for "Angel of Death", and Gobbledegook for "Mad serial killer".

With masterful prose like this, i can't possibly think of why the site is defunct.

** HPRealms was created as an anglefire site in 99 by Gypsy Silverleaf, then known as GirlieHawke. It migrated to geocites and later got its own domain. I don't know how it's still being hosted, but it's an interesting historical piece.

** Yeah, it's only good as a historical piece, the content is terrible. So many (at least now) cliche romance fics...
