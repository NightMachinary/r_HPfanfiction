:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading it quite a number of years ago, maybe ten or more. It was a series of fics set in Slytherin that started pre Harry at hogwarts and starred OCs. The third? one had Ginny sorted into Slytherin and that idea always struck me as interesting. I tried looking for it but I can't find it anywhere. Any ideas?


** The most notorious Slytherin Ginny fic I know is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]. But that one's a standalone fic, not a part of a set.

**** She removed all the fics from websites quite some time ago. These are copies I'd saved.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
