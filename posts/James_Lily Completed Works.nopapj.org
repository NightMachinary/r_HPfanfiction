What I don't want:

James does NOT ask Lily out, over and over again. It really bugs me when stories do that

Authors don't just bash James or Severus. I want flawed characters, not bashed characters

I don't want every minor character being set in the Marauder Era. That's not believable

I don't want an OC joining what the Marauders do.

Something I want:

James and Sirius were brilliant, they weren't stupid academically. I want stories that write that.

Extra information:

For other pairings: Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc

Can be on any site, can be any genre, can be any length.

Canon, AU, or anywhere in-between is fine.


** Hi! Do you read non-magical AUs? If so, I can give you a couple more fics.

My personal favorite of the long "Marauders at Hogwarts" epics is The Last Enemy series, which is a new multi-POV, canon-compliant series. The first fic in the series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][The Howling Nights]], is complete and is set in their Fifth Year, which is obviously a pretty pivotal year for the Marauders. The main pairing is (eventual) James/Lily, but it will also have minor Sirius/Remus later in the series. I really love the characterizations. They're all complex, flawed people, but none of them are bashed. James and Sirius are both very intelligent, but James has to work harder at it than Sirius does. I particularly like the pre-Jily dynamics in this one, which aren't the usual "James is obsessed but Lily hates him" cliche. I'll note given your criteria that James /does/ ask Lily out multiple times over the course of the year, but it's not a constant thing by any means like you usually see - I also find this annoying. I'd guess it's around five times? The Marauders' journey to become Animagi is really entertaining and balances out the angst related to Snape, Sirius's family dynamics, Lily's status as a Muggleborn, and Remus's lycanthropy. You can watch the excellent YouTube trailer the author made [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRpsSodszhY&feature=youtu.be][here]]. The Sixth year fic, Dark Marks, will begin posting tomorrow!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7549384/chapters/17168488][Sunshine in My Eyes]] is an AU in which Lily and Petunia were raised from childhood by McGonagall after their parents died, which changes the canon story in both subtle ways and major ways. It's still endgame James/Lily, but follows a somewhat different path than usual to get there. I was on the edge of my seat during the First War chapters - there's one scene in particular that's just chilling and I think about it frequently. I promise it has a happy ending though!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18267275/chapters/43227482][We are here]] is an AU in which Lily is the Minister for Magic and James is the Prime Minister, taking inspiration from "The Other Minister" chapter in HBP. I love that the author didn't do what you'd expect and have Lily be the PM - the fact that she's a Muggleborn MoM makes the story way more interesting. This one borrows some from the Second War canon but is really its own thing. It's a more modern setting in that James became PM after Theresa May and there are occasional references to Brexit and whatnot. Something different!
