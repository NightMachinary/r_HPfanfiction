** Yes, please! I always felt that he should have been allowed to continue his education after the truth of the basilisk became known.

*** You don't think that hiding and raising an acromantula is a reasonably expulsion-worthy offense?

**** He was wrongfully accused as the one that killed Moaning Myrtle. At that point in time, his offense was wrongful ownership for sure, but not murder.

****** no, I don't think so.

It would call for some punishment, but not such a harsh one. a training with the teacher for CfMC and explaining to him why he as a half giant is more resistant to many things, but that he has to worry about his fellow students.

Hagrid was never mean or malicious in his actions, just uninformed

******* That may or may not be the /ideal/ solution, but that doesn't mean that expelling him isn't also reasonable. I'm not sure that speaking to him would have accomplished anything. It seems as though he hasn't really learnt the lesson even decades later as a man well into adulthood.

Whatever his intentions were, he still hid and raised an infamously deadly magical creature in a school.

How do you think a normal boarding school would react to a comparable situation? I'm pretty sure a kid could get expelled for keeping a cat, nevermind something actually deadly and illegal like a highly venomous snake or spider.
