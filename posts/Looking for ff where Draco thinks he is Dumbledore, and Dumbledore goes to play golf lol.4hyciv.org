I read this fic a while ago where Draco for some reason is convinced he IS Dumbledore. And Dumbledore was pretty pleased because it meant he could go play golf. Anyone remember this one?


** I really want to read this now... I can just imagine Dumbledore picking up some golf clubs and walking away
