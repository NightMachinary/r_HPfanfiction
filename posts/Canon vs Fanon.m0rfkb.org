  Harry Potter is very short
#+end_quote

This is not canon. JKR stops calling Harry short after CoS. Harry is the same height as his father in OotP and DH and Voldemort describes James as tall. Both Mrs. Weasley and Hermione go out of their way to call him tall.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley's did not abuse Harry
#+end_quote

This is also not canon. Throwing a frying pan at a child's head is physical abuse. Vernon picks him up by his collar in OotP. In HBP Harry makes it clear he has had to dodge Vernon in the past. They allow Dudley to bully m

But also physical abuse isn't the only type of abuse and the Dursleys do that, too. They make sure he knows he's not family. They go out of their way to insult him and his parents and treat Dudley better

*** You nailed it. Said everything I wanted to.

Also, thank you for pointing out that yes - the Dursleys *did* physically abuse him. It shouldn't be surprising that JKR didn't want graphic child abuse in a book aimed at young audiences! That's why there are only hints.

**** What should be said is they didnt abuse him to the extent that a lot of fanfic push it. The beating him black and blue and nearly killing him is something they woudlnt have done cause ot would have caused the neighbors to talk and that would effect facade of normality

***** Yea, i would agree with that. But OP said Dursleys weren't abusive, just mean, which is just an insane intepretation.

*** Thank you for pointing out the height error. People think Canon Harry is short because Daniel Radcliffe is short. They are not the same thing. Just like Jack Reacher isn't short because Tom Cruise played him.

  4) The Dursley's did not abuse Harry. They made him cook occasionally, and do housework and gardening. There is no evidence of physical abuse. They were mean yeah.
#+end_quote

Emotional abuse still counts as abuse.

** Actually harry was short as a kid but was about as tall as his father by deathly hallows. Its mentioned that dudley and his friends liked to beat on harry thats why he was so quick at dodging and running away. Also petunia tries to hit him with a soapy frying pan in of the early books. Hermione was seen as plain until she put serious effort in before the yule ball. No real mention of her appearance after that that i can recall other than krums saying whats the point of his fame if all the good looking girls are taken referencing both hermione and ginny.

** I'm sorry. I just have to say something about the Dursleys. Even if we don't read between the lines in Canon (which we should), keeping a child in a cupboard IS NEVER OKAY!! That, by itself, is enough to constitute child abuse, and we shouldn't normalize such behavior by saying it isn't abuse. That's not to mention the many hints we are given that Harry WAS physically abused. It's a children's book, so she doesn't say it outright, but it's heavily implied. The Dursleys were not 'mean', they were child abusers. We shouldn't blur the lines on that.
