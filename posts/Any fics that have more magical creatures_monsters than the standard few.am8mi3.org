I was expecting to see more fics popping up about all of the amazing beasts shown in the Harry Potter universe now that there are /two/ Fantastic Beast movies out, but I haven't really seen that many, and so I decided to see if you guys've found (or written) any good ones. Because asides from the one basilisk, some dragons and the occasional blast-ended skrewt, I haven't seen many of the other monsters that've been shown/mentioned in the franchise, and I think that's a bit of a pity. There's such a huge variety of creatures with so many interesting origins, powers, etc. that could be used in so many different ways, but I have yet to see a single fic feature a Quintaped , Kappa or Cockatrice.

And yes, I know that there /plenty/ of reasons why people don't add them to their fics, be it lack of information or uncertainty as to how to incorporate them into their plot(s), but I'd like to see the ones that /do/ try and bring more creatures in; I should /not/ be able to count on one hand the number of fics I've read that feature a Hippogriff after third year or a unicorn after first.

Other than all this, I prefer gen, but I'm really not picky romance-wise and am fine with just about anything that's not terribly out-of-character. Just, please no bashing or power-wanking or whatnot; that's always a bit of a downer.

​

*tl;dr:* I'm a bit too much like Hagrid and Newt for my own good, and I'm wondering if anyone has any decent fics with loads of magical creatures and monsters in them?


** I'm also surprised at the lack of fics that haven't incorporated content from FB. You would think Obscurials, were-snakes, and America based fics would be popping up but I haven't seen any

** Well, my current story, "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", so far has featured a fair number of creatures including sirens, jinn and a tribe of jaguar shapeshifters.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** This is probably most easily explained by the fact that the medium of writing just isn't suited to large menageries of creatures that the author will have to describe in detail and also the reader will have to imagine properly from those descriptions. The amount of people who have both the skill to write good fanfic /and/ do justice to imaginary creatures is staggeringly low.

** Creatures (both canon and stolen from various myths/folklore) pop up periodically in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10515756][a better mirror]] linkao3(10515756) and some of the side-stories in its series, but they're not the point of the fic. /Fantastic Beasts/ fic, canon-divergent after the first movie, Credence/Graves.

  “And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer, because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit.” --Shane Koyczan, “To This Day”If someone told Percival Graves he'd spend his fortieth year as a fugitive on the run from MACUSA, in the company of an Obscurial, a smuggler, a Legilimens, and a No-Maj, he would've put them in an institution. But now, after a near-miraculous survival of captivity at Grindelwald's hands, he's become a wanted man because he can no longer in good conscience uphold the laws he'd once vowed to protect.This is the story of a man on the run, haunted by more ghosts than he cares to count, on a journey that will span an entire continent. This is the story of how Percival Graves saved Credence Barebone from execution; how he fled New York in Newt Scamander's suitcase; how he got something he never thought he needed: a family.
