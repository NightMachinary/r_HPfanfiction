Having recently read Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, I liked this idea. A Hermione Granger who has almost zero belief in the field of divination. Yet ironically, out of her own unconscious action everyone believes that she's a seer. Now, she is trying to disprove stuff only for things to get more weird and comedic. It's like a reverse SPEW situation.

I don't care about the pairings much, so bring it on! Thank you.


** HA! I was about to suggest HPPOS with the caveat that it comes into play >100 chapters in.

Following this thread closely for suggestions, I also thought it was a great idea :)

** She kind of uses it as an excuse in linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) and while the fic is kind of funny it had its sad moments too

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  A prank in Professor Trelawney's class leads to Ron being hailed as a seer. But nobody could predict how that would change Harry's fate. AU, starts 3rd year. Powerful!Harry. Adventure/Humor.

** linkffn(4240771)

The much maligned (and occasionally rightly so) Partially Kissed Hero plays with Hermione as a limited seer, in that she can foresee things related to homework.
