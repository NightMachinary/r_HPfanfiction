** I think the mashing of different political movements in the world in The Firebird Trilogy linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy) suits your desires quite well. Becomes a lot more prominent in the second book, first is dedicated slightly more toward world-building.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

**** How about linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)? There is a lot of conflicting opinions, political machinations, and propagandizing of various factions. Plus its the most canon-like Harry in Slytherin I can recall ever seeing.

** I really hope you don't consider the Communist Manifesto as a good writting...

Edit: I'm talking about the fanfiction not about Karl Marx's writting.

*** Well, if you mean Harry Potter & The Communist Manifesto, then yes, i do not consider it good writing, does it talk about real communism that isn't meme'd to hell? No, it doesn't, but does it make me laugh my ass off sometimes? Yes, it sure does.

Now, if you mean the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrieck Engles, then i assure you it has masterful writing, and is most denfinetly a brilliant read.

Many Thanks, Comrade Delta

** Like linkffn(Harry Potter Becomes A Communist by HardcoreCommie)? It's (almost certainly) satire, though.
