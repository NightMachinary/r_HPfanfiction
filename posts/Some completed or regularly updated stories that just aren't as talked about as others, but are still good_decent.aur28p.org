** I found this one last week, and it's an absolute gem! Has almost no love. It needs more!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126835/1/The-Slytherin-Heart][The Slytherin Heart]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6097611/Farbautidottir][Farbautidottir]]

Wilhelmina Gamp had no plans to one day become the grandmother of Gellert Grindelwald, but a Slytherin heart has a way of getting what it wants. Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France and its wizarding backlash, it's a tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love. This is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament.

​

This one is great!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12937210/1/Hogwarts-Mystery-THIRD-YEAR-COMPLETE][Hogwarts Mystery - THIRD YEAR COMPLETE!]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10350613/Jill-Klein][Jill Klein]]

Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob. With everyone thinking she's cursed too and the foul Merula Snyde willing to make her life at Hogwarts a living hell, can she survive school, find the Cursed Vaults and find out what happened to her brother? With some magic and the help of loving friends, everything is possible.

​

This one is just fantastic, and needs more love!

A trader on the edge of the wizarding world is about to turn Snape's world upside down.

​

Completed, fantastic, and has more stories within the universe:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic][Harry Potter and the Eversion of Magic]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6277431/Malebron][Malebron]]

It is nearly eleven years since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is content. When a mysterious artefact is stolen from the Ministry of Magic and someone Harry had never expected to see again returns, a new adventure begins.

​

And, if I am be so shameless as to recommend mine as well. Nearly fully uploaded, and I've been working my ass of on it! :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
