** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s MIT (Muggle Interface Team) miniseries is really fun:

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]], linkffn(9992917), PC Roberta Beadle was inadvertently drawn into a magical homicide. She became suspicious of Harry's background story and managed to piece lots of things together just by using public information. When she confronted Harry, he told her the truth and brought her onto his team. That was the beginning of the MIT (Muggle Interface Team).

So far, the author wrote or is writing 6 MIT fics. In chronological order, they are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7071175/1/MLT-Muggle-Liaison-Team][MLT: Muggle Liaison Team]]: Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, Roberta Beadle, and other OC formed the original MIT.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9382930/1/MIT-Secret-Keeper][MIT: Secret Keeper]]: Roberta made acquaintance with Oliver Wood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7085543/1/MIT-Haunted-House-Dead][MIT: Haunted House Dead]]: This is my favorite of this little series. MIT had to solve a murder case involving a cursed artifact at a Muggle manor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6869796/1/MIT-Hampstead-Heath-Corpse][MIT: Hampstead Heath Corpse]]: They had to solve a case involving a mysterious dead person.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12029238/1/MIT-Strange-Place][MIT: Strange Place]]: Anti-Muggle ward on a former Lestrange estate broke down, two Muggle police was trapped inside. Narcissa would make an appearance here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10716964/1/MIT-Entente-Cordiale][MIT: Entente Cordiale]]: They had to solve a murder case with the French. Gabrielle would play a key role.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], linkffn(11815544), is very good.

Interestingly, the dimensional travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327), is epilogue compliant.

Apart from a few exceptions, the smut fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4625848/1/In-Case-of-Emergency][In Case of Emergency]], linkffn(4625848), is also epilogue compliant.

Finally, there is the [[https://www.amazon.com/Potter-Cursed-Special-Rehearsal-Script/dp/1338099132/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493735754&sr=8-1&keywords=cursed+child][Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]. I know this joke is getting a little old, but for a fanfiction, this story is not that bad, and it's definitely epilogue compliant.

** linkffn(Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard; The Wendell That Wasn't; Gossip Queens by Opalish; Cauterize; The Twine Bracelet) are a few great oneshots depicting Post-Deathly Hallows circumstances--some lighthearted and humorous, while others quite depressing/heart-wrenching.

linkffn(An Interview with Justin FinchFletchley) was a fairly interesting read on a muggleborn's view of the events surrounding the Deathly Hallows, also with interesting worldbuilding on the Post-Deathly Hallows HP world (I think. It's been a while, so my memory is fuzzy.)

**** Also the story diverges from Cursed Child since it was started before it came out. And it continues past the events of the play.

Little0bird's universe is great, but keep in mind it lacks a lot of the magic of the world and is very realistic to how any real family might live. Sometimes you forget they are even wizards. Her epic, Questions and Answers, is great but because it is focused on showing what the characters' lives would actually be like, I am bracing for some really gut-wrenching moments that haven't happened yet like the death of a major character. The author is already pursuing a new plot that I'm not totally on board with.
