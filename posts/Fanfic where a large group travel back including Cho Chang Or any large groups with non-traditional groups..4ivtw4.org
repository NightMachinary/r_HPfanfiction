** In linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram), Harry is pretty much the only character who /isn't/ a time-traveler. I don't remember whether Cho Chang appears in it, though.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** Try the (Island of Fire)[[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]] series. It's technically a crossover, but you don't really need to know anything about the other universe(Temeraire series) going in other than the fact that intelligent dragons exist and it takes place during the Napoleonic Wars.

*** I second this. I also don't know anything about Temeraire, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the story.

**** [[/u/ArguingPizza]]

I've read all of the Temeraire novels thus far - the last book, /League of Dragons/, is set to be released on June 22, 2016 - and /Island of Fire/ is barely a crossover. It takes place in the same universe, in the same time period, but that's about it. None of the main Temeraire characters actually appear in the work.
