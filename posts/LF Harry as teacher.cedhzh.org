He can be any one of the types of teachers at Hogwarts but I would prefer defense.


** linkffn(Yellow Submarine) is a bit grim

linkffn(Delenda Est) is Harry time-traveling and as potions teacher

linkffn(Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense) is a continuation of the Lone Traveler series

linkffn(Wind Shear) is sort of a ripoff of Delenda Est but Harry is defense teacher

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) dimension-jumping Harry as Divination teacher

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) has a fem!Harry as defense professor

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

***** The writing in it is also iffy. Take the first chapter as an example. Harry is doing a dig and the story exposits his life till that point and then out of nowhere he gets gassed by a trap and wakes up as Rose.

The writing literally goes

Harry was doing a dig in a lost city

Exposition about life up until this point

Suddenly being gassed.

The author didnt use anything to say that Harry was thinking the exposition out while he worked. One line could have saved it by saying "while he thought about this he made a mistake"

Hell the next chapter has Harriet talk about how the trap promised a fate worse then death, but the previous chapter never mentioned anything about the trap AT ALL and you are just left wondering where in the story that was mentioned.
