Ive always loved how time travel is done in cannon HP, where its possible but doesnt change the timeline because you cant change the past. Anyone have any novels that use this type of time travel? And example would be basilisk born by Ebenbild. Or Vicis by Quicksilvern. Can be slash or crossover or anything

Is a good one from what I read. Plus, the main protagonists are Fred and George whom are really underrated as main characters in fanfiction.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

**** No problem! I'm happy to share great stories.

If you want something similar, I also suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/23/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano which is another time traveling fic featuring George. However, George successfully changed time in this one. It's a good read nonetheless.

I'll just quote myself since I shared this rec recently.

#+begin_quote
  The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. No one knows that there's another George that travels to the past. Older George also have a sort of a mind link with his younger self. This causes problems with the younger George and Fred and they become quite stressed out about what's going on.

  Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasleys. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

#+begin_quote
  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

** I read a few that fit the description, but I can't find some of them, ugh.

There's linkffn(5928118), Hermione/Snape, and also linkffn(8739316), Regulus/Hermione (it has a sequel, I think). I have another one somewhere wich is Tom Riddle Jr/Hermione, I'll search for it if you want but right now I can't remember the name.

** First one that comes to mind would be linkffn(4438449) which is a crossover with Neil Gaiman's The Sandman. And it fits, but the time travel is really not an important aspect of the story.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.
