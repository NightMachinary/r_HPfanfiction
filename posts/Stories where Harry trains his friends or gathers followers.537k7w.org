I've been reading a lot of independent Harry stories where he tries to take on the world himself. But are there many out there where instead of being independent and pushing his friends away he actually trains them to help him? Maybe he uses the DA or something like that?

Something along the lines of Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5058703/chapters/11633524]]) would be great.

Preferably a finished story with 150k+ words.

There were a few more with at least acceptable writing but I don't remember in which ones was this trope prominent enough.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
