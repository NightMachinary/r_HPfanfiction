I don't remember much more than that. I think the curse is permanent unless Draco does the countercurse?


** Oh damn. I'll look around in a minute, pretty sure it picks off right after the Department of Mysteries.

Edit: I'm not sure if this is the right one, but after a quick scan it might be: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11396276/1/]]
