Hi.

Not literally a power in the shadows. I'm looking for something where Harry is OP, or at least more powerful than his peers, but for some reason has to conceal his power (maybe uses alter egos, or just doesn't let anyone see, fidelius might be involved, etc.)

It's a trope seen alot in JP and KR web novels, but I don't seem to see it as much in HP stuff? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.

Preferably pretty long (150k+), and if they're not complete, then at least updating semi-regularly (no abandoned stuff)

P.S. I have read Dodging Prison, and may have read some others but can't remember atm sorry.

Edit: Can be 'Harriett' too, I don't mind. In terms of relationships, I prefer het, but really don't mind too much.

Edit 2: OCs and SIs also fine! Preferably Hogwarts Era! I really should have thought about this longer before posting.

*** Wasn't expecting to get a good one so soon. Read the first few chapters and it's definitely scratching the itch.

Thanks alot!

** As an aside, I am also open to suggestions of this type from other fandoms (Naruto? really anything though...)

I know this isn't really the place to be asking about other fandoms, but thought I might as well mention it.

** You said not literally but here's a literal one where he is the â€˜power in the shadows' and it fits your criteria too :) LinkAO3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15432591]])

And this one has the same vibe, where he's concealed by a strong Notice Me Not charm since birth so everything he does is from the shadows/ people don't know it's him. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24931486]])

** Have you read Lomonaaeren's work (I recommend them enough that my autocorrect knows it now!)? but they have a few fics like this if you haven't. Pretty sure they're on both ffnet and ao3

Edit: I just saw another user suggested some of their works. They're the two I would suggest trying as well

On top of that this one was pretty fun, though it's just a morsel of a fic linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]])
