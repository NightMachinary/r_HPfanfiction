Like the title says, looking for a time travelling Harry story. The main thing that I remember is that it uses the smut fic cuckolding at shell cottage as its pre time travel canon. And as a result, Harry mentions to Ron in the great hall at one point that he was cheating on his wife, with the wives of Ron and Bill. I don't really remember much else, but I want to find this again, any help is much appreciated.


** Is it this one?

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
