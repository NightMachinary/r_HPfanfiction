Obligatory 'I'm on mobile so please excuse any errors' warning.

When I first started reading Fanfiction... ok, no. When I first started reading fics I thought Lord!Harry was a cool idea. When I first started reading /good/ fics, I stayed far, far away from Harry/Ginny pairings. My reason for this was that I didn't like how canon brought them together. It always felt forced to me.

I recently realized that the point of Fanfiction is to have not-canon...

Soooo, I'm behind. Could y'all (no, I'm not American) recommend the /good/ ones, so I don't have to wade through a sea of bad ones? I'm fine with anything except abandoned fics (unless it's good enough where it's reached that it warrants a read), slash (unless it's minor enough that it can be ignored), harems (even if Ginny is the 'main' person in the harem, I can't deal with those), and PWP (Porn With Plot is fine, as long as it's not the /focus/ of the story). The story doesn't have to focus on the pairing either. Thanks in advance!

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** I usually suggest for Hinny beginners [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]], start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and go on.

And yes, [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][problem with Hinny]] is that it is horribly (and just insufficiently) written in the books, so most of the romance has to be written by the fanfiction authors. There is just not enough in the books, because JKR cannot write romance to get herself out of the wet paper bag.

Also, stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]].
