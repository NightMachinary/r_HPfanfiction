** It might be a fetish thing.

But as worldbuilding goes, corporal punishment is considerably more plausible than Lordships or any of the usual pureblood rubbish. Corporal punishment was common in schools all around the world until a few decades ago, and the wizarding world is generally behind the times. In many places it's still not illegal. Certainly it's a natural fit with the boarding school setting. And Snape is exactly the sort of teacher, unfortunately common in real life, who would have taken a sadistic pleasure in spanking students on the slightest pretext.

That said, I've only encountered it in one fic that wasn't porn, so... it might be a fetish thing.

** I'd imagine they were written either by people who were into that or people who were spanked as children and regard it as essential child-rearing practice. If you're into hitting your children, you tend to be really into hitting your children, so it's not much of a surprise people would write it into their fanfiction. People who aren't into spanking are equally passionate, mind, it's just harder to write the absence of a thing into a story than it is to have characters do a thing.
