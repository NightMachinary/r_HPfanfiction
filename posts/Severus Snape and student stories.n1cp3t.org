Any recommendations to good stories involving Severus Snape helping a female student?

It can be anything: studies, health, issues, suicide, loneliness Just no sexual stories. That is not my thing.

Thank you


** Snape has a platonic friendship with Luna in I Know Not, and I Cannot Know, Yet I Love and I Live

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

** Does it count if he doesn't know she's female? linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a Harry who grew up with a passion for potion brewing, and now wants to go to Hogwarts and learn from her hero, Professor Snape - except that Hogwarts only accepts pure-bloods. Rather than let that stop her, though, she and her cousin hatch a daring (and dangerous) scheme to swap places.

Professor Snape is an interesting character, still snide and no-nonsense, but without as much self-loathing, since Lily is still alive and well. He still hates the Marauders, but "Rigel" is just too talented and too passionate about brewing to simply ignore.

#+begin_quote
  Rigel: Thank you, Professor Snape. I'm so honored that you'd include me in---

  Snape: You will stop that this instant, Mr. Black. I detest flattery of any kind. All I require from you is an extra pair of hands this month. If you perform adequately...I shall consider allowing you to assist with other projects in the future.

  Rigel: What time?

  Snape: Every afternoon between your last class and dinner. With an additional three hours after dinner on the evenings you do not have Quidditch practice. Too much?

  Rigel: Definitely not.

  Snape: Get out of my sight. Your happiness sickens me.

  Rigel: I look forward to working with you as well, sir.

  Snape: Cheeky brat.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

**** Well, /that's/ a spoiler and a half :D

As of the end of book four, everyone has found out that "Rigel Black" was a half-blood imposter, but Archie and Harry have convinced their parents that he was a third party. Harry had a whole contingency plan and cover story prepared, with an apartment and a job and correspondence education, to give the impression that she's been living behind Diagon Alley in order to let Archie have her place at AIM and get more time for herself to brew potions. James and Lily might possibly have guessed the truth, but if so, they don't want to pry and get her arrested for "blood identity theft". Professor Snape /hasn't/ worked it out, but is intent on tracking his apprentice down.

  Book1 When Rachel Snow, the Girl-Who-Lived, is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic.

** He mentors Harry and Hermione in And the Basilisk made Three; linkffn(13470863); among other things, coaching her in how to write essays correctly (I think that author has visited that concept a few times besides this one).

It's not the main focus of the story, but he does help one of his Slytherins get free of a sexually abusive parent in Ritually Yours; linkffn(8631152); and Prometheus Unbound; linkffn(10765229). They are linked to each other and have unfinished sequels.

  Ron makes a bad choice about seeking out Hermione, and Harry, panicking, calls for aid using parseltongue as the tap is right in front of him. He and Hermione make a new friend, and Snape recognises the lack of self-worth of the abused. A Snape-mentor fic with a 60 foot twist. This has four years/chapters, and it's a good place to stop.
