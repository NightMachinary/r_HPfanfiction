The Sarcasm and Slytherin series has a Potter ancestor be a Gaunt who married into the Potter family (Harry ends up with his wand). It's a WBWL fic and is currently in the middle of fifth year (and updates regularly).

It does have Slytherin Harry, Grey/Dark-ish Harry, and some "Hadrian Potter" tropes, but if those are things you enjoy or can tolerate, the story itself is a pretty solid WBWL fic.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
