Like, a story where Harry discovers DnD in his childhood (hiding behind a bookshelf in a library while others played?) but instead of trying magic from it he decides to adopt the Chaotic Good alignment? So he actually makes the conscious decision that from then on, heck the rules, he will do what he thinks is right and/or exciting. Maybe he'd be a Hufflepuff?

Bonus points if it includes something along the lines of "I mean, yeah I'm a delinquent with a saving people thing, but Chaotic Good is a lot easier to say."


** There's a reason why nobody actually lives purely by D&D alignments. It's because they're really poorly thought out. Besides, Harry is already as classic Chaotic Good as you can be without being a cardboard cutout. With Ron as Neutral Good and Hermione as a well-fleshed out example of Good trumping Lawful in Lawful Good, making her the kind of paladin you actually want in your party.

Also, Harry's childhood was the 1980s, when D&D had a certain... reputation among "proper" folks (the Dursleys and seemingly everybody else in Little Whinging). Although I honestly have no idea if the satanic panic ever really got to be a thing on the other side of the pond. Still, I feel like it's more likely that Harry would find kids playing a proper British-made tabletop game. I think Harry would make a great servant of the God-Emperor of Mankind.

I mean yeah. This is a nine-to-eleven-year-old we're talking about here. The /point/ is that its heavily flawed.

and I don't know any british tabletop games.

**** Well, I was mostly kidding about him playing a British game, but the most well-known are probably Warhammer Fantasy Battle and Warhammer 40000 (which would have come out when Harry was 3 and 7, respectively), which are also very popular in America (well, 40k is, I've never met anyone who plays WFB).

And even a child can spot the problems with living according to an alignment. I spotted the Lawful vs. Good issue for paladins almost immediately when I was 9.

** Harry pretty much does act "screw the rules" in canon whenever it's needed (like Hermione and Ron) - and Gryffindors pretty much seem to fit that side of the CG alignment best.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** I think [[/u/The_Truthkeeper][u/The_Truthkeeper]] is essentially right. However I would like to see Harry be his chaotic good self and realize he is that trope.

The closest I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the D20 of Fate) I'm on mobile at the moment, hopefully this link works.

  Maggie Kimbal, a savy D&D character, meets Harry and Hermione at an early age. Melding D20 and HP magic, the trio proceeds into the field of Technomancy and "Global Optimization". How will they cope with incompetent opponents, impossible research goals, subplots, and tricky hijinks? Munchkining Harry Potter style, of course.
