**** Sure it wasn't. It only takes a bit of sophistry to go from 'If you're more of an expert on Harry Potter fanfiction you should be more of an expert on TheEndless7's fics as they are Harry Potter fanfiction. If you are not then you are not more of an expert' See, a true expert would have risen to the occasion.
