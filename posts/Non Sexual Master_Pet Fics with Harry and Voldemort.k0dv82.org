  Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?

  When Harry starts to get sick, the only one who can save him is his worst enemy. Not a love story; warnings inside.

  Harry decides it would be a good idea to find out what his Animagus animal was, but when he transforms but can not transform back, things get complicated when he ends up in the hands of Voldemort who refuses to turn him back. How will Harry cope with being Voldemort's pet? Read to find out...
