I am looking for a story where when things got bad, Harry would retreat inside of his mind. After, he would be 'normal' according to what the school saw him as - a typical Gryffindor basically. Ron and Hermione knew about this and just tried to help. No one else seemed to notice. I can't remember more right now. I'll add more if I do but any help would be awesome and appreciated!


** More info: one time I remember this taking place is right before the (Leaving?) Feast and Ron was accepting of it, just waited it out. It was at least 5th year as Ron thought of how this hadn't happened in a while and I am fairly sure Diggory's death was mentioned. It is possible that a teacher finds out, I want to say Severus, and helps out eventually.
