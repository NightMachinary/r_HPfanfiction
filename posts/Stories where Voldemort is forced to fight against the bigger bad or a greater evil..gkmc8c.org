Are there any stories like that?


** Linkffn(The Imposter Complex) has the diary fragment in a new body fighting against several baddies, both mortal and...not quite.

Linkffn(Honey by Mark Geoffrey Norrish) has Voldemort as not quite the bad guy (depending on how you interpret it) - won't say who he fights against to avoid spoilers.

*** Ugh, Honey tricked me into thinking it's complete, but it isn't really complete without the sequel, and that's abandoned!

Really interesting take, though.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Linkffn(The Lord in the Mist) is heading that way with an ancient Voldemort from another dimension who seems to have aligned himself with the good guys against a greater eldritch evil and potentially against this universe's Voldemort too.

  Part 3 of 'The Wandering Devil'. The year is 1996. The Second Wizarding War is in mid-swing. A traveller from another dimension is searching for a forbidden text. Forced to work with Dumbledore the traveller finds himself trapped between his quest and the war with Voldemort. Gods, demons and dark lords, he's seen them all before, but as reality grows thinner can anyone remain sane?

** Theres that one fic where his whole crusade was started because he kept having to stop muggles from nuking themselves and the magicals, and just wanted to force the ministry to help and it kind of snowballed after dumbledore meddeled. I think that fic ended with a post half blood prince harry and voldemort agreeing to just let things go back to politics after one more battle to let the more violent of their sides have a last shot at killing their rivals/enemys before civility ensured and harry + voldemort were to sit out said fight to honor the spirit of the cooperation and planed return to civility owing from them having just underwent stopping the muggles from nuking the world agian together. They exist, but they are probably old, from his perspective, and still kind of shitty or crackey.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
