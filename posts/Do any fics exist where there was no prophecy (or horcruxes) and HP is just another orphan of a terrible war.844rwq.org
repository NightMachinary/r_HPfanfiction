Bonus points if Harry is somehow deluded into thinking that his parentage and situation give him a "destiny" and that Voldemort will return (even though he is dead).


** well in that case his parents wouldn't have been killed that night. good chance peter may not have betrayed them at that point in time since there would be no prophecy to overhear.

**** Not really. At least not until that fateful(ha, pun) halloween night, and since there's no prophecy, Voldy has no need to focus his attention onto the Potters, and instead focus on the war. Afterall why focus on three people, when he could focus on Dumbledore, Hogwarts, MOM, etc...

If I remember correctly, it was only, because of Harry, and Lily that Voldemort didn't win. He was that close. So chances are, any story where the prophecy doesn't exist is a story that has a high chance of Voldemort being the victor.

Thanks,

Warryn.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

*** We don't know that yet, we just know that between Grindelwald and Harry's first year we know nothing or nearly nothing.

So for all we know, Tom Marvolo Riddle could be a ministry worker, even the head of a department.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."
