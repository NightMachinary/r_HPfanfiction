First of all, kudos to anyone who understood my reference in my second sentence.

Second of all, this is only partly humour. I'm actually interested in your headcanons about which wizarding families are middle and lower class. For those of you who have a big 'nobility' in your headcanon, put those who would amount to Knights and Baronets (or their feminine counterpart) in the bourgeoisie section.

Personally, I'll admit to only have a wizarding bourgeoisie partially made up in my mind. The Potters, Slughorn, the Bones, Abbotts, Zabinis, Davises, Patils and Ollivanders.

*** Wizarding World definitively has a "lower class", on both side of the law. As an example, Mundungus Fletcher (a thief/ scammer) and Stan Shunpike (helper on the Knight Bus) can both be seen as member of the lower class.

And yet, the fact that both of them were able to afford a ticket to the final of the Quidditch World Cup (Mundungus tried to be compensated for a tent way more expensive than the one destroyed in the Death Eater attack, and Stan was seen by Harry & Co trying to pick up Veelas), the most sought (and probable expensive) event of the Magical World show that true poverty is rarely seen in the HP World.

Which is kinda normal since magic is really usefull for lowering living cost. Space Extension and Muggle Repelling Charms can be used to obtain a land (though the former is probably regulated by the Ministry). Thanks to the Gemino Charm, you can build a house with one brick and an ounce of mortar, when you don't just Transfigure the dirt around of make use of Conjuration to build it). When thirsty, just use the Aguamenti charm, or maybe enchant a tap with it if you don't want to use the charm everytime you are thirsty and want to bath. Even the food, which according to Gamp 3rd Law can't be conjured, can still be conserved and increased thanks to magic.From what we saw in Canon, the only true expenses a reasonably skilled wizard has are for his entertainment (Quidditch matches), "protected item" (things like school books which apparently can't be duplicated), consumables items (floo powder and potion ingredients), and item he can't enchant himself (the Wand at the head of this list). So true poverty is either for the really bad wizards (think Half a Squib), or the one who kinda gave up magic like Merope Gaunt.

****** World cup is a better example ;)

In 2014 in Brazil, the cheapest tickets were announced at $90 (£59, 69 euros) for the group stages, and $440 (£288) for the finals (Using that because it's the one that popped up when I googled).

I think that's /somewhat/ reasonable for the minimum wage bus driver/greeter to have saved up for in the WW - particularly since the costs might have been lower (the population of the WW is way lower, and the stadium was actually 30% larger than the 2014 WC finals stadium).

**** The problem with using the World Cup as an example is that they created a stadium that could seat 100,000 people. Given that the only cost in making it the time of the wizards casting the spells, its far cheaper to built it than a similarly sized muggle stadium would be. For a society with a substantially smaller population than we're used to thinking of, a stadium that big would have all the seating that could be wanted. So the tickets, particularly for the worse seats, would likely not be particularly expensive.

However, its definitely a good point you're broadly putting forwards. Someone on what is likely minimum wage (Stan) is able to afford a ticket, that means he's either a quidditch loon who makes sacrifices for years to save up for the ticket, or he's not got such substantial outgoings that affording a luxury (even a not hugely expensive one) is feasible.

** There's always more and less rich people in society. What I think is the most important is to think about how wealth changes the standard of living. Many things that poor people in our world lack are no problems for wizards (food, transportation, housing) but there are definitely some pricey things (books, magical items like wands, brooms, omnioculars) that poor people might have a hard time affording. Even with magic, some things take a lot of time and effort to produce, and since we don't really see much industry it's unlikely that enchanted items can be mass produced by robots.

** I think the WW certainly has the potential to be quite aristocratic - the Malfoys and Blacks fit that bill quite well, as does the medieval roots of the world (eg - the Wizengamot seemingly drawing the name from the Witengamot, Hogwarts, the banking practices, the house elf slaves, etc). However, at the same time, the way people act definitely draws from bourgeois/middle class settings.

Since canon is quite vague on a lot of things, particularly politically/socially, it leaves it very open (eg, we don't even know if the Wizengamot is elected, or its powers).

Personally, I do like having the more traditional/aristocratic view of the WW, because it's a fun setting to have - and tear down. For that, the way I picture it is that it'd have evolved to have some high noble families - eg, the Malfoys - who'd have some vassal families tied to them - eg, the Crabbes/Goyles. Then, below those historically noble/ennobled families, there'd be everyone else.

For the bourgeoisie, it'd thus depend on how the world gets set up. The Potters, Bones, Abbots, Patils, etc, could all be slotted into either end of things in my view. Then, for the working class, I imagine it as making up the majority of the WW - achievable through greatly increasing the size - and also including most muggleborn and other discriminated groups (eg, vampires, werewolves, etc).

One of the reasons I like such a system is that it adds another layer of opposition to our heroes, when expanding it to the more general population. It also sets up a system where the opposition holds most of the power - and yet, at the same time, is feeling under attack for the minor reforms that took /some/ of their power away, feeding into the gilded youth that seems to make up much of Voldemort's following, at least in my headcanon (hard to ascertain in canon how rich - or not - most of the Death Eaters were).
