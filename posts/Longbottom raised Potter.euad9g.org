I want to read something in which Harry is raised by the Longbottoms. Either by Augusta or by Frank and Alice, not fussed either way.

It doesn't need to be the main point of the story but it should play a role in some way. Preferably starting before Hogwarts.

Thanks!

*** I don't think the reminder worked. Maybe you could bookmark or save the post.
