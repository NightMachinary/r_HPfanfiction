  Harry's life at the Royal School for the Blind was good. He had friends and his dog. The school provided a good education that would eventually lead to a good job and a good life. Eventually, Harry would care about and appreciate things like having a good job and a good life. The future held no surprises and Harry didn't worry about it. Then the letters came. Or, the one where Harry is blind. This changes everything (and nothing).
