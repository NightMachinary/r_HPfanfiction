** Was going to say Hogwarts Battle School, but then read the description. Yeah, as far as I know, HBS and HPMOR are the only student army fics in HPFF.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
