Looking for fics where harry had BWL brother and he pitied him and try to be helpful to him because his brother will die in the confrontation against voldemort to destroy the horcrux, and everyone except his brother knows this. Anything like this?


** Well, it isn't because he's brother is weak or anything, just usual big brother dynamics in linkffn(Fraterculus) which the title kinda gives it away. Btw, one of the best Daphne there is, no jokes.
