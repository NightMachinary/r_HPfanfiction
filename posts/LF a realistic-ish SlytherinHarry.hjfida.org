I've been reading fanfic since my early teens and I've always loved the Slytherin Harry trope, although back in the day, cliches weren't really cliches yet. I'm looking for something new to read. A Slytherin Harry which begins perhaps with a slightly shy Harry who's out of his depth but eventually does gain a lot of confidence and cunning. Possibly eventually becoming someone quite important (either in the house) or the world outside. Basically, character development. I'm getting increasingly bored with the dark!harry's who arrive to Hogwarts with squeaky voices and â€˜emerald' eyes, ready to destroy anyone who's in his path.

I really don't care about his alliances. He can be his own man for all I care. Thanks in advance !

** The Serpensortia Trilogy by MzMinola, starting with linka03(4913998) has a more realistic, canon-like Harry. A quiet, shy child, attending a more well developed boarding school (like a real boarding school, there are clubs and social activities beyond dueling, chess, and gobstones). Children dealing with difficult home and school situations, more human interaction than you typically find in Slytherin!Harry fics.

  It's Nott who finally surprises Severus by speaking up, small dark eyes strangely intense."It's Potter's owl, sir."Severus eyes Potter with interest, but the boy's lips are pinched tight, shoulders hitched, and he's staring at the ground without saying a word.Well, well. Severus' night has just got interesting (...if by interesting you mean completely hijacked by one irritating and distraught prepubescent boy).

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
