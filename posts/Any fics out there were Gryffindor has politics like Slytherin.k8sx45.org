As in, they're [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace][Proud Warrior Race Guys]](tv tropes warning) and are obsessed with fighting and honor and shit like that.

Maybe a warrior council or something.

#+begin_quote
  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you? Hidden in plain sight, in the one house they least expected, Harry Potter becomes what he was always meant to be. Hogwarts beware, the Dark Lord's equal is rising!
