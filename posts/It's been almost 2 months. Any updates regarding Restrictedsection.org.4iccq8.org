Sure would be a shame to see all those fics stay gone forever. I read and enjoyed a lot of them and wouldn't mind reading them again, so any news regarding the site?


** Just a thought, if anyone has an archive of the site, even a very incomplete one, it would be awesome to make a torrent. DHT means you don't need to rely on a tracker.

It wouldn't even be piracy, technically the author information would be intact and for legal purposes you are allowed a personal use backup.

** As far as I am aware the site owner Libbie is working on it still. She had an issue with her hosting provider and then her computer that she works from has been in the shop so she hasn't been able to get a backup set up anywhere.
