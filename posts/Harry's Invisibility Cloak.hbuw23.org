So according to canon the Potter's Invisibility Cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows and according to the lore is actually a piece of Death's Cloak which allowed the wearer to hide from Death. And unlike other Invisibility cloaks it didn't lose it's abilities with age (I believe that last is canon).

Now if that is true, then how was Moody and Dumbledore able to know where Harry was when he wore the cloak around him? And it can't be because they heard him or smelled him as that should have also been true for Harry's ancestor which means Death should have found them if the cloak didn't handle those issues.

So do you think like some fics that Dumbledore (or character of your choice) put some form of tracking/identication charm on the cloak and that is what allowed Dumbledore and Moody to know where Harry was when he was wearing it around them?

Or was it something else that allow Dumbledore and Moody to "see" when the cloak was in use around them?


** If I could have one wish, it would be for everyone in the fandom to re-read the King's Cross chapter in DH, as so many misconceptions in the fandom would be disabused if people could just read that passage.

  “So it's true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers ---”

  “--- were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

** My headcanon is that Moody's Eye and Dumbledore's Glasses were enchanted with the Elder wand. and that is why they could see threw the cloak.

** The hallows were simply extraordinarily powerful artifacts, not actually created by death (that was the children's book version). This the elder wand was beatable, the cloak wasn't absolute, and the ring didn't actually raise the dead.

We don't know how Dumbledore saw through it, but Moody's Eye was likewise and extra powerful artifact.

** Given that "The Tale of the Three Brothers" is found in a children's storybook, it could be possible that version of the story we see is a more child-friendly version of the real story or that the entire tale is just a legend meant to explain the powerful nature of the hallows which are just very powerful enchanted objects.\\
In canon, the elder wand is not unbeatable as Dumbledore did defeat Grindelwald who possessed the wand and the resurrection stone does not truly revive the dead thus the cloak may not be very perfect either. Considering Dumbledore wielded the elder wand, it is likely that he was able to see through the cloak because of it. In the case of Moody's eye, it may be an equally powerful artefact or that Dumbledore himself enchanted the eye using the elder wand.

** my headcanon after fantastic beasts is that Dumbles is a legilimens and he wasn't able to see them, instead he knew they were there because he could still hear their minds.

Moody's eye could be just really powerful. idk.

** Because the Deathly Hallows were in my opinion the last moment plotcrutch, and until the sixth volume the Invisibility Cloak was just an Invisibility Cloak, so that for example linkffn(Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31) could be perfectly canonical at that time. And it is the great story anyway.
