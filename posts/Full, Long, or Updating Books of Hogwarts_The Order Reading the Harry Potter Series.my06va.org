I've honestly got kind of addicted to the whole "Everyone reads the books ands out the truth" trope, especially with Harry Potter as it could go different ways. But, some are old, or just haven't been updated in a while. So, here's a collection of books that are either Updating, past the first few books/chapters (More than 20,000 words combined), or just simply long and detailed with their own paths from either [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], Ao3, or fictionhunt.

(Warning: None of these are Marauders Era or Next Gen as I don't like those books. But you're free to put them if you want.)

  A package of the seven Harry Potter books appear at Hogwarts during the Halloween feast during Harry's fifth year, with a note saying that the books were sent from the future and that everyone in Hogwarts, plus a few guests, need to read them. This is about Harry's first year at Hogwarts and is Hogwarts reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

  Redo of my popular story. The Order of the Phoenix is sent a certain series which depict our heroes exploits. Reads like mysecretthought's 'Under a Watchful Eye' in which the characters respond to the books as they read without the actual book quotes being stated. Helps to have a copy or just be extremely familiar with the stories.

** Hogwarts, the order and the ministry reads harry potter, Says the story has been removed.

Reading at hogwarts, a philosophers stone also says the story has been removed

Same goes for the weasleys read harry potter book one. Seems every fictionhunt story is deleted

Under a watchful eye had to be dropped immediately as without the actual book in front of me to jump back and forth, i had no clue what they were talking about. Some quotes to indicate what was going on would have made it readeable. Giving the others a try though

*** I'm sorry. But in order to read books on fictionhunt, you need an account. Then they'll be visible to you.

**** ... thats a rather silly layout. It really shouldnt say the stories were removed if they want people to login to read. Why would i create an account if every single story i find there just says removed when i try to read?

Well shitty site is shitty xD
