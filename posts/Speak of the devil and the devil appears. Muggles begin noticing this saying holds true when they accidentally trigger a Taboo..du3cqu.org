Posted this on [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] on Friday.

Could be Voldemort's Taboo, perhaps it's a Taboo on the name of the Order of the Phoenix, or maybe Hermione made another organisation like SPEW and decided to get radical with it.


** I still think 'The Taboo' is one of the stupider and lazier things in canon, and goes to show how little effort went into finishing this series.

Competent leaders throughout history would have given both their arms to have the ability to make an enemy force show up on command.

Between this and the endless camping trip....ugh. I prefer fanfic.

*** It made me wonder if there was something behind Voldemort being called You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named during the first war. Perhaps there was a Taboo placed on his name during that war that was cancelled out by his 'death?'

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), DarkFuture!Hermione does that for her name over Europe, and people use it both accidentally and on purpose to summon her. (It usually doesn't end well for them.)

Me, I am still waiting for someone to write a fic in which an Order Member confounds a BBC anchor into saying "Voldemort" several times on air, overwhelming the Taboo as tens of thousands of Muggles discuss what a "Voldemort" is.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
