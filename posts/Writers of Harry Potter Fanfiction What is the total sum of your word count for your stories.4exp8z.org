*** I actually know someone who has what I believe, a premise for a world building fic that can stand among the greats. They've easily written over 100,000 words of it but they have begun to get stuck on little details and keep changing it. They haven't shown a soul (aside from me) so far.

** 260K on ffn at present.

I've taken down a few stories over the years (about 70k of D&R's sequel, e.g., as well as a few others). I've about 400k words of work that won't be published.

** Published? Currently 4,6 thousand. I just now published the first chapter for my first story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11897885/1/The-Opposing-Movement][The Opposing Movement]]. I've already written and edited about 55000 words for that story, though.

** Published on ffnet: 179,002

I probably have another 10,000 unpublished for the WIPs and then there's 2 short stories that will be around 5-7K once they're complete.

EDIT: Most of that has been written since Nov. 2014, although I've had my account for much longer.

** 73,635 words of HP currently on Ao3, and I'd say there's maybe 10k worth of HP that's been purged from the Internet as best as I could manage.

If you meant in general for FF, I'm at 746,263 words on Ao3 at the moment, and I've deleted maybe 150k's worth of fic over the years.
