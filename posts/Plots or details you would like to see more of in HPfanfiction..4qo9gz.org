Personally, I like the stories which involve Harry as an unknown, in a different environment (be it a crossover or not) and he tries to keep his identity a secret for as long as possible. Usually shit hits the fan and he gets involved in whatever threat there is, either willingly or not.

Recently I read one involving Harry owning a bar and the Avengers, it was short but it was very entertaining. (If I could remember the name I would link it, if you know it please link it, I would like to save it)

What stories or maybe smaller details within a story would you like to read more of?

*** I think I read it in someone's author notes this past week, but they were disparaging magical cores, and more specifically, being able to measure them. So for example Dumbledore scores a 700 on the Merlin scale, and Harry is a 500 when he's 11 years old. This authors comment just pointed out how stories with measurable cores are just asking for a class system, where the powerful rule.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** I'd like to see Muggleborns brexiting the established magical society, making a new school and new lives separate from the purebloods, snatching Muggleborns up before Hogwarts gets to them.

People doing something to keep hidden from Muggles. I recall a couple fics in which people created islands to house wizarding society.

Conquest. Emperor is pretty much the only one around.

Politics between nations -- for instance, what are the borders of Magical Britain? Can your nation be said to be sovereign when the goblins control the currency and France controls the education? Is it France, or is Beauxbatons in the nation of Magical Toulouse? Perhaps it's a vassal under the Papal State, and instead of the Board of Governors they answer to the Pope.

*** I was fixated on the idea of muggleborns leaving after hogwarts, and getting together and living in their own separate community. Like setting themselves up as separate to the ministry of magic with the muggle government too.

And then them finding Harry in elementary school after his accidental magic at school, because this group of independent muggleborns monitors public schools for magic, and then recruits those kids.

I envisioned them realising they must let Harry go to Hogwarts because of who he is, but they help set him up before, and teach him extensively in the lead up to his 11th birthday.

** Bear with me here.

To start off.... I feel like there are very few HP FF where you get well done sex or edgy romantic scenes, within the context of a good plot. Its either "Teen" rated, or a smut fic. I feel as if there are way less fics that fall in between that. Even many so called "mature" fics seem to hold back and go more with the "implied" act route. I cant tell you the number of mature rated fics, that have an amazing plot, and perhaps have a ton of violence but when it comes to the sex or romance, the writer seems to get cold feet. It actually affects the plot of the story often times, dragging it down.

Maybe I am unusual, but I generally am not a fan of smut, but I also want to read fics that are mature and fully developed and dont hold back for the sake of ratings or fear of feedback or some other such nonsense.

--------------

The other thing I would like to see more of in HP FF are explorations of the wizarding worlds nature. Political aspects of course, but also the economy, the governmental system, the aspects of titles and family history, and more. There are plenty of fics that cover one aspect, or graze over more, but few that really dive deep into the nature of the wizarding world itself.

--------------

Finally, the last thing I can think of is Harry Potter as an "outsider" to Britain. In other words, perhaps Harry Potter attends a different school, or has a relationship with someone like Fleur and/or Gabrielle Delacour (or other foreign witches) but outside the bounds of Hogwarts. However the key here is that I am not talking about a completely AU world. He would still interact with the goings on in Britain, and perhaps at Hogwarts in some way (For example, HP comes back to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament as a member of Durmstrang).

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

** A story where the good guys win and decide to modernize the Wizarding World with equal rights for all sentient beings. Except unlike in most other stories, it leads to a dystopia. It turns out that those ancient traditions have good reasons behind them which are not immediately apparent to young Muggleborns like Hermione.

Goblins really are cunning, greedy bastards, and sensing the wizards' weakness they keep asking for more and more, without giving anything in return.

Freed from their servitude, the house elves revert to their primal form of gremlins and cause all sorts of mayhem and mischief, with wizards having no means to protect themselves against their peculiar magic.

Vampires play along at first, but then use their newfound freedom from the "dark creature" status to seek new victims.

Muggleborn quotas in the Ministry create discontent among purebloods, possibly paving a way for a new Dark Lord.

*** That could be good. My first thought was that Draco could be the new Dark Lord but then I thought that would be too obvious. He would be more like the political arm of the Dark Lord. Maybe Hermione is Minister and as all this chaos goes on around her Draco is pretty much smirking, telling people how much better it was in the old days and that if they want to Make Wizarding Britain Great Again to go to this rally.

But its always been a sidenote that comes up when Neville is describing the "Pureblood traditions" to Harry. Yeah, I would like to see traditional wizard worlds instead of Harry intergrating the 21st Century to Magical Britain.

** I feel like the fandom needs more femslash as a whole - but then again, so do a lot of other fandoms. Het and slash seem to predominate in most places, or so I've seen.

Also, I think there's too much focus on either H/Hr or R/Hr - I'd love to see more "Harry, Ron, and Hermione stay close friends, but none of them has a romantic relationship with another". We really don't see enough of that, even though IMO it's the most realistic option. High-school sweethearts, the vast majority of the time, /don't/ get married, have kids, and stay together for 50 years. It just doesn't happen all that often.

** You're thinking of linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep)? There's more than one story like that but I can recommend that one for its low-key tone and lack of uber-Harry.

What I'd like to see more of is post-Hogwarts adventures around the world. Stories where you can get an accurate sense for being in that different country, with magic tailored to fit with the local legends. It's a great thing in its way that online resources can give a whole bunch of information on a place you've been- much more than you would get just from spending an afternoon there.

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

He's just found out that he's wizarding Jesus, and he just killed his defense professor and nobody even noticed or cared in the slightest. I think the realization could go to his head, and turn him into the next Dark Lord. Or maybe he curses Vernon the moment he gets back to #4, and instead of whinging and crying at the letter from Ms Hopkirk, he sends something back with Hedwig (letter in one talon, dead ministry owl in the other) saying 'Hey this muggle attacked me, but don't worry i took care of it. by the way, i don't think he's learning very quickly, can you remove the monitor?'

or hell, maybe he even just gets all freaked out on the train ride, so he runs and hides like some angsty little wench in the baggage compartment and then Malfoy sneaks up on him and curses him while he's crying and then he turns into some kinda HP/Hogwarts Express combination and he fights Megatron with his Voltron-Harem and his magic Hado-Kenny Blankenship and Vic Romano in their Most Extreme Hogwarts Hunger Games Transformer Elimination.
