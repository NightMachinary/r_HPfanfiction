I read a, or rather /of/ a lot of fics in which Snape is Harry's father. Sometimes thats because Lily cheated, sometimes she was a Death Eater all along, I even read one that had Lily carry Bellatrix' child because her womb was cursed or something...

Anyway... What I never read was Sirius being the actual, biological father of Harry. How that happened, I don't really care. The easiest explanation would of course be that Lily and Sirius went behind James' back.

For why I want something like that: I'm scraping the barrel. It seems I have read it all and I'm looking for something I've missed.


** It's almost played this way in linkffn(Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987): [[/spoiler][Sirius gets about one minute of screen time, just long enough to explain how he went through the Veil and ended up back in time, where he impregnated Harry's maternal grandmother in a one-night stand. Combined with a blood adoption ritual thingee Harry had done at Hogwarts, this is sufficient for him to become Sirius's son, triggering the obligatory marriage contract with the elder Greengrass daughter.]]

Kinsfire also has a crazy-assed story where Harry dies and goes to Hell, finds it better than living with the Dursleys, and gets booted out. He gets taken to Heaven where he meets up with his family and learns that [[/spoiler][his mother was the Marauder bicycle, routinely having foursome sex with all of the Marauders (less Peter--poor guy never gets any nookie). Apparently, she wasn't sure until Harry was born just whose child he was. I also seem to remember skimming ahead and seeing Harry getting it on with his mother at some point]] but then I quit reading.

edit: added the second story.

*** Could you link the second story? That sounds like a beautiful clusterfuck and I'd like to read it. I can't find it, though.

** huh, the only father Sirius I can think of is "The BlackHeir" by FirePhoenix8

there's a good one where he's the fake dad in both "Harry Potter and Morrighan's Gift" by Athey and "Necessary Gift: a Harry Potter Story" by cosette-aimee.

and also it's not Sirius but an excellent Regulus as Harry's father is "Death of Today" by Epic Solemnity

  When a dark family secret comes to light, everything Sirius believes in is thrown into chaos. Except that Harry remains, a constant reminder that sometimes our greatest mistakes can be our most precious gifts.
