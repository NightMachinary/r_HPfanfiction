Either is good i just want a azkban fic


** "So, I've been thinking, I don't actually /know/ if dementors are dark creatures." Harry said conversationally.\\
The dementor in front of him drifted closer; memories of terror and grief assaulted Harry's mind, but he didn't pay much attention given the obvious cause.\\
"I mean, there doesn't really seem to be /proof/ that you eat and destroy souls, aside from that your mouth is involved," Harry continued, "I saw this one theory that dementors are just 'reaper' creatures, that your presence merely causes people to recall their grief and stress associated with loss, and that your Kiss just banishes souls to the afterlife."\\
The dementor glided still closer, rattling sounds coming from its throat.\\
"And there was that other one, that you're /hungry/ all the time, and you go after people's happy memories just so you can get away from the despair yourself. It doesn't make eating souls any better, but..." Harry shrugged and held out a hand, "I mean, if you're suffering or just not that bad, we could get along. Go watch a Quidditch match, those are fun if you leave the players alone."\\
 \\
The dementor studied Harry's offered hand for a few seconds...then grabbed Harry's wrist and lunged, trying to plant a kiss on his lips.\\
*~WHAM!!~*\\
And was promptly punched away with far more force than a human should be capable of.\\
"So, just a psychopathic soul-eating rapist after all?" Harry shook his head and smiled slightly as the dementor recovered and flew at him again, "I'm going to enjoy this, then."\\
 \\
Off to the side, Ron and Hermione were munching popcorn as they watched Harry lay an extremely violent beatdown on a dementor with his bare hands.\\
After a few minutes of enjoying the cathartic display, Hermione frowned thoughtfully, "Ron, did you hear what that spell was?"\\
"What spell? Did Harry cast something? Wandlessly?"\\
Hermione tilted her head, racking her memory, "It sounded like he said...'/Omae wa mou shindeiru/'?."\\
The dementor that Harry was pummeling promptly chose that moment to explode messily.

** Most of the 'owns azkaban' fics are... bad. Varying degrees of bad, but still bad. Just so you know <.<

Here's a couple more of them, however (since Caer is already linked). linkffn(2208427; 2232745; 2267009; 9251090)

** There's only one fic I know of where Harry punches a Demetor, but it isn't really Harry. Link ffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Linkffn(Light's Hope, Death's Hunters) has Harry rip an arm off a Dementor and Hermione makes a couple of wands with it. It's a decent fic but the ending is lackluster.

** Theres a fic where Harry created dementors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]]

Summary: In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out.

And its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]]

Summary: Prequel to The Nightmare Man. How did Harry Potter become a feared lord from ancient times? Here we'll see the start of it.

Not quit owning Azkaban or punching dementors but since dementors live in Azkaban and Harry created dementors I hope they would fit kinda.

** Significant Digits is very AU and weird by Potterfic standards, and it is set post-HPMOR, but the scene you want is in chapter 14: Hermoine destroys Azkaban. Start about halfway through the chapter, where it says “Not one more minute!”:
