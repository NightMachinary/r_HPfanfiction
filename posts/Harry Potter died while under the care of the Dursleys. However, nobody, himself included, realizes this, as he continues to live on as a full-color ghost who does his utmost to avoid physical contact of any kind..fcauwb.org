** This is so interesting.

It was Ron who realized it. Not the ghost part. That came much later. It was the lack of hunger that pinged him. Now, some people (Ginny) may say that Ron ate too much. But Ron personally believes that he ate just the right amount.

Harry, on the other hand, did not really seem to eat. Or even get hungry. He skipped breakfast most days, and he avoided contact like it was contagious. Now Ron wasn't the most tactful person(thank you Bill) but he tried (according to Percy, at least) and he wanted to be a good friend. So he played along. Gave a clapback to Seamus and ensured that Harry has the space he needed.

Perhaps, that is why it took him a week to realize that something was off. He almost brought the topic up with the twins, but bit his tongue at the last moment. Those two did not need more ammunition for their latest routine of Ickle Ronniekinns. But something was off, and now that he had thought about it, it did not escape his mind.

He made a list of possible reasons Harry had an aversion to food and touch. There was an issue of Mad Muggle that said some muggles have anxiety. And while Harry was not a muggle, his family was. That was probably it. He was going to ask Harry about it and be tactful and ensure Harry that it's okay and surely Madam Ponfrey could fix it.

And honestly, what you should remember is that he tried. He waited for the perfect moment, just the two of them. Only, instead of asking about Harry's family, he said, "Can I touch you, Harry?"

And while he was mortified, Harry simply seemed amused. So, atleast he didn't botch it up too much. Maybe. Harry was almost nonchalant about it, "If you must, Ron" and extended his hand for a shake. Breathing a relieved breath, Ron smiled and went to shake his hand. Only his hand passed through what felt like a curtain of ice.

As their eyes met, all Ron could say was "Bloody hell"

******** Thank you. :)

I was thinking the same thing. So, the way it is set, it's not obvious on first look that Harry has the unfortunate case of death. So, if he is not following the obvious rules of death, he has leeway to break the other rules too.

Which means Ron, with his limited, but still decent, knowledge of the magical world will have to explore other options and include other characters as the story goes on.

As for NHN, that's a good idea. I was thinking of involving the Baron, as the most powerful ghost, but Ron would be more comfortable with NHN. He can perhaps act like a bridge.

I am also using other POVs to expand the story beyond the trio. Though they will be the central element.

What's the point of magic if you can't swish it away?

I actually included that to show the ridiculousness of propaganda done in the literature that is meant for wizards. Because you just know it will have all these weird anecdotes that makes no sense. And Ron will know a lot of random muggle stuff without context or with wrong context. I believe he will have all these ideas, like kids have ideas about chinamen and cowboys.

***** Magic may exist, but there's logic to it. There's even a theory behind it.

This is why there was a wizarding school, rather than a big book of spells. There are limitations.

Magic doesn't do well around electronics being a small example. Healing magic is (theorized) to be temperamental, and even dangerous at times--- much like our technology is temperamental and dangerous at times. Potions can often help, but not always cure. You take a sleeping draught like you take nighttime medication, but that doesn't cure all the insomnia for the rest of your life.

Note; I'm only bringing this up, because I've seen some strangeness in fics that will pull me out of the story if it's too wildly explained.

If I see one more story with “muggle cigarettes”, I might lose my mind. The cultures were different, but there were overlaps. I'm pretty sure wizards still had combs, and toothpaste. They still had to cook, they couldn't just poof a meal from nothing.

****** I agree with pretty much all of it.

The swish thing was mostly a joke. And the reason I want Ron to know random muggle stuff is because they inhabit the same world. So Ron should have some peripheral knowledge.

But he is a 11 year old kid, growing in a post war society. A society that is mired in providing an explanation as well as justification for their pro-bloodlines sentiment.

So, the propaganda will leak into art and literature. Especially a comic about "Mad Muggle". In my story, mad muggle is this unfortunate chap, who is a bit simple, mostly harmless (propaganda- muggles are simple, they need a master), who always gets stuck in some situation or another.

Muggles having something as natural as anxiety, which every human has, being portrayed as a muggle thing is also another silly thing included in Mad Muggle. To put this idea of superiority of magic, without actually saying that. Sublime messaging and all that.

Which is basically saying all dogs are scooby doo. So, that's what Ron is using as a guide. As he goes through life, he will learn that people are people. Magical or otherwise.

I can see why it might not come off as that. I really wasn't writing this as a story. Just a one-shot.

******** I agree. And that is the plan. If I reach there. I find it weird that Ron, and other kids too, would be so flabbergasted by phones or pens. I mean, I understand, JKR had her reasons. But since I am writing this, I want a more intertwined, and more misunderstood worlds. I don't want Hermione or Harry to adjust as well as Ron to magic, either. Because formative years can help with lot of conditioning. So, I want the trio to help each other grow into this.

I also plan to slow down the friendship plan.. and I don't know.. I have all these ideas for plot. But I am basically writing and seeing what fits.

But yeah, that is definitely the plan. I want to show and not tell. Ron has weird ideas about muggles, that seem harmless, but are dangerous. And it is okay, as long as he is willing to learn better. I also want to bring Draco and Neville as contrast. But like I said, I won't know the direction until I am writing it.

I posted the story on ao3 with 3 new chapters.

** Evil is remarkable banal. You wouldn't say it, looking at comic strips where Evil is as comfortable far away from the average viewer as is reasonable possible, but it really is more about snatching the last piece of bread, /knowing/ someone will go hungry tonight. Evil is giving that last kick in someones stomach, in some darkened corner of a hidden room (after everybody else was already gone but surely you didn't hurt him much?). Evil is not even bothering naming the person in your head, althought... Evil is forgetting they exist after a house-fire. Oh, it wasn't on /purpose/. Nothing as clever as that. It was, however, frighteningly easy to be on your way to a new home, glad everyone survived, before thinking 'shit, we forgot the Freak!' It is.

The Freak in question (AKA the Boy, Boy-Who-lived, Harry Potter), was remarkable dense in some aspects of his life (pretty much anything Dursley-related). It helped that his annual letter arived the day after the fire, and that he was used to strange dreams. He quickly forgot about his dreams of the fire, and moved on to Hogwarts. His one true home at last. He didn't eat much, unlike the previous years, but that could be attributed to stress, and grieve, and thousand other things. Nobody noticed him skipping more meals, caught up as they were in ever-new adventures. Nobody noticed -at first- when his shadow disappeared, once, on a moonlit night. He didn't sleep, but that, too, could be explained. The nightmares (or he was just mental. Something involving a chicken and a egg, in most minds). He jerked away from touch, which /wasn't/ unusual really. So nobody, including the dear departed himself, was aware he was dead. Not even Dumbledore seemed to suspect (though it is impossible to guess, even now, how much that man knows and suspects). Hermione, who didn't believe anything that wasn't properly detailed in books before, managed to miss all the clues. No, it was Ron who, on a late moonlit adventure (in which they all hoped the only adventure would be kicking Mrs. Norris, the caretakers cat) noticed that Harry had lost his shadow. And then, that he glided through a stair and went on again. In the magic world, at least, names have Power. Even -or maybe especially- nicknames. They are part of a identity, a identity self-chosen or chosen by others (in a way, Peter had always been doomed to rat out, just as Remus had been to be bitten). And Harry was (reluctantly) the Boy-who-Lived. He just wasn't alive anymore.

** Reminds me of The First in /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, who could take on the image of a dead person, but couldn't personally interact.

There was a thought for a while that Giles was maybe The First. No one had touched him, there was always some sort of buffer preventing it: someone stepping in the way of a hug or him asking someone else to hand something to some one, etc.

*** Well, ghosts aren't well-defined in the Harry Potter universe. Maybe a ghost's physical appearance is a reflection of their inner projection of themselves, and since Harry grows up around Dudley, he thinks he needs to grow up too, so he also appears to age and get older, because not doing so would be freakish?

** There's a version of this I read once, and I'll prob never find again. Harry dies at the durslys, but because of the prophecy, he was just a ghost inhabiting his dead body.

so he goes to hogwarts as an animated rotting corpse

** How do you propose to solve

- The sorting hat? It would be kinda obvious that he's a phantom when it falls right through him. The teachers especially would instantly know. for that matter, all other objects, like clothing and books and bags and potion ingredients?

- his wand? ghosts can't handle real objects, and peeves isn't a ghost, he's a poltergeist. Not a real soul, but an amagamation of chaotic forces given life by magic.

- his magic? Even if he can hold a wand (perhaps the bond between wand and wizard is strong enough for the wand to join him in the spirit world, or the wand basically "dies" and harry picks up the ghost of his wand, god that's a weird concept), ghosts can't do magic. At least not on the real world. Don't think pretending to be extremely bad would work for long.

He could just be really bad at everything until he gets to Wingardium Leviosa, and then just TKs that?

** Brilliant idea, though it would be difficult to get him as far as Hogwarts. He presumably couldn't hold a wand, after all.

** First problem i see with this is that the Dursleys wouldn't be able to see him if he was a ghost as muggles can't see ghosts. Also, wouldn't him dying still leave a body behind?
