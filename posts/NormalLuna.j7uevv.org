I'd like some fics where Luna is a genuinely normal girl.

No death-induced trauma, no believing in strange creatures, no fourth-wall-breaking, no /seer-/stuff, no nymphomaniacal Luna. She doesn't know everything about you off the bat, and she doesn't act like she's high 24/7. She isn't omnipotent, -present, or -scient.

None of that wack shit.

A normie Luna, if you will.


** I have to wonder, without the death-induced trauma, is Luna still Luna?

*** I think she would be, honestly. Luna was nine when her mother died - before that, the child already has some personality.

*** Apparently. Someone down in another thread had complained about it, and I'm taking no chances.

** Luna is a quirky if lonely and traumatized girl. She's not a seer. She's not a sex addict. She's not a caricature seen in parodies like R' Blot's stories.

Now, do I think such a lonely girl would gravitate towards stronger personalities and presences, like Harry's? Yes. Could that influence, e.g. peer pressure, change the direction her life goes in, intentionally or not? Yes.

*** I know - looking for stories where she isn't that, maybe where her mother survives and she's not traumatized.

I'm not advocating for those descriptions, lol.
