I am looking for a Harem/time travel fic. In it, I believe at the start of the story, Harry and his Harem are babies and toddlers, except for Tonks. Tonks and the harem visit toddler Harry. They're all time travelers. James and Lily are alive. Anyone know what this is?


** Uhm, something like what you have described is in the ending scenes of linkffn(Lets do the Time Warp Again by Rorschach's Blot)

  "While you were out dozens of babies popped in with their parents . . . all of them girls,"

  "Lily's been recruiting again?" James nodded, "I guess that makes sense."

  "They came on their own," Sirius shuddered. "Some of the families were muggles . . . the kids used accidental magic to get in."

  "Oh," James blinked.

  "Some of them can talk and they told Lily that they're in Harry's Harem," Sirius shuddered. "She's happy but . . ."
