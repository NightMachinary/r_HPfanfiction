AutoModerator should now be set up to automatically flair your posts based on the title.

If you begin the title of your post with the flair type in brackets like this: =[Discussion] Some Awesome Topic= then it should be automatically flaired. It'll match some other variants too, but for the sake of simplicity that's what I recommend.

"NSFW" anywhere in the title will also automatically flag it as NSFW.


** Favor be upon you
