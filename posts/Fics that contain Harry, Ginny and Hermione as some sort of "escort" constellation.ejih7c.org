I saw a Picture with Daniel, Bonnie and Emma by some Event and i thought "wow, such a Picture in a HP Fanfic, maybe with the same occassion".

It can be some event thats held to celebrate something or whatever. Harry, Ginny and Hermione participate in this. I would like if both Women escort him and may not be in (canon) relation with him. I wouldnt mind, if its an AU.

Although i prefer no Pair fics, i accept H/G, H/Hr or H/G/Hr

Possible Lemon scenes or fics are welcome


** I'm not entirely sure what you're asking for, I'm afraid. What's an escort constellation?

**** Ah. So, a fic where Hermione and Ginny are each both on Harry's arm at an event celebrating something, ideally as friends, but they'd accept pairings at a stretch?

*** what i had in mind would be, that all 3 of them are going to this event or Harry didnt want to, but Ginny and Hermione convinced him to go. Whether or not he has fun on aaid event, all 3 of them are there. Either the 2 Women have escorted Harry or all 3 have escorted each other....if i may say so.

and yes, i would prefer no pairs, but accept them aswell.

**** Ah, okay. Hmm. I think I might actually have something for that. I'll poke through my list and check.

I recall more with Harry and Daphne though, Pureblood Political Partying being more common in that pairing and all.
