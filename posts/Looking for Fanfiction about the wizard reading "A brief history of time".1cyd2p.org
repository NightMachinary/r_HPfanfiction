As a friend of me said:

#+begin_quote
  There must be fanfiction about that guy. [[http://imgur.com/gallery/wq607TJ]]
#+end_quote

And really, now that someone pointed out how many rules he breaks in this universe. (INB4 books are not movies) I want to know if anyone actually tried to write fanfiction about this guy. I've been searching around a bit for myself but I couldn't find anything.


** I hereby nominate the picture of this wizard as the inspiration for [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]'s first-ever promptfest.

To make it easy:

- Maximum word count is 5,000 words.

- Rating: G - PG-13 (nothing ultra-mature this time; there are minors here).

- Due date: May 31, 2013.

- If you write a fic, you can either post it here, or post it on an outside page like [[http://www.fanfiction.net][ff.net]] and give the link.

How about it?

(edit: sorry, I don't know how to make line breaks.) (edit 2: thanks for showing me the way, kortech3!)

I honestly don't know why.

**** That's why I thought keep it under 5,000 words. But I bet lots of people have finals next month. Maybe the "due date" should be just a suggestion, so we can actually turn in our fics any time.

*** YES! I'm in.

By the way, I posted earlier this year about doing a Luna Lovegood fanfiction. I'm still planning on doing one, it's just that life has gotten in the way.

... but that doesn't mean that the idea can't be used again and improved upon.
