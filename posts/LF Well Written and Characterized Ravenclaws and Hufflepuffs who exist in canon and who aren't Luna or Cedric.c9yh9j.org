  Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. [Set during Deathly Hallows.]

** "Goldstein" is a story about Anthony "Yehuda" Goldstein and the trials and tribulations he faces being an Orthodox Jew at Hogwarts.

I found this to be not only a neat look at the Ravenclaws in Harry's year, but also a very interesting take on how religion is handled at Hogwarts... I mean, JKR basically said that you could find pretty much any religious beliefs at Hogwarts, so this fic tries to show what that might entail for students whose religious beliefs are a little more deeply-held. It's also kind of nice to read a story that takes place in Harry's year, where the main characters are students who barely interact with Harry at all.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.
