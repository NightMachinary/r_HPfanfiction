What happens if you shoot a dragon with an Avada Kedavra? I dont think you could kill a dragon with an AK due to its magically resistant flesh. Maybe if you hit the Dragon in the eye, you could kill it... but it takes 12 stunners just to subdue it.... what do you all think?

** It's not explored in canon. Some fics have it completely unstoppable, even going through barriers. Some have it be a utilitarian spell that instantly kills every living thing including animals. Some have it be based on hate where someone who didn't really want to kill someone else could hit them with an AK and not even hurt them. Some have it based on power where if their magic isn't greater than the other beings, nothing happens.

** In canon Dumbledore stops an AK coming towards Harry by animating a centaur statue. We can assume that dragon hide can take a lot more than whatever the statue was made of. So to kill a dragon, you might need to find a weak spot between it's scales.

From what I understand from the books, there is no magical barrier/shield that can stop AK and no spell can reverse it's affect. It doesn't mean you can't block it with other physical objects like chairs, walls etc. It would make no sense if you take cover behind a wall and still get hit buy an AK going through physical obstacles.

Edit: Targeting eye could work but it will be very hard task. It's a very large creature so you need distance between youself and the dragon for safety and then send a spell to a very tiny spot.

****** Oh, then I don't think they're protected. Maybe other people were right that it's the scales. That's often how it is in fairy tales- the dragon's scales are so strong that the hero has to dislodge one to actually puncture the dragon.

******** 1. Dragons don't seem to be endangered. "Dragon reserves" seem to be more for the purpose of keeping them out of trouble than preserving their numbers.

2. Dragons are huge; you could get a lot of hide off a single dragon.

3. The wizard population seems to be pretty small. You wouldn't need a labour-intensive system, just a few hunters/ scavengers gathering materials.

**** I'd imagine the dragon's scales are resistant because its magic is actively imbuing its body with power. Dead dragon scales (i.e. armor) wouldn't have that magic powering them, so it'd be solely a physical line of defense.

That said, AK (in the books) seems to destroy whatever it comes into contact with other than human flesh, so wearing many layers of clothing seems like it would be a more effective defense against AK.

***** I agree. Dragon hide or scales probably only work as a defense while the dragon is alive. That is, if you wear dragon hide, it will probably still protect you from minor curses, but not a Killing Curse.

And since you can (I think) block AK with stone and such, even if it gets destroyed, maybe you should wear stone armour. I mean, you probably couldn't move, and you'd basically be a building, but hey :-)

**** I guess repeated assault with AK will damage dragon hide, just like it blew up the head of centaur statue. So maybe you can take 1-2 hit.

IIRC, that centaur statue was made of gold. It's not unreasonable to assume that the Killing Curse, which, as the name suggests, is designed to kill, can penetrate /living tissue/ (like the dragon's scales) but is reflected off metals, which it cannot /kill/.

What exactly she did isn't well understood or explained, but it was a one off thing most likely. Common knowledge in the books is that AK can't be blocked.

When 16 years old Tom Riddle hears about it he says "yes, that's a powerful counter-charm". It isn't common knowledge, but it's not a one-off thing, and it's pretty well explained. It's the same with Horcruxes: a wizard who has one can survive the Killing Curse, but of course most wizards don't know about them, so they think no one can survive it.

** Well, killing such a massive beast with a single spell would be anticlimactic. You could come up with various explanations as to why it wouldn't work - perhaps AK doesn't work on animals, for example.
