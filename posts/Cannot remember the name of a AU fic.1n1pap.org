Ok so over at [[/r/harrypotter]] someone asked for AU fanfiction suggestion and I instantly thought of this fic I read but I cannot find it after much google searching. I am actually pretty sure I found this fanfic through this subreddit, but I search many different wordings and couldn't find it. If any of this rings a bell for anyone that would be great!

*Here are the details I remember:*

- Harry wakes up and his parents have never died, he retains his memories of his 'real' life.

- In order for Harry to have been saved, Lily and James agree to follow Voldemort. Harry does not have the best relationship with his mother (like most teenagers).

- Harry has siblings, however I cannot remember how many siblings or genders.

- Harry is best friends with Draco Malfoy, they grew up together and are very close, and they are in Slytherin together. In this fic Draco malfoy does not want to be a death eater.

- Harry is not friends with Hermione and Ron, and Ron hates Harry much like he hates Draco in Canon


** Haha I actually just read this story, and I'm halfway through the sequel on my kindle as I type this.

The story is Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions, sequel to HP and the Psychic Serpent, prequel to HP and the Triangle Prophecy, all by Barb.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/70312/Barb-LP][Link to ff.net page]].

To round out the details you can't remember:

James did die, Lily married Snape. This happened because Voldie convinced Harry to help him change the timelines with the Tempus Bonum Voluntatis spell.\\
Harry and Lily have a rough relationship, Harry has a much better time with Snape and his younger brothers, the twins Simon and Stuart Snape, as well as his younger sister Jamie Potter.\\
In this fic none of them really WANT to be death eaters, but there's magic afoot that mucks that up.\\
In the mucked up timeline, Hermione and the other muggleborns are never invited to Hogwarts at all.

It's a pretty good trilogy. PS is great, ToGI is pretty good. The third book is ok so far... I hope it picks up soon, as it's mostly love triangle angst at the moment. That's my biggest complaint about the series actually. Every book has a super complicated somewhat contrived love triangle/angst angle that takes forever to resolve. And every time it's about to be handled, someone takes an innocuous comment or innocent happenstance WAY TOO MUCH to heart and suddenly it's like someone murdered their mum. But the first two books didn't focus on it as much as the third has so far, so hopefully that will clear up soon.

Oh and just for clarity's sake, Psychic Serpent is a 5th year story written before book 5 came out. So ToGI and TP are 6th/7th year stories in that established universe. Because of this, certain things are assumed and other things don't happen like canon- for one example, Sirius is alive and well in Harry's 7th year.

*** Good call. The Psychic Serpent trilogy is pretty great. I think ToGI was my favorite.

****** Yeah check out the author's fanfiction.net author page. There's a link to her web site, which has ebook versions of the stories.

Among other things, it also has some more recent editing. No major changes, but I know the story on her site is the "preferred version."

****** I can't remember where I got them from, but somewhere out there are downloadable PDF's of all three books. After that I just run them through [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] to convert from .pdf==>.mobi
