** It would be hilarious if Harry had no clue and all of this played out during canon events.

Example: Fleur conspires with the merpeople to have them kill Harry after rescuing his hostage but because Harry took Gabrielle the merpeople couldn't follow up with her plan. Cue to Gabrielle gushing about her hero while Fleur curses her fifteenth failed attempt.

*** The Allure could be established as an evolutionary defense mechanism, and anyone who can outright and effortlessly bypass an entire race's ultimate defense could be considered a threat, regardless of intention. Or you could go the tradition or prophecy route, where folktales are told of boogeymen, come once and will come again, resistant to Allure, who kidnap naughty children ‘round Christmas time, or something. Not hard to find reasons for Fleur to perceive him this way; also important to note that he doesn't actually have to be a threat to Veela kind, he just has to /appear/ as such to Fleur in particular.
