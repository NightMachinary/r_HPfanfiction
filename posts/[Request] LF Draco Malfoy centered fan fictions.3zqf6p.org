I've read some before where Draco gets really friendy with Harry and Ron and eventually even falls in love with Hermione, but it was a long time ago, I wanted something different this time.


** Only ever wrote one, and since I just posted it in another thread, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zqjrw/request_for_fanfic_where_harry_or_ron_fall_in/cyo9lic][here's the link.]] it's a one shot.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

  #+begin_example
            In which Draco Malfoy returns from the future and nearly falls the hell over\.
          "103: My commander is not old enough to have fought in the Civil War, and I should stop implying that he did\."\- 213 Things Skippy is No Longer Allowed to Do in the U\.S\. Army
          The first part of this fic — through the end of Draco's first year — was written entirely during National Novel Writing Month 2010, and has been edited only in the loosest sense of the term \(notes and such removed, bits about head crabs in the forbidden forest expunged, et cetera\)\. If Draco seems a bit OOC, realize that this Draco has been through all seven books as written in canon \(minus the epilogue; while I like little Scorpius, he's not exactly here, is he?\), and for his enlightened self\-interest is attempting to make a change\. He's still a little prat, and hopefully he'll grow a little more as the story goes on\. So there that is\.As I transfer this over to Ao3 from FF\.net, I'm also taking a stab at minor editing \-\- and I'm combining what was once "The Last Second Chance" with the beginnings of "Advancing To the Rear" and continuing from there\.

** It's a Dramione fic, and it focuses on both, but it is very good. Linkffn(Blind my eyes, sew them shut). I also have a simpler Draco one shot if interested linkffn(Spectra of Grey).

Edit: trying to get links to work

  *CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION.* /Now Updated to Ch.14:/ When Lucius Malfoy is forced to make a difficult decision, he gives his only son up to the Order of the Phoenix in hopes that they will protect him from Voldemort. With nowhere else to go, Draco is stuck living at the Burrow with the Weasley's. But when a new witch from America moves in too, things start to get... /interesting./

This one is all about the father-son relationship between Draco & Lucius Malfoy. The story is currently under revision, but it is REALLY good!! I read it back in the day when it was first published, but ever since she started re-writing it, it has gotten SO MUCH better!!! This story will actually make you feel sorry for the Malfoys. It is so heartbreaking, yet so addicting and full of all the Draco feels. It really gives good insight into what Draco's life could have been like, and the characters are all written so well! If you love Draco Malfoy as much as I do, then this is a must read!! ;)

Also, if you check out the Author's page, there are several One-Shots centered around the same little world that she has created. I wouldn't really recommend reading past the *"Stopping Point"* that she has set up on the story, but if you're that hooked it isn't really that difficult to follow. The quality of writing just isn't as up to par with the edited chapters, as those were all posted back in 2009 and her writing has most definitely improved over the past 7 years, lol! Happy reading though. Hope you enjoy this one as much as I do!! =)

**** Awesome!! Let me know what you think of it if you do check it out... I'm hoping that maybe if the story starts getting more attention, then she will hopefully start updating it more again. IDK tho, last time I PM'd her over on the HPFF forums, she was working 2 jobs and her laptop had gotten stolen. And a lot of notes and stuff she had for the story were saved on that laptop. So I just know that her RL situations were getting in the way of her writing. But that doesnt take awwy from the fact that all of the chapters that are currently up to date are super awesome tho!! ;)
