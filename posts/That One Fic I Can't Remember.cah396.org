**** Is it this one [[https://www.quotev.com/story/9108774/Harriet-Potter-and-the-Philosophers-Stone/1]] ? That's actually different story (it is not a very original idea for a name). Full gender bender is just a bad idea, anyway.

linkffn(10924201) is closer to what you described.

  Fem!Harry Abused!Harry Picked up again after a 2 year Hiatus. Basically the first book but with a mentally scarred Harrie who doesn't realize that she won't be beat for using her freakishness, making friends, or having things that belong to her, though that last one she's still comprehending. But she's got a house of Hufflepuffs, and some Slytherins to teach her what family means.
