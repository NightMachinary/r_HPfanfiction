Hello all. I'm looking for a specific fic that I read once, but can't recall the name of. This is one where Voldemort is kept alive through the Dark Marks of his Death Eaters. Specific points I recall about the fic:

- Post-OoTP, so Sirius is dead.

- The magic of the Dark Mark is based on dementors, and tethers the souls of the marked to the Mark's caster.

- Voldemort developed the Mark with two or three classmates. One died/was killed by Voldemort, another trapped in a cabin in dementor infested woods.

- Dumbledore teaches Harry a form of deep Legilimency that goes into the soul. This soulscape is designed by the person's unconcious, and reflects parts of who they are, and contains representations of people they know who had an effect on their lives. Harry's soulscape-thing was an inconstruction Hogwarts.

- In order to learn the types of symbolism, logic and nature of these kinds of soulscape places, Harry practices on Snape.

- At some point, Harry, Ron and Hermione meet the Dark Mark co-creator trapped in the cabin.

- There's a bit of a side plot dealing with the creation of a new, Stasi-like secret police/anti-Dark Wizards department to the Ministry, and their fascist, totalitarian regime-like nature and tactics.

- Turns out Voldemort can't be killed while anyone Marked is alive. Harry has to descend into Voldemort's soulscape and kill the Death Eaters there, before being able to kill Voldemort.

- I'm fairly certain Malfoy turns spy for Snape.

- The final battle type dealio occurs at the Ministry, and Snape tries to kill as many Death Eaters as possible, to make Harry's task easier.

- Somehow, Harry severs the connection between Snape and Voldemort, so Snape survives when he should be dead as a doorknob.

- Harry ends up joining the Aurors, and he and Snape revitalize the department.

- May actually be two fics

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry's mental link to Voldemort is stronger than ever. Can Snape teach him to control the nightmarish visions? And is their connection the key to ending Voldemort's reign?
