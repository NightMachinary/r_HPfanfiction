** My biggest problem with bashing is that it's an excuse for an author to not worry about characters he or she doesn't particularly like; just grossly exaggerate all their negative aspects, forgo all the good and possibly add a few more negative traits here and there, then do nothing but remind the audience that these characters are bad. Bonus points if Harry gets to scream at Dumbledore in all caps, and you get a secret prize if you manage to make Dumbledore look incompetent and unable to handle a teenager hurling profanity at him.

It is, simply put, nothing more than a means by which the author can ignore good, human character development that would actually make said characters interesting to read. It's isolating all negative aspects (something which every character in HP has) and focusing on them entirely, instead of developing a character that the author might not like much, so that by the end of the story, they're in a different place.

Nothing good comes from bashing from a reader's perspective, because the biggest dickbag that a person /would/ subject to bashing in real life does not make for an interesting character in a fictional story. If you want to have a really bad person in a story, fine, but make it good. Make readers /like/ them for being bad.

Or you could go the easy route and bash them with reckless abandon, making them wholly incompetent along the way. Do you feel some twisted sense of justice thanks to that?

**** I think we might have our definitions confused then. I've nothing against showing a character in a negative light (even very positive characters in canon, like the Weasleys), in fact I welcome it if it's done well.

To me, bashing has always been, well, exactly that: as if you had an action figure of a character you didn't like, and bashed it on your desk just because you /hate them that much/. I think the very large majority of people who you will ask will confirm this; bashing is exactly what it is, /bashing/ disliked characters without grace. That's why it's seen as a terrible means to write a fic.

If we're talking about Dark/Evil tropes applied on good characters, that's a story for another thread.

But I mostly started reading fanfiction well after Deathly Hallows (even after the movies, in fact), so it's entirely possible that some early to mid 2000s fics might explore bashing in a more interesting way.

** First off, everybody should enjoy whatever. It really doesn't matter, especially not when it comes to fanfiction.

Bashing is objectively bad writing and thats why people don't like it. It also doesn't help that there are some huge followings on bash-fics while well thought out, brilliantly written fics have half of the followers. As a writer, I'm a bit salty about it, since I try to make my characters interesting, give the antagonists as much attention as the protagonists and so on (not saying I succeed, but still). Bash-fics don't have to do that. Actually if bash fics did that they would stumble over their own logic.

/However/, as a consumer, I do like the occasional bash-fic. Why? Well, probably for the same reasons I like the Transformers movies. Its trashy entertainment with no thought requirement whatsoever, because the characters, the plot, the scenes and the dialogues are one-dimensional and easy to follow. Having Harry roflstomp Dumbledore and consorts is something of a guilty-pleasure of mine, I admit.

**** I've been around HP fandom for a fairly long time, and I've never seen bashing fics referred to as manipulative!Dumbledore. They've always just been called bashing fics, partly because bashing is an equal-opportunity trope. In fact, I've noticed far more Weasley bashing than Dumbledore bashing. And since Deathly Hallows, manipulative!Dumbledore has become a tag signaling an exploration of Albus' morally grey aspects or choices, not used as a synonym for bashing.

I don't read bashing fics because I'm fond of most HP characters and don't like seeing them made into idiots or cartoon villains or gold-diggers or written so completely OOC that I might as well be reading original fic. Hate is boring, but I realize that's a matter of personal taste, and some people do get a kick out of it. It usually feels as if the fic is more about the writer than the characters, though. There's often a kind of - I don't know, childish glee and over-the-top quality about the writing.

Also, just one data point, of course, but every bashing fic I've tried has been badly written, predictable, and utterly implausible, which is the real reason I don't read them. And like Pashow above, I make a distinction between dark!fic and bashing. Some dark!fic is excellent. There may be an excellent bash!fic out there, but I have yet to encounter it.)

****** Oh, yeah, I'm aware of that. I mean I've never run across the term "manipulative!Dumbledore" as a code word for bashing. From the start, plenty of people questioned Dumbledore's treatment of Harry and were intrigued enough to write critically rather than take the wise, kind, twinkly mentor at face value. I suspect those fics would seem dated now, but they weren't necessarily bash!fics.

**** Hmm... lets see.

I actually have a bit of trouble putting it in words. It is definitely not merely making a formely good character an antagonist. I'm also pretty sure this is not what people nowadays refer to as "bashing".

Bashing, for me, is when the target of the bashing is portrayed as having no plans, no logic and no critical thinking.

Prime example is the bash-Dumbledore that wonders, most often in internal monologue, how his well planned plot could have failed. Of course, just a chapter before we read about the most idiotic plan in the history of mankind where Ginny pours Harry some lovepotion and gets caught, or something like that. Then the reader is told that Dumbledore (one of, if not the most important politician and easily most knowledgable wizard of Britain, equipped with life experience en masse and otherwise intelligent human) thinks its a good plan to talk with Harry and appeal to his sense of duty /after/ his manipulations were seen through. Of course he then gets trashed by a fifteen year old in the following argument.

Its simply the reduction of a complex character to one-dimensional, cardboard-practice-target that I would see as bashing. Rons jealousy /can/ lead him to stand against Harry, but it is /not/ the only trait that makes his character, to name just another example.

To wrap this up: I'm all for making good characters, bad. Its often an interesting twist. I am, however, strongly against reducing the character to a single concept or emotion. Thats just lazy and abysmal writing.

** Because most bashing leads to sloppy, one-dimensional characterization. Beyond that, the author sometimes uses a character as a strawman for or against (in this case, 99.9% against) an issue they feel passionate about. You mention the Weasleys being poor and pureblood... But they're also outspoken blood-traitors. It doesn't lead to them being super open-minded, but... I can't remember there ever being any specific incidence in canon leading to the conclusion that they would be extremely prejudiced.

#+begin_quote
  (in my ships it usually included homophobia and sexism....which makes sense with their family goven Molly being the only major female who is..... a stay at home mother with a whimpy daughter who is thirsty for BWL fame and fortune and Ron who is obsessed with everything Harry has that he doesn't.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure whose perception this is. Yours? It really doesn't matter, I guess. I'm not sure what Molly's stay-at-home motherhood has to do with anything. She's fussy and overbearing and bashing fics tend to exaggerate that to absurd levels. And the interpretation of Ginny is very bizarre because, yeah, she's admittedly a strangely developed character, but there's nothing to suggest she's thirsty for BWL fame and fortune and she was wimpy when she was a child, but I fail to see how that makes bashing okay. As for Ron, he isn't a perfect person, and he's still a growing and developing person through-out the series. Literally any flaw that any character has in the series can be magnified and exaggerated to absurd proportions by any idiot.

That being said, bashing is a cheap device to make other characters look good/cool/smart/open-minded/sympathetic in comparison. Hardly anything that should be praised. But to each their own, I guess.

  It is also highlighting the perception of characters in early fics because books had not yet been published... So it wasn't that crazy or awful to see characters writted a certain way because it was - at the time - consistent within the universe they developed in their fics...
#+end_quote

That's a great point and not something that I'd thought of. It would make sense that the habit of bashing characters would be perpetuated in later or even post-series fics, too, because how prevalent and long-lasting fanon interpretations can be.

  The Weasley family is a great example of gender role characterisation for fics...

**** I consider the characterizations of basically everyone in OotP and the following two books too shitty to adhere to. You could call it bashing even - Ron certainly got reduced from a kid so brave, he was repeatedly ready to lie down his life for a friend at 11-13, to a guy ditching his friends because he was hungry. Dumbledore was reduced to a guy willing to let innocent children crippled or even killed just to protect Draco.

Not to mention all the idiot balls handed out so the plot could remain on the tracks.

Actually, scratch that cos Dumbledore's secretly evil as well."

**** It's not about you specifically, it's about the concept of bashing as a whole and the sort of author who would make use of it. If you don't want to write a story with canon pairings, that's cool. You're /allowed/ to do that. Heck, I ship Harry/Luna myself.

The point is that there's much better ways to develop a new pairing for a story than to just force two characters together via bashing. Just say that Harry and Ginny never dated, and that Harry just happens to be gay, and you can have Drarry without making half of the character cast appear inhumane.

****** Bashing, in H/Hr's case, is more about writers taking the easy way out and throwing two characters together by making everyone else awful, than it is them actually giving Harry and Hermione proper development to a point where they can get into a relationship. Either way, H/Hr just happens to be the most common culprit of Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore bashing, so people tend to use it as example.

That being said, bashing is usually a supremely lazy writing tool, meant to wring out more reviews from militant readers who have a grudge against a person who doesn't exist, for some reason or another. And when bashing is in a fic, you can typically expect the rest of the fic to be shite, too, because it speaks volumes about their standard of writing. There are probably some notable exceptions, but, by and large, they're pretty bad.

******** You know, I don't want to sound like a jerk, but bashing as it is today is not a trope. It is an action. Tropes are fine; bashing is ... something else.

Admittedly there are stories with bashing of some sort that are actually readable; I will note though that in most cases those stories have bashing for the sake of comedy, as an acknowledged caricature of a critique of the character's flaws. Stories that have bashing played seriously, on the other hand, tend to suck; there might be exceptions to that but I've yet to read any notable ones.

That being said, I do not know what the definition of bashing was those ten or so years ago, but nowadays bashing pretty much means making a shallow caricature out of a character for the sake of portraying them as bad and irredeemable. Basically an “I don't like this character so I'm going to make them much worse even if it doesn't make sense” kind of thing. That's what it is nowadays. So manipulative Dumbledore, for example, isn't synonymous with bashing as it is known today; no, you can write a story in which it actually makes sense for him to behave in such a way and it won't be bashing, just how he is; heck, I will note that he was manipulative to some degree in the original story.

Oh, and for the sake of making it clear, I will note that I am not a shipper, and for as long as it's written in a way that makes sense I can read any pairing. So I never stopped reading a story because a pairing wasn't to my liking; I did, however, stop reading stories that bashed (as the current meaning goes) characters, basically making them into caricatures so shallow that I simply couldn't enjoy the story any more.

** Because it's immature and should not even be considered a "real story" but rather an angry rant about some of the characters. There's no substance to bash!fics. None whatsoever.

For example, bashing Ginny and Ron just in order to get Harry and Hermione together is just proof that the author is just a denialistic and pissed off shipper. Even if it were just for the purpose of bashing and nothing else is still silly.

EDIT: Bashing is a very common trope in H/Hr shipping. And it was just an example, I'm aware that it happens in other ships, thank you.

** From reading these posts and my own thoughts, it seems that an xyz-bashing fic 10+ years ago may be more properly branded an evil!xyz or similar in the current Fanfic environment according to fennecfoxer.

However, More recent xyz bashing fics tend towards 1 dimensional bashed characters that serve to push the protagonist to new friends or new mentors. These fics tend to have overall lazy or bad characterizations For ALL characters, and often have weak plot as well. They read like a middle schooler ranting about how horrible one of there classmates is since they asked their crush to the dance first.

This recent trend is what leads to the bashing of bashing fics on the subreddit. Without guidance, most bashing fics you find today will be poorly written "tropes", and as such (like with most fanfiction), many will give up on the bashing genre before finding the few good needles in the haystack

** At first blush, one may think that there was some progress made here, with the explanation that "bashing" is "bad" when it reduces some character to a "one dimensional villain," which is "objectively bad writing." It's then "not bashing" and "not bad" if you simply highlight a character's "negative attributes," but still ensuring that they are "complex."

Sounds good, huh?

There's just one problem with that... how "complex" was Voldemort? Bellatrix?

How about Umbridge??

Complex villains are definitely more interesting. Darth Vader was more interesting when we learned that he was a good guy who went bad, as opposed to just being a faceless bad guy.

But we don't demand that all our villains be incredibly complex. I don't see any complaints about "bashing" Voldemort or Umbridge because they weren't complex enough, or because the author didn't take time to explore any good characteristics.

Some authors do try to present such villains in a more balanced manner, so we know it can be done and we know that it can help make for a better story.

So what's the deal?

I think it's fairly simple: people accept bashing of characters they don't much like and whine when they see bashing of characters they do like. Bashing Umbridge is acceptable; treating Ginny, Molly, Ron, or Dumbledore the same way isn't.

It may be true that "bashing" produces a story that isn't as good, but bringing this up is more rationalization than reason - otherwise, the criticism would be made more consistently and evenly.

** I can only speak for myself, but it might be the fact that bashing fics pretty much always have the bashed characters act out-of-character, and I generally like characters (with the exception of Harry) to stay in-character, at least in serious fics. I don't mind bashing in crack/humor fics, as long as it's done funnily, which sadly, rarely occurs.

Bashing takes complex, round characters, and discards all of their good characteristics, while intensifying their flaws, to make weak, uninteresting, one-dimensional villains. They also usually portray the protagonists as the epitome of all that is good and just. It's childish and pathetic way of looking at the world, any world.
