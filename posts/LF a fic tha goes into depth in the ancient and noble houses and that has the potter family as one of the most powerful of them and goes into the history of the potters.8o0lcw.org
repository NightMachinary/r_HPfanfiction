I'm going to stop posting any links to anything until the powers that be get their bugs fixed. When folks can't use vanilla browsers and default settings, it's not worth my time.

  This is smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Grey Harry; Manipulative! Dumbledore; Harry/Daphne
