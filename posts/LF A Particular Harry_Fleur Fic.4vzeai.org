I don't remember much except the first chapter or two. It has them meeting at the quidditch world cup, and if I recall, it was a literal [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello][Crash Into Hello]]. I remember that they had an instant mutual crush thing going on, and that the fic had a few of the usual cliches, such as Fleur's father being high up in the French ministry (which leads to her being in the box with Harry during the game) and Harry having a more or less total immunity to Veela allure. I also remember that during the Death Eater raid, Harry rescued either Fleur or Gabrielle from being carried off. (Again, typical cliches.)

Any help?

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

*** Just as a warning to anyone new to this story, it's abandoned. The final chapter is an extended AN explaining where the story was headed.

If I remember correctly, Harry is also a bit of an arsehole in this fic, so if you don't like edgy harry, stay away.

** There's probably a dozen stories that fit that exact description, so you're probably going to have to be a bit more specific.
