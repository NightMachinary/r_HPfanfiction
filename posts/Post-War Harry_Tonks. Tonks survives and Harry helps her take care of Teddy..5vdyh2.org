I read this somewhere not too long ago and really liked the idea. I haven't read anything like that and I'm not sure it even exists, but I'm definitely hoping.

I'd also go for some post-war Honks without Teddy, but the first option would make me a very happy man.

Hope it's this. It was pretty easy to find.

I am hoping you haven't already read this. I thought you were looking for this specific one. I haven't seen any others like this. Sorry

*** No, I haven't read it.

I also haven't really asked for a specific one. I've just never read one with this concept and would take any fic dealing with it.

You da real MVP. Thanks.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5419713/1/][Here's]] one that kind of fits, though Teddy is more of an accessory to the plot rather than the driving motivation. Be warned that it's unfinished, and judging by the pace I think the writer only got maybe 1/3rd of the way through it.

That said, the writing is great and there are some very original takes on old concepts, some expanding on cannon, some taking things in a whole new direction. Bonus points because it involves Queen Elizabeth II in a totally boss way.

***** Hey, don't hurry for me. I just flick through your fanfiction collection, picking out reading material for the next month or so. IfI eventually find that Harry/Tonks thing I'll have probably added a good three dozen other fics to my "To-Read list" along the way.
