Right so, I remember a story on FFN in like 2010ish, where Hermione somehow partnered up with Snape (or possibly Draco) to investigate some dark magic happenings.

I think it had something to do with House Elves being sacrificed..? There were murdered magic folk.

It was pretty gritty and I'm sure a romance.

Does anyone have any idea of the fix I'm searching for?
