:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1) Hermione has left the Wizarding world and works in some small cafe in Ireland (i think, or some other place). Harry has spent years looking for her and stumbles upon her. Now that he's found her he's determined to take her back but she doesn't want anything to do with magic. Everything that is remotely related to her time in the Wizarding world including her wand is kept hidden in a trunk inside her room (some secret place in her room i think, don't recall clearly.)

2) Hermione has a son (which may be Harry's and he's not told about it). No on is in contact with her except Minerva McGonagall. Her son is sent to Hogwarts where Harry is currently a professor (even Neville is I think). No one tells Harry who the parents are and Minerva also refuses to tell Harry that she's in touch with Hermione.

Harry manages to teach the kid quidditch as well and feels a certain connection with the kid. The kid also writes home that Harry Potter is the one helping him. I think the kid is named James after Harry's father.

Would really appreciate help in finding these fics.


** I think 2 might be "Semper Fidelis" by Untold Harmony (a WiP)\\
