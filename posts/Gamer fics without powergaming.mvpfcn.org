I'm looking for fanfiction where Harry or the world in general run on RPG/gaming mechanics, but he isn't trying to abuse them. Rather than extract the highest possible stat bonus, he just plays the game.

It must be either complete or currently updating Slow updates are fine, as long as it's alive; one of my favorite fics updates every year or so.

I also won't read Harry/Death Eaters, past or present (that means Snape) without some /very/ believable character development or a backstory making them into less of a slimeball.

Examples:

linkffn(Eternal Fantasy by Silently Watches; Forged Destiny by Coeur al'Aran)

Eternal Fantasy

This one checks literally all the boxes for me; leveling up and classes but no minmaxing, a whole party of "gamers", interesting world, excellent grammar/spelling, complete.

Forged Destiny

A few differences here; notably, it is not a Harry Potter fic. The RPG part features rather less prominently, and it has some plot issues even I couldn't ignore, coming from an author who thinks that much of themself. Still, I enjoyed it and would love to read more like it.

  Without warning, the world changed in ways no Seer could predict. History erased. Maps rewritten. Modern life replaced by monsters, magic, and fantastical quests. Some people are happy with what the world has become, but others will stop at nothing to turn the clock back. Harry as a Final Fantasy--style adventurer, no game knowledge needed.

  Jaune had always dreamed of being a Hero, of being someone. But dreams were just that; for in the world of Remnant the Class you are born with determines your fate. Jaune was born a Blacksmith, and thus that was his destiny. But when a strange opportunity allows him to change that, can a simple Blacksmith become something more within the Beacon Academy for Heroes?
