Hi so I'm looking for a fanfic that I read about four ago. It was about Harry and Ginny and this connection that they had after he rescued her from the chamber of secrets. They can read each others minds, but at the beginning only Ginny is aware of it and she goes through hogwarts trapped in his head. It's really interesting and if anyone can help me find it that would be awesome! Thanks!


** You are thinking of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][Bonds of Blood]]?

If not, I'd like to know what it is, because that sounds pretty interesting. Also I suggest this one because it's good as well.

Edit for more.

*** This looks really interesting but I don't think that this is it. In the one I'm looking for only Ginny knows what's going on at the beginning. But thanks for the help!

** Gahh, I am sure I read this. Give me a bit and I'll try to find it. Do you remember if it was a completed story? There are a few I have read with this idea.

**** Gerr, now I am getting annoyed. I noticed below that you said only Ginny knows what is happening, and I seem to recall one like that, but no luck so far. Here is a couple anyway, just in case.

Here is one I have never read, but seems to have only Ginny knowing.
