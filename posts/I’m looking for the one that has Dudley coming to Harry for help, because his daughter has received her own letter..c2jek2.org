And of course, it's to Hogwarts.

I believe that he was actually happy with the idea, and he was not telling his parents about it either.

Any help would be appreciated!


** I believe its called *Perfectly Normal, Thank You Very Much.* and it also has a sequel about his daughter & Al becoming friends at Hogwarts.

you'd think I'd know how to summon the bot but alas, I am the worst.

**** I can't remember off the top of my head. I read this fic a while back. It's very possible I'm confusing two and thinking they are related when they're not.

edit: yep. I'm getting it confused with Dudley's Dilemma. Also a great read, unrelated to PNTYVM, but fits together in a canon way.
