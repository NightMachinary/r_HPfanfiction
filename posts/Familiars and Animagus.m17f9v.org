I find a depressing lack of Familiars and Animagus related magics in the fics I've read. It can be such a fun avenue for content but it seems that no one writes in into their fics and if they do it's interesting for a chapter then it takes a backseat.

If anyone has any fics that have Familiars and/or Animagus that would be excellent.

Preferably long stories, pairings are nice. Harry centric.


** CUDDLES!! (best familiar evar)

Still a WIP, but there are 55 chapters and it is active. This is my current favorite HP fic.

** Really? I swear every fic seems to include Animagus, at least for Harry and his minions, although it is often barely relevant to the plot. I have seen a few versions where Hedwig is his familiar, which is fun.

Relevant stories I can think of off the top of my head:

Alpha series linkffn(6389117) Slytherin Harry from year 1. Despite the title no cringe werewolf rubbish, it is about him bringing together all the students as friends. Harry-Ginny.

Linkffn(8769990) Second Chances Trilogy. Essentially gets adopted by the Greengrasses. Harry-Daphne, Hermione-Neville. All four get animagi which get some use and there is a bit of familiar stuff.

Linkffn(2488754) Second Chances at Life. Unfortunately third book abandoned after one chapter, but still worth reading. Basically original story loosely based on HP universe with some name dropping. Technically Harry main character but basically becomes complete OC. Gets a snarky snake familiar and Animagus is a central plot point.

** Linkffn(Children of the Sun by Lomonaaeren) is based on the concept of soul-based magical familiars.

Linkao3(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze) Harry has a snake familiar with proper characterization and plot relevance. The Basilisk is a major player in this fic.

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
