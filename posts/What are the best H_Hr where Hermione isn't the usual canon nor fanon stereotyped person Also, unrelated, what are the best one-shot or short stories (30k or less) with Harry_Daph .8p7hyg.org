What I mean by that is, a fanfic where it isn't either a mugglewank, or Hermione is a loner because she's "too smart", or she's Emma Watson/Goddess/Aphrodites personification? I want either a veteranHermione, kinda like "Stages of Hope", or a completely different Hermione from the get-go, for whatever reason.

Also, bonus points for non-IceQueen Daph. (My favourite was Ice Princess. Close second were the spin-offs from Contractual Invalidation)


** Would [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12310861/1/The-Augurey][The Augurey]] count? No mugglewank and since it's after the war she's hardly a loner.

My favorite is definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2302425/1/Definitions-of-Romance][Definitions of Romance]] though. It's a really good one-shot, so it avoids the issues you mentioned.

** An excellent fiction for Hermione is ‘The Arthrimancer' and its sequel ‘Lady Archimedes'. Pretty much starts at the concept that Hermione was a child math genius and takes it from there. Not sure if its that different from many fanon portrayals of Hermione, but it definitely is the best and most developed one I have seen. Hermione is the main character and protagonist on equal or higher than Harry. Its as long as JK Rowlings books and the sequel is nearly finished and being regularly updated. However it is not a Harry-Hermione pairing.

I would have believed you, if your portrait of “typical male teenager” was consistent through the story. But Harry is the only one who behaves like a total jerk and on the other hand there's an ideal boyfriend Ron, who in the canon is more sex-obsessed than Harry couldn't even dream to be.

Personally I can't see your portraits of those two as nothing more than a pitiful try of hate spitting on Harmonian Ron-haters.

But we went too far away from the original topic.

While you're saying that your Hermione is not a super model or Veela, still she gets all men she wants without putting any efforts with just her body like a super model, Veela or Emma Watson.

Unfortunately consistently isn't a strong side of your stories.

********** Please. They were moving to block Harry and Ron. They fanned out, to set up a crossfire. They were aggressive - and they let slip that they were expecting Harry and Ron. That's more than enough to indicate an imminent attack.

You're arguing like an ignorant teenager who has no clue about the law. "They were cleaning their robes"? Any real judge would laugh at such a pathetic attempt to defend the thugs. I've seen actual cases where such behaviour - just the fanning out and acting tough, no weapons or tools drawn, and without attacking anyone - was enough to get the entire group jailed for robbery when one of the group "asked" for someone's purse. So, yeah, it's obvious that you have no bloody idea how the law works. And no, my heroes can't do anything they want. But neither am I ignoring the effects of their reputation, influence and skill. A Harry who was trained by Moody and who has killed Voldemort won't be treated like any run of the mill rookie Auror. Doubly so if he proves himself in a crisis or two.

Ron wasn't perfect either - but he's not the POV character, so the story doesn't show his side and his thoughts. But his first relationship crashed and burned before it started, for example.

"She still gets all the men she wants" - yeah, right. You sound like the people who condemn her as a slut for having a boyfriend before Harry.

Consistency? Lol. You complain that my heroes can do anything they want, and then complain that Harry isn't a super boyfriend from the start and actually messes up his first relationships - like Hermione messed up hers.

They don't interact like true friends in your story and there're other reviewers telling you the same.

It was tolerable in your other stories, because Harry and Hermione were inseparable there, but in the current one they have their own lives and didn't interacted much during Hogwarts years. Yet their “friendship” is the same...

I see you have a big problem with formal logic. You said that your Harry is a typical teenager with the only head between his legs.

************ I'm not about to explain in story why something that is implausible for several reasons won't happen. No one in the story thinks that Harry should get punished for what he did. If a reader thinks that's wrong - well, can't please everyone. And, if a reader actually thinks that Harry was wrong, I don't want to please them.

Sheesh, you really have a warped view. And a very selective memory. Hermione and Paul started talking while waiting at the registry in a supermarket, and he asked her out on a date after chatting. And then they went on a date, and found they 'clicked'. A rather normal way to start a relationship - certainly not, as you claim, Hermione using her body to "get" Paul. I really think you're making up stuff here. Harry and her have been close - not as close as in other stories, but they've been growing closer as they are moving towards a relationship. Which at this point (chapter 45) they are still in the process of starting.

And formal logic? We only have two regular POVs: Harry and Hermione. We see Ron through their eyes; assuming that Ron is the perfect boyfriend is quite a leap. Especially since he certainly didn't start that way, and blew his own relationships.

I'm calling you inconsistent since you complain in one sentence about my characters being flawless and being able to do all they want, and then complain that Harry is a jerk in the next. He isn't perfect, and neither is Hermione. Both took years and other, failed relationships to grow into people who can actually have a lasting relationship. And they still have their issues to work through. Hermione especially is far more influenced by her inner cat than she acknowledges - she's vain, too curious, proud bordering on arrogance, and has less impulse control than the canon character.

That doesn't mean, however, that she (or anyone else) is going to get an idiot ball and make stupid blunders. I like my characters, both villains and protagonists, a little smarter than that.

Obliviate yourself of the author's bias and re-read the chapter. 20 sentences-dialog is not "chatting". Paul checked her out, liked what he saw and asked he for a date. It's explicitly stated at least two times.

Rest of the chapter doesn't contain almost any traits we love Hermione for as a character. It was all about her lying to him and getting what she wants. The only time that can be very loosely liked with her rational side is "2 months passed. Ok, Paul, finally you can shag me" moment.

  I'm calling you inconsistent since you complain in one sentence about my characters being flawless and being able to do all they want, and then complain that Harry is a jerk in the next.
#+end_quote

Try to separate the real world and your imagined one.

I (and others) call Harry a jerk when we project his traits into the real world. We look at him as a real person and see that that person is a moron.

In *your story* those traits are ignored or even cherished buy your other characters. In the context of your story they aren't flaws at all, but desirable traits. In *your story* your favourite characters are flawless, because *no one* says otherwise. Even parents and siblings of 14 year old girls (below age of consent in UK btw) are totally alright that their daughters are banged by some shitty celebrity.

So yeah, in *your story* your characters can do whatever they want without any unpleasant consequences for themselves. In real world they would get huge amount of negative feedback from a lot of people around them because of what they really are: morons and bitches.

#+begin_quote
  I like my characters, both villains and protagonists, a little smarter than that.

************** You seem to have some problem with female characters, to be honest. Paul finding Hermione attractive and asking her out you describe as "she's using her body to get a man" - that's very, very biased.

Also, you really don't seem to understand that an action isn't right or wrong just because no one in the story says so. A flaw isn't removed just because there's no authority figure calling people out for it. Harry is a jerk or he isn't a jerk - it doesn't matter if anyone calls him out for it.

Case in point: Romy's parents. There are several reasons why they won't bother Harry for being Romy's boyfriend. First, they simply might not care. They've been to Hogwarts themselves, after all. Second, they almost certainly won't consider Harry "a shitty celebrity", unless they are Death Eaters. He's a hero of Wizarding Britain. Third, they certainly won't be bothered about petting and similar actions. Fourth, even if they were bothered, they might not want to antagonise their own daughter - and they might not want to antagonise Harry or Sirius, seeing as both are among the most powerful in Britain, no matter whether or they are correct about Harry and Sirius's expected reaction.

None of that, however, determines whether Harry is in the right or wrong. It just means that in the story, he won't get called out by Romy's parents because it doesn't make sense for them to do so.

Of course there'll be consequences for a characters' actions - if it makes sense. I'm not about to wreck consistency and world building just so every mistake gets called out; some mistakes don't have consequences. Just like in real life. Or at least, don't have the consequences you want them to have.

Harry had several relationships, messed up all of them one way or the other - like most teenagers - and he grew from his experiences. That's a consequence. It's not the consequence you want - but then, I don't write the kind of stories you want to read.

It's not me. It's your story that /doesn't contain anything else/. The point was that in it the only thing that attracts males to your Hermione is her body. But I see that you're very uncomfortable with that statement, so you're totally ignoring it.

Make a reality check. A flaw is a personal trait that is at least acknowledged (often with irritation or more negatively) by people around that person. That people are usually not only authorities, but also friends or just acquaintances. If it's just totally ignored it's not a flaw. Your hero's traits irritates some of your readers, but are *totally ignored* by *all* other characters in your story. Through them you as the author send a message to your readers that you don't think those traits are flaws.

Your example with "Romy's parents" is a blunt case of you bending your world for your heroes wishes and desires.

******************** A flaw affects a character's actions and thoughts. For example, Hermione in the story is affected by her inner cat, so to speak. Even if she were isolated on an island, it would affect her - she would be more easily distracted, prone to napping in the sun instead of working on getting off the island, she'd care too much about her appearance - her priorities would be off compared to "normal" Hermione. It might not have any drastic consequences since she is not ruled by her instincts, but it still affects her behaviour. In the story, Hermione is prone to more impulsive actions and vain and arrogant. The thing is, unless that leads to trouble, like their near-arrest at the hands of the Aurors, no one will call her out on it because it's not something drastic, so her friends in the know let it slide. If they even notice. It's still a flaw, though.

And it's shown by her thoughts and emotions. She thinks of Sirius as "that dog" whenever he annoys her. She's wants to (and often does) claw his nose when he annoys her - a childish and inappropriate as well as ineffective action. She finds excuses to look as good as possible during a heist, and she rationalises reckless actions instead of realising that those are irrational - like the decision to loot Davis's manor, instead of just their vault, for added humiliation.

You mentioned "show, don't tell". In my opinion, having characters point out flaws is more telling than showing. Such scenes often feel forced and unrealistic, especially if done by characters who wouldn't actually do such a thing. It seems as if there's a sign lighting up: "Look, kids, moral lesson coming up, pay attention!" I don't like that. If a reader can't tell that Harry's wrong without some author expy spelling it out, then that's their problem. Just as it's their problem if they can't tell that Harry's right without a character investigating his actions and clearing him.

I don't write moral lessons, I write characters. And all my scenes are written from the POV of a character. Biased, without omniscience. That means that not every flaw will get acknowledged, nor will every mistake get punished. That's not how society works.

The story pretty much paints the picture of a corrupt society where the powerful are above the law from the start. The characters are trying to change that - in their own ways - but they still benefit from the system when applicable. That's not bending the world in their favour. That's showing realistic consequences for their actions. If Malfoy can get away with a lot thanks to his money and status, then the same has to apply to others with gold and status - even if that includes the protagonists. Otherwise, the world doesn't make much sense. There's a reason why money is often the difference between being eccentric and crazy.

Even you here are using world "normal". It means you as an outside person compare her with some standard and conclude that she's different from it. That difference affects you in some way and therefore makes you do some internal work (compare her actions with something you would expect) and classify her traits are flaws.

You as your own person acknowledge her traits as flaws.

As I described before we, readers, do the same thing.

But we look at your world and disregard outside readers/authors perspective, we see that none of your characters do this. No one does similar internal work and classify your heroes' traits as flaws, no one has some "normal" standard to compare others to. Or they just accept the shown behaviour as normal.

This is why your characters are flawless in the stories: because no one inside them acknowledge them. As you said it yourself, the flaw exists when someone acknowledges it.

It doesn't matter that you're writing from the POV of the said characters. Even with their POV we see that they don't receive any negative feedback for their obvious flaws and mistakes.

#+begin_quote

Your examples are very much reaching, if not outright false. Absence of competition? There are very few people with the talent to pull the heists off. And even fewer of them are willing to become thieves. It wouldn't make any sense if there were multiple professional thieves with that talent and that grudge. Not if they can make a fortune with less risks as a Curse-Breaker. Wizarding Britain is simply too small to have multiple groups of such thieves.

Actually no, it's not correct.

A flaw is just some mental trait, property, attribute. Itself it is neither negative nor positive. People make them negative and turn them into flaws. In your example you did it yourself when you compared Hermione's behaviour with some "normal" and described your negative attitude to some of her possible actions because of that. Until your "judgment" flaws didn't exist, traits did. You yourself turned some of her cat traits into flaws.

If you make that trait part of your "normality", it stops being a flaw, because it would become what's expected.

Like any mental issues they are very hard to be self acknowledged. You gave example with bleeding, but it's not correct, because there's physical evidence of the wound. More correct (but may be extreme) example would be some mental issue like bipolar disorder or PTSD. They are just set of mental traits that cause social disfunction. They don't exist until they are classified together and acknowledged.

Or another example is Swastika that's an Indian ancient symbol. Yet a lot of people think of it negatively, because they associate it with Nazis crimes. I'm not talking about justification her. It's just an example that good and bad are defined by people.

We all know the plot holes Rowling made to make her books more interesting. It doesn't make you a better author if you are knowingly repeating the same holes just to make your heroes better than everyone else.

According to your definition of normality. Not everyone shares it.

If an easily distracted person learns to live with it without affecting others, it stops being a flaw and becomes just a trait. If even in that case you think about such person negatively, you're very judgmental.

Being a vail is also not a flaw, if such person interacts with similar people only and causes no harm to people around him. If you still think bad about him or her... see the previous point.

Even cruelty wasn't a flaw, but a normal trait during middle ages and before.
