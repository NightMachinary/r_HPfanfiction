I just read Harry Potter and the game in like 2 days or so and I've completely caught up with it and really enjoyed it. I've also read Harry Potter Game Exploited (something like that) and was wondering if any of you guys knew more of these gamer fics,

I would love it if it was completed but non-complete is also fine. Thank you.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** Magical Player but is a SI-OC so you may not like it, although it's actually one of my favorites, plus it has some Xianxia elements.

** This is just such a crazy idea! I've never even thought of anything like this before for a fanfic! :o Where the whole world is a video game?! I did just start reading "THE ADVENTURES OF HARRY POTTER VIDEO GAME EXPLOITED" that Grimmy posted below me, and it is just great so far!!!!

*** A lot of different shows/anime/books/series have fanfics about it, it's one of my favourite genre. If you like video game exploited you'll probably like Harry Potter and the Game as well, it's much longer and is still updating regularly. It is a story though, not as much wacky hijinks as in exploited.

** You should try linkffn(12206119)

There's several others but I don't think they reach 20 chapters before the authors quit them.
