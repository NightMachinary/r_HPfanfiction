** Considering how much she's blasting everyone with her veela powers in canon, the 'woe is me' attitude is something I've never quite understood. If it was something she couldn't control, I highly doubt she would be going to a public school, or even allowed to go to one.

***** I'm not of fan of the Harry/ Fleur ship, which mean I don't read about her a lot outside of a very secondary role, but I'm . . . surprised by the whole "Veela Alure". Writing about Fleur in FF, it sound like a kind of mentale attack that she can control at will, while I always thought of it as the Veela being very hot. I mean, people like models can kinda "control" how people perceive them depending of how they act (full make up during a photo shoot it different from no make up in front of TV), but you can't ask them to stop being hot on demand.

****** I've always seen it as Fleur being a stunningly beautiful woman naturally and that as a result of her Veela heritage she also has her Allure. With the Allure being a magical aura that causes those in its area of effect to see her - and possibly others according to the wiki - as more desireable.

However it's not something that she can control and is likely linked to her emotional state, similar to how Tonks' metamorphagus abilities are effected by her emotions.

Also, if you haven't read them the Half Blood Romantic and A Different Kind of War stories are incredible and definitely sold me on the ship.

****** The idea of the "Veela Allure" is from GoF - if you read the scene of the Veelas walking into the stadium, it's pretty clearly the inspiration for it in FF. Obviously, everything gets dialed up a ton though.

Personally, I find the Veela Allure to be an interesting setup, but most fics don't really deliver on it greatly. It's just used as an excuse to somehow have Harry immune to it, be special/awesome, and then hook up with Fleur.

There's much more interesting things to do with a not-fully-human character than that, even if just to explore worldbuilding elements - add in that she's basically the only French character of note (which is objectively superior to British characters ;) ), and that she was good enough to become a champion and there's a lot more to her then just a prize for SuperSpecialAwesome!Harry to win.

I think that's all natural to add up to someone being more restrained and aloof - that doesn't make her a 'conceited bitch'. Plus, we're seeing her from Harry and his friend's POV, and they're 3-4 years younger - most 17-18 year olds aren't going to pay much attention to 14 year olds, after all.

It's okay and fine because Harry is a beta (which they use wrongly, of course) and gay.

******* I just think that both of those pairings - Honks or Flowerpot - just make far more sense than the canon ones Rowling pulled out of her ass and would actually have fit the story better because of it.

Despite the age difference, there's enough maturity/immaturity between Harry and Tonks respectively that would allow them to overcome it. Their personalities fit well without having to rely on tropes; as you've said they have enough common interests to have that bonding experience and Tonks' abilities as a Metamorphagus and position as an Auror gives plenty of opportunities for something to develop. Basically, she provides the fun experience that a character like Harry would need while still having a level of maturity to sympathise with him and his struggles.

Fleur and Harry, on the other hand, works well for a different reason; he's stubborn enough to deal with the rougher aspects of her personality, she's blunt enough to pull him out of his shell and deal with his moodier moments, she's also an incredibly powerful and knowledgable witch who was able to casually put a dragon to sleep at just 17, a dragon that from memory was meant to take a dozen people to take down.\\
Add to that the fact that Harry has her respect for saving her sister, that he's nice to her when others aren't so kind and that he's one of the few people around that doesn't drool the second she walks into a room and you've got a pretty decent reason to have them together.

Like you said they make far more sense than some of the weird shit that edgier/younger authors like to put out and I personally see them as making far more sense than the ones that Rowling pulled out of her ass. It also has the added bonus of allowing two interesting characters that could have been better (or even slightly) fleshed out to take a more central role that doesn't relegate Fleur as the hot one Bill is cool enough to marry or Tonks the depressed metamorph with a Lycan fetish.

Dating someone you have vicious arguments with, who gets jealous over your successes and who relies on you to finish any work they struggle with is not exactly a healthy relationship, let alone a pro-feminist one.

As for Ginny there are plenty of things to critique her for regarding her pairing with Harry, not least of which is the apparent fact that Rowling had obviously planned for them to be together at the start but forgot to include that in the books until the last two.

Absolutely agree with you on how interesting the Honks relationship would have been, both during and post-hogwarts.

The smut is honestly 90% of the reason that it's so hard to find a good Honks of FlowerPot story. Horny authors only see Tonks as a girl that can look like anyone she wants and Fleur is simply the hot one.

I'd love it if those two ships became more prevalent, because as much as I can appreciate other popular pairings I feel like they've been done to death comparatively.

  AU Year 4. Left alone to his devices, Harry is thrust into a tournament where he is absolutely outclassed. Enter Fleur Delacour, a lazy prodigious Veela who is bored. They meet and sparks fly. Dangerous opponents, seriously dangerous creatures and his rotten luck. How will Harry survive this one? And Fleur never told him what her father does for a job...

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a remastered version is coming to my Patreon - initially free.

*** Carmen Victory was a solid read but I remember there being something about it that eventually made me quit midway through it. I think it was something about the darker plot and characters, although it's been a couple years now so my memory is fuzzy. Never did get around to finishing it, probably never will tbh.

All I can say for certain is that I took it off the List and I usually don't do that without a good reason.

** Despite it not being my favorite pairing (that would go to Harry/Luna with a Harry/Hermione as a close second)...

I have always had a soft spot for Harry/Fleur stories, particularly ones where either...

1. Harry reforms the "Im too good for you" style of Fleur and wins her over or...

2. Fleur takes Harry under her wing or "claims" him and goes on to turn him into a powerful force in the WIzarding world.

But I have to say I am not sure i agree with the OP's sentiments that most stories or even the canon story have her as a "woe is me" type. Shes already kind of "Im the hottest woman" type, but she just is a bit isolated and uncomfortable to a degree within Wizarding Britan rather than France.
