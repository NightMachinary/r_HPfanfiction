** Bill Nye would be a lovely potions teacher. He'd make Snape and Slughorn look boring and drab.

**** Good point. It's the subject that determines how much more lively and entertaining Bill Nye is compared to the other professors.

  Divination = Uncle Iroh

Just the pure unfiltered awesomeness he would drop on Harry and company on a daily basis would be amazing.

"I have prepared tea from the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's /heartbreaking!/ That, or it's from the white jade bush, which is poisonous."

"Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not."

"It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to restore honor." -Saying that to Sirius or Ron would be amazing.

"While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing." -To Harry anytime after book 4.

"I was never angry with you. I was sad, because I was afraid you'd lost your way."

Actually Uncle Iroh would make an amazing Dumbledore stand in.
