Not that he just doesn't happen to go, but he actually refuses to go to hogwarts. I would also be interested in fics where he is forced to go unwillingly.


** My first Post!

Here is a one-shot that I thought was cute,

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.

** This may not be what what you're looking for. linkffn(The Handbook of Elf Psychology) is the sequel to linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) The sequel is set for the most part at Hogwarts, and harry is very resistant to being there.

#+begin_quote
  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

** I'm reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11656250/1/A-New-Kind-of-Normal]]) that follows a first-year Harry who really wants to stay home and be "normal". He doesn't put up much of a fight because he doesn't want to lose his memories though.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. Small changes build up in his life in Little Whinging with the Dursleys as he strives to be more "normal". Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part One of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. New chapter twice weekly! Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
