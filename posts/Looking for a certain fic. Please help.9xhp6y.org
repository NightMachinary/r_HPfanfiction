Hi everyone,

I'm trying to find a fanfic that basically shook my world almost ten(?) years ago. It was a beautiful piece of work, which somehow re-ignited my passion for literature. I'm sure someone knows this one, since it's so f* good. I just somehow can't seem to Google it succesfully:

Ginny is a bartender in a punk/alt-bar in London, Harry comes there by accident and starts chatting to her without recognizing her.(iirc G has changed her appearance to stay incognito). They end up spending the night and ofc eventually lots more together. I think every chapter had a foreword from some British pop band (Smiths?).

Please help me, I can't believe this haunts me this much :D


** This sounds a lot like A Black Comedy in terms of punk bartender Ginny but she works at the Hogs Head. Might just be a coincidence. Just in case here you go. linkffn(3401052)
