TLDR; Harry gets a savepoint-type timeloop. This is almost necessary because the decks are stacked against him, hard.

One of the unique points of this fic is that this is a Solo Harry fanfic. Harry does have friends, but when he has to face death and danger, he goes at it alone.

Next, some elements in this fanfic need explaining beforehand.

1) This is a AU where Trelawney gave her prophecy in a bar with multiple people. That's why the Prophecy is public knowledge and why lots of Death Eaters are hellbent on killing Harry.

2) The beginning is quite rough. Harry's trauma after getting killed again and again and his drive to *survive* is shown well. Probably the only fanfic where Harry prefers the safety of the cupboard compared to the murderous Wizarding World..

3) Training in this fanfic works realistically - books and such help only so much, most spells need to be trained with partners.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13445242/1/Kino-s-Solutions-to-Everyday-Death-Tournaments][Kino's Solutions to Everyday Death Tournaments]] ) - He's literally a god in this one.

Linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12381536/1/Scion-of-Sorcery][Scion of Sorcery]]) - Very OP and trained by doctor strange.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12381536/1/Scion-of-Sorcery][Scion of Sorcery]]) - OP and very skilled. Crossover with LOTR.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300345/1/Prodigal-Delinquent][Prodigal Delinquent]]) - Some dark shit but he's OP and skilled.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13380952/1/Fairly-Odd-Child][Fairly Odd Child]]) - Crossover with fairly oddparents. Fairly short but fun I think.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster][Wizard Runemaster]]) - Warcraft crossover. I actually love this one, I think it's somewhat well written and very fun to read.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]) - OP and almost super smart Harry, mostly does magic by thought.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage]]) - OP and super intelligent, raised by Tony Stark.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game][Harry Potter and the Game]]) - One of my favorite gamer stories and an OP Harry.

  Kino is the god of Free Will. But he used to be a human named Harry Potter. Offered up the chance to do things over, Kino finds himself smack dab in the middle of the Triwizard Tournament! Again! So he does what anyone would do in his situation, come up with the most insane methods of winning each task!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance.

Kid hero stories where they're forced to take the weight of the world on their shoulders alone and have to sacrifice everything in the process I prefer to avoid. It's why I couldn't stand Darth Marrs' Firebird trilogy.
