Basically, a marine who got stationed in Britain has a son at Hogwarts and then someone murders that son. NCIS gets called in, more kids die, including Pansy and eventually they catch the killer. There's a sequel where the team has to come back because of the war and are forced to hide out in Hogwarts. I can't remember if it's before or after Kate.
