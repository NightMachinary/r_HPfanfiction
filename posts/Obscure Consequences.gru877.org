What creates an Obscurial is well known. What the metaphysical process is is not fully understood, but the way to start the process is known to all magical families.

The abuse hefted upon little Harry by the Dursleys broke him, his magic condensing, merging with his soul and altering the very laws of reality around him. But Harry was more than a single soul - more than two at that, for he unknowingly held his mothers very being in his blood and a sliver of one almost broken in a scar - and as his soul condensed, it SWALLOWED that which was not he and the process... changed.

The development of an Obscurial is well know, the process documented, but when the process is altered through blood and soul magics and more Soul than any one being could possibly comfortably hold, the result is unknown to all, for there would be no balance to find within the chaos.

And so Surrey was covered in shadow and a dark dust fell like the autumn rains upon Little Whinging. And in the middle of it all was a little boy, crying for the love that he was denied. And as he cried his silent tears, Privet Drive warped around him and a distant hum sounded out across Britain, faint but ever present...


** Attempt at a darker prompt, inspired by Lovecraft.

Anyone able to tell me why exactly neither Harry or Voldemort ever developed an Obscuris? Because that's another bit of canon lore that doesn't make sense to me... abused magicals may develop an Obscuris and what happened to both characters definitely count as abuse - probably violent, in Harrys case.

**** I'd expect that Harry at least attempted to suppress his magic, even if just subconsciously - knowing about magic is not necessary to develop an obscuris in canon.

Tom is a different problem, he had control from a young age and used it so that is probably why he never developed one. Then again, canon is filled with holes, that's why it's such a good playground. Like Skyrim, in a way...
