Asking primarily due to curiosity. They seem to pop up in a reasonable amount of fandoms and they seem popular, which I find odd. Could anyone enlighten me?


** Wait, there are actually fics? I only ever saw some fan-art of what assorted characters would look like as kittens.

*** I've only seen it in the description and never actually read the fics, but I've seen 3 or 4 that have Malfoy being a cat.

**** Malfoy as a cat? How blasphemous! He's a bouncing ferret through-and-through.

** This has been a thing for ages. It has something to do with kittens being cute, the freedom to act playful/mischievous without (serious) repercussions, and the inherent helplessness of being small/weak in a big, scary world (and how a special someone might protect you from it). It's a form of wish fulfilment, where the wish is to be small and cute and loved.

At least, that's what most of them seem to me. I've read a fair few of them, and in the HP fandom they mostly revolve around the transformed character being "allowed" to act a certain way due to their changed form, which they could not do as "themselves" for reasons. Ie; Malfoy being cuddly and playful instead of a pureblood heir; Harry receiving comfort without having to be a selfless archetypal hero; etc.

** I thought it was just because kittens are cute? Does it need a reason? O_O

** People trust animals. Take characters who don't trust each other or you would want to ship, turn one into an animal, and they are put into a weird situation that simultaneously forces them to bond somehow, it's funny.

** Combination of neko love and Warroirs fans who are also Harry Potter fans, I would guess.

** Also common to transform characters into infants, for whatever weird reason(s)

** I have only see them in the MLB fandom with Adrien turning into a real kitty and I never found them weird because Adrien is a cat-theme superhero in the canon. I didn't know this was a thing in other fandoms. That's weird.
