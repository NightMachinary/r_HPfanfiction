Just got an idea from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d7g3ck/any_fics_where_harry_is_just_really_good_with_one/][this request]]:

Harry buys a book with easy to learn, but in most cases not very useful, spells during his first visit to Diagon Alley. From it he learns a simple illusion spell, that allows him to bring up some small scale visual illusions.* With practice the illusions become more and more complex adding sound, smell, taste and maybe even feel later on. He uses that one spell to fake is way through most of his classes and fights.

* I always liked the idea that the trace gets applied during the boat ride.

While typing that I got the feel that I might have read something like this before ... if it exists link it please.


** Linkffn(Delenda Est) might be what you're thinking of; it takes a while, but Harry eventually starts to rely pretty heavily on illusion spells.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** Yes that was probably what I was thinking of, has been some time since I read it.

** Why would the trace be applied on the boat ride instead of like in the shop? Is there any textual evidence for the theory?

*** The only thing that comes to mind is that Hermione mentions on the train that she has tried a few spells herself. That could of course just mean on the train. But it is sometimes used in fanfiction to explain why Harry does not get in trouble when the authors need him to learn some magic before Hogwarts.

I like it because it adds another purpose to the boat ride, besides the nice first impression of Hogwarts.

** Would love to read a story using lots of illusions in battle. Perhaps even completely tricking everyone Mysterio style.
