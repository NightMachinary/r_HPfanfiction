I just read the story linkffn(Just After Midnight by Margotllama), and can I say this is probably the best Snape picks up Harry from the abusive Dursleys story that I've read in a while. Though, it is only probably only quarter completed, which is a damn shame.

The whole premise is Snape goes to get Harry from the Dursleys on that little island, but doesn't explain anything to him. He just apparates into the room stuns Vernon and apparates out, all the while verbally abusing Harry. So Harry draws the necessary conclusions and assumes he is being kidnapped. No one explains about magic, about his parents, about Voldemort and of course he is trying to escape.

They think Harry is deranged because he is so skittish and combative and don't let him go back to the Dursley's before school starts. On top of all of that Snape is ridiculously abusive towards Harry but Harry desperately wants to leave Hogwarts to go back to the Dursley's who have been established as being physically and emotionally abusive because no one has explained ANYTHING to him. No one has sat down and told Harry, hey you wizard your parents are wizards you were killed by this crazy guy this is your birthright or whatever. So he just thinks he's stuck in this crazy world of kidnappers and he has to outsmart everyone to be able to leave.

I wish this story was finished and I really want to read something similar. Does anyone know of any stories like this? I am sorry to recommend an unfinished story but it is pretty good.


** My God Almighty. One would have to think Dumbledore would get involved after a botched performance like this. One cannot go about doing this to a child!

  AU. Just after midnight, in a hut on a rock in the sea, Harry Potter celebrated his eleventh birthday and, instead of Hagrid, was collected by Severus Snape to be brought into the world of magic. Mild abuse, neglect.
