Basically what it says in the title. The future sucks so Hermione tries a ritual to send her memories back in time but screws up somehow and the memories are incomplete and she wakes up under the lake. Any idea which story this was?


** It's a good one.

** Hmm...if you're looking for a specific story, you should probably use the Fic Search flair rather than the Request flair. The flair button's next to 'delete', 'spoiler', 'nsfw', 'crosspost', etc, on the botton of your post.

Aaanyway...do you remember any more details about the fic? Any particular phrases or unusual words? How Hermione reacted when she first woke up under the water? Is it old, or a recent fic in the last year or so? Was it on Fanfiction.net or a different website?

** I've read several stories like that, got any more specifics?

Was she jumping back with anyone else or alone? From how far ahead did she jump?

** Sounds vaguely like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][this]] in some respects - the time of memories showing up is at year 3 rather than 4.
