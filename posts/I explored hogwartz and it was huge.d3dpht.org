Hey,

Recently i explored harry potter's hogwartz map with a few friends in vrchat, vrchat is a program where you can hang out with friends and as well virtual reality and normal desktop, all together, when i first spawned there, i noticed how seriously large this map was, and i wanted to explore and see it all. Time from time i noticed map bugs wich limited us from seeing the complete map just by walking, many players would not be aware of the many other spots in the map wich are worth watching.

The whole trip took me over 2 hours, and the video i end up with is an hour, i've highlighted the 28 places on the map wich were worth to see with timestamps so every curious vrchat user & hp can watch them to. Hopely this is enjoyable for someone. If you wanna visit the map yourself just search for harry potter or hogwartz after installing vrchat, vrchat is also free by the way so anybody can go there. If you notice wrong names i gave to the locations please tell me so i can adjust that.
