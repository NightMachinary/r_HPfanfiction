Jk, can I actually get some heartwarming fics where harry is removed from the durslyes into the care of another, preferably crossover character like princess Zelda, Artoria Pendragon, Black Lagoon Balalaika, Zouken Maikiri, Etc.

Basically cheesy happy escape from durzkaban fics.


** ..but if anyone has anything like the title you should post that too. For study.

*** You should do neither. Like, you should like what like, ya feel. As for faith restoring... I replaced a request for absurd most likely shit with a request for marginally less absurd but usually still shit even if I read it every chance I get. Both should either reduce your faith due to stupidity or restore faith due to absurdity and I don't remembeer what I was writing about so later.

*** Right? I lifted the title from an old thread with a thread about how much people were downvoting a perfectly normal post because it wasn't their thing where someone said they should use the title followed by jk to see how many downvotes they get from people who don't even open the thread. I waqs going to do that until I actually had something to post. I'm surprised by the lack of downvotes tbh

** It's neither cheesy nor a crossover, but "No longer alone" has Harry adopted by the Tonks family after an AU ending of the third year. Overall it is pretty light hearted, but the Dursley abuse isn't swept under the rug like in canon either.
