Wizard Runemaster. Follow Harry as he roflstomps his way through the WoW world, picks up hot elvish chicks and solves every problem ever, forever.

Its a fun read if you're willing to go brain-afk.

*** Or relive your vanilla WoW days. I read Plums' work everytime I get nostalgic about WoW. Chaos is the natural order of things when organizing anything greater than 10 man raids.

Too bad Plums hasn't updated. I'm curious as to how he's going to tackle the clown suit era of WoW.

  A Weapon. A Hero. But now... a loose end. Harry Potter resolves to destroy the enemies who betrayed him on his terms, only to find all his plans torn asunder when he's summoned to a new world plagued with the same enemies as his own.

** The only one that's worthy of a recommendation is Plums' work, and even that is cutting it close. It's pub stompy and the tropes Plums' is using gets tiresome.

I'm still looking for a decent Potter/Jaina though. The drama that would occur between Kael'thas and the heartache of Jaina's past with Arthas is gold for drama.

** There's very, very few readable pure Warcraft fics, let alone crossovers. I haven't found any that I could read more than a few chapters of.

*** Both Dumbledore and Riddle would actually stand out in PvP if you consider the game.

As was discussed in some past threads, the magic of HP is more on support. Thus, they're perfect for crowd control in raids. Otherwise even the average WC mage could wipe the floor with Dumbledore and Voldemort.

***** I disagree at least to a point I mean there is a spell that /makes the caster/ *completely* /immune to all fire/ (at least that's how I think *Flame freezing spell* works) and that would practically negate everything a firemage could do.

In some ways the HP magic is ridiculously powerful because it seems to work on /concepts/.

Edit: Actually forget everything I just wrote about fire.... *Fiendfire* would probably get trough the charm, and in Azeroth(and related worlds) there seems to be quite a lot of cursed flames.

**** Not really - aparation is way better than blink :) (as long as they stay mobile, they stand one hell of a chance!) ;)

Also look at the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore duell: Now that was magic - most others are really weak compared to that sadly :(

Sure, Medivh, Antonidas, Khadgar or Jaina Proudmore would wipe the floor with them, but others? I am not so sure about that (and those are prodigies who've seen all out war, something Voldemort and Dumbledore have not, so they haven't really trained for that!)
