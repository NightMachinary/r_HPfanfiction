Like literally none of the pairings are good. For starters, Ginny is basically a clone of Harry's mother who only idolized him in the beginning because he was the Boy Who Lived. There never was a ton of character development between these two so it makes no sense to pair them. Secondly, don't even make me get started on Ron and Hermione. I had seen potential in Ron and Lavender hoping that it would show Ron mature, but no. Ron instead marries the girl he called names, almost got killed multiple times, and bullied all throughout school. There are many other pairings that don't make sense, like Bill and Fleur, which makes no sense at all. Two of the only good pairings are, of course, Lily and James, and Remus and Tonks.


** While I dislike Rowling's attempt at writing romance, your reasoning is... Questionable.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny is basically a clone of Harry's mother
#+end_quote

What? They both have red hair. That is pretty much the only similarity.

It is like when people say there is no point in fics that pair Harry with any of the quidditch trio, as Ginny was on the team so they are just replacement Ginny's.

#+begin_quote
  There never was a ton of character development
#+end_quote

Outside the trio, no-one is seriously developed except their subplots. Rowling basically close to have Harry pair with a background character, and not promote her to main.

#+begin_quote
  I had seen potential in Ron and Lavender hoping that it would show Ron mature,
#+end_quote

What? Lavender is basically the primary 'Ron doesn't have to challenge his assumptions about relationship' pairing. Ron/Hermione is the right pairing if you want to show him maturing. It just doesn't work because it isn't developed and doesn't feel earned.

Could have easily had Ron get serious about studies because he wanted to impress Hermione. Or had them struggle with different assumptions on what they would do after school. Or had SOME sort of non-harry-related conflict for them to work through.

And no, kissing other people to make each other jealous does not count.

#+begin_quote
  like Bill and Fleur,
#+end_quote

It happens entirely off screen with just enough hints to suggest what happened. If anything, this is what works best in Canon, as the reader can fill in the blanks.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

?????????

Lily and James are a steriotypical 'boy wants girl who won't stoop to notice them'. What we know about James is that he was a bit of a bully like Ron. And he basically got 'hero gets the girl' treatment. And Lily is woefully undefined, and acts almost entirely as a motivation for the male characters (Harry/James). Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the entire HP series failed the Bechdel test.

And Remus/Tonks? You thought Bill/Fleur came out of left field? It was pretty clearly tieing of romantic lose ends without introducing new characters.

#+end_quote

Ginny joined the team as a replacement when Harry was banned, so they were only on the team together for sixth year by which point JKR's shitty chest monster thing had reared its ugly head. I don't disagree with the concept you put forwards, but Harry trained with the original chaser team for five years against Ginny's one. If someone wanted to argue that Harry spent hours every week with the quidditch girls and there must have been some interactions between them I'd agree, I'd then point out Harry spent his summers around Ginny. I don't disagree with your idea but I do take issue with your argument.

A negative Ron view is more of 'insensitive prat' catagory, perhaps with a side of bigot. That is what I assumed the OP meant when they called Ron a bully and I used it in the same terms.

Although those are more redeemable that the straight up bullying of Draco or Dudley.

** Stopped reading at “Ginny is a clone of Harry's mother”, because that's patently idiotic to anyone whose capacity for reading comprehension extends beyond hair colour.

Edit: Never mind, read the rest. You really going to try and pay out Ron/Hermione when you call Remus/Tonks a good ship? He's twelve years older than her, and she bullied and harassed him into a relationship and child he didn't want. It's toxic as fuck.

The real criminal pairings are Nevill/Hannah Abbot and Luna/Rolf Scamander

I mean WHY

Why use the non-character of Abbott, and invent Rolf Scamander, just to break up the only relationship that would have been remotely food? Neville/Luna is infinitely superior.

** I never really saw Ginny as a clone of Lily. But maybe it's because we know so very little about Lily. But, tbh, the only thing I like in Harry/Ginny is that it makes Harry officially part of the Weasley's family.

Lily/James was kind of awful for all we knew about it.

Remus/Tonk was a total disaster (let's force an older man who is probably depressed as hell into a relationship with a girl he barely knows and doesn't show any interest in because... love will cure everything? Because she's cute and she wants to? Because no one can mind their own business?)

Ron/Hermione was just... meh. If only they could have stayed friends instead. There was really no need for this romance, imo.

Fleur/Bill was just out of nowhere. And I never really remembered Bill's age but it seemed so weird.

I think one of the biggest problem is just the need to put all the characters in a relationship by the end of the series AND to put them with someone from the group. It's never satisfying. I can't believe Hermione would have stayed in England, would have become Mrs Weasley 2.0, sticking with her high school sweetheart. It just feels all too forced.

No, I dislike them all too. Almost all of them manage to find ways to squick me out or feel insanely conflictual, and they all feel forced. There are hardly any pairings in the whole series that don't involve story characters getting together, because of course there's no life outside the narration and the characters don't exist outside of their scenes.

******* Just because he doesn't show certain traits of an incel doesn't mean he clearly is one. For example, the fact that he doesn't treat Lily like her own person, with her own emotions and likes and dislikes. He sees her as an object to be won. He doesn't care about her own happiness.

Another trait is that he uses a single failed romantic pursuit as an excuse to be a spiteful vindictive douche to everything and everyone, and refuses to take responsibility for his own shitty personality.

*************** ‘One glance at it showed me all I needed to know' - that alone is proof he didn't see Pettigrew. He only took a cursory glance, to him Black was guilty and that's all that mattered. I think you're kidding yourself if you believe Snape would have ignored Pettigrew had he seen him. He wanted revenge on Lily's betrayer.

Additionally Snape is only ever spoken about through the lens of Harry's opinion, we know he bullied Harry and possibly Neville but we have nothing on the other years. People over exaggerate what he did - of course it was abominable behaviour but it wasn't widespread. In fact he protects the most at risk students from the Carrows by giving them detention with Hagrid.

Snape risked his life as a spy for the light for many years. He got good intelligence and followed Dumbledore's plan to the letter. Killing Dumbledore saved Draco, Harry and probably the entirety of Wizarding Britain. His patronus charm literally did save all of wizarding Britain, taking Harry to the Sword of Godric Gryffindor.

Also let's not forget that Harry, who was picked on most severely by Snape, names his child after him. That's a sign that he's redeemed himself to the boy he hurt most deeply. I think there's definitely a case to say Snape is redeemable.

His desire for revenge was born out of a broken promise that the chief blood supremacist would kill her baby and spare her. He then spent near 7 years bullying said baby and treating the child Voldemort didn't go after even worse. The man threw the sword in a frozen lake in the middle of a war out of spite.

*************** Snape was sort of in a bind in the sense that he was a spy and therefore didn't really have any option other than to continue using the word mudblood. Otherwise he couldn't have been, you know, a spy! I think his desire for revenge may have been born from that, however I don't think that's all it was eventually.

Also the very nature of Snape being 3D helps make him a more redeemable character. A neglected child, hurt and alone, poor and constantly wearing ill-fitting clothes, is it really any surprise he would desire power. Add to that the horrendous abuse and bullying HE suffered from James Potter and Sirius Black, Snape's faults come from his ill-treatment. I don't blame him entirely for his actions. Additionally Snape did work tirelessly as headteacher to protect the students.

Rowling says that Snape is immensely brave and when asked if she considered Snape a hero, she replied: "Yes, I do; though a very flawed hero. An anti-hero, perhaps. He is not a particularly likeable man in many ways. He remains rather cruel, a bully, riddled with bitterness and insecurity---and yet he loved, and showed loyalty to that love and, ultimately, laid down his life because of it. That's pretty heroic!"

I believe Snape can be redeemed.
