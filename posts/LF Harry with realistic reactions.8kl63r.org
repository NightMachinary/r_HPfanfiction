Harry is basically Wizarding Jesus. After seeing Snapes memories of Dumbledore, naming your son after him is pushing it. Sure, honour both as War Heroes, but actively naming a child after Dumbledore and Snape was too much. What about poor Lupin? or Moody? Remus Alastor or Alastor Remus is much better than Albus Severus.

Just want a Harry that reacts realistically to everything. With Magic, most of us wouldn't care about the theory either, but we'd try and learn every spell we could, because "Ooh a Colour charm, saves painting the walls" but we wouldn't really care who invented it or why.

The only really "realistic" reaction Harry had was when Dumbledore told him about the Prophecy and he flipped his shit and blew up Dumbledore's office.


** Considering that Lupin ran from his pregnant wife and not once contacted Harry, naming a child after him is just as far fetched as Snape. You know when Lupin contacted Harry outside of Order business? When he ran from the woman he vowed to stay with in good and in bad times. Harry even laments that Lupin didn't write after Sirius died.

And both Dumbledore and Snape deserve their own threads on why they should not have children named after them.

***** Lupin is from the word lupine, meaning "wolf-like".

Remus in Roman mythology was the brother of Romulus, after which Rome was supposedly named. The two brothers were orphaned as infants and raised by a she-wolf.

So basically, Remus could introduce himself as "Werewolf Werewolf" even before he was bitten.

Same for naming children after cowards!

** My favorite explanation for that remains the fic where he got really drunk and accidentally named the poor kid after all of his most hated people in order, and had to sneak into the ministry to edit the birth certificate to keep anybody from realizing his real name was "Albus Severus Tom Vernon Potter". Then he told everybody he'd named them after the two bravest headmasters he had ever known like in canon, and just never mentioned they were the only two headmasters he had ever known.

It's really just a one-off joke from a time traveling Harry mentioning something in the timeline that he came from. Also features Harry being the father of all of Ron and Bill's kids because the author seems to have a Weasley-based grudge or something, without actually bothering to have an evil!Ron.

Like learning to drive in the Muggle world, you still have to study and take lessons, which theoretically are tedious, but you get to drive a car or bike at the end of it so most 17-year-olds are pretty stoked to do it anyway.

He can still be lazy when it comes to homework, etc. but I think it would make a lot of sense for him to try and improve his practical skills in Charms and Transfiguration, at least so that he'd be able to make some decent amendments to those damn dress robes!

***** They're still kids and it takes quite some effort to accomplish anything worthwhile. So for may the initial enthusiasm fades under the gruelling reality of the normal school work.

So you learned to transfigure a matchstick into a pin and a mouse into a snuffbox. That still doesn't make you fulfil your fantasies. You still don't know enough to transfigure a matchstick into anything else and you rarely need a snuffbox (not to speak of having to catch a mouse first).

And the teachers are not the most competent at keeping the children's enthusiasm for their subject up.

****** Lol yeah some of the stuff they do in class is maybe not particularly useful to 11-year-olds and the quality of teaching in the books is pretty shocking :)

In terms of accomplishments, I'm definitely not saying this should happen immediately, but one really interesting aspect of growing up is figuring out what your "thing" is, stuff you're passionate about and will spend time on regardless of having any direct pay off.

In direct contrast to all the Weasley-bashing, I quite like stories that give Ron something else to do and a better growing up arc than leaving Harry and feeling bad about it. The Arithmancer has a nice side plot about Hermione encouraging Ron to figure out what else he's good at rather than just picking subjects cause they're easy or because Harry's doing the same things. He ends up grumbling his way through Muggle Studies and Ancient Runes (so he's not losing his grudgingly-doing-schoolwork attitude) but then figures out he's actually quite good at Runes and does some more imaginative problem solving with it.

Also, magic tends to be more immediate and more generally useful. A Summoning Charm is dead handy -- at work, I would always forget at least one thing on my way out the door and have to go back to my office, but with a Summoning Charm, I could just bring it after me. I can't program that. It would take years of work to create a robot that could handle that for me. But a month of practice would get me a reliable Summoning Charm.

Conjuration and Transfiguration could be quite useful too, depending on how they work. 3d printing gives you a permanent object after you spend hours designing it and hours waiting for it to be printed, and it's at least moderately useful. Conjuration gives you at least temporary objects immediately. That's immensely useful -- conjure dinnerware and never do dishes again!

There are at least a few useful household charms, and I'd expect Ron to be familiar with them and their usefulness.
