I know this is super vague, so it's a long shot but here it goes. So, it's a longer fic that completely follows canon other than Snape and Hermiones romance. Hermione has been asked by Dumbledore to support Snape, and she helps him with brewing of some sort. They are kind of on the outs for awhile after Dumbledore dies, and finally reunite when Snape visits her at the camp while Harry follows Snape's patronus to the sword of Gryffindor. The fic basically ends at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts.

I know there are some fics that closely follow this format, the following of canon really stood out. It was as if their romance was flawlessly weaved into the story, just behind the scenes. If anyone has any guesses, I'd greatly appreciate it!!


** I don't think it's the fic you are asking for but if you like canon compliant fics this one is following canon really closely: Second Life by Lariope.

** Is this the one where she sneaks away to meet him in the sand dunes behind Shell Cottage just before the final battle and they have sex for the first time despite him being reluctant because he is sure he is going to die?

*** Ugh! I can't remember! I think their first time was at the camp when he snuck in and Harry was off getting the sword, but I can't be sure. I wish I could remember more, it got me hooked on the pairing for the last two years, you would think it would have stuck better in my mind! LOL

** It could be linkffn(Camerado by MillieJoan) but I think she knew ahead of time in that one.

There are actually a number of fics that it could be - Secret Sixth Year is one of my favourite tropes - I know Slytherpouf has done one, and linkffn(Hermione Granger and the HBP by Grangerous) is a good example of the trope - the story has three parts and ends about a year after the final battle, so I don't think it could be that.

If you could give me more details about it, I might be able to narrow it down (although the potions thing is already helpful, most people go with secret Occlumency lessons).

Is Snape still alive at the end? Do they get a HEA?

(PM me for a Snape-positive Discord server link, if you're interested.)

** Honestly that's pretty much bashing poor Hermione, it's like bringing her down to something worst than her Lockhart moment.. Snape's almost 40, has a horrible personality and isn't exactly good looking. He also hates muggles.. What exactly would Hermione find attractive in him especially when she has much more appropriate individuals all over the place?

Seriously, I find this pairings the most hideous form of bashing, because it isn't even intended as such.

***** Thanks! Someone's always got an unsolicited opinion to give! It's alright, I get that the pairing isn't everyone's bag. I read some excellent Hermione/Snape fics after running through all the Dramione known to man, and got hooked!
