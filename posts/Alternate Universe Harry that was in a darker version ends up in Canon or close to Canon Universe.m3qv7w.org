** There was an interesting fic I read a very long time ago where Harry was kidnapped by petigrew instead of betraying the potters location to Voldemort. He brought him Harry and Voldemort ends up raising him as a son. He takes on this sort of enforcer role in the death eaters where if they betray them, the “dark prince” comes and kills them. It was a great story. There were two sequels and I remember one of them being him swapping places with canon Harry. The story would switch back and forth between the perspectives. I'll see if I can find it if you're interested.

*** You're thinking of The Darkness Within by Kurinoone

linkffn(2913149)

The writing in the first one is migraine-inducing for grammar pedants like myself, so if OP is similarly inclined they might be better of with the re-write, even though it's incomplete

** linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) is similar to this, except people in the canon world go to the darker world. Canon Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny from one world, and Grey/Dark but not evil Harry, Hermione, and [redacted] from another end up in a third world where Voldemort wins, eventually conquers the entire world, and has Harry Potter as his second in command.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.
