This is a scene part from a story. I'm really hazy about this so I'm really sorry. Snape was young and a death eater, when Voldemort fell for the first time. Snape was interrogated by a team from overseas(America?), unlike other Death Eaters, he was treated nicer than others by the head of the team. The leader wears a fox mask, and cared for him. Pretty sure Snape was also tied to a pole for humiliation as well... As I said, really hazy on this, but thank you in advance!
