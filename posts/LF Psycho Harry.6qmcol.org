Something similar to 'Worthy of Magic' or 'Control' or 'Too young to die'. I think I might write one myself actually...

Billionaire psycho Harry meets a young Daphne and shows her a life of BDSM... Just kidding.


** Stop kidding and write a BDSM Harry Daphne for us.

*** I saw a story linked in this sub recently that had some BDSM play and aftercare involving HP as the dom and DG as the sub. I can't find the link off hand though, and I think it was on ao3 since it isn't vanilla enough for FFN.

**** linkffn(Dominating Daphne) if i recall correctly. The author has a revolving around HP/DG. Sorry, I just saw the vanilla thing. This is tame really, so definitely not the one you are looking for.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dark Knight) is exactly what the title suggests it is, with a psychotic, post-Azkaban Harry as the Joker. Such a pity it never got finished!
