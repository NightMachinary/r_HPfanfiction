A story where Harry becomes an Auror, but unbeknownst to anyone, he is actually wildly more powerful than the average wizard. It turns out, even among people who CAN cast a Patronus, most can't send 100+ dementors running for the hills. Since Harry pretty much only uses the Patronus Charm and the Disarming Charm, no one ever noticed how powerful he is. You can't disarm someone more than successfully, right?

Except Harry has a reputation for disarming and one desperate Death Eater on the run has a friend put a permanent sticking charm between his wand and his hand, thinking that will give him a vital edge.

Harry corners the man, "Expelliarmus!" and to the mutual horror of Harry, the Death Eater, and all of the witnesses, Harry very successfully disarms his target. At the shoulder.

Going to about the ramifications of too much power and too little control on every day spells, and the process of learning to cast spells that aren't dialed up to 11.


** Against a wandless opponent, Harry's /Expelliarmus/...:

- Physically removes the arms of its target, hence disarming them again.\\
- Summons a weapon to the hand of its target, and then promptly disarms them of it.\\
- Disarms the target of the /next/ wand, weapon or tool they pick up, an overpowered one making them butterfingers for days.\\
- Rips out the target's magic, rendering them a squib (until they can put said magic back, anyway).

**** But wait, doesn't it also throw the opponent's weapon at you?

Because that would imply that only the skull and outer squishy parts would be blown off and the brain itself would fly into his hand.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
