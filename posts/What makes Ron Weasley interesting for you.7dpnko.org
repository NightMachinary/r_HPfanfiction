There are all sorts of Ron Weasley's in fanfiction, anywhere from canon Ron to evil Death Eater Ron. Why kind of characteristics do you like seeing Ron have in fanfiction?


** I don't know that I've ever seen a Ron written the way I imagine him in my head canon.

Ron's at his best when supporting a character (Harry, usually) that has to make rough decisions. Loyalty is a big part of Ron's character, but the interesting and powerful part of Ron's personality is /faith/. Once he matures and learns to deal with his insecurity issues, Ron provides a brick wall to lean against for people who tend to get caught up in trying to be perfect. Which is why I think he's such a fantastic companion for both Harry and Hermione, both of whom try to put the world on their back in different ways.

As far as Ron on an island goes, I don't think he gets nearly enough credit for the kind of mind that's required to be good at chess. His memory has to be very good, he needs the ability to juggle possibilities and decision trees, and it betrays a willingness for delayed gratification that's not present anywhere else in the younger parts of his life. Hermione (and everyone else) scoffs at him because he isn't interested in academics, but he still manages quite a few OWLs just listening to her. Given something that he actually wants, I imagine him excelling.

To be honest, I feel like Ron bashing is popular because the canon books (even before the movies) already start down that road. Other than the chess game in book one and destroying the locket in book seven, he's never put in a situation where his talents (multi-track mind, faith in his friends) shine. Instead he's mostly comic relief, which is a fun part of his personality, but not really indicative of his potential as an adult and Harry's best friend.

*** Yeah people blame the movies entirely for ruining Ron's image but the books don't really do a great job of showcasing his talents and uses, and instead sacrifice those things for comic relief. Ron doesn't really get to shine even in the books. It would have been awesome that chess playing analytical mind thing wasn't abandoned entirely.

** Ron is one of my favourite characters in the HP story, but he's a little frustrating because he never comes into his own.

Ron is an underdog story waiting to happen, but which never really DOES happen, because he's constantly being shoved aside so that Harry (and to a lesser extent Hermione) can shine. He does have his small triumphs, but they tend to happen off-screen and/or immediately be overshadowed by Harry's problems or accomplishments.

Thing is, JKR lets Ron realise this and be understandably frustrated by it, but she never lets him overcome it. As a result, Ron enters the story as the kid who's constantly overshadowed by his siblings, and as a result is usually ignored and overlooked.... and he exits the story as the kid who's constantly overshadowed by his FRIENDS, and as a result is usually ignored and overlooked. The only thing that's changed is who he's being overshadowed by.

Really, though, Ron is one of the more relatable characters in the HP universe, and weirdly enough I think that's one reason why he's so hated: Harry and Hermione both work as representations of our hopes and dreams that we're special, but Ron is more a representation of our fears that we aren't.

As fans and readers we can and do fantasise about being Harry the Hero, who goes from misunderstood nobody to rich and famous celebrity who ultimately defeats evil and saves the world,

We can fantasise about being Hermione the Genius, at first mocked and shunned for her bookish and nerdy ways but eventually growing up to be the pretty and popular and successful Smartest Witch Of Her Age.

But nobody fantasises about being Ron the Overshadowed; the one nobody remembers the name of, the one who has to make due with second-hand wands and books that fall apart, the one who's a fairly average person surrounded by prodigies and talented genius, who never catches up to the people around him no matter what he does, whose lot in life is to be mocked, forgotten and brushed aside.

And yet, let's face it... Ron is the person we WOULD be if we were in the wizarding world. We might tell ourselves that we'd be a much cooler version of Harry who doesn't take crap from anyone, or a prettier version of Hermione, who gets everyone's respect, but deep down I think we all suspect and fear that we would be Ron, unimportant and overlooked, and the most we could hope for would be some small moments of personal triumph or at least get a few laughs from the audience before the important people, the ones who mattered, took over and saved the day by themselves.

Who would really want to have a madman after them, even if it meant fame and a little money (we don't know how much his trust-vault contains after all! That's why some fanfiction writers make him rich and others only give him enough to finish Hogwarts!)?

I might not be good at Quidditch (not into professional sports, unless you mean watching them on the telly), but I'd be better than Ron at magic because I'd simply practise till I get it right (sorry, but being able to impose your will on the universe with a few words and a stick?

**** In what way did Harry nearly DIE because of Ron's jealousy? Ron's jealousy didn't sic a dragon on him or force him into the Triwizard Tournament or plot to have him meet up with Voldemort. Ron's jealousy had nothing at all to do with Harry's predicament, the plot would ultimately have happened the exact same way whether Ron was jealous or not.

I know fans love blaming Ron for everything, but this is STRETCHING it.

PS: Yeah, that's what they all say. It's a lot easier to IMAGINE all the cool stuff you would do, than it would be to actually DO it.

** I'm not a huge fan of Ron (I admit I liked The Champion's champion a little too much), but I like Bro Ron.

He's not perfect, but who is it. He has your (Harry's) back. He may sometimes feel jealous about Harry's wealth, but then he realizes he has a different kind of fortune.

In the end, Ron's a bro. The kind of bro everyone has seen somewhere.

** I like to see a neutral Ron, in terms of alignments, Harry, Hermione and Ron plot quite neatly on to Chaotic Good, Lawful Good, Neutral Good early on. (They later migrate away from Good to shades of Neutral at different points).

I feel like that speaks to their politics as characters, too. Hermione, despite the social justice bent, is probably naturally one of the most traditional of the three. Ron is traditional too, but in a different way, due to his different background - wizarding vs muggle. Harry though, is almost from the word go out to break the system and constantly comes into conflict with it.

It's actually a reason I do believe in the Ron/Hermione pairing, although I also enjoy reading deconstructions of it based on certain characteristics that can be emphasized. They're actually both quite traditional. They also quite neatly form a quite typical British male-female relationship pairing model (from the 80s-90s, at least, very common - no clue how it was in the US) of a fairly traditional man pairing with a slightly less traditional, but still with quite traditional values, woman. For all Hermione will be a working woman and might not be super domestic, she'll definitely bring up her kids to behave and be good in school and /follow the rules/.

Other elements of Ron that I like: a Ron that's close with his family, especially Ginny, but not overprotective. I also like seeing Ron interact with a lot of the adult characters, Hagrid and Sirius would be two main examples.

** I want to see a delinquent Ron. Not an Evil Deatheater Ron, just a delinquent rebelling for attention. He's not Perfect Percy, or the Troublesome Twins, or Sweet Ginny, so his parents always kind of unintentionally skipped over him because he was always "doing okay" and not being a problem. And eventually he got fed up with that. He didn't want to do pranks like the twins, he just wanted to cause a mess.

I also want a Ron that can actually strategize to an extent. Not a chessmaster Ron, but the Quidditch Fanatic Ron that actually understands the concepts that govern professional Quidditch play, like how different players are valued more due to current team needs, or tactically cutting your losses like what Krum did in the World Cup. He'll take these things he learns and apply them to real life.

I agree with Ron.

Bulgaria were only a couple points away from winning with the Snitch. There have been FAR larger comebacks in the history of professional sport.

Krum feared humiliation more than defeat. He disrespected his own teams commitment and passion for victory.

****** Catching the snitch earns your team 150 points and ends the game.

Krum caught the snitch when his team (the Bulgarians) had 10 points, but the opposing team (the Irish) had 170.

So, Bulgaria earns an additional 150 points for catching the snitch and then the game ends. The final score was 160 to Bulgaria, and 170 to Ireland, meaning Ireland won the game and the World Championship.

To put it simply, Krum chose to end the game knowing his team would lose. Harry justify's it by saying that Krum "wanted to end the game on his terms," or something, but in doing so he conceded victory to his opponents.

Krum basically lost morale and gave up on winning.

***** This is the issue with a game with no defined stop time. Let's say Krum outclassed the Irish seeker so greatly that he could prolong the game indefinitely by preventing the snitch from being caught. Does he just never let the game end? The score was 170-10 after, let's say, a couple of hours. In a few more hours it may have been 500-40. Tomorrow the deficit may be in the thousands. He has to let it end some time. He chose to save not only himself, but his team the humiliation of losing by a 3 or even 4 digit deficit.

****** If Krum didn't catch the snitch Bulgaria could have defeated Ireland.

Krum took a certain defeat over the possibility of winning.

You're right in that Ireland could have beat them 500-40 or something, but it's better to at least try and win instead of just simply giving up because the score is close. If it came to such a resounding loss then you've lost anyway, it's better to go for the win than concede for a close lose. (If it weren't the world cup that would be different, as then you need to take into account points lost and won, but it was the final match of the world cup meaning it's win or lose.)

Did he? I didn't remember. I still think it was a good move, especially if the entire World Cup was points based like some people make the Hogwarts tournaments. Losing by ten points in a match is not a bad thing if you're already leading the Cup by a hundred.

You're comparing apples to oranges. Harry tries to empathize with Krum's mindset, but to Ron, it doesn't matter how badly you lose, a loss is a loss. He had a /chance/ to let his team score before catching the snitch, but according to Harry's own opinion, all Krum was doing was saving face.

Think of it like American football. Imagine at the Superbowl, it's 56 - 52 and there's 10 seconds left in the game. Your team can either run it in the chance that they get a touchdown, worth six points, meaning they win the game; or they can go for a field goal, which is worth three points, which means whether they make it or not, they're still losing.

Ron doesn't see the point of the field goal because you're still losing. You've actually got a chance of winning if you run the ball. This actually translates well to strategy, since Ron seems more the type to go out fighting.

********** I think Quidditch is a lot like most team games these days. An absolute shit show at the lower levels, and optimized to extreme levels in pro play. The fact that Ireland was actually able to win purely from goals is proof enough that the Snitch isn't the end all of Quidditch, just a decisive element of it. I also favor the headcanon that there are tiers of Snitch difficulty, those being School, Amateur, and Professional, with each level amping up the speed and agility of the Snitch. Perhaps at the School level, the Snitch could be worth fifty points to give the chasers more of a chance to affect the game and give the more incentive to play. It would also give the Seekers incentive to run interference with opposing players, rather than just hunting the Snitch all the time. Generally make the game more involved.

******** Interpretation that's more Ron friendly:

Bulgaria's chasers lose to Ireland's, but when Bulgaria is only ten points ahead variance and bursts of skill could still make it a draw or even a win for Bulgaria if he catches it a little later. There's no reason for Krum to not let the snitch go and catch it before they're 50+ points behind unless it was 100% him or Lynch.

Ron is also a very emotional character and has been known to let emotion rule his logic. I see Ron as being more in denial about Krum's move rather than not understanding it.

If you want to see a betrayal, look at Peter Pettigrew: Selling his friends out to the bad guy for his own personal safety, getting two of them killed and a third one framed for their murder -- THAT'S betrayal.

And the second so-called betrayal? He leaves because Harry TELLS him to leave. It goes like this, more or less:

RON: This camping trip sucks, we're not getting anywhere!\\
HARRY: Boo-hoo, cry me a river. Nobody said it would be easy!\\
