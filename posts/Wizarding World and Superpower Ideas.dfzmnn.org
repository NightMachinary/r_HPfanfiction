So I have been throwing this around in my head for a bit, and thought it merited further discussion. So lets talk superpowers in HP fics.

Now first of all, its very rare that this is done well. I think there are a couple of reasons for this:

1. Magic in HP can sort of do the majority of things traditional superhero archetypes are built around - flight, levitation, elemental manipulation, telekinesis, etc. In most cases, giving alternative means of doing the same comes across as either lazy or cheap, and certainly redundant. The most common example I have encountered is "magic manipulation or sensing," which is always taken to such an extreme it usually takes aways conflict and tension (looking at you Blindness).
2. Origin of powers is often lacking frankly. In many cases, the most iconic parts of superheroes histories are their origin stories and how they got their powers: Superman was an alien who gained power from solar radiation; Batman was a rich kid who watched his parents be gunned down; Magneto was a holocaust survivor; Spiderman was bitten by a radioactive spider and accidentally perpetuated his uncle's death. When a character is just given their powers, or born with them (see Queenie in the recent movies for example) it often comes across as just a way of making other parts of a story work. Even Harry in canon being a parseltongue works because of the history, the origin of his abilities.
3. There are already several existing innate abilities as well (metamorphmagi, seers, parseltongue, etc.) that are almost all seemingly linked to inheritance. This complicates any ideas of outside abilities, or rather makes it more difficult to buy Harry or Hermione or Ron just getting powers. Its also somewhat problematic for Harry's case as he already has several Voldemort-related superpowers.

Now that I have gotten some issues out of the way, I fully admit I am interested in seeing any fics that could do this well. I think a key characteristic for a good HP with superpower(s) fic would be /uniqueness/ of the abilities. From the three above points, I think the main requirements for a good superpower fic would be:

1. A unique power set that does not break the world of HP (i.e. most OP/Indy/wish-fulfillment fics). So the MC would need to gain/have power(s) that fill some niche not really occupied by most HP magic.
2. The power(s) change the MC behavior, or can even affect the plotline and change canon. Not because they are uber-talented, but because the ability would change the person's behavior or perceptions.
3. Adds to the magic of the wizarding world. The abilities create new adventures and characterizations to varying degrees.

With that finished, what are your thoughts? What sorts of powers would work well in an HP fic and not break the world/story/conflict? Can you think of fics that fit any of these ideas too?


** I consider magic itself a form of superpower.

While writers are welcome to add more innate abilities, I believe canon itself already provides sufficient ones.

There's no need to heap every cool feats on the MC either. How about stay true to the canon friendship concept and let your team members have their moments? Canon Tonks is actually horribly underutilized, and Harry's Parseltongue is pretty much only a plot device for CoS.

Then there's the balance of power issue. Canon heaps most cool feats on the bad guys and uses literary weapons (Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, Plot Armors, and the ‚ÄúLucky Hero‚Äù trope) to give good guys a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe fine for children's fairytales, but not good for me and millions other likeminded fans. JKR made up all these cool magical plot devices, but has she ever considered what their repeat use would lead to? Why didn't Voldemort hide his Horcruxes under Fidelius Charm with him as the Secret Keeper (And don't tell me that bullshit contrived nonsense that he couldn't trust his Death Eaters! He gave two of them directly for fuck's sake!)? Why wouldn't the Order, Ministry, and Voldemort require Unbreakable Vows whenever necessary? Why didn't Voldemort just march into the White House and Kremlin, Imperius their bosses and order them to fire all their nukes (I highly doubt those MACUSA goons or their Russkie equivalent could stop him)? That would get rid of 95% Muggles in a few weeks, and who would give a fuck about SoS then?

Finally, if you are writing about wars, at least get yourself informed on how to fight wars and incorporate all these superpowers (magic in HP's case). Two group of dumb asses standing in lines slinging curses at each other is not fighting wars, it's stupid writing from some ignorant fic authors. Even worse: bad guys throw every Unforgivables including the kitchen sink at the good guys, while the good guys answer with stunners, protegos, and Rictumsempra(!). üòñ

** Has anyone explored wands as sources of more minor powers? Like hazel wands finding water by weeping silver smoke. Or laurel striking someone who attempts to steal it with lightning (interesting defense against expelliarmus perhaps?).

** I have an oc who narrowly avoided becoming an obscurus, and can't cast any magic externally, but is basically a metamorphmagus on steroids.
