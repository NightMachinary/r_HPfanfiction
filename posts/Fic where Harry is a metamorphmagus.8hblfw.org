  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** In linkffn(darkness ascendant) tonks teases him constantly, promises to be his virgin slayer when he's fifteen, and he is a metamorphmagus but only enough to grow his hair and nails. He plans to start taking a potion regularly to strengthen the nails/nailbed so they can be used as a weapon if need be after the end of first year.

**** They asked for a Harry/Tonks pairing. Outside of old pureblood families in HP (e.g. Sirius's parents were second-cousins), most aren't interested in relationships or marriage with their second-cousins. So my story wouldn't meet that criteria OP asked for.

***** But is that like, something that people actually make a deal about if things do happen? Cuz like, as far as I know sexual or romantic interest in family beyond parents and siblings isn't all that odd or something most people find particularly repugnant

******* Okay, so I did some asking about and it seems to be one of those personal or cultural things. I brought up the matter with some friends last night and this morning. Like, some people I asked thought it was odd but not that off, like three people I asked were like nope that's inbreeding fuck that and the rest were either like not my thing but you do you or like whatever it just seems unlikely.
