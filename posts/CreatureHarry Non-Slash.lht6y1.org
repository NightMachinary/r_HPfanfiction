I've seen threads like this before, but they're pretty much dead and I'm still looking, so...

I'm looking for fics were Harry spends a good amount of time as / is a nonhuman creature. I don't care if it's an animagus form, a potions accident, or anything. The only thing that I don't want is fics where the only point of the thing is kinky sex or alpha/beta/omega stuff.

Some of the stuff I've read already include:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5621051/1/Outcast-s-Alley][Outcast's Alley]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle][Growing up Kneazle]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11863465/1/Lord-of-the-Wind][Lord of the Wind]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry is a Dragon and Thats Okay]]

There are definitely more, but I think those are the most well-known and it shows the variety of stuff I'll take.

Edit: Grammar and formatting.


** Most of it is slash... and, well, /bad/ slash, isn't it?

Two of these are /tagged/ with a slash relationship but contain no actual pairing. More info below. So. Ones you've missed include:

- Dragon of Moria (pre-slash is kind of sort of implied, but nothing actually happens. It's more of an awkward 'oh! he's pretty!' kind of thing.) - Lotr crossover.

- Incendio - Hobbit crossover, no pairings.

- Hermitage - Vampire. Some anime crossover I've never heard of before. Pre-slash, I guess? Nothing happens, not even in the sequels.

- Emerald Eyes and Black Diamond Scales - a rather unique percy jackson crossover. I /think/ a slash pairing was planned, but it was abandoned before it gets anywhere near that point. So, warning if the author returns from the abyss?

- Birth of a Phoenix - animagus form, wbwl. Writing is a little rough around the edges (but not unreadable). A suprisingly trope-free wbwl, no pairings.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called â€˜The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  Being bitten by a basilisk then healed by a phoenix has some unexpected consequences. "...I was awoken by my skin tingling, uncomfortable, but not something that worried me. The tingling grew to be unbearable, my skin was itchy and it felt like spiders were crawling all over me. I started to scratch, then I felt my magic almost... pop. I almost screamed, it hurt so bad. My body was flooded with power like I never felt before. My eyes seemed to burn and my body bubbled and burned. When I couldn't take any more my vision blackened.I wake up to hissing..."

Werewolf Harry, canon pairing (Harry/Ginny), it stays 'innocent' throughout (very minor soulmate-type stuff, not in a sexual way or I wouldn't have linked it). Sequel's been on 'hiatus' for the better part of 4 years now, which is a shame but there's a lot there already.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Mother) is an odd one: infant Harry uses accidental magic to apparate away from the Dursleys to a magical creature who blood adopts him and raises him. So he becomes a human/Dragon hybrid. Then he becomes very Scottish. There is bashing of Ron and Dumbledore, Luna is freaking adorable.
