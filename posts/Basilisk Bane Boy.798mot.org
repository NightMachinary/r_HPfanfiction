Harry Potter.

He's twelve years old and in a desperate attempt to save his friend's little sister, he does something incredible.

Harry discovers the location of the fabled and lost Chamber of Secrets. He presses onward when he is separated from Ron. Inside, he finds /Salazar Slytherin's/ own Basilisk.

A /phoenix/ flies in from fucking nowhere and provides the Sorting Hat to Harry. He then discovers the long lost legendary Sword of Gryffindor and uses to slay a millennia old monster.

Sweet merciful fuckin' Merlin. This is an absolutely absurd achievement, I would say it's easily on par with surviving the Killing Curse and becoming the Boy Who Lived. Seriously, if it was known/proven this would be /global/ news.

A story could hardly be more legendary. This makes Dumbledore defeating Grindelwald look positively mundane - it would fit right in as one of those ridiculous Harry Potter fictional novels that are mentioned so much in fanon.

I'm looking for fanfictions where Harry slaying the Basilisk becomes common knowledge and appropriately respected.

The closest fic I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]] linkffn(11265467). But that's not what I want. I want more of a focus on how incredible Harry's feat really is.

Any recommendations?


** I know exactly what you mean, I wish the same.

I actually have a story planned out where exactly this happens. Before year 3, when Harry's idling in Diagon Alley, he meets Newt, they start talking, and Newt starts bragging about all the dangerous creatures he's met - and then Harry mentions casually that he met some Acrumantula and slew a basilisk. It goes from there.

I'll probably not even really start it within the next two months (Busy with another story, and while I had a shitty first chapter written, I'd rather forget that)

*** That could be interesting. I wonder where exactly you'd take it from there.

I guess Newt would be dying to see the Basilisk. He then takes it out of the chamber, records it, it makes front page on the news, etc.

No real idea where else the fic would go though.

** Boy are you right about this. That stuff was positively heroic and one of the better reasons why I'm able to swallow stories where Harry just absolutely curbstomps things. J.K. herself has made Harry potter do legitimately legendary things so why not fanfic? Unless it's just badly done, you know what i mean. "I hAZ THE POWER OF 1000 magical cores also elemaental showdow magic whoosh there went the plot". Yeah.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** linkffn(Accidental Animagus) Slaying the Basilisk became one of his more well known achievements.

Harry slaying the Basilisk can also be seen as proof that The-Boy-Who-Lived was more than just a fluke.
