I'll start.

​

I first discovered fanfiction back in fourth grade, when I was convinced that Neil Gaiman had posted a sequel to his novel /Coraline/ on the Internet. For hours every day, I trawled web pages on my father's iPad 2, trying to find it.

I never found it, but the notion of fiction written by fans, based on another work, never left my mind.

In the first few days of fifth grade, on a library computer, I discovered a website called fanfiction.net. My first fandom was, obviously, Coraline, and, every day, I would read hundreds of words of fanfic, looking for the official sequel.

I eventually began to branch out into other fandoms --- A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Mysterious Benedict Society, and, of course, Harry Potter --- being among them. I was in the middle of fifth grade at this point, about 10-11 years old.

My first Harry Potter fanfic was one where Vernon beats the shit out of Harry. Harry wakes up in Tom's house, and begs Tom to “just fucking kill me”. It's probably important to mention that Tom did not look like Voldemort in this fic.

I still can't find it.

Harry Potter fanfiction was also how, through the Harry/Draco ship, I discovered homosexuality. I didn't know what being gay meant at that point so it was very alien to me.

The first /good/ Harry Potter fanfic I discovered, on my own, no less, was /Magical Relations/ by evancentracend. I was in seventh grade at the time.

That night, a friend told me about this fanfiction called /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/. I read it, and I loved it.

Thus, I discovered HPMOR. This was the fic that really made me love science.

A few months later, I discovered /The Accidental Animagus/ by White Squirrel. I loved it, and I immediately began recommending it to everyone I met. A few months later, I discovered /The Arithmancer/, by the same author. I discovered [[/r/hpfanfiction]] the next day, and I consistently began finding actually good fanfiction.

When I graduated middle school, I was reading thousands of words of fanfic a day.

On the fifth day of ninth grade, I discovered /Innocent/ by MarauderLover7, and I fell in love with it. The plot captivated me, and the characterization absolutely hooked me in.

At the “Back To School Dance” in my sophomore year, the girl I was dancing with recommended MarauderLover7 to me, I told her I already knew about that author.

A few days into 10th grade, /Lady Archimedes/, the sequel to /The Arithmancer/, began. The proverbial dam that had been building up since the middle of eighth grade broke around the middle of my sophomore year, and, because of the Arithmancer-Verse, I began to really love the subject of mathematics.

On May 25th, 2017, I came across a person sitting against a row of lockers. I initially thought they were someone else, so I said hello. They said hi back and continued the conversation. I then discovered that they were reading Harry Potter fanfiction.

We're still friends to this day.

Harry Potter fanfiction has influenced my life in ways that I could never have guessed, and I'm ever so grateful I discovered it.

Thank you for being such a wonderful community.

**** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality has a lot of big words and big scientific concepts (Harry is adopted and raised by scientist parents), so you'll pick up a lot of new words, although even as a native english speaker who's in college studying engineering, this gave me quite a big headache with how verbose it was at times.

** For me it was a great help in improving my English. When I was a teenager I read Harry Potter series in my native language and later, I don't remember how, I found out about the concept of fanfiction and read the few good fanfictions written in my language. But the thirst for more fanfiction never subsided and later, when I began to learn English the thought of reading so many fanfictions available in English was a wonderful motivation for me. The first actual, non-textbook thing I read in English was fanfiction. These days I can't find anything good though, I have read so many fics that there aren't many good ones left. I'm really picky, so I have a hard time finding anything worth reading.

** The works of Dorothea Greengrass (on FFN) inspired me to start writing again after going to University to learn how to write cured me of wanting to write more than 20 years ago.

I have 7 novel-size stories on the go, a list of 16 more I haven't started, and I look forward to each day because writing makes me happy. Happiness I didn't have for more than 20 years because someone was paid to teach something they had no business talking about.

Don't believe what you're told. Believe in yourself. Write what you want to write because you want to write it.

** I started with Lord of the Rings fan fiction - and that helped me with my elvish. Then I discovered Harry Potter fan fiction and I learned the...mechanics of being gay. I knew what homosexuality was but I didn't know how it worked physically. I also started reading fanfiction pre 2002- before OotP came out and pre horcruxes - mainly prediction based and now is not canon. What awesome times.

** I would say that it's made me think more deeply about characters, and reminded me that there are two, three, or dozens of sides to pretty much any story.

And it's also the reason I've dipped a toe into writing. Nothing more than a toe, but that much likely wouldn't have happened if I were starting from scratch.

Fanfiction gave me an outlet for my anger, and in turn, helped show me the wonders of writing. Something that still resonates to this day

So reading fanfics was kind of my gateway to learning about how to be more open and accepting of people from other religions, sexual orientations, politics... read a lot of Star Trek fanfics back in the day.

** I discovered Harry Potter fanfiction about eighteen months ago, and it's given my writing a purpose and made me feel welcomed. I'm a bit of a social outcast at school, and fanfiction communties just make me feel as though I'm part of a big family - especially Murder Most Unladylike fanfiction, where you recognise the authors who write several oneshots.

I just feel so much more happier with fanfiction in my life - I don't know what I did without it.

** I started reading fanfiction 8 years ago. At that time, Becky G was up and coming and I learned that G stands for Gomez. So I googled if she was related to Selena Gomez and ended up on Movelas. I read a bunch of Becky G fanfics then 1D fics even though I barely listened to their music. This was how I was introduced to erotica and how gay sex works. And how sex works in general.

I didn't want to make an account on Wattpad so I was unable to read some fics I wanted. (Don't read fanfiction on Wattpad, it's rarely good. If it is, it's almost always cross posted on another website)

Anyway one day I googled Ron/Hermione erotica and that started my journey into Harry Potter fanfiction.

I read the fic (the [[/r/hr][r/hr]] erotica one) on Harry Potter fanfiction. Then I started using ffn.

This was my first forage into actual fics. Not necessarily good ones but ones that weren't pwp.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and The Mystic Knights;Forest of Mystery;Harry Crow; Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality)

And many more. I loved them. Although now 7 years later, I hate them. My tastes has drastically changed.

Soon enough I started reading Drarry. Which lead me to adult ffn. Anyway, this is where my undying love for Lucius comes from. I hadn't read deathly hallows or even hbp yet. So Narcissa wasn't really a character in my mind. Lucius was though. Going through my sexuality crisis I wanted nothing more than an accepting family. Fics where Lucius was an accepting and supporting father made him my favourite character. Despite his flaws he was still a good dad. Something I wanted out of my own dad. Years later and he's still my fav.

One day I came across linkffn(Runaway Wizard) which inspired me to read Lucius centric fics. I'm always down for some well written Lucissa, Snucius and Lumione. I've even read a few good Larry fics.

I can't think of any Snucius or Lucissa fics off the top of my head but there are so many.

As for Lumione well I love linkffn(Hungry, Thirsty, Crazy) to the point I made my suicide note a poem with that title. I also love linkao3(Anyone On The Line).

That last fic led me to ao3. I started reading it the moment the first chapter was posted on adult ffn but my new school had a wall that blocked that site. So I moved to ao3 and I fell in love.

Anyway fanfiction has become my main coping mechanism and I'm probably addicted. The only time I've ever gone an extended period of time (it was 7 days the first time and 5 the next) without it was when I was hospitalised. And I spent 50% of the time dreaming of fics and the rest convincing them I'm not a danger to myself or society and they can discharge me.

It's improved my reading skills, my comprehension levels, my trivia knowledge, my history knowledge etc.

Now when I read fics, I automatically beta them in my head. Although I never give my work to the authors.
