I'm looking for fics where Harry is believed to be dead. Could be that he's been captured, is ill and being taken care of somewhere, etc.

Would like a complete story, or at least one that's moving. Ships or no.


** I'm sorry to be this one guy but seeing as you did it twice. Recommendation flair is to recommend to others. If you're looking for some fics corresponding to some requirements use "Request" and if it's for one specific fic you read before use "Fic Search".

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.
