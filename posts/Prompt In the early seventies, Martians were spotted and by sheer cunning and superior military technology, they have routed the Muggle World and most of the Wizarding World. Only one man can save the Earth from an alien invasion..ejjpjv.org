I have read fics in which Harry Potter goes to space and I wondered for a moment as to how Mr. Riddle will deal with an alien invasion. Basically, I am looking for a Harry Potter and Mars Attacks crossover.


** Honestly he would probably just commit random acts of violence while hiding under a fidelius charm. To be perfectly honest he's not a great Dark Lord. Grindelwald on the other hand is an excellent villian and would handle this situation better. He would either gather all remaining humans under his command. Binding them together magical and non magical alike. Or he would ally with the invaders and then betray them and attempt to take over from the inside.

*** I could see a fic that uses both, having Grindelwald be the chessmaster who allies himself with the invaders (and the only thing restraining their power, truly working for the greater good) and Tom a terrorist member of the "resistance" who ultimately proves useless. Dumbledore could be on either side, depending on how you characterise him.

**** I could see Dumbledore siding with the invaders. But I've read way too many fics bashing him to be impartial honestly lol. But yah I like that idea. It would be a very interesting fic to see play out.
