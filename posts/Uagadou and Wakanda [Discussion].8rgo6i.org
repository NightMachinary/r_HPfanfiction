This is something I had forgotten I put in my outline for a story I'm drafting. Has anyone done an Avengers crossover where Uagadou is located in Wakanda? My idea for my story was that since Wakanda (in the MCU) hid itself around when the European slave trade was booming, they might have gotten away with not hiding the existence of magic to their muggles (if magic became too wedded to the country's activities, I doubt any could enforce the statute upon them given the addition of high technology). Of course, the Mountains of the Moon are about 200-300 km north of where the MCU Wakanda is located, but that's an easy fix (just flip Wakanda north over Lake Kivu).

Would be interested if anyone has done that before. I thought I saw it mentioned as an idea on this sub before, but my search turned nothing up.

Edit: oops, wrong flair...


** Not a bad idea. Especially with how hidden they are from the world. It would make sense to have a school there. The main problem is I don't see why they would hide, which would be a large problem in canon.

For a crossover idea I had, Wakanda didn't have wizards as vibranium sucks the magic out from the area over time. It's a no-go area because of it.

*** Why who would hide? I'm thinking that magic would be known to the Wakandans since they hid from the world (because of their Vibranium) before the SoS. So Uagadou would just be a really exclusive school in the country, unknown outside Wakanda save for the magical community (which is rather interwoven in canon due to the SoS). Might use it in my story to explain how their tech jumped ahead so drastically (magitech, or whatever I end up calling it).

Vibranium is so weird in the comics. Most of the time magic just beats it (especially Ultron, heh) but otherwise the metal is too OP.

**** The whole point of the International Confederation of Wizards is the statute of secrecy. I couldn't imagine they would be pleased with a whole nation knowing there is wizards about. Even if this country is half hidden from the world already. You would also run into the problem of magical children outside of wakanda. Do they get to learn about the secret of wakanda in order to go to school?

I haven't read the comics, so I'm not sure how the metal acts like. I wasn't thinking that it will attract spells, so people wearing the metal are immune... More that it gains its strength by slowly leeching any magic in the area.

***** Ah, I see. The idea, I guess, is that given how militarized the country became there's not much they can do. They can gripe, but since no wizarding community has a military, it's hard to pressure such a setup (magic + most advanced technology) by their usual means (especially since it went into hiding before the SoS). I suppose it wouldn't be hidden from the magical community, mostly because none of them are militarized and they have to be able to trade with someone.

Ah, interesting idea. To be honest, the comics are all over the place (as usual). It's usually nearly impossible to destroy without some kind of supernatural or atomic level attack.

***** I might use that magic leeching idea of yours, but mostly by incorporating it with the flower that gives the Black Panther abilities. I find it odd that a plant mutated by mass vibranium exposure would also allow one to speak with the dead. At least if magic is partly involved, I can gesture at that. :)

** Fun fact: In the German version of Black Panther 'Wakanda Forever' was translated as 'Wakanda Ã¼ber alles.'
