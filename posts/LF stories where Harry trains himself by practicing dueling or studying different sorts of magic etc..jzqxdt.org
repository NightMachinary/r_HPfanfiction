So i'm basically looking for stories where Harry trains himself but it needs to be as realistic as possible. There are quite a few stories out there where Harry just becomes the most powerful wizard in like a day. Those aren't really my type of stories.

Hopefully any of you have some suggestions :)


** linkffn(The Merging; Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Both are complete, although the latter has an abandoned sequel.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** For extreme case of self teaching try linkffn(2488754). I would argue it is more an original story with some cameos by HP characters, with Harry a complete OC, but definitely worth reading. Unfortunately the third book was abandoned.

Rise of the Alpha series linkffn(6389117). Goes from year 1 to the end with Slytherin Harry teaching himself (with some adult help) and eventually the rest of the school how to fight until they are an entire army. One of the best 'battle of Hogwarts' I have ever read.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** A more studious Harry trains with Ron and Hermione's help to defeat Voldemort after learning he is a Horcrux at the end of first year. A note of caution: it appears to be abandoned and we never reach the point where Harry can hold his own against a significant threat. But I still think it's worth a read. linkffn(The Horcrux Within by althor42)

  AU When Harry is fighting Voldemort for the Philosopher's Stone, he makes the horrible discovery that he is keeping Voldemort alive by hosting a fraction of his soul. What is the rest of Harry's time at Hogwarts like when he knows that he has to die?
