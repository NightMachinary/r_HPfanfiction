** "/Avada Kedrava!/" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Avada Ke-/dav/-ra, make sure the 'r' comes after the 'v', not the 'd'.

"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand and said, "/Avada Kedavra!/"

Their muggle fell off its seat in a flash of green light, and lay still upon the floor, eyes unseeing.

**** Clearly this is an excerpt from an AU where Voldemort won, and where muggleborns are taken at birth and given to proper upstanding wizarding families.

So, yes. The muggle is her mum.

** Frowning, Harry began to approach Ron slowly. “Ron, don't you think this is a bit excessive?”

Ron's eyes flicked to his before returning to the spider on the floor. “That thing is evil, Harry. Have you seen it's size?”

He flicked his wand again. Another green flash of light flew out and crashed against the arachnid crawling across the Acacia wooden tiles of the floor.

One second. Two.

Nothing. The spider got back up on its legs and began crawling across the floor again, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

Ron let out a loud groan. “Just die already! Merlin, what's wrong with the spiders in this house?”

Harry shook his head and looked on as his best friend prepared to cast yet another killing curse. He couldn't blame him for being unnerved, but this was taking it a bit too far.

*** when I posted this prompt, I imagined Voldemort casting the killing curse at Harry and just nothing happening.

This, though, feels perfectly in character. I could truly imagine Ron losing his head and trying to kill a spider.

****** I remember one very amusing fanfic where Harry goes on vacation, and one of the spots he stops in is Australia. One of the spiders bites him. Everyone is alarmed, then confused when the spider dies.

And OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED WHY THE SPIDERS KEPT BITING HIM.

******** In linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorchach's Blot), at one point, he gets bitten by one of Australia's particularly venomous spiders, only for the spider to die due to Harry's blood being poisonous.

The spiders KEEP biting him because he seems like a basilisk to them, and basilisks are natural enemies to spiders, for some reason(I have no clue WHY a spider would care about a snake, though)

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
