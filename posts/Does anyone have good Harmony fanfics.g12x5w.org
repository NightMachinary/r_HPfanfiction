**** All of them are Harry/Hermione. Tell me what you like to read and I will rank them for you. What tropes and Genres. Do you like fluff or hurt comfort. Angst? Humor?

***** Nevermind the genres bro, just rank them based on how much you liked them... Tbh, I'm not exactly sure what I'm more into as I'm not a regular reader... So just rank them based on quality if you could please...
