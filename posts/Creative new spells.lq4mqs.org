** In Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay, they were trying to invent a spell to duplicate books, accidentally creating a translation spell Xenographia until they managed to get the plain duplicating spell, Xerographia. You'd think the Xenographia is far more versatile, except they often got the result in extinct, incomprehensible languages.

Same goes with Tempus, while most fics treat it just like a regular clock, here the concept of our time keeping is being questioned, so it might give a completely useless result like "now", or based on different timezone, even planet.

** Wind Shear linkffn(12511998) has the Blood Gorger curse. The victim's blood explodes and anyone splattered is infected, who explode and so on. It's described as an army killer, where a mosquito can cause countless deaths.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** My first thought was a marvel HP crossover where someone uses that on Thanos's army in endgame but I'm not sure if they all have blood since they're aliens. Cool spell definitely creative.
