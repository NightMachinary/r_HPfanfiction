**** Speaking as someone who has Worm as their main fandom and Harry Potter as a distant second, it's just awful in every way. The utter bastardisation of Taylor's character is excruciating to read, as a very killing-averse, complex protagonist who looked back at her descent into villainy and extreme ruthlessness with enormous regret and wished she had done everything differently is turned into a one-dimensional caricature who slaughters enemies wholesale without the slightest flicker of remorse and gets away with it every time on the flimsiest of pretenses despite everybody knowing she is responsible. Every opponent she has is suddenly an incompetent moron incapable of learning from their mistakes or those of the many people she's previously killed while everybody else just stands around in awe at her amazing ability to warp the plot and story arcs of every other character around herself.

It's just the worst kind of wankfic.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.

  There are many universes in which one Harry James Potter discovers something or another, and things turn out vastly differently for him. Sometimes he finds a long-lost family member and they steal him away from the Dursleys, or learns that a professor of his is his birth father and that fact was hidden from them both by his mother, or he learns he can talk to snakes at a young age and they teach him things. In this one, he's given a book.
