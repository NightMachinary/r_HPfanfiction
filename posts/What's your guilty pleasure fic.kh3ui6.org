Have you got a fic that you know to be flawed, but you still enjoy it for what it is anyway?

Mine is "This Means War" by Jeconais. I know that Harry is a bit of a Mary Sue, everything comes much too easily for the heroes, and it's got some clichÃ©s, but I can't help being entertained every time I read it.


** Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes

It is the most sarcastic story I have ever read and I find it hilarious. It is a short read and I read it whenever I don't want to start a long fic. I would highly recommend it.

Actually I will start a reread of it now

** I hadn't thought about This Means War in ages but you're right, it's a fun fic despite the flaws you mentioned.

My personal guilty pleasure fic ATM is the Lone Traveler series. Harry's OPAF, there's a lot of telling without a lot of showing, and the narration tends to get a bit...preachy, but it's good for quick, episodic fix-it scenarios.

  Third in series, read prequels or be confused. Harry had spent his whole life wishing for magic to be more abundant, and that was precisely what he got. He wasn't even particularly upset about the many serious dangers inherent in such a thing, for what was life without challenge? The irony of ending up in Azeroth after all the references was a bit on the nose, though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance/ by epsi10n]]. Salazar Slytherin basically committed suicide by reincarnation in his old age, and came back as Hermione Granger a thousand-odd years later. Hermione, who goes by Sally, begins to try to resuscitate her previous life's reputation.

Because shenanigans, Snape ends up believing the portrait of Salazar is using Hermione as a go-between for the physical world, and ends up feeling responsible for making sure she doesn't get in over her hear.

It's amazing.

** My guilty pleasure is "Saving Draco Malfoy" bcuz' of the rap*/non-con and the things with the elves but... Ugh, I don't know, I still like to re-read it from time to time. Draco here is a little more like the Draco I see in my mind when they describe him like "pureblood, narcissistic, proud, Slytherin, survivor", so not taking into account his silver spoon persona we see in the books.

Summary: While the Wizarding world waits for Harry Potter to save them, Draco Malfoy decides to save himself.
