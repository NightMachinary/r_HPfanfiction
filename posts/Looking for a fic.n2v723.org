:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only scene I remember is that Snape comes back to Hogwarts with Bellatrix and co. and he has been harbouring fugitives and anti voldemort sentiments around the school all this time and so is fearful that they will be discovered. He had poisoned the Carrows with Draught of the Living Dead or smth earlier. But instead the school is in perfect 'order' and the death eaters (besides Bellatrix) are impressed? Crabbe (or Goyle) torture Pansy (I think) and someone has impersonated the Carrows very well.

Thank you for your help!

*** Yes! Thank you! That was it. I had a look at it, when I searched for myself and dismissed it then. But you were right :)
