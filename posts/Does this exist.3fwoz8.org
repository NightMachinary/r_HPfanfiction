*********** It's as opposed to a school you have to meet criteria to enter, like member of a society, the military, a religion or whatever. Anyone can just turn up, pay the fees and you're eligible. (There will probably be an entrance test first, though).

Britain has state schools, grammar schools, comprehensives, academies, independent schools, private schools and public schools in various combinations. It's not as simple as it could be.

******* Brit here. We never had Prefects at our school. But then I realised that our "Monitors" served the same purpose as them except they were limited to a single year and slightly more numerous than the ones in HP.

School houses are very much a thing though, depending on where you go to school.
