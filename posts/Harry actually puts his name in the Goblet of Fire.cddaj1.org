  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

** Harry puts his name in the Goblet of Fire under Hogwarts, while Crouch does so under no school. Harry, of course, gets chosen twice, and now he must compete in each task twice or else lose his magic. Of course, this is a problem for the 2nd and 3rd tasks- they have to acquire a time turner so he can complete them simultaneously.
