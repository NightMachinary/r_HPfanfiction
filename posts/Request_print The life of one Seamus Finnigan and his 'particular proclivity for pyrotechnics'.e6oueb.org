I really want to see a fic about Seamus' life, so from the pov of a side character. I also really want to see how Seamus' skill for blowing everything up evolved over the years.

Edit: title is supposed to say Prompt


** HoM Teacher (Not Binns): The next historical figure we shall look at is Seamus Finnegan. Can anyone tell me what was famous about him? Yes, Granger-Weasley?

A descendant of Ron and Hermione: He fought at the Battle Of Hogwarts as a member of Dumbledore's Army, and caused the event that broke the Statute of Secrecy.

Teacher: That is correct, point to Ravenclaw. Can anyone tell me what he famously did during that battle? Wicks?

Another student: Didn't he blow up a bridge or something?

Teacher: Correct, point to Slytherin. Finnegan had a natural affinity for the explosive kinds of magic, he holds the record for the most blown up Hogwarts cauldrons during his time as a student, and spent much of his later life running a demolition firm. In the battle of Hogwarts, he cast an overpowered Blasting Curse that single handedly caused the bridge to collapse with at least seven death eaters incapacitated due to it. The blockage he caused allowed for many of Dumbledore's Army to regroup and heal wounds, which may have saved the lives off some of your ancestors. However, Finnegan's particular proclivity for pyrotechnics was indeed what broke the Statute of Secrecy. Who remembers what he did and where? Pucey?

Third student: I don't know exactly /what he did/ but it was just outside Platform 9&3/4 right? The barrier was blocked off and he tried to blow it open?

Teacher: Not exactly. Yes, Granger-Weasley?

First Student: His family were running late, and his son was caught in between the barrier just as it was closing. He cast Bombarda on the barrier to stop him from suffocating.

Teacher: Correct again, another point to Ravenclaw. The whole event was caught on No-Maj Smartphones and spread across the Internet before the Ministry Obliviators could do anything. Which led to Minister Granger to make movements to abolish the Statute of Secrecy in order to explain ourselves and prevent a World War between No-Majs and Wizards, and the British adoption of the American phrase of defining a non magical person, as opposed to the demeaning “Muggle.” Finnegan's story is one of if you'll pardon the pun explosive consequences from the simple act of trying to save his son's life. Finnegan's Pyrotechnics stands today as a reputable firm that promotes destruction for the benefit of our lives.
