Disclaimer: This is my first fanfic so please don't expect me to be as good as J.K Rowling. She is an amazing author who has inspired many people to create their own stories. I would really appreciate it if you could give me lots of constructive criticism so I can improve.

Draco Malfoy. Sly. Cunning. Mean. Arrogant. Bully. Pureblood.\\
Slytherin.

Draco Malfoy was many things, but he was not soft hearted. At least, that's what he thought. Lately, he seemed to be becoming less like the person everyone expected. He didn't push people in the corridors, or hide their wands. And it was all because of one person. As he sat at  his desk during Potions he couldn't help but notice the sweet smell of vanilla coming from the desk in front of him. He looked up to see a girl with bushy brown hair staring right at him.

Hermione Granger. Smart. Brave. Logical. Pretty. Muggle born.\\
Gryffindor

"Draco," she whispered, " my quill."\\
He looked where she was pointing and saw the feather resting against one of the legs of his chair. Draco slowly picked it up. As he handed the quill to her, their fingertips touched. It felt like electricity, to Draco, and for a moment they stood frozen in time before they were snapped back into reality by the sound of Professor Snapes raspy voice.

"2nd years. Just because it's the end of the year you are not to neglect to schoolwork. There will be serious consequences. You are dismissed." He said with a snarl.

Draco's vision went blurry as he smelt a flurry of vanilla as Hermione dashed out of the classroom. He walked out a few moments later, perhaps he would get the chance to talk to her. But then he remembered how he had called her a mudblood earlier in the year. He had always made fun of her, because she was muggle born. But also because he was jealous of her. She was always top of the class and he could never beat her, so he was always second. He regretted all he had done to her. She would never want to talk to him. Anyway as she walked out she was immediately joined by Harry and Ron.

Potter, Draco thought, a vile disgusting excuse of a wizard. And Weasly was even worse, with his red hair and his hand-me-down robes. They would never be proper wizards, famous perhaps, but not legendary.

Draco would never admit it but Hermione was his driving force. Competing with her and always trying to beat her and gotten him good grades in all his classes. Hermione was his only competition.

Draco walked by trying to escape but instead bumped right into Hermione. His books fell from his arms and toppled to the floor. Draco hastily grabbed them and ran down the corridor. He was feeling a rush of emotions and felt his pale skin blush bright red. When he look back, he saw Hermione  staring at his hollow grey eyes and intense gaze that never left until he was out of sight.


** First of all this should go in self-promotion. Second provide a link to the fanfic rather than posting the whole chapter. Third, I can't remember third but I had something in mind.
