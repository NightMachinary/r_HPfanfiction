I am somewhat weary of coming across "Voldermort", "MacGonagoll", etc in fics. What are some of the most annoying and egregiously misspelled names you've encountered in fanfiction? My Immortal and Thirty H don't count, just to halt that floodwater.


** Does Hadrian count?

Lilly. Zambini. Fluer. Rudolphus.

*** Hadrian DOESN'T count, sadly, cause it's a perfectly acceptable "long version" of his name, like ron's is actually ronald, bill's is william, charlie is charles. it's not a canon one unlike the rest, but it could be short for hadrian, harold or harrison.

A few years ago it was practically an epidemic of "Ginerva" names out there. It's Ginevra, folks. And it's virtually never used, so just skip it altogether and stick with Ginny.

** Lilly bugs me a lot.

But I think the most common misspelling I've seen that I actually notice is misspelling Alastor into Alastair, Alastar or something like that.

Also, I have a habit of calling the Divinations professor Sybil whenever she comes up, because I can't spell her last name to save my life.

EDIT: ...and clearly I can't spell her first name either.
