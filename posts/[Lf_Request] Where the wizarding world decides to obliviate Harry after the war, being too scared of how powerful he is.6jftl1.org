** They obliviate him after the ootp trial at the ministry in linkffn(12200475). It devolved into twincest and fairly standard time travel tropes so I dropped it two chapters in.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
