So I love "Poison Pen" by GenkaiFan, and I'm wondering if there are other fics like it out there. In particular, letters to the editor type fics, and/or fics where Harry (realistically) navigates the legal side of the Wizarding World. Thanks!


** Not sure why, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/1/Inspected-By-No-13][Inspected by No 13]] always reminds me of Poison Pen.

** Edit: I think I misunderstood what kinds of fics you were looking for. Sorry about that.

I've always really liked letter fics, even if I /really/ hate all those wizards are sheeples ones.

My favorites are probably

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3638418/1/Pen-Pals][Penpals,]] a fic where Harry asks the Dark Lord not to do some things. Definitely not realistic, but short and funny(ish).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] This one's told through letters and diary entries. Really great fic, if a tad dark in places. It does a lot of expounding on mental magic and compulsions though, as well as some really interesting fanon about the status of women in the wizarding world. I haven't finished it yet (1/2of the way through I think) but it's been fantastic so far.

[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Dear_Tom/Dear_Tom/][Dear Tom]]: A really fun oneshot where the Order reads Harry's letters to Voldemort. This probably qualifies as what you're looking for with the whole solving problems with letters thing (no legal stuff though). Be sure to read to the end of this one. It's not some stupid-ass-white-washing-Dumbledore-is-a-puppy-raper bash fic, just a tad cracky.

** I've got linkffn(How Xenophilius Lovegood Saved Magical Britain by Arpad Hrunta) and linkffn(Letters from the Asylum by NarutosBrat), both are pretty amusing.

But the best epistolary style story I've ever read, hands down, is [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]. It's not quite what you were asking for, but it's awesome in its own right.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby comes with his warning, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, and his life, forever. A long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
