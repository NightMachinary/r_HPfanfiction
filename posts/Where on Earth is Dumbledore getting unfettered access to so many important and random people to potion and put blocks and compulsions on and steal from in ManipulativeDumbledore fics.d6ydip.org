** He's a longstanding headmaster of Hogwarts, Grand Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW. My headcanon is that he's very well respected and connected.

*** Sure, but he's potioning Harry and Snape and Sirius and children of families that both trust him and don't. Plus he's usually also depicted as incompetent as well as a con man in these fics. Like Gilderoy Lockhart but amped up.

**** Elves, using other people, so on and so forth. It's cartoonish, but we're talking about a children's book series.

** "Hey, it's me, ya boy dumbledore, come meet me I have an important question for you."

And there ya go. At the start of philosophers stone, I doubt there was anybody in the british wizarding world (and likely few in the european wizarding world) who wouldn't make the time to visit if Dumbledore asked them to. And it would only get worse has he ambushes more and more people and builds his reputation.

Even Lucious Malfoy would come, even if not running. Even if the pretext had nothing to do with running the school and his position on the school board.

Imagine if at the height of his career Elvis called you up one day and was like "Hey, wanna hang out? I'm paying." Even if you didn't particularly care for his music you know you'd go.

** I'm afraid that the simplest answer is that those kind of fics are simply badly written.

** It's a long con using the house elves of hogwarts. It started with snape “to ensure that he isn't attempting to double cross is and cause havoc” if anyone asks. Snape then makes more potions.

** Mostly I think it's just the writers who aren't very good at writing Dumbledore, especially writers who don't like him. They make him out to be this hyper-Machiavellian manipulator with his fingers in everything, but then have him totally and consistently lose in a battle of wits with an inexperienced and self.important teenager. Because you have to tell the reader how much he DESERVES the total and utter hatred that Harry shows, but also show that he's NO MATCH for borderline self insert super-Harry.

The fics aren't written to be consistent, they're just written to paint Dumbledore in as bad a light as possible, no matter if it makes sense ot not.
