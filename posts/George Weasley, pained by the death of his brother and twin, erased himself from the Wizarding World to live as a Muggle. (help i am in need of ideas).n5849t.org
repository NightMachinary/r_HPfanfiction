A short drabble by me :p

i didn't know how to flair this, so I just used self-promo

I'm not sure how to continue this, so if you have any ideas on where the story should go, please tell!

--------------

George Prewett was nothing special.

He'd live a normal, fulfilling and ultimately mundane life, just like everyone else. He'd live, finding a loving wife, having beautiful children and raising them well. He'd die, old and frail, surrounded by tender goodbyes, as he floated into the abyss of death.

George Prewett was nothing special.

He'd live a normal, dull and ultimately meaningless life, just like everyone else. He'd live off of paychecks and odd jobs, trying to make enough money to feed himself every day. He'd find love and she would leave, far, far too soon. His children would grow up and forget about him, only caring for him when he turned weak and sick. He'd fall into the abyss, knowing his life could have been more.

George Prewett was nothing special.

"Ahem." A forceful voice pushed him out of his thoughts, holding up a basket of groceries infront of him.

"Oh, very sorry, Ma'am." George said, "I'll get that scanned for you right away."

"What kind of etiquette does this store have?" She sneered. "Honestly, it's very rude not to listen when someone's right in front of you."

"Apologies, Ma'am." George replied in a sickly, sweet tone of voice. He'd dealt with annoying customers before, yet something about this one irked him more than it should.

"Good."

They were both silent for a good few minutes as George scanned her groceries, each item making a small beep noise.

He packaged all of them up neatly in a box and gave them over to the woman.

"You aren't going to help me carry it to my car?" She said.

George inhaled. "Sorry ma'am, I'll help you on that right away." He grit his teeth.

"If you're acting like that, you won't make it far in life." She said, as if talking to a toddler. "People aren't as forgiving as me."

He nodded, trying to appease her. "Noted, ma'am. Thank you for the advice."

After walking over to the sunny parking lot, she opened her car, waiting for George to put her stuff in.

Reluctantly, he did.

She drove off without a word of thanks, just like all other annoying customers do.

Sighing, he went back into the store, to shake off the thought the he would always be nothing special.

--------------

Percy Weasley never thought he would walk through a Muggle town ever in his life. He never thought it might actually intrigue him. Of course, he wasn't like his father, having a very odd and peculiar obsession with Muggle items.

Yet, something about this was drawing him in. It could be the electricity, working almost like magic would. It could be the atmosphere, always awake and always busy.

Percy Weasley never thought he would end up in a Muggle grocery store.

It was so... ordinary.

He didn't see anything as magicless as this in his life.

All the aisles were neatly arranged, tediously by hand. Restocked by people, not by the flick of a wand.

It was all so foreign.

He decided he would buy something.

He scanned the items upon the shelves in each aisle, looking for something that piqued his interest. He ended up in the children's section, eyes browsing all of the odd trinkets.

A can of worms.

He can't believe that caught his attention.

He didn't know what it was, he didn't know why he decided to buy it.

He walked up to the cashier with flaming red hair, almost looking like another Weasley. He walked closer and he could almost see it as-

"You actually are joking, Perce... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were--"

"Sir?" The cashier said. "You alright?"

"I- yes. I'm fine, thanks." Percy quickly stammered out. "I'd like to buy this please."

The cashier took the can out of his hands and-- Oh, Merlin, his hands were shaking. He desperately avoided looking at the cashier, pushing the thoughts of Fred away from his mind.

"Uhm, sir?" The cashier said, and it sounded so, so much like his brother. "Are you sure you're alright?"

"I'm fine." He said, making his voice as stable as he could. For goodness sake, he wasn't going to break down in a Muggle grocery store of all places.

Attempting to get out of the store as soon as possible, he paid for the can. Only to realize it wasn't Muggle money.

To his surprise, the cashier took it. The man who looked like his dead younger brother, the worried Muggle cashier that tried to ask him if he was alright, took in his sickles and knuts as payment. He didn't even bat an eye.

A dozen more questions ran into his head. Did he actually look like Fred or was Percy hallucinating? Was this cashier actually a wizard? Maybe a squib?

Percy bolted out of the store, leaving behind the odd Muggle toy he tried to purchase.

Merlin, he needed some rest.


** "Hem-Hem-" A forceful voice pushed him out of his thoughts, holding up a basket of groceries infront of him with the fakest of smiles.

"Oh, very sorry, Ma'am." George said, "I'll get that scanned for you right away."

"What kind of etiquette does this store have?" She sneered. "Oh no, this won't do. Honestly, you have been very naughty, not to listen when someone's right in front of you. Oh no, I'll have you helping me with my bags. Tut-tut... off you go..."

*** Plot twist: That woman was actually Umbridge having fled and George Weasley was actually on an undercover mission to find Umbridge and assassinate her as revenge for what she did in the (indirect) service of Mr. Noseless. What she doesn't know is that George sprayed magical contact poison on her groceries that would kill her and only her and leave no trace at all. Mission accomplished.

** I'm currently writing a one short because of this post. It's similar to this and I'll give you a snippet of the start:

/It was the year 2048 and George Prewett sat in the faded grey recliner at Stoneycroft Aged Care Centre. After the death of his twin brother Fred he moved to Stoneycroft, Liverpool to get away from the Wizarding World. The Wizarding World caused him too much pain. Fred, Harry, Ron, Bill and Fred. Hermione and Ginny. He had been with Fred until he was 19, since they were born to when Fred died in 1997. 19 is too young to die./

/Although he was 70 years old now, he could still pull a prank, trick or joke on anyone, just like his glory days with Fred, Lee and the marauders map. George brushed those thoughts away because there was no need to remember them anymore. To everyone at Stoneycroft he just went to the local public school and his parents were Albus and Minerva Prewett./

/The matron on shift, Hannah, walked around tending to all of the seniors needs. The smell of burnt coffee drifted away from the kitchen and filled the room. Through the window the snow fluttered gently down and icicles grew from the roof. It was almost Christmas time, the time George hated most. He missed his real family but knew it was pointless to try and escape./

/Tinsel decorated the room and a 2 meter tall pine tree stood tall. The tree was next to the blazing fireplace, nothing in comparison to the one in the Gryffindor common room. The whole room was nothing in comparison. George stood up, to walk back to his room, where he could think about these things alone./

In a few days when I'm done and have posted it, I'll link it here.

** In my mind I picture that George erased himself from the memory of his friends and family before leaving into the muggle world.(This would be a great magical feat enforcing that he is anything but ordinary). Maybe even erased his own (could go either way). When Percy unattentionly runs into him he doesn't recognize him but it jars his memory. Now he's having flashes of the past and a brother he doesn't have.

For him not to recognize Fred's twin you'd either have to make this an AU where they aren't identical twins or make it to where George has altered his appearance perhaps he can't stand seeing Fred reflection in the mirror because for just a second he thinks it him before realizing it's just his own reflection.

Could be told from either or both pov, but of from Percy's I'm picturing a mystery vibe with some feels. Sort of like running on air but with out the romance.

If from George's it would depend on if he remembers who he is. He could think he was going crazy. Remembering things that didn't happen. He could even start saying strange things out of habit, and of course add Percy following him around using magic to hide it could be entertaining.

*** I actually love the idea of George erasing himself from the memories of his family and friends and I agree it's the only way this prompt works, but he would also probably have to do something a bit more widespread since he was the co-owner of WWW and presumably somewhat well recognised.

I think it could probably tie into “canon” as well - we know that Ron eventually goes on to work as a partner at WWW, and I like the idea of a Percy redemption arc, so maybe it could be something like Percy accidentally runs into George somewhere, starts having flashbacks of Fred, thinks he's going crazy, runs into Angelina and ropes her into helping, then they talk to Hermione because she's the expert in memory spells amongst them, and then Ron gets involved. And they somehow find a way to bring George back.
