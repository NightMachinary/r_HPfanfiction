** Hmm. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966?view_full_work=true][Azoth]] linkao3(1049966) Male Harry is in eighth year and apprentices to portrait Snape and I believe he has a few conversations with Hermione about the future. Maybe that's the fic you are looking for?

**** Can you give more details about this fic? How long is it? Is it a one-shot or is it longer? I searched the combination of Portrait Snape and fem!Harry tags and there were no results. There are 3 fics that match Snape, fem!Harry, and Hogwarts Eighth Year, but none of them involve a dead Snape. Here's a search query that I used, including the characters of Hermione and Snape, along with fem!Harry and excluding a couple tags.
