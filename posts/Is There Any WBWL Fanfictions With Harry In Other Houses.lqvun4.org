Is there any WBWL fanfictions with Harry in other houses. I see too many WBWL fanfictions with Harry in Slytherin. I do like Slytherins but I feel like this is used too much. Any suggestions?


** I mean in [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/harry-potter-and-the-boy-who-lived.17021/][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] He is sorted into Ravenclaw but later leaves Hogwarts altogether

** Are there any fics where everyone assumes that the edgy, Lord-of-too-many-surnames character is the right boy who lived but it turns out that the laid back, unassuming character who was sorted into Hufflepuff was the real boy who lived?

** Obligatory LinkFFN(the prince of slytherin)

Gets my vote for best fic on FF. But that's just my opinion. WBWL that does an amazing job of world building, subverting expectations, and foreshadowing a cohesive well thought out story.

Over 1 million words and I've read through it twice now. Story is ongoing and in year 4

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
