I'm looking for time loop fanfiction (with any main character). I've already read [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Getting_the_Hang_of_Thursdays][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]]. This question is mostly inspired by my finally catching up to the current point of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], an original piece of fiction that's also based on a time loop, so anything similar to that (if you happen to have already read it) would be great, but other types or genres are fine too.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

*** I don't know of a mobi link, personally. You can read it on wordpress [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][here]], and if you have a scraper of some sort you could probably make a mobi out of it.
