I just saw this on the yahoo group and thought I would share.

  Hey, everyone. Quick note to let you all know that Bob passed early this morning. Very unexpected. He was improving, mass had shrunk significantly and he was on maintenance chemo treatments.

  When I went to bed, I found him. His passing looked peaceful and I can only hope it was.

  Thank you all for being a part of our lives for so many years. You've brought us a great deal of happiness.

  ~Alyx~

** I'm really sorry to hear about Bob's passing and offer my condolences for their loss. Bob& Alyx both have made some wonderful contributions to the world of HP fanfiction and I know that the community was made better by their efforts.

Rest in peace.

** Don't know if I ever read or came across any of his stories, but all the same, it's a damn shame whenever it happens.

It obviously cannot be stated the extent to which cancer can go fuck itself.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth][The Queen who fell to earth]] is good, it was the first in their final trilogy. The final of which he obviously cannot finish, but he posted his plan so you at least get to see that.

The longest of any of their stories is [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] you need to be a site member to read it. This is one of the best stories I've read. A disclaimer of sorts, it was written just before HPB came out, so the things they write which seem like cliche's were definitely written before they became cliche's (and not every one of their stories is a Ron/Dumbledore bashing thing, they usually are pretty positive on them.) But it's still creative and amazing!

** I can't believe that. Bob was one of the first FF authors I ever read, and his story Parallels was probably /the/ story that got me so into FF in general. He helped change my life, even if he doesn't know it. Fuck that stupid fucking cancer bullshit. It took away one of the most fun and batshit crazy writers I've ever read. RIP Bob, you deserved better. But rest assured in the knowledge that as long as I live, your memory and your stories will live on.
