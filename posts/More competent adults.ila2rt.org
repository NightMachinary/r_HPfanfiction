Dumbledore tracks Slughorn down and pretty much begs him/forces him to give him the memory of Slughorn and Tom talking about Horcruxes

Maybe Dumbledore realizes that McGonagall was right and takes Harry away from the Dursley's. (Can be when he's a baby, or when Harry is older, when he makes a complaint)

Dumbledore realizes he made a mistake with the Marauders and is trying to fix it, but maybe realizes that having a ex Death Eater run among the children isn't the best call, or at least puts some restrictions or talks to him more.

Or just something. Doesn't even have to be with Dumbledore, can be any of the Professors.

Harry can still be the main character, stuff can still happen around him, but having more competant adults would be nice.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, doesn't have to be any of what I mentioned, just anything with competent adults. Can be on any site, can be any length.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like, but doesn't have to focus on pairings.


** "Harry is a Dragon and that's OK" Everyone behaves like a reasonable person, it's hillarious. To be found on ffnet and spacebattles. Currently beginning the 6th year. Mostly Canon complaint (in a British, to the letter of the law, manner). Recommend reading through SB thread for more inputs from the author.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
