So I read a fanfic a few years back that I'd like to read again. Hoping someone else here has read it as well.

Pre-HBP for sure.

Harry goes back to the Dursleys after Sirius dies. He AKs himself in the head and almost dies but is saved. Nicolas Flamel comes to Hogwarts to train Harry. Later on Dumbledore reveals that he tried to kill himself as well.

I know it's not much to go on but if anyone can think of anything I'd appreciate it.


** Friends, I believe I've found it: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ioci/HPATROTP.html]]

**** You'll love it. It was one of the first fanfics I ever read and I have searched for it but never been able to find it.

**** Ha, good question! I looked through my old bookmarks (I bookmark most of the fics I read) and combined that with increasingly-questionable Google searches... Actually though, I was glad someone mentioned that this was most likely on Schnoogle, because that helped narrow it down quite a bit!

** Oh Shit, This was one of the very first fics I read. Definitely pre-HBP. I think it was on Fiction Alley/Schnoogle back in the day. Damn. I remember that HP & Dumbledore had matching black spidery tattoos on their temples from where they both AK'd themselves. Really curious if anyone remembers this.

*** I'm interested now. Was it good quality or was it just one of those fics that sticks with you because it's one of the first ones you read?
