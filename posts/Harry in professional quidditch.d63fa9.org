Preferably no Harry/Ginny


** There was an author who in the desperation over how bad JKR's rules of Quidditch are created his/her own. E.g., there was no designated Seeker, but Chasers which acquired sufficient number of points could seek, and catching a Snitch didn't finish the game. Do you remember the author and the story?
