Hello, what is your favorite Harry Potter fan-fiction story containing sexual content? I don't mean sex stories in which the characters are accidentally called Harry and Hermione and Ginny (etc.), I look for stories with actual relevant plot.

Some very good ones:

[[http://ficwad.com/story/58132][Love Has No Age]] - I love this one, although it's unfinished and not active for a while now

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5218660/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sisters-Black][Harry Potter and the Sisters Black]] - Well, this one is more smut with story than story with smut, but it's great

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]] - Not smutty at all in the first half, but the author is really good at what he does story-wise, and sex-wise in the second half

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] - This story doesn't contain any explicit sex, as the smut is put into separate story, the main story references the side-stories in relevant places

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10084910/15/Incubus][Incubus]] - Surprisingly good story given it has kind of generic motive

Give some other goodies :)


** "Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942): It's a typical Darth Marrs fic with tons of sex and violence. Dark Lunar Harmony.

"Here and There", linkffn(7525570): It's a very well done time-turner travel with lots of sex scenes between Ginny and Hermione. It would have been great were it not for the last 4 chapters.

"In Case of Emergency", linkffn(4625848): This smut fic has a decent plot, and is almost epilogue compliant.

"Murder Most Horrid", linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort in this AU. It's a very decent crime/mystery story with tons of lemons between Bellatrix and Hermione.

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345): Not too explicit, but this fic has surprisingly large amount of sex scenes given its length.

/cough/shameless/self/promoting*

Seriously though, I ghost wrote half the smut scenes for EasySurfing before I started my own fic... I think his plot is better over all, but my smut is of the highest caliber. Be warned...character death in SFTP...and WAY too much R/Hr for the first 20 chapters or so... There are many things I wish I hadn't written... I know it has plot issues, but I am the smut master

Some of my favorite smutfics... (linkffn)Sword of Gryffindor (linkffn)Animagus Mishap (linkffn)The Harem War (linkffn Faery Heroes

...several others i can't remember with Harry/Fleur... Harry/Tonks... Harry/Gabby... Harry/Other Slytherin Girl...

*** Oh, I'm really curious about the Harry/Gabby ones. I actually did see your story before on reconnaissance for interesting stories, but never actually read it, it's still in my to read list. Will definitely check it out. Do you know anything about EasySurfing's status?

I tried Sword of Gryffindor but gave up quite quickly, I had problems with the style of humor (and I never understood the Ginny-Lily problem, Harry doesn't even remember his mum)... Faery Heroes looks really good from the description and first few lines.

***** Fairly sure you are referring to [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]]- it's only on ficwad.

Author's summary: I'm writing this for my own amusement, so it won't be very good. This story will feature plenty of OC's, OOC behaviour, well trodden Cliché-filled paths and a hideously Super Harry. There will be pointless overdone smut. There will be plotholes large enough for Jupiter. There will be bizarre theories and strange forgotten stuff. I will drop threads. This story will not contain literature. I'm not just playing in JKR's sandbox. I'm mixing in concrete and ground glass. If you like it, let me know.

Harem of The Ancient House of Potter. [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600026063&chapter=1]] There's political manuvering and evil plots, but they definitely fall second to the smut.

Harrine Potter, Mistress of the Nine [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600094578&chapter=1]] I forget why I liked this one, aside from a female Harry. It didn't get very far before the writer gave up.

The Animagus Mishap. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8673659/1/Animagus-Mishap-SLOW-UPDATES]] Human, furry and bestiality sex. I don't remember if this has plot, but it certainly has fucking. The premise is a little too dumb/fast/easy to be honest.

I'm curious to see exactly what other people come up with.
