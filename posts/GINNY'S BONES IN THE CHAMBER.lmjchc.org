I think Harry went dark in the story, I think her left her there, on a return trip he finds whats left of her down there. With enough evidence to support that she struggled to survive down there for a little while. Really gruesome stuff~

Anyone know it?

** Is that the one where he goes a bit psychotic because of the horcrux? Like he speaks to it while a child etc? And is friends/more with Luna and he eventually caused her death as well?

*** I couldn't tell you, I originally was reading it through a storm ages ago and the internet gave out in the middle of it. I was gonna wait until later but I never got around to doing it and I only just recalled it now. This is the most impactful thing I can remember from the story.

**** Hmm, I've read a couple of fics where he just ditches her in the chamber, I'm just trying to remember which it was that might be most likely! Do you remember if it was ao3 or ffn?

** Antithesis was an interesting fic, I ended up helping with the beta for a while before I ran out of time. But pretty unique in all that I've read.
