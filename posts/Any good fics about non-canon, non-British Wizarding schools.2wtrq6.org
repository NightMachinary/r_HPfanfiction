Just finished Alexandra Quick, really enjoyed it. I'm interested to read about other non-British schools that we don't hear about in canon (not quite as interested in Beauxbatons or Durmstrang fics).


** There's Brave New World by bellephron (sp?) But it didn't age well in my opinion. Its probably the longest fic in my faves (The Story by Dad is the only one that might be longer iirc) so you can find it there by sorting by length.

*** In which ways didn't it age well? I was thinking of reading it at some point?

**** Well I'm not saying that it's bad to the point that you should skip it, just that by camparison to the fics that came out in the last 7 years it's not nearly as good as it was in 2007.

** Though the first two books still center on Harry at Hogwarts, you see quite a bit of other schools in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs's]] Firebird trilogy.

** It's not fanfic in the story arc sense, but [[http://americanwizarding.tumblr.com/][American Wizarding]] on Tumblr is an imaginative series of posts about famous wizards and wizarding schools in America.
