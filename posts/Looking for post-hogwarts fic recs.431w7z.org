I'm looking for really well written post-hogwarts/post defeating voldemort fics, preferably very lengthy but long oneshots are cool too. Preferably fairly angsty and about rebuilding life after the war (either right after it happens or later on in their adult life). Also I enjoy slash. Thanks!


** Northumbrian's 83 story series is almost entirely focused on postwar developments, it's imho the most believable and canon compliant collection of postwar stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]] *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is the best among them and of novel length.

*Grow Young With Me*, linkffn(11111990), is a very well written romance fic, currently also discussed in the book club.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is not completely canon compliant, but shows what would happen if the wizengamot was stupid and sick enough to pass something like a marriage law.

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848), epilogue compliant postwar smut fic with a plot

*These Cuts I Have*, linkffn(11317075), was just completed and written by Melindaleo, who published a rumored 'fake Book 7' back in 2007. Her writing is pretty good.

*Ginny Duty*, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465]], is quite enjoyable too.

Finally *The First Day*, linkffn(4367121), is the poster fic of postwar angst/hurt/romance stories. I personally don't like it, though.
