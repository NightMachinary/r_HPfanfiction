** While I don't have any fics to offer, I'd just like to know. In fics like these, how does Harry reconcile the fact that Voldemort killed his parents and numerous innocent people?

*** A lot of authors shy away from it, because it's hella controversial. So they make it so that Voldemort either didn't kill Harry's parents or potters!bashing. Another way out is that poor Voldemort was just crazy and didn't know what he was doing. Also Harry can just not care for whatever reason(sometimes it's a good one, most of the times it isn't)

And the obvious one is time travel, where it hasn't happened yet.

*** Authors will have Harry accept his parents' death by having Voldemort repent/he was insane at the time and acting on a prophecy, shifting the blame to Snape/having Harry not care because he never knew them.

The numerous innocent people thing is easier to get around. The good side kills too is often used to argue Harry's eventual acceptance. Harry having diary!Tom as a friend beforehand and his loyalty to his friends is another argument.

linkao3(5090342) is a good example of that.

Or the author tries to write Voldemort as manipulative and explains himself in a way that seems plausible.

  Harry Potter didn't have that many friends. Each and every one of them was so rare and precious - Harry would protect them with his life. His newest friend, however, just may cost him more than he can pay.Mostly pre-slash (and a wee bit of slash) between Harry and Diary!Tom Riddle. Part of the Little Things verse but can be read alone. My take on the Harry/Diary!Tom cliche (because sometimes I get this itch to re-write all my favorite cliches the RIGHT way :))

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

** The only one I can think of where Harry unwillingly gets the Dark Mark is linkao3(419407). He's only defiant towards Voldemort though; he gets along quite nicely with Tom.

Someone already mentioned Crybid's A Dangerous Game. linkao3(13059681). Harry is forced to join Diary!Tom but not Voldemort.

ObsidianPen's No Glory is an AU just after Voldemort won the war. That's probably closest, but only one of the Light is forced to take the Dark Mark. linkao3(7502151).

  AU! In a world where Neville Longbottom was declared the Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter grew up in a happy, loving family, but all of that changed when he was twelve; the year he met Tom Riddle. TMR/HP slash. Dark!Harry.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
