** Ha. With the age demographic of reddit, I am guessing most don't even know the show Green Acres.

If this happens Arnold Ziffel is an animagi.

That said, a Harry raised by Lisa and Oliver, where he is really good at farming but also loves shopping sounds like a golden crackfic

Edit: not sure if I should say good at farming. Perhaps greatly interested in

*** Actually, Harry might be ok at farming. Oliver did manage a few decent crops here and there.
