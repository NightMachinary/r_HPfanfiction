The obvious fact, that it is muggle literature aside, would finding a copy of the fountainhead, in Voldemorts basement or a secret Deatheater bookclub, where they´re discussing her books, work as a joke? Also which combination of books and characters would be funny to you, there was one fic where Harry was raised by Deadpool and gave a copy of the communist manifesto to Hufflepuff, which caused to start a revolution. So what are your examples and opinions?


** Only if you convinced them that her real name was Annalyn Randolfus and she was a secret pureblood trying to take over the muggle world by some insidious method.

Oh, who am I kidding, most Death Eaters probably aren't even functionally literate if Crabbe and Goyle are anything to go by.

**** Well, I mean if we assume that blood has nothing to do with magical power, then you've got hundreds, perhaps /thousands/ of people who willingly believe in something that is a categorical, factual untruth.

Just think of them as murderous Flat-Earthers, maybe?

***** Considering that Rowling said that muggleborn tend to be stronger, because of all the incest happening in the pureblood nobility, it could very much be that them believing in pureblood supremacy, is because they have a family circle instead of a tree.

**** I could totally see a scenario where the upper-rungs of Death Eaters are an idea generating "party" and everyone outside that ring just kind of follow along, hoping to benefit from the ideas/actually agreeing with it to differing degrees.

Educated aristocrats relying on illiterate, easily manipulated peasants, if you will.

** I'm not sure you'd see active DE's reading it, if for no other reason than the fact that she's a Muggle.

However, I could a see a reformed Draco post-2nd-Wizarding-War, attempting to reconcile his Pureblood beliefs with the current political climate and stumbling on Objectivsm.

"No no, it's not that I'm better than all of you because of my blood, I was totally wrong about that. It's because I produce and you do not."

** It /could/ work as a joke. A deatheater such as Lucius, with his bribing and cozy relation with Fudge, would be a perfect, minus the magic, Randian villain. I fear that the joke will almost certainly go over everyone's head because almost no one has actually read any of Ayn's literature.

*** To be fair, the notion that the fountainhead and her other books are something like an asshole bible, is somewhat shared, I don´t know if it´s bigger then her following, but I´d wager it´s not that obscure.

**** It's considered an asshole Bible BECAUSE people haven't read her work. It bums the hell out of me because I don't even like her work. I have to defend Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead constantly because people substitute reading the damn texts with listening to a biased podcast or inaccurate summary. It would be like if very few people actually read Harry Potter, but instead relied on a summary written by a fundamentalist Christian.

***** Granted, it's been a while (7-8 years) since I've read AS, but I do remember it as glorifying being an asshole about producing. I can understand Objectivism's underlying tenet that producing is a moral action and agree, but the heros of the story are not the sort of people I'd want to spend time with, because they're all unrepentant dickbags about their philosophy.

I suspect part of the issue is that the story is written in absolutes. There are good people and evil people and literally no one in between. AS is an apocalypse story, so I can understand why that's the case, but when you combine that absolutism with Rand's undeniable writing skills (regardless of how you feel about her philosophy, I think it's hard to argue she wasn't a talented writer) and the age of her average first time reader (I'm assuming teens, as that's when I and most the people I know who've read it did so), it leads to people trying to emulate larger than life characters in situations totally unlike their own and that usually comes out as them being an asshole in day to day life

****** You're not entirely wrong. Just remember that many people, including the deatheaters, misinterpret her tales as glorifying /rich/ people.

** If you throw this in a fic as a throwaway joke, it would make me cringe when I read it.

If you deconstruct Ayn Rand and/or the Death Eater ethos by having a character who actually engages the material and tries to work through the inevitable issues that arise, that could be pretty boss.
