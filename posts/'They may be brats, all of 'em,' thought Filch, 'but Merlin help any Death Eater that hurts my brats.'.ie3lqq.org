***** There are tight controls on shotguns and who is allowed them, but it is possible to own one. Leaving a shot gun around certainly wouldn't be acceptable.

Most people are against hunting, however. I think some farmers sometimes have them.

It would seem out of place in a fic because it's so unusual to have one. It just seems wrong because of our culture around guns.

Also, if we assume Filtch has some sort of contact with the muggle world (certainly, he seems to know what a gun is), then it's notable that the Dunblane school massacre in 1996 which resulted in far stricter laws about shotguns was recent. People were very quick to react to that.

I also doubt Dumbledore would allow a gun in the school and there's enough portraits in that place to snitch on anything.

********* My above discovery about gun control laws came up in the context of an idea where Lily acquired a sawn-off shotgun as a back-up weapon, since she knew she can't defeat Voldemort in a duel. Thing is, since she had to acquire it illegally, she wasn't trained in how to use it properly and because of that, she failed to score a killshot on the first try and only succeeded in supremely pissing off Voldemort (due to the perceived cheek of a muggleborn trying to use a muggle weapon against him) to the point he didn't give her enough time to try again and went out of his way to make sure she died violently and painfully rather than from a simple AK.

********* You're assuming the wizard with the gun is too stupid to enchant it! Enchant the clip so that when the slide goes back to chamber a bullet a duplicate is created with gemino and that is what goes into the chamber. As the slide completes its action a bombardo spell is placed on the bullet (not the brass cartridge). The firing pin hits the the bullet and off it goes. An automatic pistol shoots about five rounds per SECOND! I highly doubt your other wizard is going to hold a shield against five bombardos per second for as long as you hold the trigger down. You could enhance the pistol with an automatic shield spell that went for a meter to either side to protect you. Cooling spell, recoil elimination spell, impervious spell, accuracy spells would make it the ultimate weapon.

** "The North tower is collapsing!"

Neville ducked below a purple spell and rolled into cover, gaining some temporary calm in the storm.

"What?" He shouted over to Terry, who was similarly lying low under some staircase.

"The North Tower is collapsing! Too many reductos! We--" he rolled away from his cover just in time to see the staircase crash into the spot he had been just moments ago. He ducked and jumped, weaving through the spells raining down from the wand of Death Eaters.

He finally collapsed near Neville, and gripped his shoulder.

"The walls are too damaged," Terry rasped from exhaustion, "the magic is failing, it may collapse any moment now."

Neville thought it through. He could see Terry bleeding all over his arms, one of his knees was bent in a horrible angle. He still clutched his wand, determination shining from his tired eyes.

"Somnium," Neville spoke, and Terry's face morphed into anger, but soon collapsed into blissful oblivion.

"Sorry," Neville waved his wand, transfiguring a broken stone wall into a cage, inside which he put Terry's bleeding body.

"Impendimenta!"

The whole cage was covered in the delayed reaction spell. It wouldn't hold for longer than a couple hours, but, well, neither could they.

Finally he looked at the smouldering, freezing, blackened corridor he had been hiding in. The Death Eaters had moved on.

Heaving a sigh of relief, he started running towards the tower.

McGonagall, the resident transfiguration expert, was off battling the inner circle. He had no idea where Flitwick was.

He had seen Sprout throwing plants through the greenhouse windows, and he had seen a death eater starting some sort of fire spell.

He gulped the bile rising in his throat. Now was not the time.

Suddenly he started skidding on the floor, smacking a wall hard. Before he could recover, he was covered in red ropes.

"Wait!" One of his attackers shouted, "he's a pureblood. Remember his orders."

The other death eater grunted.

Neville's head finally stopped ringing, and he focused on his attackers. "Let me go!"

"As if," one of them said, "you've already caused a lot of problems for us."

"It'd be besht if cha listen ta him."

All three of them turned in the direction of the sound, only to see nothing. The Peruvian Darkness powder quickly covered them up.

Neville looked around wildly. He heard some muted explosions nearby. He strained his ears, but the ringing had returned and he couldn't hear anything.

Suddenly, an arm grabbed him and held him up. A knife cut through the ropes.

"Wave your wand up and down, and say Lumina," the same voice instructed him.

The sheer absurdity of hearing Filch instruct him in spell casting did not registered in his mind till he had already cast the spell.

The smoke cleared rapidly.

Red painted the walls. And red coated Filch's cloak.

"Gerrup. This ain't no time to sleep." He spoke with conviction.

"B-but... how..."

"The crackers from the blasted twins explode just the same inside them bodies," he grinned nastily. "Now off yer go."

His cat stood beside Filch, staring at Neville, unblinking.

Finally his brain rebooted, "Thanks," he said, rapidly getting up, "I'll be... err... going then."

"Yer do tha'." Filch nodded. "Keep them to'ers frem fallin', and I'll keep ya frem dyin'."
