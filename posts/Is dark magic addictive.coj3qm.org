The effects of prolonged use and how people go from "just one dark spell in an emergency can't hurt" to throwing around dark curses left and right seem to indicate that dark magic has a somewhat addicting effect.


** From my understanding 'dark' magic is more of a moral and political function than any mechanical function of magic itself. We are never shown any clear effects of casting dark magic. Alternatively Dark magic could be emotively empowered like the patronus spell and drawing and using those negative emotions excessively could cause damage to the caster.

** I mean there's no cannon answer, it's really up to interpretation. However, the power/control that some people feel from hurting others could cause addiction even if the magic itself has no more addictive properties than any other magic. If you look at it that way, it might not be the magic itself that's addictive, but fact that most dark magic harms others causes desensitization and a power high. If that's the case, something like a cutting spell that isn't considered dark could become just as addictive to use on others as the cruciatus.

** My head canon is that it's easier. You fuel your spells with negative emotions, allowing you to bypass lots of visualisation and focused intent. No three D's are needed for the Cruciatus curse, you just have to mean it.

So it's addictive in that it's a crutch for wizards. And because it's emotional, it tends to manifest in ways useful in combat and has become associated with its violent practitioners.

Other than that I think I remember [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] explaining dark magic as a branch of magic that didn't interact much with common counter charms, making it difficult to dispel, remove or shield against.

And in a world were that tap of a wand can fix a broken arm, a lingering injury must have a more profound impact on culture.

** I always liked the idea that it's addictive in that you enjoy the feeling. Like when you use a spell that requires anger or something it sacrifices that feeling and gives a feeling of euphoria. Therefore it's harder to cast a spell multiple times in a row because you lose those feelings for a time. However, using the spell gives you more of a tolerance to it so it takes more to get that feeling but you can cast more spells.

I can't think of one canon example of this. Who are you speaking of exactly?

*** Harry goes from 'emotionally compromised, unsuccessful Cruciatus' during the Department of Mysteries (Bellatrix says he has to enjoy it to cast it successfully), to having Sectumsempra as an emergency fallback (he uses it against the Inferii and against Snape), to deliberately trying to Cruciatus Snape, to Imperiusing a Death Eater and an innocent Goblin, to deliberately and successfully Cruciatusing Amycus Carrow out of a sense of vengeance.

**** Is that really an example of an addiction to Dark magic? Or is that a protagonist appropriately graduating from kiddy Dark magic to big boy Dark magic during wartime?

Dark Magic includes all those little hexes, jinxes, and minor curses Harry loved and used in books 1-4. There are, of course, levels to all that as I mentioned above, but it still all classified as the same branch of magic.

No, it doesn't. I think I've actually had this argument with you in the past. Hexes, Jinxes, and more acceptable Curses are /related/ to Dark Magic, but aren't examples.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Harry in books 1-4 spoke of and sometimes hurt people when he was angry. That is a consistent thing.
#+end_quote

And he somehow avoided using Dark Magic, despite the fact that he knew the Cruciatus and Imperius Curses from Crouch/Moody's example in Year 4, and presumably the Killing Curse as well. In fact, he goes through several major battles without using either, including almost the entirety of the Department of Mysteries.

Honestly, it seems like the allure of Dark Magic is working on /you./ "A protagonist appropriately graduating from kiddy Dark magic to big boy Dark magic during wartime?" That sounds like something Snape would say.

Interesting because there's an interview around somewhere with JKR calling curses (she doesn't differentiate) the worst kinds of Dark magic and jinxes and hexes minor variants of it, but okay.

And Dumbledore who gave him leave to use any jinx, hex, or curse that occurred to him. The other Dumbledore, too, tbh.

******* This is true. I was researching dark magic in canon, and those are all "dark charms." There's really nothing special about them except that they cause some damage to the victim. And yeah they are labeled in accordange to how much damage/effect they have on someone. Jinxes have the least, hexes moderate, and curses the most.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Canonically, basically every child in Hogwarts uses dark magic. Jinxes, hexes, and curses are all "dark charms," and are all classified as dark magic/the Dark Arts. There's no mention in canon that dark magic has any effect on people, except for Voldemort becoming snakelike, but that seemed like it was due to Horcruxes rather than general use of magic.

** It's not canon afaik, but it sometimes works really well. And it makes sense too imo. I mean, from what Bellatrix said about Crucio, we can kinda interpret that dark magic requires negative emotions to fuel. Patronus requiring positive emotions provides another example of this being likely from the canon as well. And if they do require negative emotions, then it's not a reach to say using them would be cathartic as fuck. Channeling your hate, fear, whatever, and having them lash out at the world in a similar manner to teenagers smashing shit when they are mad, but way more destructive. It would be liberating in the moment, and then you would have to deal with the consequences of what you just did. The negative emotions you would experience in the aftermath, such as fear or self-hate, the knowledge that you can use them to lash out at the world that caused you to cast that first spell in the first place, and wanting to re-experience that small moment of catharsis instead of the shit you are dealing with now, could create a cycle where you keep using dark magic as an outlet for negativity, only for that dark magic to be the source for even more, until you get desentisized to the horrible things you are causing. Add magical mind fuckery to it, and well, you are fucked.
