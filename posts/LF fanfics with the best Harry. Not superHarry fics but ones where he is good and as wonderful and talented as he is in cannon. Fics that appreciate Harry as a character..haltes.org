** !linkffn(Harry is a dragon and that's ok)

Harry is a dragon, however that really doesn't change him much. It does, however help put him into situations where his character can shine through. It also contains the best portrayal of Dumbledore I have ever seen.

!linkffn(Harry Potter, squatter)

This starts of as a young Harry placed in New york and due to an inexplicable amount of luck, he gets to olympus, where he finds a temple, and plot happens, lots of food porn, disobedient cats, fluff, and just plain adorableness. Best crossover I've seen so far. His character matches that of an adorable, good natured kid. I just recommend it so much.

*** The crossover is a nice story, but barely has anything in common with canon, and indeed almost every reference to canon is decidedly negative. I'm still reading it, because the rest of it is great, but it would genuinely be a better story if every canon reference was removed.\\
We see Dumbledore only to bash him and make bad stuff happen to him (same with the Dursleys but it's not like anyone has ever cared about them), oh and the way the entire magical world do magic us wrong and anyone could do it, nothing special about wizards etc.

Harry is a dragon is just brilliant though.

**** Yeah, looking back on that, I have to agree with you on the bashing bit.

Still, I love the characterisation in the story.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.
