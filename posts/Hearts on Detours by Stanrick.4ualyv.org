  Dark times lie ahead, they said. Soon we will have to decide between what is easy and what is right, they said. Yeah, well. Nobody told him they were actually talking about that Yule Ball nightmare that now lies inescapably ahead with no clear answers in sight. How will he ever get out of this mess, and is there any way that doesn't involve dancing? (There isn't.)

** I'm not sure how this author normally writes, but this was quite exhausting. Its written as if he had a secret challenge going on to produce the longest sentence possible, with the most diverse use of the entirety of the biggest dictionary he could find.

Having said that, its good for fanfiction standards. I'll keep looking.
