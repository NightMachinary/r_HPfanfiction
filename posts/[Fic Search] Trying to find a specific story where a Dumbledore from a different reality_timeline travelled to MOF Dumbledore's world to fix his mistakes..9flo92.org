  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** Hmm...very fix-fic, upgrading the light side without raising corresponding challenges. There were a few interesting plot points, though, that I don't think I've seen elsewhere, like adding a new station for the Hogwarts Express to let parents visit regularly.

A somewhat interesting read, but would need some more substantial conflict to make it great.
