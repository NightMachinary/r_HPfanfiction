It turns out that having XXXXX beast rampaging through schools is awfully common. And most schools don't have an Harry Potter to safe their arses.


** Professor Sinistra found Harry Potter to be a perfectly kind and respectful young man. He got average grades in her astronomy class but he was never rude to her and was always conscious of his classmates. In fact, if she didn't know his past, he would be just another average young boy passing through her class.

But Harry Potter was not average. Sure he caused the fall of You-Know-Who but that was ten years ago and he was only one. Now he was eleven and, honestly, up until the proceedings of the past week, Professor Sinistra would've said that the boy's quidditch ability was his biggest achievement at school. But taking down a fully grown mountain troll? As an eleven year old, first year student?

Just last week, she had heard from her brother - who was currently working as the Quodpot coach at Ilvermorny while continuing his research on the magical fungis of New England - and he said that Ilvermorny had a similar issue. However, when a half-grown forest troll (very like a mountain troll but taller) had entered Ilvermorny it had taken the professors half a day to track it down and another hour to finally take it down. And, now that she is thinking about trolls, she can remember a Quibbler excerpt from a few years ago where a troll entered Durmstrang and one from farther back when one injured two students and a groundskeeper at Mahoutokoro. The author of this article, Xeno Lovegood, theorized that trolls are drawn to places of great magic because of the nargles that swarm the areas and make tasty snacks. Now, whether or not this is true, Professor Sinistra was becoming exceptionally grateful to Mr. Potter and his two friends for taking this troll down before it caused further damage. But it had to be pure luck... right?

By Mr. Potter's fifth year, Professor Sinistra was increasingly glad that he had a streak of good luck or pure skill (she didn't care which) because between the troll, a rumored baby dragon, the three headed dog, dementors, more dragons, mermaids, and a sphinx, she wasn't sure the school would have survived without him. Of course, much of this wouldn't have happened if he wasn't a target of Voldemort. But, whatever.

At least she didn't teach at Uagadou. Apparently, they were located near an erumpent breeding ground and had problems keeping them out of the school grounds.

** Astoria greengrass fixed a small shaving mirror to the bayanet lugs of her AK-74, checking the corner. Ever since her families move out of Britain and into America, things had never quite been as safe.

When a school run by Death Eaters was safer than a school that was the best in the country... Well. Maybe Dumbledore was onto something after all.

There. A sliver of movement. A twitch. There it was, something that wasn't quite what was meant to be. A shimmer. Astoria Greengrass aimed and fired, the recoil bruising her shoulder. She fired again, and again, into the shimmering mass.

The silver bullets struck true, sending a spray of gore over the stones.

Damnit. This was getting expensive. Two werewolves in as many months.

At least selling werewolves for parts was legal in America. Drawing her set of knives, she got to work.

**** It's a reference to linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow And The God Emporerless Heathens) where Dumbledore recieves a letter from the Greengrasses asking wether an ak-47 is an apropriate christmas present for a proper pureblood daughter. Excellent crack fic. I mean, I'd imagine that 5.56 is a little light for going against a werewolf. So, in which case it'd be AR-10. To be perfectly honest, a heavier calibre like the 30-06 would be better. For all we know, the Greengrasses switched from potions manufactoring to arms importation.

But the other advantage of using anything with AR in front of it, is that one can reference [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VuDjJ9KIxM][Invisible Sun]] by stealing the line "I don't want to spend the rest of my life looking at the barrel of an Armalite".

****** Yeah. My first thought was actually .300 blackout, however, I don't think it was available in the 90's apart from some specialised wildcatters. To be perfectly honest, the best option for a werewolf (following running away as fast as possible so the aurors can do their job) is probably one of the .50 calibre anti-material rifles. At that point however, the plausability of a child being able to handle such a weapon is null and void. P.S All my knowledge of firearms comes from cdda ([[/r/cataclysmdda][r/cataclysmdda]]) and shooting a knockoff chinese ak type rifle a while back.

But I bounced --- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.

** It was in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, when suspicion of him being the heir of Slytherin and petrifier of all he surveyed was at its height, when Professor Snape finally decided the time was right. He could see that the boy was being worn down and disheartened by the cold looks and snide comments that other students were throwing at him day after day, not to mention the casual hexes and curses that made his daily movements around the castle anything but relaxing. The Hufflepuffs had been so very good at unnerving and annoying Potter in this way that Professor Snape was almost tempted to give them five points for initiative and helpfulness. Almost.

Ideally he would have put his plan into action last year but he was not so foolish as to underestimate Dumbledore; the Headmaster was as wily as any Slytherin and careful around Potter, always so very careful, thus patience was required. But the Board of Governors had now removed Dumbledore from the school, and thus the path was suddenly clear. The window of opportunity was likely to be a brief one, but Snape had been ready for some time.

The next morning, Harry opened his mail to discover an application form for the Monrow Canadian school of magic, with an accompanying brochure describing the school in glowing terms. Harry read every word, becoming more interested as he did so; the undetectable compulsion charms that Snape had applied worked perfectly in lulling his suspicions and developing an overwhelming desire to know more about this school. Harry read the brochure every chance he got that day, and the more he thought about it, the more he saw himself far away from all of his troubles, living in Canada. He did not realise that his Potions master had exactly the same idea. Before the day was out, Harry knew that Canada was the place for him. How could he have /possibly/ thought that Hogwarts was where he belonged! He filled in the application form and sent it off, keenly awaiting a response.

That evening, Snape sat in his living room and poured himself a celebratory glass of firewhiskey. Potter would do very well at Monrow - for a short time, at least. Giants, trolls, Yeti, dragons, even polar bears; they were all often to be found near the school premises, and regularly even inside the school premises, with the defences being somewhat limited by design. Monrow's school motto was 'Learning through doing' and the staff saw such incursions as good practice. Dangerous of course, and the boy was a Gryffindor, so typically reckless and still mostly untrained after a year and a half of useless Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons. "I give him a month," Snape said out loud to himself, and smiled at his own reflection in the glass.

Just a little idea on this theme, hope you like!
