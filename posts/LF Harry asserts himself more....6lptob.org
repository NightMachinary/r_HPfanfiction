...and places boundries, especially on his friends (mostly Hermione, she doesn't need to know everything and she has no right to his secrets and feelings and other things he might not want or need to discuss with her!) and also on the adults (Dumbledore, Snape, Molly etc.)

Hey guys,

As you've read in the (extended) title of this thread:

I am looking for a Harry who asserts himself more often and doesn't take all the shit (bullying, bad teaching etc.) without trying to put it right and setting up some boundries.

Bonus points (stuff I like, but that's of course not a need!):

- Harry applies himself more and actually really tries his best in class (maybe he even has a teacher as a mentor or is some teacher's favourite, like Hermione is for McGonagall!)
- No divination if possible, I'd prefer it if Harry took the interesting but harder classes (arithmancy and runes!)
- Harry refuses to teach anybody who wore a Potter-Stinks badge (making exceptions if they appologize is ok) if it's a fifth year fiction or doesn't really want to speak with anybody who thought he was the heir of slytherin!
- Harry leaves Hogwarts if nothing changes (I've read a lot of "other school" fictions and I am fan of those that are well done and show new classes, magic etc.)
- Animagus Harry (I think it really strange that he never learned the skill as something to be closer to James Potter (Prongs!) and Sirius Black (Padfoot!))
- Dursleys get what's coming to them as do Dumbledore (hell, I'd be satisfied with him trying to make up for "storing" him at the Dursleys like some tool (a weapon!) without taking his mental and physical well being into account (beyond: He will survive, even if it's ten dark years!)...so either manipulative asshole Dumbledore or missguided and sorry Dumbledore!) and Snape (Harry can forgive him, but only after a time)
- Not Harry/Ginny (all other het-ships are acceptable)
- An academic rivalry (good natured, not like with damned "I am proficient with the imperius curse, but I was coerced so I got out of Azkaban" Draco Malfoy...) with Hermione (or somebody else) might be great :)
- parseltongue is used for something usefull, same for animagus form (or several...I mean if it's a soul-thing then Harry kind of has two...well, one an a bit...of those after all!)
- integrating or destroying the scar-crux without having Harry killed (it strikes me as odd that nothing was tried here! Makes Dumbledore look more like some terrorist leader who sends kids out to die!)
- Metamorphmagus Harry might be nice :)

Also: PLEASE NO SLASH (at least not for the main character...if some background characters are gay? Go for it! I just don't like it as a main plot point!)

So, the stage is your's!


** Sounds like those typical indy!Harry fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(9863146;12088294), seem to be a really good fit to your request and are yet very different from the typical indy!Harry fics:

- Harry and Hermione were both educated by Tonkses well before they entered Hogwarts. Once there, they started making friends/allies immediately. Before the end of Year 1, Harry himself made a decisive speech in Wizengamot to support of the Muggle Protection Act.
- Harry was academically slightly behind Hermione and sported a rivalry with Anthony Goldstein.
- Harry took no shit from anyone and often challenged provocateurs to honor duels.
- As the title says, Harry was an animagus.
- Dursleys were sent to 10 years in prison for child abuse.
- Dumbledore recognized his mistakes and tried to amend them, but he kept making them down the road.
- Harry/Luna, Hermione/Neville
- While Dumbledore had been trying, the scar-crux was resolved in a rather logical way.

**** Yes, that's the main problem with this otherwise great series. Year 2 is IMO the worst part, but then Year 3 is one of the best. Its sequel is in complete unknown territory though.

*** Not necessarily - why would it, I mean I myself was an assertive teenager, but I wouldn't say I was like the kind of typical independent Harry (and frankly: I didn't want to be...my parents took care of a lot of shit for me...but then again: I have parents and Harry does not!)

I'll look over your recs, thank you :)
