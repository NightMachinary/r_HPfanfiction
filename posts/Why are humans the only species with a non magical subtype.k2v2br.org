As far as the books go. I'm not sure if like cursed child or pottermore or fantastic beasts change things , but I don't think other magical creatures have non magical version. There aren't non magical goblins or dragons. Only humans have muggles and wizards. Honestly makes me wonder if all wizards are just human x magical creatures and magic is weird in genetics.


** Kneazles ?

*** Acromantulas, Flobberworms and Nundus id say are different enough from spiders, worms, and jaguars. I think it would be like saying Pheonix is the same as any other bird but magical.

Crup though is a magical dog breed so you could say that not the same and a magical variant of a non magical thing. But since it is bred and could be crossbred with another magical creature.

Wizards though are supposedly straight up human only some are magical and some aren't.

**** The differences between wizards and muggles is more or less the same as the difference between the others.

Wizards have magic, increased durability, and longer lifespans. Acromantulas are giant, talking spiders with durability. Nundus are big leopards with a magical ability and flobberworms are longer worms that eat lettuce.

** I prefer to think that most magical creatures are modified magical humans (goblins, veela) or magically merged/transfigured normal creatures. I have this notion that millennia ago, some wizards turned into dragons in an attempt to achieve the perfect battle form.

*** Yeah, I could see that happening with giants. Or maybe it was a growth potion gone wrong

** There were non-magical dragons, they went extinct along with whatever killed the dinosaurs. Same thing happened with other non-magical "fantastic" beasts, they failed to adapt to various changes without the advantage of magic. Non-magical "fantastic" beings lives among their magical brethren, because the Statue of Secrecy gave them no choice. With small enough population, most of them end up having magical descendants, since according to Rowling, the magical gene is dominant.

So how do we explain the billions of Muggles if the magical gene is supposed to be dominant? Because being magical is a disadvantage in predominantly Muggle society. You got mad at your neighbors and then they suddenly float up into the sky leaving you alone to tend the field and facing the winter. Sure, there are farming spells /now/, but during the initial appearance of magic in recently evolved H sapiens, all you got is the (often dangerous) magical outburst.

Those who survived are the one with either far more controlled emotion, not enough strength to hurt people (even if they don't actually kill anyone, they risk getting punished for attacking their neighbors or sent to the frontline), or happen to born into a magical family. Fear of Muggles attacking or enslaving them drive the magical society further away from the mundane

*** Additionally, inbreeding is known to reduce viability of offspring. It's bad enough in Muggle societies (/cough/ Alabama)... but in magical communities where the isolation went on for centuries? Sheesh.

** What if it's because humans are the /newest/ species extant? We haven't been around very long. What if we're in transition to becoming a magical species and it will only be another few thousand years before there aren't any non-magicals left?

Alternately, like homo sapiens and neanderthals, what if magicals and humans were separate species capable of interbreeding and the same thing is happening as happened to the humans and neanderthals - namely that neanderthals died out. Different origin, same end as scenario 1.

** I don't think that they are, I think there are probably muggleborn versions of every animal, it just that most of the time people don't notice. hell there is probably a ministry department about find the muggleborn animals and removing the more obviously magical ones from the muggle world.(Or at least that is my head canon).
