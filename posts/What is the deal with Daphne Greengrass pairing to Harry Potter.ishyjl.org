I am seeing many Daphne Greengrass pairing with Harry Potter. Some are good and some are bad, but seeing many stories with these pair it is boring. So, why many choose Daphne Greengrass to pair with Harry Potter?


** Some want to pair Harry with a female Slytherin that isn't "evil". When the choice is between Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass, people picked the latter because they liked her name more. Things snowballed from there (as more fics are created, it eventually inspires others to make their own fics with her, etc)

** Because people love to write OCs.

But OCs aren't very popular so they choose a canon character that is practically a blank page. All we know about her is that she is a) a pureblood, b) from a Non-Deatheater Slytherin family and c) probably wealthy because the Malfoys accepted Dracos marriage to Astoria Greengrass. But we know literally nothing about her character or her backstory. She doesn't have a single line in canon. So writing her is like writing an Slytherin-OC.

It's the same with Tracey Davis - if people don't wanna go for the pureblood variant.

I remember reading fics where Daphne is essentially the Slytherins Hermione, others where she is a very nice girl who was the only one in their house/year who would befriend Tracey and Millicent as they are half-bloods and in my own fanfiction she is a little bit like Charlie Weasley or Newt Scamander in her love for magical beasts. And that are only three examples I can think of now.

***** Mean Girl!Daphne could be a lot of fun, too. She could keep Tracy around to play mind games with her and to manipulate her. She could also be in a struggle for influence with Pansy.

Another possibility would be to have her come from a destitute family. Her goal, here, could be to bring her family back to the status it once had, or to find a place for herself in society despite having lost her status. Such a backstory could lead to very interesting stuff in Slytherin.

I mean, there are endless possibilities, and yet, most Daphnes we meet in fanfic are basically the same character.

Yes and no - in my opinion, anyway. :)

If you know what you're doing, I definitely agree. If you're a new writer and you're inexperienced in plotting, pacing, development, all that stuff, it can be really difficult to avoid them, especially if you don't have the confidence to really move away from the baseline set by stuff you've already read or interest in the techniques of writing beyond just "Hey, I wrote a story, guys!".

Yeah, but that is a general problem with fanfiction not only with Daphne or even the Harry Potter fandom.

I mean how many Dumbledore-Bashing fanfics are out there that literally have the plot: Dumbledore steals from Harry - the Weasleys (at least Molly and Ron) are on it - Harry finds out and goes to the Goblins - Harry is suddenly Lord Potter-Peverell-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-and so on - Harry becomes friends with the Slytherins - Magical Nazis aren't bad they are simply misunderstood - Harry defeats Dumbledore in some stupid move (because while Dumbledore fooled the whole wizarding world he couldn't fool the angsty teenager) - the end.

** I can think of quite a few reasons off the top of my head:

- Ginny is the canon pairing.
- Ginny, having long red hair (like Lily), implies Harry has an Oedipal complex - he's attracted to girls that look like his *mother*. Eww.
- Harry says in Deathly Hallows that he loves Hermione like a sister, so for some people that suggests no romantic attraction to her.
- From Pottermore and Rowling's social media posts, we learn who other people end up with - Neville and Hannah Abbott, for example.

The main reason though, IMO, is this: Aside from her being in Slytherin, a pureblood of the Sacred Twenty Eight, and Astoria being her younger sister, we know absolutely nothing about her. She is therefore a blank slate, a character that we can make behave and look however we want as fanfic writers. The blonde haired, blue eyed Daphne is fanon, we have no canon image of her.

** As with every other tropes in fanfics, someone wrote a story with Daphne Greengrass inside, other people read it, liked the character and decided to write a story with her inside, to the point where, despite being a blank slate (only her name appear in canon), Daphne pretty much has the same personality in 90% of the fic where she appears.

The first authors who wrote about Daphne wanted to explore the Slytherin House and the "Pureblood Culture". They needed a character that could serve as a guide for the MC (Harry) and prove him that not all the Slytherin are Junior Death Eater like Malfoy. This character also needed to be able to serve as a Love interest for the MC.

Since Canon doesn't have any character that could fit the bill (Pansy had potential but is also deeply into the "asshole Slytherin" territory), authors had to "create" the character. They could either write an OC (which don't have a very good reputation in fanfics), or use this cool name they saw in Canon, so they did the later.

** People have always gravitated to the Harry/Slytherin!girl thing. Before Daphne & Tracy were revealed (pre-OotP), the only canon Slytherin girl was Pansy, which was kind of a huge bitch. So authors turned to Blaise Zabini who at that point was a complete blank in canon (Blaise is a unisex name). The Harry/Blaise thing did gain some steam, until HBP turned Blaise into a black guy. At that point the Harry/Daphne ship was slowly gaining in popularity and all the H/Blaise fans jumped onto Daphne.

** Daphne is basically a blank slate to write off of, that's the reason that people write her and Harry is the MC so that's the obvious pairing, the pairing is read because she's usually depicted as very beautiful and she also has the "forbidden fruit" aspect which is her being in Slytherin..

** Because her whole appeal is that you get to write a good upper class character with all the fancy pureblood culture fanon has come up with. Some people are interested in inventing a good Slytherin so that they can say "not all Slytherins are evil". Some love the cliché "bitchy girl gets molten by good guy", hence the ice queen trope. Daphne is the go for those stories since Pansy and Milicent are depicted negatively in canon (not that this has stopped Snape and Malfoy fans, but for some reason it does for the Slytherin girls) and the other unnamed Slytherin is Tracy Davis, whom fanon has established as half blood, so she isn't suitable for all the "upper class" stuff.

Not my cup of tea, but well basically Harry/Daphne is Harry/fanon FemDraco (as in completely whitewashed and just rich and fancy).

I don't get what you mean by "whitewashed" though. Daphne, Draco, and Harry are white in canon, so their being white in fanfictions is not them being whitewashed.

That has nothing to do with race at all. To quote the Cambridge Dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  to make something bad seem acceptable by hiding the truth
#+end_quote

Which, in the case of Draco, means glossing over the fact that his attack on Katie alone would be enough to make sure he'd never see the outside of a cell, nevermind everything else he did in book 6. So his bad actions are ignored or badly excused to get them out of the way and pretend that they never happened and he truly was "just misunderstood" and the number 2 criminal based on what we see in the books (only surpassed by Voldemort).

Honestly, I don't get America's fetish with making everything about race using definitions which used to be exclusive to right-wing Nazi wannabes here (in school were were taught that the mere concept of race is nowadays only used by those idiots).

** I think the reason is that her character allows the author to approach the politics of the Wizarding world from a more neutral point of view. The main female charectors have very entrenched political beliefs changing which changes the whole charector. Greengrass being a pureblood slytherin who is not a death eater allows for a more fluid political perspective and gives more freedom to the author. It also adds intrigue and mystery to the story as otherwise fics can get boring as everyone knows Harry is going to win in the end.
