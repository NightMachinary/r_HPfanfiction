1. Something goes terribly wrong in the Horcrux Hunt, and so on a whim, Harry says Voldemort's name to get him to come to them and save them. Would probably end as a Harry/Tom, Harry/Bella or Hermione/Bella fic. Not entirely sure what would be so awful that they would prefer Voldemort to it, or something that Voldemort would find so appalling that he would feel sympathy for the teens, but ehh, details.

Decided to post one of my 254 story ideas from my phone's notepad, because it's one I don't think I'll ever write, but I haven't seen done yet. If anyone is interested in using it, feel free, just make sure I get a link. =)
