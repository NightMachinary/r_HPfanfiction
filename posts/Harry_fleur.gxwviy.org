Looking for good long harry/fleur romance. Dont mind a little smut but preferably it be in addition to the plot not porn without plot. Cliches are fine veela bond life debts the whole 9 yards. It's just so hard to find some without them meeting falling in love and marrying within like 2 days.

** Not sure how much you've read already, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c97t8l/harryfleur_all_of_it/][this thread]] is a great starting point, although admittedly a year old now. If you have not read them, I especially recommend linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and linkffn(letters). In terms of incomplete fics, I really liked linkffn(his angel) and linkffn(ingenio ab artifex), but both are abandoned, so read at your own risk

**** I'm with you on the end being a bit confusing because of that, but for the most part I like the rest of the fic enough not to mind. But if those two are the only ones of these 4 you've tried to read, then I would 1000% recommend Cadmean Victory. It's the standard by which Harry / Fleur is generally measured on here.

***** Best harry/fleur I've ever read was linkffn(in spite of obstinate men) and its sequel(in spite of appearances) by quartermass. But he hasn't updated the sequel in almost 2 years even though hes still active so hopefully he finishes it soon.

Dumbledore and Amelia Bones send for Mr H Delacour, former French Auror and consulting detective. Meeting Harry Potter by chance on the Knight Bus, Delacour, his wife, and his daughters are soon entangled with the story of the Boy Who Lived, and the truth about Sirius...

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** One problem is it isn't often I find a long story that is a simple Harry/Fleur (though it does happen). Most have her in a trio.

Howwver the story Heart and Soul by Sillimaure is pretty much what you are looking for as it is a slow burn though it does turn into a Harry/Fleur/Hermione.

linkffn(5681042)

Fleur's Surprise by Harry50 is another Harry/Fleur/Hermione story that you might like.

linkffn(9137342)

One of the few Harry/Fleur stories I know of is Harry Potter and the Silver Vixen by patton44. It is a WBWL story.

linkao3(18279665)

And His Angel by durararaaa has Harry meeting Fleur at the world cup and taking things from there. The author did complete it/discontinued it as they planned to rewrite it.
