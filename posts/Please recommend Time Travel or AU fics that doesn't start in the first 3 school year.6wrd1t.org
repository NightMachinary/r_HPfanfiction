As the title says, Can you guys recommend good time travel or au fics that doesn't set in the first 3 years? 6th and 7th year are preferable. Post Hogwart is okay too. Thanks

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

It's a 4th year AU, really interesting to read, and pretty well written (if you excuse the bad- i.e. lack of- editing). Fun read, complete at a 103 chapters and even has an official alternate ending.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
