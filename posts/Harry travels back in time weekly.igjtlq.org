:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while ago where Harry finds this thing (I think at grimmauld place???) which lets him stop time or go back in time or something like that, and he puts it in his trunk and uses it to gain a week of “training time” every week and spar with his future self and stuff. Sorry if this isn't enough to go on.


** Sounds like linkffn(1657629).

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** Sounds somewhat like White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais, but the pairing is Harry/Pansy.
