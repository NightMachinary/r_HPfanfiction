I remember Snape's line "Lily's eyes where never that cold" In cadmean victory


** "Was he really?" said Harry. "I know he did a lot of scary stuff, but he literally lost a fight to a baby. Can you imagine? Ask historians fifty years from now about Voldemort, and they'll say, 'Yes, British chap, very mean, lost to a baby.' Or future Dark Lords, they're studying the history of Dark Lords, looking for examples of what not to do. 'Hagis the Horrible, don't use fiendfyre in an enclosed space, well obviously. Gellert Grindlewald, don't fight Albus Dumbledore one on one, sound advice. Lord Voldemort, don't lose a fight to a baby, wait, what?' I mean seriously. I wouldn't lose to a baby. One kick and it's over."

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

  "Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Severus Snape demanded.

  I said, "The Draught of Living Death."

  Severus sneered. "The Draught of Living Death, sir. Ten points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor."

  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

Man, I don't know what it is about that line, but I think that for a brief moment it allowed us to see Voldemort as a human being instead of the deranged psychopath that everyone pictures him to be.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Major AU! SLASH LV/HP: Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned.

"But, but..." Confusion consumed her face as she stared at him, her mouth hanging open. "I... everything... You.. fighting and..."

"I fight, I kill. I do not back down. I do not run. I claw my way through everything in my path. I kill. I steal. I lie. I destroy and ruin," he stated as he stepped towards her, his words soft, dark and sharp, "because I've seen what happens when no one stands up to those that want to do those things. Because I've watched families driven to ruin, entire societies driven into despair and crushed by fear by those that want to fight, want to kill want to see people suffer."

He looked at her hard in the eye. "When I see you, Ms. Black, what I see is a young women who seems to want to become the kind of thing that I hunt. I can see the hunger to fight, to battle, to kill, in your eyes. And when you look at me, I can feel the kind of monster you think I am."

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

The dark arts never worked for me. They require too much hate.” Moody snorted, “Aye. Which makes you that much scarier.” “Me, scary?” Harry asked, looking almost surprised. “Who would find me scary?” For a moment, Moody looked over at the dead bodies and then just looked back at Harry with a flat look. “I'm sure if you ask them, they won't tell you they find me scary.” Harry insisted. -Wind Shear

She narrowed her eyes at him. Sweet, little, muggle-raised, Hufflepuff her arse. But she wouldn't push, not here, not now. Harry Potter wasn't escaping her, he was hers whether he knew it or not, whether he accepted it or not. She had time to strip him of his secrets. -The Second Time Around

"You so weren't muggle raised," she muttered as she pointed her wand at the jar. He cocked a smile at her, "Sure, I was. My bedroom was the cupboard under the stairs. My old best friend used to be terrified of spiders, but I had to sleep with them, as long as I didn't try to squish them, they didn't bite me. Not even in my sleep." -The Second Time Around

"Um," he answered smoothly. -The Second Time Around

“Harry, I graduate at the end of the year. My parents will have me engaged before then."

He stared back up at her where she sat on the floor, "Are you... are you proposing to me?"

Ted didn't laugh as he had expected.

-The Second Time Around

"Do you just not know how to die?"

Hell, part of the reason he supported Dumbledore was because of how effectively he made Potter suffer. You had to admire someone who caused that much pain and misery by "accident". You had to wonder how much torment he'd visit on someone if he really worked at it. ~Snape saying something, not sure what fic

". . . you know, sometimes I wonder about you, Harry." "Sometimes I wonder about me too, Hermione."

Harry laughed. “When he and Hermione went on their honeymoon, they left an instruction booklet with a friend of ours called ‘The Care and Feeding of Harry' -- the introduction was written by my wife, well, girlfriend at the time, but it was Quidditch season and-”

Harry trailed off as Maria smiled sheepishly and opened her top desk drawer, pulling out a familiar dog-eared booklet. She held it up so that Harry could see the red ink on the cover that said, ‘Revised Auror-Edition 2013.'

“I'm a grown man!” Harry exclaimed.

Maria laughed gently, “Oh, Harry, there are worse things than being loved.” ~a Supernatural crossover series

“Ask Malfoy if you need anything, Charlie. He'll be happy to get it for you.” Granger leveled Draco with a look that seemed to suggest that if he wasn't happy, she'd end him.

“I don't know where you've gotten the idea that I'm not polite to guests,” Draco replied. Then he realized that Hermione was tortured in his house when she only seventeen, and decided that he should never speak again.

The audacity, she thought to herself as he took a seat on the couch and beckoned for her to sit beside him. Trying to seduce her... Well, the joke was on him because he was about three months too late. She'd already been seduced, thank you very much. -Grow Young With Me
