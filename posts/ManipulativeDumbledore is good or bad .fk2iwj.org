I just get confused after read a fic about bashing Albus and a detail hit me in the face. The Weasley family had 7 children right ? That mean they had gone thought the progress of sending 5/7 to Hogwarts already then why do they have to gone the station by pushing the luggage trolley the old fashion way on the muggle side of the station and yelling the station name instead of just apparating or used the floo? And to my horror I agree with the author of the fic about their theory and many more of their theory about the way Harry view when the manipulation are laying bare(but their theory fascinated me to the point i bacame confuse from the fic to the real story of JKR tbh). So what do you guys think? Any one can knock some sense into me ?


** Apparation makes a bunch of plot holes. That's not new. Maybe the platform is protected against apparation or something. Or maybe it's hard to apparate with all the luggage and children they have to deal with.

I don't remember hearing mention of any fireplaces on the platform, so it wouldn't make sense for there to be Floos, plus Arthur really likes muggles and it wouldn't be weird for him to push opportunities for his family to rub shoulders with them.

Honestly, I think that a lot of manipulative Dumbledore theories only work if Dumbledore is the greatest psychic to ever live, and this is one of them. How would he know to time it perfectly so that the Weasleys met Harry Potter without being blatant about telling the Weasleys to leave at a certain time? And how would he know that Harry would get along with any of them, considering he hadn't ever talked to the kid and had no idea what temperament he had? And what purpose would it serve to have the Weasleys be the ones to tell Harry how to get through the pillar? It all seems unnecessarily complicated and it makes no sense for Dumbledore to even be able to do that.

*** Another theory that for Harry to relied to the Weasley 'cause they are the first wizarding family he ever met and became attatch to them. And i wonder that if the platform have antiapparation and no fireplace then how the wirading peoples gone by then ? Ohmy my brain are protest against the heavy thinking, honestly I'm not used to heavy thinking and this is making me dizzy

**** I'm not sure if I really understand your comment. For the sake of communication, I think what you said can be paraphrased as "Dumbledore wanted Harry to rely on the Weasleys and that's why he would 'send' them to the platform, and how would the wizarding people get to the platform if there were no magical means to get there?"

For the first point, there would be much easier foolproof ways for Dumbledore to get Harry in with the Weasleys if he really wanted to control Harry's friendships. He could have just sent Harry to live with the Weasleys for those last two weeks of his summer just before Hogwarts so he'd glom onto them. There's no guarantee that he'd make friends with whoever shows him how to get through the pillar.

And why couldn't the wizarding families just use the pillar? Maybe there are multiple little nooks like the pillar to get through to the platform to accommodate the crowds, but it's not like purebloods are allergic to muggles. They can pass through a muggle space, even if they look weird, to get to a magical one.

** The Molly scene being used as "evidence" always gets me because it was a mom playing dumb for her kids. This happens in normal healthy families.

Dumbledore is an excellent plot device, and a horrible character. In order for Harry to be a protagonist, either Dumbledore has to be frying bigger fish, incompetent, or evil. Since we don't often see the bigger fish he's frying, it leaves us with less palatable answers.

** Apparition is a deeply unpleasant sensation if you're not used to it, it is implied that a pretty solid chunk of the wizarding population prefer to avoid it. The Weasleys own a car, it makes sense that they might not want to make, say, a bunch of pre-teens and early teens apparate with them.

It's just plot convenience. Mrs Weasley asks about the platform in order to make Ginny feel involved.

***** There's a far better explanation that fits the rest of the books and doesn't involve ridiculously long drives.

They used the floo to Diagon Alley and walked the rest of the way. In the second book all children were obviously used to it.

** Okay.

1. The Floo and Apparition had not been ‘invented' in book one, at least if I remember correctly. This is made more evident later on when Dumbledore had to travel to the Ministry rather than just stepping out of the fireplace or leaving the school to Apparate.

2. The shouting about Muggles was nothing more than a way for the author to introduce characters to the main character without being overly suspicious. Another point I see argued is that Molly Weasley was being loud and repeating information due to having so many children. I mean, my own mother frequently did this when it was just me with her.

3. Dumbledore is hardly manipulative and wanted Harry to die. In canon, he was heartbroken when he realised that Harry needed to die and was thrilled when he realised what Voldemort had done (taken blood). People are cherry-picking lines from paragraphs. In this case, “You raised him like a pig for slaughter” which is hardly the case. Harry was always in conflict as it would be a boring book if all we read was him doing schoolwork.

Canon Dumbledore is not a manipulative villain that wanted Harry to die and to take the credit for defeating Voldemort. He lied, omitted information, and made mistakes. He is a human character. Remember, the people making Dumbledore the villain are also making Voldemort, the man who created Horcruxes, killed many people, and attempted to murder a baby the good guy. I mean, let us not forget he also caused two wars.

** Well, Manipulative!Dumbledore is pretty much canon though, isn't he? It's up to debate just to what extent his schemes go, and how Machiavellian is he. But even for a fan of the guy, like me, it's hard to read the series and not think that Albus has some backstage plans running. The kicker is that a lot of fanfic writers either lack the ability or the desire of writing such a complex... (anti-hero? villain? tragic hero? what even is he?) character, so they run him into the ground and turn him into some kind of maniac whose sole purpose in life is to (hopefully just) metaphorically fuck Harry Potter.

​

And as a general remark, I find it very hard to believe there is no Magical way to reach 9 and 3/4 platform. Weasleys gallivanting through the Muggle side would make sense if Arthur was with them, but since he is not, it is... quite hard to think of it as mere coincidence.
