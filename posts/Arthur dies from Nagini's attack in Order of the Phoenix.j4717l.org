I've seen this idea mentioned a couple times, but has anyone seen any fics that explore the potential aftermath? I'm also just interested in hearing any ideas

I imagine there's a lot of different implications, that I think Sirius' death had less of. How would the Weasley family handle things, what happens to Ron and Harry's friendship, do they get more serious, how do Order members feel about risks, etc.


** Harry blames himself a lot more, Molly is even more protective of the family she has left.

Maybe it shakes Percy out of his idiocy early?

** Well, she-who-must-not-be-named did say that she killed Remus because Arthur lived, so one change would have been that Teddy got to grow up with his dad. Not sure if she still would have killed off Tonks or not.

*** Remus would have been a HORRIBLE dad. Even if he pulled his shit together he would likely have ended giving up Teddy to Andromeda and/or Harry whenever one of his depressive periods happened. Not to mention every full moon.

He would be scared that being associated with Teddy would limit Teddy far more than it ever should.

**** I disagree. When he arrived at Shell Cottage to announce Teddy's birth, he was literally the happiest we've ever seen him at any point in the series. True, we don't know how he would have handled being a father since he never actually got a chance to be one, but we have no reason to think he would have been a horrible dad.

And before you mention the fact that he ran out on Tonks, yes, I'm not ignoring that. But he was distraught and panicked because he thought he had doomed his son to live a cursed life, and let's be honest, who among us hasn't done something stupid and irresponsible in a moment of emotional distress? The important thing to remember is that after he got his head back on straight, he went back to his wife and didn't leave her side again.

***** It wasn't as much that single instance as the signs of depression the man exhibited throughout the books. I am not saying he was a bad man but he did have chronic depression (Which is understandable with his condition).

I think he would end up in a funk which would be non-conductive to be being a father. He would inadvertently neglect Teddy because of the depressions. Not as much a fault of his own but the fact that he wouldn't have the mental clarity to take care of Teddy properly.

I could see him becoming a bigger part of Teddy's life when Teddy is older but I honestly believe Remus would at best become an estranged father while Harry would become the main father figure in Teddy's life. Especially if Tonks died during the battle.

Also I don't think Andromeda and Remus got along at all. Either Andromeda wouldn't be as hands on as the grandmother or she and Remus would fight at times. Teddy would pick up on this.

I agree he was the happiest when Teddy was born but that is not enough when you have to raise a child. Also Remus would financially have a hard time raising Teddy.

Harry would try to help with that but Remus is too proud of a person. He might change for the sake of Teddy but he might not. I don't know. Tonks was what made Remus better without her... I just don't see it.

Though I can agree that "horrible" might be too loaded.
