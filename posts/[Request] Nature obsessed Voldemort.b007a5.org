** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama) had a pretty heavy focus on Magic and her connection to nature. It was also an all around great story too.

It doesn't do exactly as you said, but it isn't difficult to see it as such. I walked away from the story seeing him as a fairly decent person by fictional standards.
