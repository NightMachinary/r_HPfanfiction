So, basically the WT are bored at dinner, Umbridge says something about the ministry, so they decide to have some fun and start acting out Robb's coronation ceremony (if someone didn't see this I strongly recommend to watch on YouTube, it's awesome), thing is, some muggleborns actually recognized it and decide to play along, also swearing fealty to Harry.

Then, the ones who hadn't read/watched the scene, including some muggle-raised half-bloods actually think they are serious and decide to jump in the boat, also swearing loyalty to him, thinking it's something about the culture of the wizarding world that they just hadn't seen before and don't wanting to seem uncouth/ignorant for not knowing of it beforehand.

Then, the purebloods and wizard-raised half-bloods of the light-side, against the ministry, Harry's fans and some neutrals seeing so many swearing loyalty to Harry figure that he is taking the fight to Voldemort and the ministry and this is the moment where he divides those in his side and those against, so they get on their knees and swear fealty too.

Then most of the dark-sided half-bloods and purebloods see where the wind is blowing with the now overwhelming majority of the school unified and most decide to go for self-preservation and decide to side with him too.

Most of the others just fall in line now that practically everyone is swearing fealty to him. And then even some professors, like Trewlaney and Hagrid, maybe even Flich (maybe even making some of the more serious professors having a bad day with Umbridge and throwing their lots with Harry without thinking just to spite her) thus giving even more credibility to the movement.

Harry is understandable baffled, but ends up accepting the oaths, either by some spell from the WT, having watched the show/read the book and playing along, or even an accident. And so he is declared Harry of house Potter, First of his name, King of the English, Scottish and the Irish, Lord of the Three Kingdoms and Protector of the Empire.

With this even the ones who tough it was a prank at the beginning now think it was a real-life coronation and are so embarrassed over it that they just decide to go along and act like they knew it was a coronation from the start. The only ones that know it wasn't are the WT, but they think it is so funny/are so embarrassed by how their prank snowballed that they keep their silence.

Most professors try to put an end to it, but Dumbledore thinks the whole thing is hilarious and act like it is some ancient form of deciding a king or any other BS he can think about (unknowingly giving them even more legitimacy).

The students write home and their parents either think it's something that actually exists, but they didn't know about or are just too annoyed at the ministry to care and so they decide just act like it was a perfectly normal thing to be done and fall in line (Dumbledore said it was valid, so it probably is and they just didn't have the knowledge to know of it beforehand, but they aren't willing to admit their own ignorance so act like it is a perfectly fine thing to happen and pledge loyalty to Harry too)

After this the parents get some of their colleagues/friends and their families to also pledge for Harry. At this point too many people already claimed to have known it beforehand, so even if Dumbledore went and said he was only kidding no one would accept it because if it isn't true then they lied.

And so we have a Harry as the (exasperated and annoyed) king of a magic nation in war with the ministry (he, allegedly, just rebelled against the state to creat his own in front of a high level ministry official, at this point war would be petty much unavoidable) and Voldemort (self-explicating). And all of this because of a prank that went ridiculous FUBAR... Yep, Fred and George are so going to the Stocks for this.


** Well, they may have read it, because that scene is from the first book that was published in 1996, the HBO Series came much later.

I do find the concept funny, and it would completely trigger Umbridge into a massive tantrum. Voldemort would probably have his supporters crown him to, just to now be left behind.

*** Oof... I remembered Game of Thrones and googled the book series. First book came out August 1, 1996. Just in time for sixth year.

And now I'm depressed, it's been nine years since the last book. I haven't read the series or watched the show due to a warning about the... sporadic release schedule.

**** We could just move up the timeline by a year. Easily done without really changing anything important. Just make it so that everyone was born a year later than canon. Or just handwave the entire thing and be done with it.

**** Hmmm, we could pretend Martin was a wizard and published his books in the wizarding world first so they would be available 5th year. Maybe no one wanted to read about a war of that magnitude so soon after the first war. And maybe he was a Muggleborn so pure blood supremacists won't read it. Now all the Muggleborns think it was a history book from somewhere they never 'knew' existed.

*** Yes, this is the one. Now imagine it in the great Hall during dinner with they deciding that Harry is a better option than either the ministry or Voldemort... Right in front of Umbridge (aka the ministry number one fan and someone with a grave case of denial against Voldemort's being back to life).

Hopefully Harry and Ginny (or whoever) don't end up having a Red Wedding /(Rains of Azkaban/ starts playing).
