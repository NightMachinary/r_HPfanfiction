I had to think of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizard_in_the_Leaky_Cauldron][this guy]] today and thought of his backstory.

Now I know that he isn't canon and that he is only seen once in the movies, but still he seems like a riddle to me.

So I decided to write a small fanfiction about him. It's only one page long now so it's open for expansion if anyone wants me to continue writing. Please note that English isn't my mother tongue, so it's possible that there are spelling and grammar mistakes.

Read it here (google docs): [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8sTUd6CnOj-WTBZS2dQaU1LSDg/edit?usp=sharing]]

Please leave a message if the story doesn't show up and I'll fix it.

hope you enjoy it :)


** You write the first-person point of view well. I'm very bad at it myself so I have to point it out.

There are a few mistakes here and there (the most notable is that a woman with magic is a witch, not a wizard) and plot holes (a muggle can't find Voldemort's hideout and enter it just like that... He's a muggle! Likewise, a muggle researching magic? Wat?)

And then there are problems with your english and your phrasing is sometimes a bit awkward.

But all in all, you managed to give us his whole life story in just under a page, and his kind of magic would be interesting and dangerous.

*** I agree about muggle-repelling charms. However, someone /can/ study magic even if he doesn't wield it himself---like any other subject. And especially if his spouse is a witch.

** I like the idea of him being developed into a full OC because of how exploitable and promising his “blank template” from the original scene is.

However, the story itself felt kinda empty to me. The unexpectedness of wandless magic used as a trump card is a rather frequent guesting theme in many stories, and it is often used in pair with surprising/impressing the authoritative figures too.

It's the same with the characters trying to combine magical and muggle developments. Even more so in case of this character---that particular implication was there in the original scene itself, which makes your exposition into a reiteration of the same thing.

Making him a descendant of Albert Einstein would've been good if you intended to continue using this character for explaining to the general public what the concepts behind Einstein's works really mean. Otherwise, it looks [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Atheist_professor_myth][like that joke about a university professor and a student]] (/“And his name? Bernhard Einstein, grandson of Albert Einstein.”/).

All this said, please don't take this as a discouragement against writing more and improving your skills and the story. I'd actually like to have either a writing prompt thing here once in a while or a stickied thread were people would share their stories to hear what others think about them.
