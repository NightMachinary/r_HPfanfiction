*** I just want to say - as someone who's put a fair bit of time and effort into writing, I'm a realist about the fact that once I put it in WbA or anywhere else on the internet, it's out of my hands where it goes, to a degree.

That being said, the sheer blithe disregard you show here for any kind of consideration for the people who actually write the words makes my skin crawl.
