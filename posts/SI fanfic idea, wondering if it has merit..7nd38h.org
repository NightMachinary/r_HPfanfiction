** I like the idea. Something new. I've noticed there is a lot of SI threads around lately. Looks like a lot of us have the same New Years Resolution to make a SI fanfic.

*** I think Full-Paragon may be partially responsible for that, since his recent linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal And Other Morals) proved (against his own intentions) that a good SI story was possible.

(If you don't know, the short version is I complimented Paragon by noting he "couldn't write anything bad if he wanted to", so he wanted to do something bad on purpose to spite me; since he hates Self-Inserts, he wrote his own SI story and posted the three chapters thereof... only to immediately prove me right because everyone liked it and now it's become his main fic.)

**** I still blame you for that you know. And not everyone likes it, so there.

No, I haven't already written 200k words for that story. Stop looking at me like that.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks.

** I like option 1, but as [[/u/Hellstrike]] mentioned, WWII takes precedence. Of course, what he forgot was that Grindlewald was involved in WWII, as basically wizard Hitler (not to be confused with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7t8fales4w&feature=youtu.be&t=52s][/lizard/ Hitler]]), so there's that small complication to ending the war. Still, given the time period, it's possible, if slightly unreasonable, that your SI change the tide of the war.

** Wait, you have a self-insert from 2018 and he is only interested in the Dumbledore/Voldemort conflict?

Are you aware of a thing called "World War Two" that is going to happen around that time? And that a person with magic could prevent that conflict? Assassinating Hitler (Imperius curse on one of his guards for example) and preventing 70 Million Deaths takes precedence over a power struggle of a small British society. Also, there's Grindelwald to consider because his reign also falls into that time period.

Maybe it's because I am used to ASOIAF SI-stories but an SI in the 1930s not dealing with the largest military conflict in human history seems like a wasted time. And all the knowledge said person would have on modern technology is be another point to consider.

Also, the best way to deal with Voldemort is to simply kill him in Hogwarts. I know about the ethical issue of time travel and killing people for things which they have yet to do but it comes down to gambling with thousands of lives because there is no guarantee that the time traveller would be able to be a positive influence without drastic measures.

** I definitely thing a SI with only limited book/movie knowledge is a good way to avoid the Peggy Sue fix-it tendency (and avoid horcrux hunting rehash). For that matter, avoiding starting Hogwarts in 1991 (or altogether) is a good way to be different.

** I don't like it. Mostly 'cause I would just kill Tom riddle in his first year and THEN see if I can influence the world
