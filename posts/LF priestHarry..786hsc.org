Just finished TeamFourStar's Hellsing abridged videos and now I'm fired up for badass priest Harry. It doesn't have to be Hellsing crossover. Harry being a badass priest is the thing I'm looking for.


** I would think the vast majority of fanfic writers aren't Catholic, so can't give any insight as to how a priest works in the real world without bashing, let alone the changes that would come as a result.

A few months ago, I created a thread in [[/r/Catholicism][r/Catholicism]] asking about what changes would need to be made to the Church if magic turned out to be real. The most popular response said that the Church would update its list of banned things to study to include magic (to go along with Tarot cards and the like). However, my opinion as a HP fan who's also a Catholic is that the HP magic is morally neutral as opposed to morally evil because spells are consistent and repeatable a long as you cast it correctly. I can see the usage of some spells as mortal sins other than the Unforgivables (i.e. Engorgio on a man's penis or a woman's breasts, the use of contraceptive potions or Polyjuice, Felix Felicis would also come under question as would other potions or spells that can have permanent consequences)

In short, I don't think one exists, but I'd love to be proven wrong.

*** I was looking for using the religion as a background for the characters like they did it in the THS hellsing without getting too into the Christianity's inner workings.

Church in a HP world probably wouldn't dare to mess with wizards when a random moderately powerful wizard who got angry at them could literally teleport to the pope's bedroom and assassinate him. At most they would try to influence them to be more morally good but the wizard culture had the use of contraceptive potions and spells, felix felicis, spells that could be used to enhance their sex lives for hundreds of years. If the church tried to enforced it they would call them prudish and laugh at their faces.

Wizards, when you consider some of the church's rules are very liberals.

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What will a God do now it has lived life from the perspective of a human, will this lead to good things or bad?
