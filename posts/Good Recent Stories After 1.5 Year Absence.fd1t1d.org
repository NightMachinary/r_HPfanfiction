Been a long time since I've actually read (much less written :< ) any HP fanfic. I typically prefer HHr stories, and if not that Gen stories, so anything interesting I missed in the last year and a half?


** I've compiled two lists for HHr stories (no bashing). Maybe you'll find something for you in there.

For multi chapters click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]]. For one shots/short stories click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EkWs8qXJPU_if2D2Cn9yRnCAjqUsf5p-lE_Y_GXUIc/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]].

** Linkffn( A New Better Life by Ulltima101) this is my own story and it's still in its infancy at under 20K words. It may hit your interests.
