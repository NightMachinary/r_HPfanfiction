I am looking for fic recommendations in which Harry takes up Dueling seriously and becomes a badass at it. No super!Harry though. I mean I am okay with a powered-up Harry as long as the plot is somewhat realistic and he doesn't gain superpowers overnight. Thanks for looking.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** linkffn(8545947)

OnTheImportanceOfLungs does...interesting things with magic. Dueling one of them. It sorta takes heavily from the Fate series (I say series but IIRC only stay night had been released at that point) and from anime like Scrapped Princess (though he never referenced Scrapped Princess specifically). Oh. And Harry has the Sharingan from Naruto.

I enjoy it quite a lot though.

I suggest Fractal here but it's a rewrite (overhaul) of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope.

So if you liked it, I recommend reading the original. Fractal is tighter and has a nice pace to it. Wizard can get a bit...away from OnTheImportanceOfLungs sometimes but I prefer it.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.
