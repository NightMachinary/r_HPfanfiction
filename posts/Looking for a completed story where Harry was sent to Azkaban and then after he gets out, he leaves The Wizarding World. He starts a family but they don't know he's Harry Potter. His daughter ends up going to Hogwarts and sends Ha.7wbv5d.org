But let's not kid ourselves and pretend like the Harry Potter from canon is even in the same galaxy as Voldemort in terms of capability. Not to mention the Harry Potter from canon would would have to be so OOC to suddenly decide to become a Dark Lord that he may as well be Draco Malfoy's illegitimate son. Stories that do it well don't pretend to be canon compliant, or don't pretend that he's as cruel as Voldemort.

  So you are okay with disarming spell killing the gateway dark lord of ask [sic] time
#+end_quote

The disarming spell didn't kill Voldemort. The Elder Wand refused to be used to kill its Master (Harry Potter) and, thus, the spell was rebound upon Voldemort for a second time. Harry Potter could have used literally any spell and it would have had the same effect.

#+begin_quote
  /“Avada Kedavra!”/

  /“Expelliarmus!”/

  The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air *toward the master it would not kill*, who had come to take full possession of it at last.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  won't accept that a wizard who could kill with such an harmless spell can be dangerous
#+end_quote

Harry Potter didn't kill a single person during the entire war, but, okay. Let's roll with the assumption that you can actually consider Harry Potter a murderer, despite literally warning Voldemort that he would die if he fired a spell at him and, even at the end, attempted to get Voldemort to "try for remorse".

#+begin_quote
  “It's your one last chance,” said Harry, “it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”
#+end_quote

How is this at all relevant to my response to you? I didn't say Harry Potter wasn't powerful - just not nearly as powerful as Voldemort. Certainly not powerful enough to topple an entire government single-handedly. You could argue that he could amass a following which would assist him, but there's a few problems with this.

1. It's against his character, as I already stated.
2. Any followers he could potentially get because of his personality would instantly have to be disregarded, because you're turning his personality on a complete 180.

******* While some parts are open to interpretation, the idea that several people in that fight died by Harry's own wand is entirely fanon.

Here is an excerpt from The Seven Potters of every time Harry cast a spell.

#+begin_quote
  Wriggling around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, “/Wingardium Leviosa/!”
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, “/Impedimenta/!”

  The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him
#+end_quote

(This one can be interpreted in a few ways, but the Impedimenta Jinx is just supposed to stop or slow people down - presumably once it wore off he could just continue on like normal, considering it's never described that his broom took off from under him.)

.

#+begin_quote
  Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “/Confringo/!”

  He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
#+end_quote

(Again, this one could be interpreted differently - The guy's companion falling back, in my mind, at least, is a clear indication that he was being saved. Of course, you could attempt to say that he failed, but that's never described in the books.)

.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike --- Stan ---

  “/Expelliarmus/!” Harry yelled.
#+end_quote

(Unfortunately the effects of the Stunning Spell are never described other than "barely holding them off" - however, considering no one else has been described as dying so far, I think it's a bit of a stretch to just assume that's the case here.)

.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them
#+end_quote

(Some context - at this point in the fight, Voldemort is there, as are /most/ of the Death Eaters from this ambush. However, Voldemort has disallowed any Death Eaters from throwing any spells at Harry. Meaning anyone who's fallen off of their broom are likely to have plenty of help being saved. Again, it's slightly open to interpretation.)

/“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!” “We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added defiantly./

Many people use this quote to show that Harry is unwilling to kill, but it shows the opposite, as he only used to Disarming spell on Stunpike, but Stupefy, Impediments and Confrigo on the others.

********** He wanted her to feel pain. She did feel pain, but not enough to rattle someone who has been on the receiving end of Voldemort's curse.

Don't forget that this was probably the first time he used that curse. Lack of practice was a big factor and even then he managed to hurt her.

For comparison see his progress in Patrnous charm. It's fueled by happy memory and v desire to protect yet when he first tone carry he he could barely manage a mist. He learned it with to drive away hundreds of soul suckers.

Similarly of he had prior practise he could have matched Voldemort's level of pain.

From book:

Aaaaaah... did you love him, little baby Potter?”

Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, “Crucio!”

Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.

“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson -”

Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed, “Crucio!” and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur's arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard's head.
