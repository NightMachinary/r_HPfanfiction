** Well, I googled 'Harry punches Krum fanfiction', and the first result was chapter 11 of One Wizard Too Many: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7244255/11/One-Wizard-Too-Many]]

Is this the one you're looking for?

As a side note, I recommend adding a 'Fic Search' flair to your post if you're looking for a specific fic in particular, or 'Request' if you're open to any fic that has the something-or-other you're seeking.

That, and putting a description of what you're looking for in the title of your post will help catch the eye of people who might know the fic you're after.
