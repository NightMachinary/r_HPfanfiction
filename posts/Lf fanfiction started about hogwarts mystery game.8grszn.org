The game pisses me off to much to play (I hate timed games like this) yet I want to know what's up with that bitch merula and the older brother

Anybody started writing that seems decently well written ?

Thanks


** I have to admit I've already deleted the game off my phone, it had so much potential but feel so short because of the freaking energy. I also really want to know what the deal was with the brother though.

I heard a while that we would be getting a Harry Potter version of Pokemon Go, but this game may have taken the place of it.

*** Nah, it's still in development and will be coming out sometime in 2018. It's called Harry Potter : Wizards Unite

** I haven't seen one but it would be nice to finally get some decent backstory on the main character. That game is just so hard to get into because of the energy limit!

*** Really? I find the energy limit a big part of why I keep coming back. If there wasn't a limit, I would spend hours at a time on it, so I'm not getting burnt out on the game.

**** I just really get annoyed when I play the game. In the first chunk of it, when you're character gets stuck in vines, each tugging action took 12 energy for my character. And I get that it's supposed to make you want to go back, but when one action takes eight hours and you immediately run out of energy like that, it just makes the energy mechanic seem like a big cash-grab.

** I'm more curious about the story than I am about the actual game play. It is really frustrating how long it takes to get any plot development though. I'm still playing, for better or for worse. At the very least, I'm mildly entertained. If there's anyone that has gotten far enough in the gameplay to have enough to write fanfic content from it, I haven't seen it.
