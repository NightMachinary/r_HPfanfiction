:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's that one where Snape and harry are bonded but Dumbledore put in a bunch of dumb clauses into the contract like Snape is required to wear a collar? He told both of them that the other person doesn't want the contract, oh and Harry is a dark or neutral lord I think?


** I don't know the fic myself, but you'll probably have more luck with results on HPSlashfic (link in the sidebar).
