  Wow, you're a smarmy fuck aren't you?
#+end_quote

Insults are nice, actually answering questions and contributing are better though.

#+begin_quote
  First of all, the Dursley's are rich.
#+end_quote

No, they're not. They are middle class, and they live in a standard suburban home. They are proud to be default normal people, that's the whole point. Standard suburban home, boring uniform neighborhood, one car, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Vernon himself can fit under there with no problem. And that's with a bed and everything in there.
#+end_quote

You know what, I found the quote for you.

#+begin_quote
  That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.

  "Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. "Who's writing to me?"
#+end_quote

Squeezed through the door. The argument you're making for the size of the cupboard is based on Vernon being able to squeeze through the door.

Remember when the Dursleys immediately moved Harry out of there out of fear of how the wizards would respond to his living conditions? Why do you think they did that? They /knew/ it was wrong.

#+begin_quote
  What size is big enough that being grounded is an OK punishment?
#+end_quote

I've given you at least a bit of a response to this, and you're still avoiding giving answers. So again, you first.

#+begin_quote
  So what's the size you're arguing for?

  How big is big enough for it to be okay to lock a kid in for extended periods?

  how large of a space do you think that [Harry's cupboard] can possibly be?
