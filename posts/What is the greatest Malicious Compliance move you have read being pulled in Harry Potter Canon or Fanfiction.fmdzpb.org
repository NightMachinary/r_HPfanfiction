The greatest I have seen was in the final battle after Voldemort gave Harry 1 hour to surrender himself and he watched Snape's memories; Harry apparated to an army base, broke into it's armory and stuffed his pockets with shrunken down high explosive and strapped a dozen shrunken down claymore mines to his chest. Then he made a basic dead man's switch that would cause the explosives to revert to their original size and detonate as soon as his heart stopped. He then went into the forest, tossed a portkey to Hagrid and let himself get hit by the killing curse and BOOM.

For anyone curious this is the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788731/5/Harry-Potter-and-the-things-that-could-have-happened]]

What is the greatest malicious compliance you have read?

  The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers didn't seem to mind them very much.

  ‘Dear, dear,' said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. ‘Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the Headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom?'

  The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as Headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and they were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a dishevelled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick's classroom.

  ‘Thank you so much, Professor!' said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice. ‘I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn't sure whether or not I had the authority.'

  Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face.

** My favorite part of that chapter is when he punches Dumbledore in the face and tells him that he ruined everything with his bedamned secrecy. (Plus, telling him he never wants to see him again.)
