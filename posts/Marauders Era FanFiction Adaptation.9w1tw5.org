I make stop motion films and I wanted to make an animation based on the marauders era. I thought there would be no better place to start for a good script than just straight up fanfictions. So I'm looking for recommendations for a marauders era fanfiction (preferably long) that I could possibly adapt into animation. Any would be appreciated.


** The Life and Times by Jewels5 was always a favorite of mine. Not sure how it would look in stop animation, but that's my recommendation. It's not finished, but it did end in a spot that could be tied off nicely.
