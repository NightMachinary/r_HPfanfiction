I just thought of the /worst/ pairing I can think of: Severus Snape/Vernon Dursley.

While I go poor acid into my eyes, what do you guys think is the worst pairing possible, even if it hasn't been written?


** At least they're both adults. I find that a lot less creepy than any of the underage student/adult pairings.

** There is some truly sick shit on A03...worse than that.

But I actually think a crack fic with Snape/Vernon could be kind of funny. Now I'm picturing a story where Snape is still lusting after Lily but worried since he knows he sent Voldemort after her (while not giving a shit about poor Harry and James). He goes to a bar, gets drunk to forget everything, and randomly meets and falls in bed with Vernon. They have a low key FWB hate sex situation (with Snape now worried that Voldy will find out he told Dumbledore & is banging a muggle)...and then Petunia finds out. Petunia freaks and somehow finds a way to contact Lily (maybe by phone) and Lily and James decide to take her in (despite the nasty past)...but Godric's Hollow is too small for the three of them plus Harry plus Dudley. They go off and find another place to live...meanwhile, Dumbledore kills Voldemort.

Ten years later, Harry goes to Hogwarts and Snape is still a bastard to him...but Harry snarks right back and tells everyone "he's a homewrecker who ruined my aunt's marriage", coughs and goes "professor slut, oops, i mean snape", etc. (not to promote slut shaming, but the idea of kid harry slut shaming Snape would be the vibe).

** There have been a few pairings I won't stand behind. Most of them involve professors with their students. I am still recovering from the Lupin/Hermione smut I read back a decade ago. The author didn't warn for it, just hit chapter x and it was Lupin taking advantage of his position as a professor and forcing himself onto Hermione... who was worried that she was failing his class...

And that was when I made the decision to never read a Lupin story that wasn't set in the Marauders Era.
