I love stories where a character ends up traveling to another world. They are always so much fun to read.

I'd love any stories where one character, or more then one character travels to another version of their world for whatever reason.

Bonus points if Tom is good or Sirius is dark and Severus is good. (Of course doesn't have to be, I want as many Traveled to Another World kind of story you can think of).

Extra bonus points if James and Lily are alive in the other world.

Any ratings is fine. Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but if done well since it's the other world, I will allow it. I would also appreciate it if the story was complete or updated regularly, one thing I hate is starting to read the story only to find out it hasn't been updated since like 2015. Now if it has a ton of chapters, then I suppose it's okay. I'd just rather have completed stories.

Sorry for the long post, thank you for the help in advance. (And note anyone can travel to an alternate world, not just say Harry, Severus or Draco. Since they seem to be the most popular with those stories). Just thought I'd tell you that.

- Tom is good
- Severus and Lily are together, James is with someone else
- Sirius is Tom's son-in-law
- There is no Draco
- But there are still bad guys

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) has still got to be one of my favourite dimension travel fics.

It's quite old and falls into a few cliches, but I think it holds up surprisingly well. James and Lily are still alive, through Tom Riddle is most certainly still dark.
