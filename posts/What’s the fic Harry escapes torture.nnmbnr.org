I know this is meant to be under the ‘what's the fic' tag but it's broken so I have to put it here.

I read a fic about a year or two ago that starts out with Harry being kidnapped and tortured in malfoy manor while the order are trying to save him. The actual scenes of him being in captivity only last a chapter or two before he escapes by himself and apparates to the burrow.

After apparating to the burrow it sets off an alarm to the order who are all at headquarters, they all quickly rush back to find Harry passed out on the floor, badly injured.

A key point I remember is Umbridge getting out to trial for using a blood quill and she gets charged as guilty, this leads to her getting extremely angry and attempting to crucio Harry but due to his torture he's used to the effects and it doesn't hurt him.

Some other smaller parts I remember are Harry panicking and pulling a knife on dumbledore when he comes up behind him and startled him, this is right after his escape.

And also I recall Draco taunting Harry, saying that he could hear his screams and cries of pain coming from his basement.

That's all I can remember atm, it was set in OOTP and was posted on fanfiction.net

Any help would be appreciated!

** I've read one almost exactly like this, except Harry stayed at the burrow after and went mute. Might be the same fics?

*** Maybe, but I feel like I remember him talking, though it's possible he was only mute while he was at the burrow and started talking again later in the story
