I love Hermione/older character but only when they are plausibly around the same age through the wonders of magic.

I find older man younger women stories really squicky but want to see her with Snape or one of the Blacks, anyone from Riddle's era Hogwarts or Marauder's era. I don't really have any restrictions on pairings.

If you've got any where a younger version of a character ends up in Hermione's time then that would work too.

I think I've read a bunch of the most popular ones so some more recent/lesser known ones would be great!

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
