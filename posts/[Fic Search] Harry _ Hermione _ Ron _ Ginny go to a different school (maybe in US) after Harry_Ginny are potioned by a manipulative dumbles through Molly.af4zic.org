What I remember:-

1) The other school is led by someone incredibly talented and whom dumbledore tried to control in his Hogwarts days through potions (to fall in love with Tonks)

2) Hermione finally detects that Harry / Ginny are under the thrall of the potions and gets them out of it.

3) Good Ron / Ginny.

4) When Dumbles gets wind of this and attempts to control them again, the other headmaster appears and whisks them away.

Pretty sure I read it on ffnet, but might be elsewhere too.
