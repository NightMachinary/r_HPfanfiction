** A Harry/Katie Bell story set in HBP where he sneaks out to St Mungos to visit her, either as an established relationship (eg they got together after a Quidditch practice) or they get together during one of the visits.

The logistical side can be solved by Tonks (if her love life is nonexistent, she might as well help others) or the twins (bros being wingmen) since it'd take maybe twenty seconds in total to get Harry from Hogsmeade/the Shrieking Shack to St Mungos and back with sidelong apparation.

** A Harry/Cho fic.

Maybe where she chooses him for the ball? Or he asks her before Cedric. An ending where he enjoys the ball rather than him ignoring Parvati and brooding over Hermione and Cho with Ron.

Or maybe a post GoF one?Whether in OotP, HBP or post war.

We need more of this pairing :)

** Ron is the BWL, and his mother is dead as a result.

EDIT: Actually, I'd rather everyone was a slightly more competent than their counterpart. Ron is a budding seer, Hermione actually independently researches/invents something, Harry obsessively gets stronger so he can face Voldemort and actually turns out to be a DADA prodigy, there is a reason Hagrid is one of Dumbledore's most trusted advisers, Dumbledore doesn't foolishly do loads of things for seemingly no reason, like the traps around the stone and leaving Harry alone at the Dursleys to be neglected, Voldemort has more of a reason to be feared, etc.
