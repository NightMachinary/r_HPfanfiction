I'm looking for a powerful Harry fanfic that is actually readable, most of the ones I've come across have been.....not very good to say the least. Basically, I'm looking for little to no grammatical errors and I'm looking for the story to start at year 1 and hopefully, continue.(/Planned sequels or already has sequels)


** Have you read Core threads?

** *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146): excellent world building, smart and rational characters (both heroes and villains). Harry seemed a little too mature at 11, but otherwise believable. The story begins when Harry was 5 and finishes at the end of year 4. The sequel *Animagus at War* is coming in a few weeks. An interlude called *The World of The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(12076644), depicts the worldwide response to events at the end of Year 4.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

#+begin_quote
  A series of one-shots in the Animagus-Verse showing the state of the magical world at the time of Voldemort's return. Some brace for war, while for others, life goes on. A bridge between The Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War.

** i think there's a fine line of difference between a "readable fic" and a fic that has little to no grammatical errors.

While these fics may not start at year 1, IMO they're very well done and are probably my favorite fics that involve harry being powerful; *The One He Feared* linkffn(9778984) i think the summary covers this fic quite well, also *Magicks of the Arcane* linkffn(8303194) has depictions of /absurbly/ powerful magic and the characters utilizing them to full effect.

for a powerful harry story that starts at year 1, *Blindness* linkffn(10937871) has a pretty op harry but is a gary-sue so you've been warned.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Now. YMMV. But I've found this series to be one of the better powerful harry stories. It hits a few tropes but given how old it is I think it gets grandfathered in without making them unbearable. The author wrote a book for each year and it gets increasingly AU. However, In my less than humble opinion it offers one of the more interesting and clever concepts regarding powerful wizards (which per your request Harry is one).

This is the first of them.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
