This seems like a very minor thing, but I have noticed in Fanfiction that nobody takes their tea like a normal person; they always have it with lemon or just black. I have literally never seen someone have tea white with two sugars.

I have lived in the UK for all of my life and I have NEVER seen someone have tea with lemon. I think I've seen black tea once or twice but I thought that was weird at the time. It always really brings me out of the story.

Does anyone have any idea why this is? I see it a lot in stories where Harry is the whiny edgelord taking down the wizengamot at 11 years old. Perhaps writers use it as a way of distinguishing Harry from the common rabble who like builders tea?


** It's cuz a lot of fanfiction is written by Americans who have no fucking clue how to drink or make tea. That and a lot of them are the British equivalent of weeaboos so they think they know how you make tea.

*** It literally never occurred to me until about two years ago that you could put sugar and milk in hot tea just like I do in coffee. Because in all the fiction (fanfic or not) no one ever did. In Texas we only drink iced tea, which to be fair, if usually sweetened, /never/ with milk. It just suddenly hit me one day that I should try it. I'll never drink coffee again. I still don't put sugar in highly flavored teas, but my plain black tea? Super strong, super sweet, all the half-and-half. I have no idea why Americans think you drink it plain. Especially because once I realized, I noticed in every TV show that people at least offer milk and sugar!

Edit: Forgot to add that once I shared my discovery with my husband, he immediately bought an electric kettle. We use it daily. And now I remembered we're out of tea. Well, out of his tea (he likes chai. I'm not sure there's even tea in his tea.)

If it's a store-bought istant chai then the presence of tea in it is debatable, yes. With tea bags it's a “maybe”, and if it's a loose leaf tea then tea it is.

*** Or, Americans also drink tea and we aren't pansies so we don't put sugar and milk in it bc it's not necessary. Lemon on occasion, yes, depending on the tea.

Edit: just to be clear I'm joking about the pansy part. We do drink black tea most often though I literally do not know a single person who adds milk to hot tea, maybe some sugar or honey but never milk.

I was always the sweetest, cutest kid, and I've been drinking my tea black since I can remember. My brother likes it with cream, but he's lactose intolerant so he drinks it with a spoonful of sugar (we don't really use sugar cubes here), my mom drinks it with stevia, and my dad basically drowns it in lemon and sugar.

My characters drink normal tea, but on thinking about it I'm not sure I ever specified milk and sugar more than once. It's just 'tea'. I'd have to go back and look. Perhaps I should edit it in.

** I have had so much fun reading this thread. As a British person, my tuppence on the issue:

Most people I know have a local "normal" brand of tea. In the North it tends to be Yorkshire Tea, in the South it tends to be PG Tips but there are other common brands.

The standard method for myself and most people I know is:

1. Boil the kettle.
2. Place teabag(s) in cup(s) or pot. (I'm not going into fancy specifics for either, on a daily basis I don't fuss about too much). Sometimes I'll use loose leaf, but that's a whole other kettle of +fish+ hot water.
3. As soon as water boils, pour over teabag. THIS IS IMPORTANT. In the same way that NOT doing this is important when making coffee so you don't scald it.
4. Wander off for a couple of minutes. I don't time the brewing and I'm too impatient to stare at it. If you are a builder, wander off and/or chat and don't come back "until you can stand up a spoon in it", as my late Nan would say.
5. Remove tea bag. Add sugar/sweetener/honey and a splash of milk to each cup. Stir. I personally don't add any sweet things as I'm sweet enough ;)

Edit: I realised I responded to the general tone of the comments instead of OP. I agree. I find the tea habits of fanfic characters weird, and it will even occasionally break my suspension of disbelief. There is also generally not enough tea involved for stories based in the UK. Alas, this is also true of Canon.

In my fic, tea will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it! Pots should be available at breakfast at the very least! Huh, I might make that my flair.

Almost everyone I know drinks their regular black tea strong with milk and sometimes sugar (I'm a heathen and like mine with sugar but no milk), but a lot of tea brands seem to advertise their tea in clear glass teacups with slices of lemon, I guess to show the colour of the tea and make it look pretty? My guess is that these people either live in a country where tea is commonly served like that or just aren't big tea drinkers and assume that's the normal way to take it due to those sorts of ads.

I've also noticed a lot of writers seem to specify that characters drink Earl Grey, which is perfectly acceptable to drink black with a slice of lemon.

******** ? We're talking about milk, lol. As far as I know, there IS only black, green, and white tea. Chai is just black tea + yummy spices. It's a specific flavor, like Earl Grey is black tea + bergamot. (My favorite tea for when I want to pretend I'm super sophisticated is Lapsang Souchong. It's just smoked black tea, it tastes like a campfire smells. But then people ask you what you're drinking and get to sound like you really know your tea with a weird one like that. But it's literally the only weird tea I know)

*** UK folks don't know what half and half is, which I discovered in London a couple of years ago. I was at SBUX across the street from the British Museum, getting my fix. At the condiment bar, there was only skim milk (the horror!), so I asked about half and half.

The girl behind the counter had zero idea what I meant. She said, "Oh, do you mean pouring cream?" I have no idea what pouring cream is, so I said no and suffered with the skim milk. Got lattes the rest of that trip. Also, if you like Splenda, bring your own. It's thin on the ground there.

And! Lemonade is not US yellow lemonade, but rather Sprite or 7-UP. You can find it some places like at a Boots, but it'll probably be called "cloudy lemonade". I do enjoy an Arnold Palmer and the only place I was able to make one was at a Byron's. They had US lemonade on the fountain and Snapple Iced Tea in a bottle. I confused the girl by asking for half a glass of lemonade and an iced tea, but by God I had my drink!

******* No, this is a pasteurized, homogenized blend. Here is what I found online:

Half-and-Half Half-and-half is exactly what it sounds like, equal parts whole milk and light cream. It contains about 12 percent fat, which makes it richer than whole milk (which contains 3.5 percent fat), although less rich than light cream. This makes it a popular addition to coffee because it lends a little more richness to the cup than whole milk does, but not as much as cream. It doesn't, however, contain enough fat to be whipped. So enjoy it in your mug or try using it in desserts that call for equal parts milk and cream, like panna cotta.

**** I am actually planning on a trip so thanks for all of this!

It sounds like I'm not going to be able to get whole milk in coffee shops then. Sad day. That's all I drink. Now I want to know what pouring cream is.

I almost thought it sounded like the lemonade is the same as it was in Spain, but retreading what you said it's not. Theirs was a surprise at first but I definitely began to prefer it! It's basically like super yellow sprite. But it tasted kind of like American lemonade, kind of not, but also was fizzy. It was really good.

***** You're welcome! My experience was limited to that one SBUX. They also do coffee at Costa and Pret a Manger, so they may be different. It might be that you can ask for whole milk from the barista--I just didn't think to do it at the time.

At one pub, my husband asked for a Coke and the server asked if Pepsi was okay and he said yes. He ended up with Pepsi Max which is diet, so he wasn't very pleased by that.

Also, when you go out to eat, don't expect a lot of (or really any) attention from the server. It's up to you to tell them when you're ready to order and when you are ready to go and would like to pay the bill. It's not rude, it's just how it's done there. Kind of funny--when we were there in 2016, we were at a pub in London and the Giants football team were playing an exhibition game, so London was crawling with Americans in their Giants gear. There was an older man and lady at the pub and it was kind of funny to see them huffing and puffing as they were expecting American-style service and not getting it.

** Where I'm from if you go to a non-fancy resturant, and you ask for tea, they serve it black, cold, and with a lemon wedge. If you want it sweet there are sugar packets on the table. And growing up, as a fat American, we drank tea by the gallon with two cups of sugar in it. :/

** I know that a lot of that kind of fanfict is written by Americans. I'm an American, and I don't drink my tea with milk, and I don't know anyone who does. That's one of those differences between cultures that seems small but can be a big deal in something like writing and details.

Personally, I used to work in a tea store, and I like to think I know how to make it at this point. Occasionally we'd get people ask for milk, which we didn't actually have, we just had non-diary creamer since we weren't a full-service cafe, but yeah, most people just wanted it sweetend. I drink my tea with either a little bit of sweetening (not nearly as much as some americans), or just straight.

But yeah. this is definitely one of those cultural difference from different sides of the atlantic.

** edit: Fanfiction is mostly written by Americans, who, inevitably botch little things about British culture that you can't really understand unless you are a part of it. That being said, my British flatmate didn't even like tea, so I don't tend to assume everyone in Britain takes their tea the exact same way (though obviously there is one way that is common enough for there to be tea color charts involved).

When I was living in England, we had a gas worker come to fix our meter thing, and I stupidly offered him a cup of tea. I have never been more stressed out by my own politeness.

I basically just ended up making the tea, adding the sugar he wanted and then just giving him the jug of milk because I knew I was gonna mess it up (I regularly mess up the amount of milk in my own tea). I refused to be the American that completely botched his tea.

Tea making is stressful!

edit 2: The way the characters take tea has never really bothered me, but I do enjoy when authors use the way they take their tea to say something to the character. I find it more bothersome when fics have literally everyone drinking coffee.

** As an American who drinks tea all day long, (almost as much as some people drink water) ice cold and sweetened with one packet of saccharin, and the odd few drops of lime or lemon juice on occasion, this would probably be a mistake that I would make. Honestly, the thought of putting milk or cream into tea kind of makes me gag, and I hate tea hot.

Be that as it may, based on some of the comments here it seems that the way people take their tea is just as varied as the ways that people take their coffee. The methods even seem similar: milk/cream and sugar, milk/cream, sugar, black. If I were to write a scene, after reading these comments, where people are sitting around drinking tea, and even bother to mention how they are taking it, I might treat the diversity of how they're taking it like they are drinking coffee.

** English Breakfast tea is actually supposed to be taken black/black with milk/black with lemon. Supposedly, never with sugar, as it overpowers the aroma of the tea. I think black or black with milk is the way most tea connoisseurs recommend it. So I suppose that could be one way to distinguish a character as being more 'posh' than the other, by having them drink tea the 'correct' way.

** Different kinds of tea require different preparations. Green tea should be steeped at a lower temperature than black tea, and its flavour is best complimented by honey. The bitterness and flavour of black teas is dulled and complimented by milk (or even better with heavy cream), although people who like dark chocolate and IPAs enjoy bitterness. Honey in black tea would taste foul, but some people can't handle bitterness so they add refined white sugar that has no flavour besides sweetness.
