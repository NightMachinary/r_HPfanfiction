:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
so I've been trying to find this fic for months now and I've had no luck but it's a hermione/sirius time travel story in which hermione is sent back in time almost directly after Harry defeats voldemort. The clearest part that I remember is the ending: on the night that voldemort kills Harry's parents, hermione tries to stop sirius from going after pettigrew. He uses her time turner and sends her back to the future, where she stays with remus and teddy (who is now a toddler). Eventually, she goes back and saves sirius's life and they live happily together. Anyone know what this is?
