Basically I'm looking for stories that cover anything to do with politics and careers. Any characters, any era. Something that delves into bureaucracy and that kind of thing.

Also, random question: Do you think there would be security measures on the Floo entrances of the Ministry? For example, they have to be certified and connected only to Ministry workers houses. I want to write a fic where someone goes to the ministry via one of the pubs, but it occurred to me that might be a security flaw, somehow.


** Came across this looking for the same thing. Ever find anything?

An even though I'm quite late to answer, yes I think they'd have some sort of security measures. I think it'd probably be an id system though, possibly by registering members wands. So an employee should be able to use the network from anywhere.

If it were just their homes fireplaces connected then anyone would still be able to break in an use it.
