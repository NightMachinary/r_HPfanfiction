Polyjuice potion, Memory charms and Stupefy are enough for one person to dismantle the Ministry.

Look at Mad-Eye-Moody, he got stunned and locked away by Barty Crouch Jr who then went on to impersonate him using Polyjuice potion. Keep in mind Moody is a really paranoid person who is always on guard. Now how hard would it be to do this to a regular person?

This is just 1 example of how easily magic can cause a bunch of problems. Honestly I'm surprised the Ministry can even survive with all these hazards out there.


** I agree. I'd like to believe that this is also why Defense Against the Dark Arts is a mandatory subject till the OWL level.

****** Right? It's one of my bigger pet peeves in media when the sexual assault of male characters is overlooked. And sometimes, like Riddle Sr they're even punished for it vis-a-vis he and his entire family being murdered for what? "abandoning" Meriope as soon as he was able to escape the woman who essentially kidnapped him, held him captive, and, presumably, repeatedly raped him?

Take the original Captain Kirk, for example. He isn't the lothario pop culture has made him out to be. Only three of the women he has a relationship with in the show are consensual (Dr. Helen Noel, Miramanee, and Edith Keeler). The rest are either straight up drugged rape, like what Elaan of Troius and Nona do, or he's either coerced into it or forced to do it to assure his own or the /Enterprise's/ survival, as with Andrea, Marlena Moreau, Drusilla, Shana from the quatloo episode, Kelinda, and (sort of) Marta. Only three out of the eleven relationships shown on the show don't involve at least some level of coercion, and /Kirk's/ made out to be the problem.

Even his "ground-breaking" kiss with Uhura is literally forced by sadistic telekinetic aliens.

******* Yeah, recently I read another book where the male lead after being raped, marries the woman because she is pregnant. It was really sick that authors handle it carelessly.

I get that this book did handle Tom Riddle Sr.'s storyline very precariously. In fact, some part of the book validated Merope's need for love, and even trying to justify in some manner proclaiming that "Merope couldn't buy love with drug-potion" whereas Tom Riddle's rape wasn't even discussed, or dealt.

But Voldemort didn't kill his father for leaving Merope. He killed because his father abandoned him in an orphanage to suffer. Atleast that was what his intention were in the book. Voldemort developed resentment and hatred for his muggle father, who he assumed should have taken up responsibility to bring up the child.

I am with you, still, considering the text was not enough to show how Tom Riddle was the victim here, and not at all discussing Metope was the rapist.

However, not being able to get hard only makes penis-owners not able to be the penetrating partner, but it doesn't prevent them from being raped, nor does whether or not a vagina-owner is sexually aroused prevent them from being raped or conceiving.

Given Ron's reaction to his being drugged by Romilda Vane, and the assumption that she bought the drug at WWW, since we see love potions for sale there early in HBP, it either implies that wizarding culture does not have a rape culture, so public sale of roofies is not an issue; or that wizarding culture is so rife with sexual assault that the drugs to facilitate it are sold commercially to at least make an effort to oversee the quality and safety of the drug.

***** I don't think he was though. I mean think about it. He is left in an orphanage from the night he was born. Then, for the next 11 years, he's ostracized and called a “freak” by the other kids in the orphanage. The kids also hurt him and his caretaker is portrayed as someone really horrible. He gets revenge because he wants them to feel how he feels, how hurt he is, he wants to get them back. He doesn't actually instigate anything until later in his life. Most of everything he does before he learns he is a wizard is some sort of pay back. Anyway, he steals from the other kids and that's wrong but hey, what kid doesn't make mistakes? But, Dumbledore comes to tell this kid that he is a wizard, sees all the things Tom has stolen, and basically judges him as a bad person for life. Remember, Tom said Dumbledore always had some sort of grudge against him. I'm not saying that Dumbledore is a bad person, just that he may have made a mistake. Maybe there was a chance to change Tom. Anyway, so Tom learns he's a wizard and goes to Hogwarts where he's sorted into Slytherin. But, remember he doesn't know who his parents are and he's lived in a Muggle orphanage his whole life; therefore, he's considered a Muggleborn. So, now he's ostracized and isolated at school because he is a Muggleborn. Due to this, he decides to prove all of them wrong and become the most powerful person ever. So, he was bullied quite a lot, he didn't know his parents, his orphanage was horrible, Dumbledore hated him, and when he finally finds out who his parents are one of them is dead and the other doesn't want him. Tom literally had no good events in his life. That's got to have taken a toll on him. In the end, I think he just wanted revenge on the world in general.

And there are interesting aspects to Voldemort's early life. The worn down robes, the Gringotts always being unreachable as he grew up, Hogwarts becoming a home for him, but I still think Voldemort was a sociopath, who wanted to use everyone and everything for his advantage.

He wanted all the powers and his disassociation with people in general, aided him to not hold back. I dislike how book portrayed "love" or "being loved" is the extreme gift. I mean, it wasn't Tom's fault that Merope died. Or that Tom's fault to not love people around him. Institutionalized kids generally exhibit disassociation, and Tom had tough childhood, so blaming him for not able to love is cruel.

But he still holds all responsibility for his actions. He did choose violence and manipulation to bring destruction on others, especially to people who did him no harm. He deserved death, and certain parts of his life could have been better under different circumstances, but he chose the wrong way.

Tom Riddle may be just another one. He is definitely not the first or the only one that suffered such a childhood. Grindelwald's war produced most likely tons of magical orphans. But he may be one of these people that are natural-born psychopaths.

This isn't in the books. Nothing in the books suggests that Tom was bullied in the orphanage; in fact, it's implied he was the bully. He's never called a "freak" by the other kids, and the ways he harms them are very extreme and disturbing.

"Annoy" doesn't automatically mean those kids were bullying Tom. He says that because he found kids annoying, he hurt them in retaliation.

He was never described as a victim of bullying.

So, while the amount of stuff that /can/ be used to do very bad things is high, the amount of people who'd actually /use/ them that way for anything huge is actually pretty low - resurgencies of Dark Lords, self-proclaimed or otherwise, notwithstanding.

In theory, the entire reason the DMLE exists is to catch those people who /would/ create a bunch of Polyjuice/love-potion/Imperio/murder-curse related problems and throw them in a nigh-inescapable prison with soul-sucking guards. That's a serious deterrent for most lower-key crimes as well.

The real problem, then, is when that system stops working. Vanilla government corruption, of the kind that also exists in the Muggle world, leads to specific people staying out of jail who /really/ should just have their soul sucked out the first time, and every once in a while a powerful sociopath is born through one circumstance or another for whom Azkaban isn't enough of a deterrent - which is when big honking wars tend to happen.

It is not strange at all that most werewolves seek their salvation with Greyback who puts his lot with the Dark Lord who promises them more rights when the new world order is established. This was their only hope, who cared about Azkaban if their regular life was hell already? At least behind bars they wouldn't accidentally kill someone and wouldn't starve.

Imagine if there were shelters, subsidized jobs, active anti-discrimination laws? The allowance to attend schools without having to keep their being a werewolf secret?

Then get myself a grand mansion, buy as many Dark books as I can, steal the rest, become a powerful wizard and generally avoid witches and wizards that could steal from me as easy as I would have.

I once read a drabble where Voldy told Lucius to get him a rich muggle to torture and steal his fortune from. Lucius grabbed an American billionaire and left V in the room with him. They heard screams, and just waited around until it died down. Lucius then mentioned to the other DEs that it was a fellow from the colonies called Bruce Wayne...

** What is most scary about the Wizarding UK, is how no body makes a stink when Hagrid is shoved in Azkaban (which we can compare to guatanamo bay in how horrible the prison is) "to be seen doing something", and nobody raises a stink. What is scary about the Wizarding UK is that in the beginning of book 5 Fudge suggests in front of a full wizengamot that he can convict Harry and change the laws afterwards and nobody gives a peep. What scares the shit out of me about the Wizarding UK is Rowling's suggestion about how many officials could be bought. What is downright terrifying about the wizarding UK is that a decade and a half after Voldemort's first rise it is so damn easy for them to round up all the muggleborns and prosecute them.

What is scary about the non-magical UK is that child marriage is still a thing, which would be terrifying combined with amortentia.

I think what scares me the most about those 7 Harry Potter books is the lack of ethics classes when teenagers are taught to bend reality to their will.

*** The political situation of Wizarding Britian is fucking terrifying.

The legislative arm is /also/ the judicial arm, meaning the same people make and enforce the laws. There is no due process, Harry's hearing gets moved at the last minute without notification, and he was going to be tried in absentia. He had no advocate, wasn't allowed to cross-examine witnesses, and no one gave a shit that the judge wasn't impartial.

As you said, people can be imprisoned in a place that could accurately be described as Hell-on-Earth, on no one's word but the Minister. No trial, no hearing, just straight off to Azkaban.

I get that as a series for kids, it's far from important to develop the political/governmental/judicial framework. But the wizards and witches of Britian have fewer civil liberties and protections than people before the Magna Carta was signed.

However I do agree that there probably isn't any place in the ministry where the spells wear off because the trio are able to go in disguised with polyjuice in Book 7 to get the locket from Umbridge and we do know for a fact that there were people under the imperius curse at the ministry during both Wizarding Wars.

**** Most ministry employees can't cast a basic shield charm, and it's implied that ministry employees are selected for higher grades than the median population, meaning they showed more promise in magic school. Not only that, but quikspell tutoring services are popular enough to be advertised for a small population. My head canon has been that most wizards kind of suck and have a few areas of specialization (Lockhart is one of the memory charm GOATs despite otherwise being utterly useless.

We're never given a great power scale for the verse, Voldemort's power seems to derive from the fact that he's highly proficient at all branches of magic, which is unusual. It isn't too distinct from the muggle world, where most people have elementary general skills and hyper specialize- many people struggle with basic algebra, but a handful understand advanced computation and build computers, etc. The rare polymath who's very good at many things is just more powerful in the magical world because all their skills can be parlayed into literal reality bending feats.

********* Really the Wizarding education system is quite bad, you pick in your Third Year which classes you want to take, which will then define your career path.

Considering the classes taken in the first year, it would seem like DADA, Transfiguration, Charms, and Potions are the core classes. These classes are compulsory up to OWLs. This would imply you are meant to come out OWLs with the grades to move on in these subjects if you so choose. In the NEWT years, you do advanced training to prepare yourself for a career path. No NEWT class is compulsory outside of what a potential employer is looking for. So it's more likely that OWLs are your A-Level Equivalent. If were to assume that the Wizarding World did its grading logically, both NEWTs and OWLs would be considered a certification. You wouldn't have just OWLs or just NEWTs you'd instead see a mixture. For example, you might need an OWL in Care of Magical Creatures to be part of the security team at a dragon reserve.

If NEWTs were compulsory, Snape wouldn't be allowed to raise the entry bar to require extra credit. I operate under the assumption that you must demonstrate some greater level of understanding than what is expected of an OWL student. It is called the Ordinary Wizarding Level, basically, you pass these, and you are considered a qualified Wizard. You show that you are above and beyond, you get an Outstanding. Harry received an Outstanding for the use of the Patronus, something most wizards supposedly can't achieve.

If we assume an Outstanding is an A that raises some problems because you're really telling me that /Hermione Granger/ didn't get a perfect score in DADA when she achieved one in practically all other classes. She achieved perfect scores in /all/ of her classes, you can't just say Harry knows more than her! She's canonically a genius, who was using NEWT spells before her OWLs and brewing NEWT potions in her 2nd year. Defense is an amalgamation of other classes she got perfect scores in for the practical aspects.

**** well apparently the patronus isnt something most anyone can do, seeing as during Harry's defense OWL the instructor wanted to see if Harry could really do it as it was uncommon to see.

Also forget the ministry where people with magic can easily step in to counter your terrorism, whats to stop a Dark Wizard who doesn't care about the statue of secrecy to going into a muggle football game and cast explosion spells into the crowd? Or fire to quickly overtake the stadium? I mean make it a talented wizard like Voldemort who gets followers, and can't be caught by the ministry despite their efforts, and you can get terrorist attacks on muggles on a massive scale.

*** I'll maybe give you memory charms since we don't see them used much.\\
Not sure what you mean about backfiring though, if you mean Lockheart then that was just Ron's broken wand backfiring like it did with the slugs, nothing to do with the memory charm itself (a spell Lockhart has cast many, many times with no issue)

But three 2nd years brew polyjuice with no issues and it's used by Crouch Jr., Malfoy and the Order later on.\\
It's probably only restricted to NEWT students because of what can go wrong if you add something other than human hair, not something you want the Nevilles of the world anywhere near.

Imperio seems pretty easy actually, probably the easiest unforgivable.\\
Harry casts Imperio easily with no practice or study, Malfoy keeps Rosmerta under it for an entire year and plenty of people used it during Voldemort's ministry takeover.

Compare this to the hours of practice Harry needed for things like the summoning charm (which was standard class work) or stunnign and shield charms.

** There's also a whole bunch of dangerous creatures out there in the magical world. Dementors, trolls, dragons, red caps, kappas, transformed werewolves, vampires, and many more.

It's also my main response when people complain about how dangerous Hogwarts is. The Wizarding World in general is dangerous. If a student can't handle Hogwarts, with all its protections and teachers, then they would be helpless outside of Hogwarts. Hogwarts give its students some sense of the dangers so that they know how to react.

** A scary place yes, but, similar to our world, depending on one's level of knowledge. Fire, car crashes, opening the can the wrong way, getting lost and starving. Arguably, some of the real world dangers are ealso dangerous or highly unpleasant. Some of the equipment we use, when wrongly, could also be damaging.

It is not exactly the same thing, but somewhat equivalent in principle. Survival and well being are, in the magical world, also dependent on competence and proper focus.

To my mind, one of the most difficult things in the wizarding world is not a spell though. It's psychological. The easiest to forget because it is too common place. Having to pretend to be ordinary. Somebody you are not.

Having to always remember dressing in a way you don't want to. Travel in the most inconvenient way when you know betetr methods. Having to pretend to have a Muggle identity when you are a wizard. To me, that would be the most psychologically scarring of dangers in the wizarding world.

It took a group of people using the Imperius Curse and several deaths of high-ranking Ministry officials, including Dumbledore's, to do it.

It's absurdly easy for a wizard to go into the muggle world, cast a confundus on a girl to make her wander into a dark alley, and then use the imperious... and after the deed is done, obliviate the victim and maybe an epsikey to heal the physical damage.

So far, the ministry of magic showed that they don't really care about muggles acting as witnesses for a crime. That means that they most likely also ignore most of the crimes that happen against muggles as long the statute of secrecy is safe.

The wizarding world is basically what rapists dream of when they plot stuff in their dark cellars.

**** Yeah, but I guess they put some scanner close to the Gaunts to monitor that family. They must have had some history of violence and rule-breaking.

But I doubt they can monitor the entire island. Or, they might be only able to track down bigger fluctuations of magic, stuff that happens during combat, for example. But stuff like an Imperius, Obliviate, Confundus, etc. can be used in a subtle way, and if there is no ministry scanner closeby, then you get away with it.

What I think is that while there is so much room to abuse magic, normal magical folk don't really do it, or think about doing it.\\
It might be the way they grew up, and most of them most likely stay in the magical world and never visit the muggle one. Only a few individuals like Mundungus or maybe some Death Eaters may ever venture into the non-magical world for shady stuff. They are a different culture after all, and maybe the thought of using magic to rape another person never really manifested that much - but only in the sickest of minds.

I like to think that because it makes the magical world less dark ^^

***** Yeah, true.

The book really doesn't explore, but it's extremely plausible to abuse the people who are considered less powerful/inferior. And muggles are considered inferior, even to the "good" wizards. They think very low of non-magical people, like a pet or an animal, rather than equals. It's children's book, so probably the author was finding it easy to write about, torture, death, racism, child abuse rather to write anything about rape.
