Harry is believed to be dead and heralded as the Boy-Who-Lived, his twin is the BWL (arrogant and pompous, but who was raised to appreciate his family), has a little sibling, anything's fine, really.

Definitely not the fics where the Potters send him away and expect Harry to welcome them back. I want the fics where James and Lily loved their son, grieved his death and tried to move on with their lives.

A Harry who doesn't understand why his parents didn't come for him when they were alive and conscious, who holds onto that grudge, believes himself to be let down and abandoned, just like by every other person in his life so far.

Perhaps he would hate his magic at the start, because of which he was let go by people he genuinely cared about.

Angst is fine, as long as the story ends on a happy note.

Bonus points if Harry doesn't get paired up with Ginny. Or Hermione, for that matter. linkffn(Love and Love Again by foreverandnow) has been good, but it was mentioned by James that Harry, had he been alive, would've most likely been in love with Ginny Weasley, so...

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** There is some (slight) adjustement in “Blood Binding by SphinxScribe” linkffn(10382653), but it is certainly not the angst-driven drama, you seem to be searching for.

*** Any genre is fine because I'm honestly desperate to read anything that doesn't involve Potters shipping their child off to the Dursleys on Dumbledore's friendly advise. I'm definitely gonna check it out, thanks!

**** Like what is likely about that. So ridiculous. These people died protecting their child but now they are just going to blindly ship him off to their neglecting relatives and for no reason at all. He has Lily's blood after all. So the 'blood protection' argument doesn't seem to fit. I think those kinds of stories are written by angsty teens or something because they make so sense whatsoever.

They show Lily and James Potter as blind sheep following an idiotic Dumbledore orders blindly.

***** I've seen fics where authors also try to reason that behavior. “James and Lily really try to pay attention to Harry, but as the BWL requires has more immediate needs, they just... forget their other son and have to be constantly reminded of his existence.”

If those fics were written with a goal of making sense, then their authors failed spectacularly. James and Lily, people who were ready to do anything to ensure their child's survival, are suddenly giving their son to the Dursleys, all because -- they have another child?

****** I agree completely! There's just no reason to write that into a story at all. Like two parents can't handle two children so they ship one off to a relative so they will have two children to raise. It's just a gateway to have a badass angsty protagonist that can tell all the 'bad guys' (meaning more often than not the Potters, Dumbledore, Weasleys etc) exactly where to go. It's making the good guys bad with no real thought put into it. No effort or originality. Like I said, I can only imagine the people writing these things are too young to understand how ridiculous is. There is no sense at all.

**** No, this is definitively not THAT kind of story. Normal canon-compliant (not remember whether it is Hinny or not, but it is not that much significant) plain vanilla story.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
