I'm planning on writing a time travel fic where Harry goes back to his first or fourth year but while having another younger Harry running around. I've been inspired by fics like HP: Dolen Amser, Disorder of the Phoenix, Retrograde and many others but I cant seem to come to a decision regarding pairings which would help me settle on how the story forms, I would of posted this as a poll if I was able to but I'm wondering if some people could help me decide. My initial thoughts regarding pairings are: Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks, Harry Potter and Amelia Bones, Harry Potter and Bellatrix Black Or, Harry Potter and Other (Someone else or Ofc) If you could say why you want that pairing I'd greatly appreciated. I also want to put it out there that Harry's partner could of traveled with them so people like Fleur, Daphne or Susan could be a possibility. Hermione and Ginny will NOT be considered so please dont say them.


** Well i think it is better if you use discussion tag instead of request

For pairing, it really depends on your harry age. If harry is in 20s, tonks will be good. For older maybe amelia. I love bellatrix, but i don't think she is viable partner in your fic timeline. You have to write very good redemption arc as she already tortured Neville parents and do other evil. Up until now, i only think bellatrix is good for time travel to marauder's era.

For your younger harry, it really depends on when do you want the fic start. In fourth year fleur will be good. Below that, i prefer witch that have same house as harry so they can have a lot of scene together.

*** For Tonks I was thinking about putting them into the same year around 6th year and them finding school together and expanding from there but with Amelia I was thinking a couple years after Voldemort disappeared and he rescues a young fem harry and raising her alongside susan but I'm not as sure on logistics for that one... yet

** I can't think of the story right now (though I think it's one of the "Harry claiming the Headship of the Black family" ones) where an insane Bellatrix is in hiding at the Malfoys. Somehow the Magic breaks her free from the Dark mark and removes her insanity. She is completely upset about what she did to herself and her looks and completely regretful about the things she did as a deatheater.

The Story is not The Head Of The Family Black by Red Jacobson.

The reason I mention it was because I thought it was a good way to start a redemption arc for a "present time" Bellatrix. Eg that the insanity was forced onto Bellatrix (by lestranges and her parents) and with her insanity and the lestranges' pressure she accepted the Dark Mark. Meaning if she hadn't been pushed into insanity she would have never become a deatheater.

The problem with the older pairings of Amelia or Bellatrix and bringing Harry back to first or fourth year really sets up a May - December relationship unless you decide somehow to de-age the women as well.

If I recall correctly Tonks is 6 years older than Harry and Fleur is 3 so you can quite easily bring Harry back (say from his early 20's etc) and have one or both of the girls in a relationship with him. That could actually be a very fun trio. A veela who is "sex personified" and a metamorphmagus who could change herself to whatever she wants.

It all really depends on what you want to do and how/where you want any relationships to go.

** For the older one depends on the age he is when he travels back. Is he in his early 20 then Fleur and/or Tonks. For the younger one Hermione
