I have been reading more fanfics recently and noticed the common thread of Harry needing a new wand once the Horcrux was removed from his scar, it makes a lot of sense to me. What are things you all like on a similar vein?

edit: i have also admittedly been on an wingfic kick recently, but good ones are few and far between.

** Not sure of ot counts as a trope but I really like in the more M rated romance fics when the main couple start sleeping together one night they forget their silencing charms and the rest of the house teases them about it the next morning.

** If Ron is treating something as really serious, he's wrong; if he jokes about it, he's usually right, and in a way that is nearly prescient.

** Peggy Sue (time travel in a "do-over" sense) is probably my favorite trope overall.

That doesn't mean it can't get a bit tiresome after reading nothing but it. Over half of the fics with the pairing I like the most (Snily) are Peggy Sue fics. To a point where I pay more attention to a fic when it /isn't/, regardless of its general quality, because of sheer novelty.

*** I liked when someone said Blaise Zamboni is the ice king. Can that be a new trope?

*** I can't remember the names of the others, but the story that made me realize it was Lady Black, Lord Potter by MuggleBeene. Pretty fast paced, romance genre which is pretty forced but pretty easy read.

** This isn't really a troupe but I really love the way necromancy is portrayed in Rebirth.
