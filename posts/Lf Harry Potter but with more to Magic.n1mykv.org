I mean don't get me wrong but Magic in HP-verse is very dry, it's basically another subject to school, there's only ‘spells' like “Stupefy” and ‘Swish and Flick' wand waving... i just want more to it than magic being a tool... like im down to read long fics with world building like Harry goes to fae/fey Dimension or High Elves world or else where Maybe Harry founds Atlantis, or goes Another school, hell maybe even Hogwarts but i want to read like a slice of life i can easily say have read a lot of Fanfics and most of them are the same... -Harry goes to hogwarts, then the author either concentrates on love life or voldemort... sometimes even both at the same time... if I'm lucky i read about the first class with potion or Dada or Charms... but i Like things like A lone traveler Series or linkffn(A Good Teacher by lecturience) Where we as reader's gets more into theory, o get to read a whole class from a magical subject I would love to read about Harry traveling in the world, maybe creating a school or being a king, discovering ancient magic, living in the elves realm with Yggdrasil the Great mother of Elves or maybe Fae dimension where he learns soul magic idk i just want to skip the whole killing voldemort = end of the fanfic, i want more to magic I don't have Preference in Pairing but i don't like Light character x Dark Character except in few exceptions (Harry/Bella) so probably won't Read Harry/LV or Harry/Snape or Harry/Draco

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

If you want Harry going off to discover new magic try this. It is basically an orginal story with occasional references to HP, but it is still worth reading.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-
