:FlairText: What's That Fic?

As it happens, the muggles won the wizards vs muggles war.


** Well, you technically want the What's That Fic flair, but you're looking for The End by Draco664: [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_End/The_End/]]

Every now and then I contemplate writing a story set in that setting, looking at how common muggles would respond to having dozens of satellites hovering around to assassinate anyone at any time, or how time-travelling witches/wizards might respond, or governments that don't want to commit genocide, or if dementors could survive without magic...

*** I like where that went, but boy is the development not there. The entire planet goes genocidal after the killing of only two world leaders? Actively rejecting collaborators? It really needs a more detailed 'descent into madness' for it to be believable.

​

Also suffers from too much 'cannon centric characters'. If you are going to have a worldwide calamity, it isn't going to always be the British characters who are the primary actors.

​

If you are going to explore this, I suggest taking it in a direction similar to the Telepaths in B5: The threat was made so real that laws were passed requiring all wizards wear inhibitor collars (where they can always feel the magic just right beyond their grasp, but never use it), take the magic inhibiting drug (with nasty side effects / mind not quite still there), or work for the approved government agency.

Thus the magical population splits into the "Magicorps" (Fully controlled by the people in power), the inhibited (drugged/blocked magic), and the outlaws. You can still have the nice 'three way conflict' happen, without the unbelievable 'we need to kill the wizards who want to join us'.

​

Either that or develop a much more realistic reason for the muggle world to descend into outright genocide.

*** Oh, sorry, thankyou. It auto set Request and I forgot to change it. It's been fixed, now.

Also, thankyou for the answer to the search. That's it.

Additionally, how about a story were ‘that' Harry gets a ‘do over'? He ‘is' the Master Of Death, maybe he could get to begin again?

** I feel like this is a DeludedMusings fic, but I can't track it down. If not theirs, someone else's that used to post on FanficAuthors.net maybe?
