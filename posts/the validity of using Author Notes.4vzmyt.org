I'm a long time fanfiction reader. I've crossed oceans of smut, the frozen tundras of angst, and the jungles of side plots for many years. I even traverse the deserts of the OC character insertions.

In all my fanfiction reading I've never felt the urge to write. This lack is why I seek authors opinions specifically, though others thoughts are always welcome.

What us your opinion on the use of authors notes to preface a story. I don't mean one at the begin of the story that's usually just an explanation or a place to note edits. I've recently noticed how many FF writers feel the need to note every chapter whether it's responding to reviewers, preach about their interpretation of canon, or even just explain the previous chapter.

It annoys me personally. The story should explain itself. If it requires direct author explanation then it's probably either up its own ass with cleverness or just too obtuse for anyone not the author to grasp.

Not all of them are bad. Some are useful. A few are clever. But most are just an artifical word count booster that I immediately scroll past.

Now. Your thoughts?

  As long as

  1. they aren't long as shit

  2. they are not a bigass collection of review responses

  3. they're not in the middle of the text

  4. they're obviously separate from the text

  I'm cool with 'em.

Though I will add that I prefer them at the end of a chapter.

**** I actually prefer them at the bottom if they expand on stuff in the chapter (like answering readers' "how" questions) from a writing perspective.

Like let's say you have some big reveal, but dropped hints the past few chapters. The AN at the bottom would be a good place to point them out (so that people who were like "what the hell?!" can have a small "aha!" moment).

** I use Author's Notes fairly frequently, and it's not really to explain what's gone on in the last chapter, but more of a chance to explain why I chose to do what I did. I'm aware that most people skip it, and that some people outright hate the idea of ANs, but it doesn't bother me that much. If someone doesn't like Author's Notes, then there's nothing forcing them to read it, and if the inclusion of ANs somehow sours someone's opinion on the rest of my fic, they can fuck off, I don't care.

I end up treating ANs a bit like Behind the Scenes features in movies and television: it'll tell those who are interested why something happened and why I decided to do it instead of something else, but (much like Behind the Scenes features) I know most people don't care, and they're absolutely welcome to skip it.

Edit: spelling.

** I use Author's Notes almost every chapter myself, but its not to answer reviews or explain the story; since I believe in letting a story explain itself; but more of like a little two lined message to my readers.

For example, I wrote a chapter about McGonagall in my Harry Potter fanfic. My AN was, "I found a picture of young McGonagall in the wiki while researching this chapter. Mind Blown." Another one was a little 3 word anagram I gave my readers to solve, to increase curiosity and intrigue in a mysterious plotline.

Most of my readers love those little bits, and have told me that it gets them more involved in the story.

Now, what I /definitely/ agree with you here is that I do hate it when writers try to explain why they did what they did in a chapter. That's a big /No-No/ for me. I also believe in not making reviewer replies in ANs. If the author feels that he desperately needs to answer some reviews publicly (usually wanting to respond to some Guest review's criticism) then he's welcome to make a new chapter after his last story chapter, title it "DO NOT NEED TO READ" in bold, italic and underline, and then post all his replies in it.

And don't even get me /started/ on those obnoxious middle of the chapter ANs!

** I also dislike AN's as an author.

I'll leave the reader with a little "Hope you liked it. See ya next chapter." because we are after all in a community, not in a bookshop.

But all my AN's together aren't even close to the wordcount of some of these obnoxious Reply AN's where the author explains his decisions to every single reviewer that asks. There is a PM function.

Long AN's are a warning sign for me. Especially those that explain decisions. The worst I have ever read was an AN that explained so much, the following chapters seized to make sense without reading the ANs.

** I dislike them immensely, for much the same reason as you. Worst is when the author is responding to reviews with them - there is a PM fuction. Almost as bad is when the author is trying to explain where their going with a story - the sort of thing the story itself should be able to convey.

*** You hate everything though, lol.

But on a serious note (ha) plot details/supplementary material outside the prose should be an immediate red flag for readers - not to mention the author themselves.

I just can't comprehend how you could write an essay as long as the chapter itself without thinking, "Maybe this could do with a re-write."

** When I'm writing, I'll only really include a brief note at the end of the first chapter to encourage criticism. After that, just to announce changes to the updating schedule or thank an editor/contributor. While reading, long notes tend to tick me off if the author's getting into arguments with commenters, or if they're using them as a platform for political rants.

** Never at the beginning of a chapter, always at the end. Not overly long, you shouldn't need to explain anything to your readers. If you do then you failed at your job as an author.

Mostly I use them to say something like "Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed. Let me know what you thought!"

Occasionally I'll add a "Sorry it took so long to update" if it was much longer than previous updates. Once I took a second to thank an anonymous reviewer who had written a very nice review.

But most authors notes should be short and sweet.

** For me, author's notes are basically the fanfiction equivalent of a foreword of a book. As such, I believe them to be best kept to the very beginning of the story, i.e. the beginning of the first chapter, or the entirety of a small first (“zeroth”, so to say) chapter, together with a disclaimer if one is used (a small tip for those unaware: one doesn't use a disclaimer to say “none of this is mine”, they are instead used to say “this-and-that” isn't mine and then claim that the rest is). If, for whatever reason, there is a need for the author to note something every single chapter, then it is better if they are instead added to the very end, as adding them to the beginning means they are skipped and adding them to the middle of the chapter means the whole story gets skipped; really though, considering that the system through which most people read fanfiction allows for looking back to the earlier chapters, if one needs to inform readers of new things as the story progresses it is best if there is a link to a separate document (a simple text file, optimally) with those at the beginning of the first chapter and then no author's notes in the subsequent chapters.

Because really, if one needs to converse with their readers then there's always creating your own forum for that, and if one needs to defend some choice of theirs then it probably isn't a good choice (and if they only /want/ to defend it then we go back to the forum bit)

** Quite a fun device is /fictional/ author's notes. /Johnathan Strange and Mr Norrell/ does this in bucket-loads, but it is an uncommon thing in mainstream fiction and fan-fic.

An author might do it if they're pretending to be the "editor" of the character's "memoirs", and they add footnotes to clarify some point, or add some background on another character. it's good if the main character is an unreliable narrator.

** I read a long AN the other day that was incredibly useful, because it was basically translating a bunch of acronyms/terms that Brits would get, but others wouldn't. Any time there's piece of the story that someone wouldn't get due to a cross-cultural misunderstanding/lack of knowledge, I think that's worthy of an AN. But I only thought of that because I just read an example the other day. In general, I agree with you!

** I use them mostly for review responses. Though sometimes to tell why I won't be posting for a while, and possibly when I'll post again. Yeah, there's a PM function. But, I don't know. Just feel like doing it I suppose. Some may think it tacky, but on my AGOT fic I'm getting reviews telling me thy think my review responses are nice! As odd as that seems. That said, I'm quick and to the point with them. Though on my HP fic, I did end up in a bit of a 'flame' war with a reviewer that for 5 chapters straight questioned me based on a humorous response to another reviewer, that response was taken straight out of the 'How it should have ended' video for Harry Potter.

** I hate those that use them to respond to reviews, unless its like a single particular flamer or shoutouts to some people that guessed something correctly.

In general I use them to explain where I've been when I take forever to update and almost never a full paragraph... I also think its usually ends up being word padding even in my own stories, but when I have 200-600k words before padding, I don't worry so much about an extra 200 words here and there.

Skip them, thats why they go before or after the chapter.

I COMPLETELY DESPISE authors notes in the middle of the chapter.
