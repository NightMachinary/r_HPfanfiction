By studying ancient magic, and looking at how the patronus charm works.

A wizard develops a spell that can block the avada kkedrva, break unbreakable curses, heal people who are on the brink of death.

For instance. By casting the spell when someone attacks you with an avada kedarva, a powerful shield blocks the spell. Similar to how Lily Potter protected Harry.

And it can clash with the killing curse, similar to when Harry's expellarimus clashed with Voldemort's Avada kedavra.

Since Avada Kedavra means "Let the thing be destroyed".

The spell could mean "Let the thing be protected".


** Yes and no. You'd need a pretty big downside to using it (eg. it permanently uses up part of your magical core/energy) because otherwise everyone would use it all the time, and thus the Killing Curse becomes irrelevant. Perhaps make it so that after 10 or so uses, it essentially renders you a squib. It needs to have a disincentive otherwise everyone would just use it immediately.

*** It could be difficult to master. Like the Expecto Patronum. Could that work?

**** Potentially. But remember, the “difficult to master” Patronus Charm was mastered by a group of student who were generally 15 or 16 years old. And that a 13 year old, albeit a very powerful one, casted it as well. Simply calling it “difficult to master” doesn't seem good enough to me. It has to have some physical disincentive to me.

***** Perhaps multiple uses of the spell can destroy the wand?

** Idk m8, sounds pretty broken.

You'll ruin the meta. It needs some heavy nerfs.

** As a downside maybe make it damage the wand? Like using this spell will for sure block the killing curse but now you've burned out the core and you have a smoldering stick

*** Oh yeah. The spell would be too powerful for normal wands. After multiple attempts, the spell would take a toll on your wand.
