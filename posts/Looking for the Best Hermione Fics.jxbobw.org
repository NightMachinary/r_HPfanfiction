  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire is great [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

​

Justice, Justice You Shall Pursue is another great White Squirrel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue]]

​

For the gang when they are broken, Stages of Hope is good [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

​

Witch Queen was one of the first fics I read with decent writing and it even recently got an update after a looong time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen]]

  Harry looked her up and down, marveling at how young /she/ seemed. He'd known, intellectually, that it would be like this. But Dumbledore and Hagrid, when they'd been alive, weren't that much older looking than they were now. Hermione, Destroyer of Europe, was /so small and cute/

** All these White Squirrel references, and no one has brought up linkffn(The Arithmancer) series? Admittedly the second book does lean a bit into Mary Sue territory, but even then it does a fair bit of interesting world building and exploration of the possibilities of the magic system. (And the first book is really great.)

Also, I found linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) interesting because of how firmly Hermione stays away from altering canon events (while still being very busy). She has been sent back with one job to do, and she's preparing to do it, whatever the cost. She really embraces her Slytherin side.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
