** Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais was my fav guilty read. Clichéd but fun.

*** Love those stories, but I really don't see them as clichéd. Quite the reverse, in fact.

** "Family Values" and "The Case of the Missing Wizard" Both by Ishtar, both spectacular cross-overs that maintain the integrity of each franchise, and (sadly) both not updated in some time (Family Values is likely dead.) If I had to pick the HP fics I want updates for the most, it's these two.

** I pretty much like all of them. Sunset/Sunrise by Bobmin I reread occasionally. Hate the disclaimers, but a good story.
