Hello! Well, with all the Britpicking posts floating around, I thought I'd post about something that irks me. I mean, it's not 'irritating' in the sense that I'll stop reading the fic, but if you really want to make your fic authentic... well, here are some tips.

- - people get homesick. A lot. I was sent to boarding school when I was 12 and my parents were divorcing. A massive amount of kids end up there because of that. Maybe include a few scenes with someone crying and a friend breaks into the kitchens for hot-chocolate? Or they're comforted by an older student. There's a lot of talking in the dorms because of this and a lot of bonding. I still talk to a lot of my former doormmates even though we live on different continents. You have a sort of love/hate relationship with most people at the end bc you've fought a lot, but you've also comforted each other a lot. You will probably know them better than their families do.
- - bullying. It's not classic bullying though, it's connected to tradition. You'll have things like older students forcing you out of bed in the middle of the night to play a trick on you and your roommates and it's a tradition that persists because it's been practiced for maybe a hundred years
- - fighting for first shower privileges
- - tutors or those who care for you, will use every situation to educate you as your parents aren't there to do it. For example, we were only allowed access to any kind of technology in the afternoon at ages 11-13 until a tutor had approved the state of our rooms. Yes, we had cleaners that came once a week, but we still had to do exactly the same things to keep it in a good state. Also, good education.
- - smoking for some reason. I don't know why this is such a big part of boarding school culture, but most boarders I know smoked in their last two years of school (at different schools too!).
- - Lots of smuggled-in alcohol (post 16/17 year olds) and 'legal' parties every weekend. Like this teachers feel like they can control casual party-goers.
- - lots and lots of boredom on the weekends. That Hogsmeade trip, believe me, is a HIGHLIGHT. Make sure the students show it. Also a school like Hogwarts depends on tradition so there will be weird competitions: annual chess competitions, maybe an annual flying competition over the lake where everyone tries to knock each other off?
- - Lots of cultural trips on the weekends to the theatre, museums, anything that would make parents happy to hear their child is doing.
- - CLUBS. these are an essential part of life. Debating, weather club, math club, cross country, theatre, musical theatre, any instrument, orchestra, choir, football, basketball, rugby, tennis, swimming, Latin club, film-making club, astronomy club(okay at Hogwarts this is redundant), etc. Go crazy with your clubs.
- - puberty when you're living with other people is awkward, but by year three-ish, you don't really care about who sees you in which state. Also lots of crushes around this age.
- - midnight raids. To the kitchen, to other houses, maybe for a dip in the lake
- - there's a lot of music and couple's dancing. I don't mean awkward slow-dancing, but actual rock n'roll dancing (no I am not 40. I am in my 20s). But music is generally blaring out of somewhere.
- - Head of house is really involved in your life. They'll psychoanalyse you a lot. But you end up kinda loving them like an aunt or uncle.
- - no one at the age of 11 cares about how wealthy someone else is. I only remember our financial backgrounds being important to like 5% of kids. And even then they were the douchy kind (see. Draco Malfoy). Intelligence and talent was rewarded and the social hierarchy was defined by how charismatic you were or how talented you were in something. For example, if you were really really good in one subject and could hold a charming conversation, maybe publicly weasel yourself out of some homework once or twice, you were set for the semester.
- - you definitely know everyone's name in the year above you and below you. If you're a seventh year, the first years will know your name even if you don't know their face.
- - boarding is a nightmare for an introvert. It's overwhelming and it's really too much to be around people so much. You have to learn to adapt, especially if you have to share a room with someone. There will be a lot of passive aggressive comments about how ‘you left the light on' or ‘there are hairs in the bathtub' or ‘please don't throw your books around' ‘that poster is dead-ugly' etc etc.
- - the school paper run by students. No one wants to write it, everyone wants to read it. I've never seen people give out 1€ coins quicker than on the day they'd sell it.

​

For now, I think that's it. I might add more if I think of more. But I hope if you read this far, it might inspire you to add some extra details like this into your fic. Make it interesting! Maybe have a few scenes where all of Hogwarts has a midnight raid activity that the professors don't know about, or something. In any case, stay safe, and goodbye!

Edit: my very first award of any sort. Thank you!!!

Edit: another two awards while I was asleep. Thank you so much! This post really blew up overnight. I hope it helps some of you ! :) it goes without saying that a lot of things I wrote couldn't be done at Hogwarts because of magic, but I think in most cases a wizarding alternative could be found. :))


** Former boarding school teacher here...

Yeah, you're right about most of that.

That being said, Hogwarts has a very...Dickensian vibe in the books. I guess wizarding Britain does, in general. I feel like it kind of makes the idea of a "plausible" Hogwarts difficult for me to envision since even the lowest possible number of students (~40/year x 7 years) would necessitate far more faculty and staff, especially when magic is considered.

The youth can not be trusted with plastic sporks, let alone magic wands and deadly curses.

**** Our school didn't have "houses," but we did have dorms. I lived on campus but not IN a dorm (thankfully), but I was in the dorms all the time and had kids in my home constantly. In fact, I have 4 former international students of mine staying with us because they can't get out of the country due to COVID.

So, yeah, I'd say we have a pretty close relationship. I have a lot of respect for kids and teens, so I treat them like people and that tends to create solid relationships...who would've thought...

And I was being facetious about the youths not being trusted with stuff; in general, they are better people than most adults I've met. But yeah, supervision is definitely necessary in a boarding school. The idea of only, what...like 10 teachers/facutly/staff to deal with ~200 magical teens (including 11-14 years)...no.

I enjoy some stories that mention the portraits and ghosts and such are used as aids to the faculty. That, plus "magic," is fair enough, in my eyes.

One memorable occasion was when a Freshman dropped acid and after a two hour long search in the dead of winter, our physics teacher found him naked in a snowbank and had to haul in his frostbitten ass over his shoulder.

Teenagers really, really need plenty of faculty around to keep an eye out, because they have a tendency to do dumb things.

** I can see wanting writers to be more accurate to boarding school life, but if they aren't following these suggestions I feel like they are more closely following canon. There aren't any clubs really mentioned except the 2nd year dueling club, SPEW and the DA. When the dueling club started it was a fairly big deal and then never mentioned again. If i read a story with lots of clubs I'm immediately aware this is a change from canon.

I do wish there was more about homesickness from say Hermione's POV as an only child she was likely doted on. Then she spends most of her vacations and Christmas breaks with the Weasley's. Always stuck me as odd.

These are great suggestions for someone to make a different Hogwarts experience! I am not a writer, but I'm sure this will help some people who are.

Second choice councillors were usually the heads of house (Hahahaha imagine a Slytherin coming to Snape with unrequited love issues) and if the situation was very extreme you could go to the school psychiatrist who had a vow of confidence. Or you could do confession (Catholic school for us so a few teachers were priests or nuns). I went to the school psychiatrist a few times because he was a genuinely kind person (think Lupin, but just at peace and comfortable in his own skin, a true priest) and he could help in some problems with friends or teachers. Last I heard, the Catholic Church moved him to his own church (Jesuit priests tend to move around every 7-10 years)

Not enough people who know to pass on the traditions, not enough kids to fight for shower space, not enough teachers for them to have time for the kids. The homesickness and smoking are probably still there. Of course from Harry's POV we don't see homesickness because he doesn't get it.

** Exceptionally good post.

I'd take some issue with the idea that nobody cares how wealthy you are. I think it's true of most schools early on but there comes a time when the poor kid is looked down on because they can't afford the latest stuff, and sometimes the rich kid will get extra cool points because they have all the nice gear. Certainly happened a bit at my (part-boarding) grammar school.

Apart from that though, I agree wholeheartedly with what you wrote. JKR hints at some of it: there are certainly clubs for instance, but there's nothing like the depth you describe.

Could be things like visiting a preserve (thinking of the dragon preserve in Romania, but there's probably one for some kind of creature in Great Britain) or touring the magical printing press of the Daily Prophet. Seeing stage performances put on or maybe some kind of classical music that is culturally important to wizards. There's historical sites associated with King Arthur, and since Merlin existed canonically they would probably consider those important to wizards too.

It would be really cool to write about something like Kew Gardens, but the magical version- or maybe its the same as the muggle garden but there's hidden magical areas among the muggle displays? Sort of like how Diagon Alley is hidden in London, they could have a magical garden hidden in a muggle one.

**** We know that there are 8 gryffindors in Harry's year (Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Hermione, Pavarti, and Lavender). We also know there are 9 Slytherins (Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Blaize, Nott, Pansy, Daphne, Tracy, Millicent).

Lets be a tad generous and assume 10 people per house per year, so 40 students per year. If we assume all British magicals go to Hogwarts, that means 40 witches/wizards are born each year.

Now, it does seem like magicals have longer lifespans (see Dumbledore), so lets assume everyone lives to 100 (this obviously isn't the case, the first war was described as taking a massive toll). That's still only 4000 people in the entire British wizarding world (not counting squibs and non-human beings, of course, but for the most part they seem to stick to themselves).

It is fair to say that the scope of what we see in the wizarding world does not match a total population of only 4000. My headcannon is that wizarding birthrates are falling and anemic, making the wizarding world disproportionately old (and therefore conservative) and larger in population than the number of school age children there are would suggest.

In a healthy society, large majority of people will have siblings. Replacement is 2 children per family. In a hypothetical world where a third of people had three children, a third had 2 children, and a third have one child, only one sixth of children born would be an only child. It certainly /seems/ like the wizarding world has a disproportionately large number of only children. But its difficult to tell if this is the case simply because we don't know if most students we encounter don't have siblings, or they do and its just not mentioned.

We also know the Great Hall doesn't adjust over the christmas break, I remember them pushing tables to the walls and setting up a new, small one for the staff and the few students, and we know freshly sorted students pick their places wherever there is room with no mention of anything growing for them.

I feel like that's just one of those things Hatsune Miku didn't plan out in detail when she wrote the books. If there is only one school it /has to/ grow and shrink with the population, if the population isn't stable for 1000 years.. which it probably wasn't.

Are there any references to a different classroom size in the smaller newt classes? I can't really remember.

It seems more likely that the birth rate would have been affected for most years at Hogwarts though - Voldemort put the curse on Hogwarts in around 1959, so it seems likely that somewhere between 1960 and early 1970s his rise to power took place.

So, it seems to me that between would-be parents, entire families murdered and muggle born parents pulling their children out of school - there should be a decreased number of children reaching Hogwarts age both sides of Harry joining the war. If I was to take a guess, I would say that Bill's year should have been larger than Harry's.

On the other hand, we know that not all British children (plus at least some Northern Irish/Irish students) Hogwarts. How many, we can't be sure.

****** Wars don't depress the birth rate that much. In real world Britain in WW2, for example, the birth-rate *went up* despite so many men in their prime breeding years being away from home for so much of the time.

1935: 711,426 live births

1936: 720,129

1937: 723,779

1938: 735,573

1939: 726,632 ("phony war" starts in September)

1940: 701,875

1941: 695,726

1942: 771,851

1943: 810,524

1944: 878,298

1945: 795,868 (war ends in May in Europe)

Note that 1940 and 41, the peak years of German bombing of British cities, are markedly low, but even then the drop from 1939 to 40 is only about 3%. Comparing with Germany, where there was far more devastation, is tricky, as the birth rate was artificially inflated by pre-war Nazi policies, but even there the fertility rate only dropped by about 12% from 1940 to 45.

***** I also have this headcanon and find support for it in the text based on the number of empty classrooms that are always around, the mention of a "Charms corridor," and another mention of a "Transfiguration department." What I gather from this is that Hogwarts used to have many more students, necessitating the use of more classrooms (enough to occupy a whole corridor for Charms instead of just a classroom and office), and more professors to accommodate them (a whole Transfiguration department).

Since we have evidence that around the 50s-60s there is only one professor per subject (Dumbledore is /the/ Transfiguration professor, etc), populations must have been in decline for at least a generation or two. Thus, it can't just be due to Grindelwald's/Voldemort's wars, as is often posited (though I'm sure that helped). It's probably due to some Pureblood bullshit, but it's fun when people play with this idea in stories.

It's what I choose to believe. But we never hear about those, since it seems everyone who matters went to Hogwarts.

I think having a 1000 students would be abit hard, since you only have 4 houses so 250 per house(IF they are marginally equal) and then 36 per year, so most classes have on average 70 students, which is a college class size. Still too big for supervising children doing dangerous stuff.

I think 500-700 is more manageable with 125-175 per house, with 18-25 per year and then we have 36-50 per class, MUCH more manageable, if a bit hard logistically, but then, /magic/ (Maybe they have magical ways of grading essays, or make their exams mostly multiple choice that can be corrected and graded automagically).

And with this and if every kid goes Hogwarts, ignoring those that go abroad, and applying UK demographics of kids 10-17 being around 10-12% of the population, we have something like 5000-7000 magicals in Britain.

Which makes me think Ilvermorny if it's the only one, must be HUGE.

I think it's far easier to assume a logical population, estimate student numbers from logic, and then we go on from there. JK always, always said she wasn't good with numbers, it's not fair to fanfic authors to hold stuff against them that not even the author held against herself when writing her work.

HP is inconsistent as hell and nitpicking stuff that's not important doesn't help anyone, what if the guy wants there to be 20k wizards? What would that change if "it's not canon"?

******* Yeah, they would, but at the core the problem is that it would have to be something they would notice. The different kinds of fabric is something you can't expect an average eleven years-old to be able to perceive by sight.

This arguments are generally more along the line of not letting the kids go to school using clothes that could either offend or distract the others, as a way of demonstrating to people from outside the school where they study (more so at official events, but some really take the whole school-peide thing too serious) and as an easy way for the teachers to differentiate between their students and outsiders (I think there are also some who argument about discipline and feeling of belonging to the group, but honestly, never took this ones seriously).

And besides, this is mostly beyond the point, my argument was that eleven years-old kids normally won't give someone popularity points just for having clothes made of a more expensive fabric, not discriminating against kids with bad clothes. This is mostly corroborate because of the fact that unless this is a school unrealistically elitist the norm would be that the majority, including the would-be-bully, wouldn't have clothes made from that kind of fabric (at least not for day-to-day wear.

I guess in the case of bad clothes, depending of the damage, it would be impossible not to notice (tears, discoloring, stains...) and this of course could be taken as an excuse for bullying, though I still say that they wouldn't be able to see the difference if it's only something like the kind of fabric being of low quality or it being a size too big.

I can't imagine any of my classmates acting like some of the characters do but that might be a matter of circumstance.

** Just out of curiosity, on the point about people not caring about money: I'm curious where you personally fall on the economic spectrum. I think if you had money you probably thought no one cared about money, but if you didn't have money, you might see it differently. For example, people making fun of your clothes, or your teeth, or being on the outside of an inside joke from the ski trip you couldn't go on. No one's going to make fun of you the way Draco does, mostly, but being the butt of these jokes and being left out of the expensive stuff might still make you less popular.

I went to a ritzy private school (not boarding though) where the white kids would tell you everyone was super not racist, but a /lot/ of stuff is coming out now and turns out ... surprise! the school is super racist. I bet people would tell you that no one cared about money at my school, but as someone who had less of it, they definitely did.

** A good write up, I must say. I attended an all-boys Christian school, which is quite similar and it uses the same ground as a boarding school did. While you could stay there, and I did many times, most simply went home. A lot of your points are good, a lot of them depend on the people as a whole.

For example, there was one kid who had no home to go back to, so he was never sick, and he was a fulltime boarder. As I said above, all-boys, so no one would cry if they felt homesick, even if they were twelve. They either dealt with it or discretely went to a teacher. There was no asking friends for help because it was all fickle. While I talk to them off and on now, they admit they missed home, but when they were twelve, they hated their parents and they were /fine/.

Bullying, I agree, was very common. I was attending the school on a scholarship, which was announced when I started, so I was a poor kid in the middle of the rich kids. Fagging was still a common practice, just not called fagging and it was toned down slightly. Yeah, a senior would still wake you up at five in the morning to dress them, carry their stuff around, I missed a lot of that experience as I became good friends with the senior that ‘adopted' me. We both played RuneScape, so we bonded over that.

For me, there were enough showers to go around, so no one fought. I mean, two kids did once punch each other because they thought they were looking at each other.

Only a select few actually smoked, most avoided it like the plague as it clung to clothes. Smoking was also a quick way to get kicked out. Same with alcohol. It was done, but not commonly. Christian school, it was a guaranteed expulsion.

I can assure you, many boys remained fearful of other people seeing them naked. There were a few that flaunted what they had, but many were still shy about it. Some bragged, others did not. This is one that heavily depends on the characters. As such, gay people tended to be shyer with it, but one was quite open.

A month of detention was not worth a late night snack. Most stocked up on snacks and hid them away.

Oh no, people flaunted their money quite often. Who got the most pocket money, who had the better clothes, and who had the better phone were all common arguments. Private school and therefore, whoever ad the most money, was king.

I only knew like two people below me and a few above me. Those not in my social circle were not relevant. But, I agree, everyone mostly knew everyone. It was small enough that you could pick out a face.

I was an introvert, but I was left alone. I preferred it over public school, which was where I was forced to be with other people.

No student paper, either. It was done by the teachers.

** Several extra thoughts from my boarding school days.

1. Food in the rooms. Sure there are the kitchens at Hogwarts, but that's far away from the dorms (outside Hufflepuff). Most of us had small fridges in our rooms to keep drinks and food. We would heat up canned or packaged food to eat as a late-night snack or get food delivered to the dorm. I'm surprised there isn't a magical equivalent of Ubereats in fanfiction.

2. There were degrees of privileges you could earn if you didn't get in trouble, like being able to stay out past curfew for a concert, having a friend who doesn't attend the school stay over in your room, or being able to go home outside a set home visit weekend.

3. There were always a few students who didn't do well and went home. Some couldn't handle the academics. Others were homesick, or didn't like the subjects that were required. You could imagine a muggleborn who couldn't adjust, or someone transferring to a school that better fits their interests (say, a student interested in magical art).

4. Even with Dumbledore's second chances philosophy, I have to believe some students get expelled each year. At my school, being caught with drugs or alcohol was automatic dismissal. Poor academics also got you sent home.

5. Being independent was such a novel thing. We used to love wandering around the campus until curfew just because we could.

6. As students, we were always organizing activities, like school dances in the dorm common room, volunteering, talent shows, and the like.

7. Sometimes you would miss a favorite food from home, which is where having a kitchen in the dorm was great. Friends would hit the grocery store, then cook a meal together. Or sometimes students would cook something to sell as a fundraiser for a student group.

For example, when I read a Harry Potter fanfic, I can tell right away if it is a Brit writing it or an American writing it (not just British English vs American English) based on how describe things in the muggle United Kingdom when there are Americanized terms like referring to Primary School as Elementary School or describing stuff that is not to the setting ($ instead of £). This is because most American fanfic writers have never experienced the UK or know the proper terms, culture, ect.

That is when you research, even if it has nothing to do with writing. I learned some about British Schools watching Educating Essex, and dug deeper to learn more about comprehensive schools in the UK. I also have watched documentaries on boarding schools like Harrow School. Every school is different in culture, who attends and their families, the way it is run, what direction the school governors or headteacher envision, ect. whether boarding, state school, or any school. Not every muggle comprehensive school is like Passmores Academy (with a great headteacher like Vic Goddard), just like not every boarding school is like Eton (or Hogwarts).

This holds true with Boarding Schools. Most fanfiction authors have never been to a boarding school, so they cannot be expected to know what it is like to attend them. I know I never did. I went to a day Roman Catholic private high school in America. Some go to ordinary schools and only encounter boarding schools in the movies or games like Bully.

I think that these resources for fanfiction authors to refer to so as to help get an authentic feel is great. If they don't want to use them they dont have to, but they are there. Just like the guide for American authors to understand the setting and culture of the Muggle United Kingdom, because when I first was talking about the UK I was referring to London (a city) as synonymous as the whole UK. That is as bad as calling someone from Scotland English. You can learn a lot trying to get these things accurate and it may spark an interest in something outside HP fanfiction.

But I'm sure the boarding school thing can be explained by some people as Hogwarts having a different culture being in the wizarding world as opposed to schools like Eton, Harrow, and boarding schools of that nature. But one comment stuck with me: " Head of house is really involved in your life. They'll psychoanalyse you a lot. But you end up kinda loving them like an aunt or uncle. " You will never see Professor McGonagall doing that, she just does not have the time as professor of Transfiguration, Head of House for Gryffindor, and as Deputy Headmistress plus whatever else Dumbledore piles in her inbox when he is doing his other two jobs outside school. You have at minimum of two sections per yer year (2 houses per section) Years 1-5, and 1 section per year Years 6-7 in the core classes. Depending on how many classes per section per teacher per week, it adds up fast. This is before lesson planning, grading, meetings, setting up for classes involving spell work and before Head of House duties for Heads of Houses. All of this is before even McGongall's Deputy Headteacher duties (I noticed that Dumbledore has the Head of House have the ultimate say in punishment before him and does not factor McGonagall in as a last step before Dumbledore possibly in recognition of her workload).

All in all, these are great tips and a great resource for Boarding School life that will help fanfic authors. Even if they are not essential to the story, but subtlety in the background, it can help put more life into the story and when adapted for the wizarding world enrichen it. I would rather read one fanfic with an authentic setting, culture, ect. than 10 lemons or harem stories. But to each there own.

Thank you.

** > Lots of smuggled-in alcohol (post 16/17 year olds)

Post 16/17? What kind of weird up-tight school did you go to? My school had a bar for the 6th form in a vain attempt to prevent them bringing drink in! We still did of course, both for our own consumption and that of the younger children. Ahhh, good memories of selling watered down vodka in badly-resealed bottles!

And the reason most people don't write about what real boarding school life is like is either ignorance, or for those of us who do know it, because it wouldn't be very interesting. Who the fuck wants to read about childrens' "fights for first shower priveleges"?

** I went to a normal secondary school with the option of staying for the weeknd in London. It is exactly like you mentioned, currently Hogwarts feels so bare bones.

Where are the fights between kids that just wanna be popular, the rule breaking and stupid ideas.

** Marauder era fics like "The Life and Times" show boarding school life the way you describe, including the smoking, partying, music, clubs, dorm life etc. Sad that it's abandoned.
