** As I was scrolling down I read this as "werewolf coutre" and thought yes, clothing that doesn't shred when one transforms, makes sense that someone would fill that market niche.

Or maybe someone trying to make wolfsbaned werewolves less scary by putting bandanas or dog clothing on them.

Or someone making Greyback into a pair of ugg boots.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Weres Harry) Summer after Fourth Year, Harry goes to the werewolves annual gathering because he is recognized as a pack leader. Winds up challenging Fenrir Greyback to a duel to the death, and Greyback made the mistake of underestimating the first Skin-changer in centuries. He also meets a pack of werewolves who are trying to break the curse via breeding. (They managed to get born werewolves who don't need Wolfsbane Potion to retain their minds.)

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) touches on werewolf culture. Not a huge amount, but it is a background thing, and it does lead to an important plot point.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
