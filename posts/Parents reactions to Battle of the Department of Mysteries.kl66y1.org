Hi!

I was wondering if there is any good fanfictions about parents/guardian's reactions about their kids breaking into the Ministry to save Sirius. I read Proud(about Augusta and Neville), but I was wondering if there are other ones. It can be about Molly and Arthur talking to Ron and Ginny, Xeno to Luna, or Augusta to Neville, or any mix of it.


** Neville's parents would have given him candy

** Also interested in the general aftermath, realizing just how bad Fudge fucked up the last year, realizing that the Prophet is fundamentally untrustworthy, etc.

**** "Ah shure look." and nothing else.

Irish moms are like that.

*** The ministry promptly pinner everything on Fudge and Umbridge, fired them both and got on with things.

Somehow the Prophet still remained popular and trusted, presumably by virtue of whatever dark magic convinced people before, after all Skeeter was famous for blatant lies and just about everyone believed her articles in GoF.
