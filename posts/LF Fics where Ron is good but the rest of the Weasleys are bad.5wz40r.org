Much like where the twins are the only "good" Weasleys, in that they are the only ones who side with Harry, I'm curious if there are fics where all the Weasleys but Ron get bashed in a story.

Slash, bashing of other characters, crossovers and dark!harry is fine. Please no harems, mpreg, romance/smut-driven plot, pottercest or genderbending. Thank you!
