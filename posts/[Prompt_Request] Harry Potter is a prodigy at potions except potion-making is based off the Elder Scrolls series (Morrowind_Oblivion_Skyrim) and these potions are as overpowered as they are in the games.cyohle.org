In Morrowind, you can make potions to improve your ability to make potions thereby having an exponential increase in that ability. After that, any potion you make has game-breaking levels of effectiveness.

I want to see that kind of abuse of potions in the HP world. This would likely be a crack fic but anything is fine.

  Lily Potter never actually saved her son's life. No, Hermaeus Mora did it for her, at a price. The witch ended up in Apocrypha and Harry became a new dimensional anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge now standing on his shoulder. Poor, poor Wizardry World.

** "What on earth do you think you are doing, Potter?"

*munch munch*\\
"Figuring out what this aconite does, sir."

"Fine."\\
Because honestly, there was simply nothing Severus Snape could or would do. Maybe it paid to have someone to be an example so the little dunderheads would understand why you never eat or drink in a potions lab. It being Harry the bloody Potter was more than fine for him. Just how did they become more idiotic each year, that was a mystery.

“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

"One moment sir," said Harry as he dug out his ingredients bag, pulled out a stalk of asphodel and started munching.

"Potter, what are you doing?" The look on Snape's face was indecipherable.

"I just need to eat 400 more of these and then I'll be able to tell you precisely what it does, sir..."

**** I had big difficulty imagining just what kind of reaction it would be possible to have when someone just decides to start eating the ingredients. I imagine Snape freezing totally including thoughts and then that would be the rational explanation afterwards. Because what on earth did just happen? It would be too bizarre for bezoar reflexes to work.

** The Diadem vanished. Before the horrified onlookers could say anything, Harry immediately placed the mundane faux-locket that Regulus Black had left for Voldemort onto the enchanting table, along with one of the cheap soul gems Harry had filled by going on a boggart-busting spree, making sure to cast Soul Trap on each of them.

"Now, look," Harry said, as he hefted the newly magical locket. "It buffs my enchantment ability. All I have to do is find something that aids in Restoration and turn myself into a vampire, and I can get the Resto loop going for real. Sure, it's not as pretty as a Morrowind potion loop, but Skyrim's magic system can break, too!"
