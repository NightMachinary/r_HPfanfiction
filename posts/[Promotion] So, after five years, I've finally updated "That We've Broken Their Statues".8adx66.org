I'm really, really proud of myself for this. I started this Labyrinth/HP crossover back in /2013/ and I am finally a single chapter from the end, with plenty of ideas for what comes next. No idea what bizarre chain of events woke up the dormant "Broken Statues" part of my brain, but, hey, two chapters in two weeks.

I'm aware that "Broken Statues," at least, is somewhat prone to Stations of the Canon, but Rowling's carefully constructed plot will really derail in later installments.

** I've gotta say, I'm interested in "new person discovers the wizarding world" fics, is it necessary to know Labyrinth before reading this?

*** I think it is pretty necessary to know Labyrinth regardless of the fic in question. Really, it's soo awesome

*** It would provide a crapton of context, since the fic is from the Labyrinth character's POV. But Labyrinth is a 90 minute movie from 1986 and has a TVTropes page, so context shouldn't be that hard to get.

  Sarah Williams stumbles into the Leaky Cauldron. She stumbles back out again with a Gringotts account she didn't start, a part time job at Hogwarts, and an awkward truce with the Goblin King.
