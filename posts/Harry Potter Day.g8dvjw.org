Ok, so, in the very first chapter of the first book, McGonagall says that she wouldn't be surprised if Halloween was known as 'Harry Potter Day' in the future. Well, what if that came to pass? Imagine how much more awkward Harry's time at Hogwarts would be if there was a whole day dedicated to him!


** If I were Harry I would hate the day even more considering this is the day his parents died and now the whole wizarding world celebrates this day every year

** Happens in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) and Harry and his caretakers have to dance around it, when they want to memorialise death of his parents.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** I had a thought similar to this while I was reading the Cursed Child. There's a joke in the dark reality that it's "Voldemort Day"
