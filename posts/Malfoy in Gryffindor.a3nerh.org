Are there any fics were Draco is sorted into Gryffindor?

Without it being parody/crack fic and „it was a dream” pseudo-twist. Also no Dramione.


** Here's my post from a few months ago. Got a few good recs.

My contribution is linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7). Gryffindor!Draco with an Irish twin in slytherin, Hydrus. The fic is long, and Draco only one subplot of many, but I really think it's the best part of the fic.

*** It's on its fourth(?) book by now, so there's plenty to read. It's also still updated regularly. I'm enjoying the fic.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** I read this a while ago: linkffn(Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone)

Do not read if you dislike Drarry. This fic itself isn't Drarry, but following fics in the series hints at it.

  This is it. This is the end of it all. Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end. This is just the beginning. (Time Travel AU)
