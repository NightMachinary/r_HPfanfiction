The final battle at hogwarts goes differently with voldemort deciding to siege out the castle instead of attacking it out right afterall what did voldemort care how long it takes the castle to be sieged he is immortal anyway.

decades later and siege is still going on while a growing population lives inside the now isolated castle of hogwarts.

Death eaters have now built intense fortifications around the area of hogwarts to keep the inhabits inside inside the castle. meanwhile, the citizens of Hogwarts dig deeper into the earth to expand the castle to provide room for the growing population.

Head minister Ronald weasley, lays dying in bed of old age worried that his death and the politicing afterwards will lead the nation of hogwarts to ruin


** Harry too is worried, as he knows that according to the prophecy he must be the one to defeat Voldemort. They begin a final offensive to push out of hogwarts and attack Voldemort directly as it is their only chance at defeating him. However, this will not be an easy task for Voldemort has had decades to build up an inferi army and had prepared his inner circle members for the possibility of a last stand. The citizens of hogwarts know this but they have no choice, for if they don't take the fight to him and Harry dies of old age, all is lost.

*** Head minister Ron was against the final push.

he had spend his decades as head of the hogwarts goverment making sure hogwarts would be just as tough for the death eaters to push into.

so it would basically be a stalemate.

Harry's eldest son, arthur potter was very close to his uncle ronald and served as his minister of defense for several decades.

Ronald knows with his death, the pro war faction would gain the power needed to swing the balance of power.

Harry potter was actually against the push for decades himself it was only after the death of his wife that he changed his mind and decided to commit to the pro war party fully
