**** I was bored during alot of it, I didn't hate it but he seemed so much nicer it was disconcerting, then other things that might just be my memory but also spoiler territory

>! The dad isn't on the boat but instead kidnapped by opal and is rescued in the end, his hair is brown and that's probably canon but it took me out in alot of places, holly was in her cell for like half a day, and theres no wine cellar scene which disappointed me greatly but isn't a problem really !<

** I seem to recall the reverse of this once. Riddle got ahold of Lockhart and obliviated him. As part of his recovery, he gained the skills he always claimed he had. Was quite a fun red herring. No idea where I read it though, sorry.

*** I do recall a story like that... "Not another redhead" was it's title, I think? (not sure) Anyway Harry is a redhead here (got more from Lily than the eyes), gets adopted by the Weasley and goes on crazy adventures. There were even spinoffs of Lockhart's adventures, eventually.

**** "Like a Redheaded Stepchild" is also similar. Harry and Hermione (and Luna kinda) are adopted by the Weasleys and defeat Quirrell but Voldemort is still attached to him. Quirrell is obsessed with Lockhart and so they seek him out and obliviate him I think and it makes him actually competent

** Here's the truth - I don't know how I got here.

They say my name is Gilderoy Lockhart; Order of Merlin, Third Class; Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League; five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award and all that.

You know, even if I didn't.

But I've read my books, because who wouldn't if they had woken up in their own blood with no memories. Was I attacked? Did I do it myself? Am I even me? At this point, does it even matter?

All things I had hoped my biographies might have answered. But no, they're a pile of garbage. Crossing over dates, erratic inconsistencies. I don't think they can be anything but fakes. The world believes them, though, and you don't know how scared I am that one day someone will need to me do something, help them or protect them. And I won't be able to, amnesiac fraud that I am.

That's why I took this job. I could fake my skills to children, teach them some basics and then take a sabbatical. And Dumbledore would be here the whole time. Safest place in Britian, they call this castle. More fool me, I suppose.

And yet for all of my lack of skills, sometimes I wonder. You saw me during the duel with Snape. I let him hit me. You frown, but when I saw him begin to cast I knew I could dodge it. Somehow, I knew. It's happened before - when I don't think, just act I can move faster, cast better.

Just like somehow I knew enough to track the beast down. The spiders, the water on the floor, the ghost. Although I can't have been that good if two second years also came to the same conclusions.

I won't lie to you two boys that I'm not scared. I am. But you need to stay here, and get help. I'm going after your sister, and I will not let more students be hurt on my watch.

It's time to have faith in myself.

** One problem with this concept is that if Lockhart's books were taken at face value, he was to fighting the Dark Creatures and Dark Magic in general what Dumbledore and Flamel were to the academia. It would be a truly insidious plot which could fell such a man, such a hero, such a warrior! Think Moody, but so good that he avoided so much as getting his hair ruffled where Moody lost extermities.

â€‹

Imagine his Witch Weekly award in this light:

#1: Spends his life fighting the worst Magic can throw at him.

#2: He regularly wrestles dark creatures and had all manner of disfiguring and vile sorcery flung at him.

#3: He can still win beauty contests.

** The Unspeakable following Lockhart would have let him keep his memories, but he blabbed to Lovegood, and suddenly there was a deluge of mail from fringe groups about the need to take down the Rotfang Conspiracy. That was the last thing needed when they were so close to success, all that was needed was to get Barty in position, and they would be victorious.
