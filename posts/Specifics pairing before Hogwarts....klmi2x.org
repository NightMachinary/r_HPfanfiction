I always find it weird that Hermione who supposedly lived in Crawley, met harry who lived in Surrey in many fics before Hogwarts, or like they went to same school or was connected through any means. There are almost 10 other students named in Canon who definitely lived in UK but I see this as a common theme where harry meets Hermione, accidentally transports to her home, know her in school or just these things. Is it common in UK for underage school children to meet children from that far away or do it feel forced in some fics ?


** My city has a population of 29k, it takes roughly 20mins to walk from one edge to the opposite. I spent most of my childhood outside, all over the city. The majority of my high school classmates, I met for the first time in high school despite some of them literally living on the same street. The odds of Harry naturally meeting Hermione before Hogwarts would be abysmal even if she lived in Surrey.

** I mean, in terms of the arse pulls fanfiction makes sometimes, this is far from the worst.

"It's a small world" is a popular saying for a reason, I'm sure you've seen the story about the couple who appear in each others photos at Disney about 20 years before they got married.

Granted, generally this trope is indicative of lazy writing, but that doesn't mean it's inherently bad.

** it's forced pretty much all the time. As a British person, there was no instance of me or any other student at any of the schools I went to meeting children from far away that weren't actually family at family events or whatnot.

It's always forced, and always for that precious Harry/Hermione pairing that is always the same rehashed and boring garbage with the same parents (Dan and Emma Granger, I wonder which actors in HP have those first names?), the same weasley bashing, the same super Hermione with no flaws and the same boring ending.

There is quite a few fics I liked, but stopped liking when Hermione got shoehorned in as a girl Harry met before Hogwarts, or just got with despite never even going to Hogwarts.

But to be honest, there have been instances of Harry knowing other students before the books - Dean, Seamus, the Patils ... but it's usually just something mentioned. Considering the size of the UK comparing to population and how many muggleborn students would be in Hogwarts at the same time as Harry however it makes it unlikely he would run into any of them beforehand, at most maybe 1 (or 2 if the one he runs into is the Patil Twins).

*** You really must be pissed when Harry goes to France and "runs into" the Delacours...

But yeah, nobody doing this cares much for accountability. I'd wager most of us couldn't find the UK on a map without Google, let alone Crawley and/or Surrey.

**** Technically I'd say there's more chance of Harry running into the Delacours, or any other wizarding family, then into Hermione. Granted the chance of it is still abysmally low, but they have magic in common - and if Magical Britain is anything to go by, wizards tend to have a central 'hub' where all the commerce happens, so it's /slightly/ possible for him to meet Fleur, or Ron, or Draco. However, outside of Ron or Ginny wanting to meet the Boy Who Lived, there would be flat zero reason for them to actually interact.

**** The Delacour one is also annoying, although I dont dislike it as much because it isnt as common and features characters I like more (I seriously dislike Hermione).
