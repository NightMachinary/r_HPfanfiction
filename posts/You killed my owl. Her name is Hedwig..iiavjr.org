*** The times were dark and the unspoken question eagerly waiting on the lips of nearly every witch, wizard, and denizen of the magical world was: "Where is Harry Potter?"

Undersirable Number One had been missing for about a year, now, but for most it felt like forever. The Dark Lord had taken over, muggle-borns were in hiding, wands were being confiscated like poisoned candy and camps were being erected, filled, and cleared out on a seemingly daily basis.

Severus Snape could not say he enjoyed his new reality under the oppression of the Dark Lord. At the very least, though, he didn't have to teach dunderheads under Dumbledore's saccharine world view. What a fool. For all his brilliance, Dumbledore managed to get himself cursed and killed to engender a mere boy to a plot he was not equipped to handle and likely did not want, given his absence. The former Potions Professor made his daily rounds, hexing students into submission and quelling the Carrow twins of their more... corporal punishments. Someone had to hold things together, and Snape couldn't afford to let things get /too/ carried away.

At the same time, he was lost to a purpose since Dumbledore's death. The Potter boy had made no moves, made no contact for nearly a year. There were rumors and meetings and conversations, but it was all speculation. The boy had essentially dropped off the map. Snape made his rounds, and tiredly escaped sometime after curfew to the Headmaster's office to turn in for the evening.

Severus' favorite drip coffee was just finishing brewing as he entered the cozy lounge. Gone were the old ticking, whirring gizmos that Dumbledore had been so fond of, replaced by alchemy equipment and scrutinously labeled ingredients. It made Snape feel comfortable; the order of arrangement amidst so much chaos. The elves had even left a dish of leftover roast potatoes, beef and wine sauce, with an accompanying note. How thoughtful.

Severus tuckered in while reading the note: "Special thanks for all you've done." That was odd. The elves were practically illiterate, their grammar and grasp of the English language a far cry from their cooking ability. At least the food was good. Severus sipped his coffee and pondered world events for a moment, but as he sipped, the hair on his neck stood on end.

Snape whirled around, out of his chair, wand in hand, occlumency shields up. The corner was empty.

"I sense you. Show yourself, assassin!" A hundred curses raced through Severus' mind, ready to duel, to fight, to defend himself, to kill.

"I wish things had happened differently, /Professor/."

"Potter..."

"Are you going to call your Death Eater friends?"

"Not if you reveal yourself this instant!" Snape whirled again, toward the direction of the voice, but he sensed it moving. His magic and senses were heightened, his heart was racing.

"Death Eaters..." the boy said, almost dismissively. "You really are nothing without Voldemort, are you?"

"You've sealed your fate, Potter. Speak his name and he shall appear."

"Not here. Not at Hogwarts. I've made sure of that."

"Is that why you are here? Seeking refuge? I could have been an ally to you, you know. Dumbledore practically guaranteed it."

"I'm not Dumbledore. I'm not following his plan."

"Then what are you doing? Why are you here?"

"Taking care of loose ends. Removing those who have done me wrong. Finally taking my life in my own hands, essentially."

"Brave words uttered from under an invisibility cloak!"

Harry Potter materialized to Snape's left, a split image of James, except of course for one haunting feature. "I don't need a cloak to become invisible," the boy said, in what sounded almost like a mocking impression of Albus himself. "Also, it's already done."

Snape's heart was racing faster and faster. Anxiety was getting the better of him, and now, the sight of The Boy Who Lived, Undesirable Number One, Harry Potter, was putting him through the ringer. Snape was paralyzed with indecision, fear, anxiety. What was wrong with him?

"Why are you here?"

"It's already done." The boy shrugged. "Figured it was poetic. Hermione's idea, naturally. I'd have just hit you with a curse and be done with it."

"What..." Snape realized, now, that he'd been poisoned. He fished through his robe's pockets for a bezoar, recounting the symptoms and likely cause, his eyes darting to various ingredients hoping for inspiration. "WHAT?!"

The boy smirked. "It's a muggle poison. Bezoar won't save you. Nothing can, I'm afraid, except for maybe a coma, a respirator, and another hundred years of muggle medical advancements."

"How--?" Severus practically croaked. His throat was closing up. His heart wouldn't stop POUNDING in his chest.

"No one seems to put stock in the help. The elves. Their faces lit up when they saw me. 'Harry Potter sir is back! We is saved, sir! Oh bless mister Harry Potter!' Very easy to ask favors when you're loved rather than feared."

Severus doubled over, trying to puke, but his throat and airways were closing up. His stomach churned and his heart was on fire. He couldn't swallow, or breathe, or do much of anything.

"Like I said. A cutting curse would have done the job nicely. I don't like seeing you, or anyone, really, in pain, /Professor/, but it's done. People keep asking when I'm coming back. Well, now, I guess I am. There's going to be a reckoning, /Severus/."

Severus Snape fell to the floor, writhing in anguish. He couldn't get a spell off to save his life. The boy stood over him, wand drawn.

"That was for Hedwig, you son of a bitch."

The dull recollection of a snowy owl exploding in a bright green blast past through Severus' mind as darkness greeted him. His last thoughts bordered on pride for the boy. He was seeing the owl's death from Harry's perspective.

"So it is." Severus tried to say, but he was already gone, somewhere else.

** "SNAPPPEEE!" Harry yelled furiously as he stormed towards the greasy haired potions professor.

"What do you want, you nasty brat?" Snape snapped, sneering at Harry.

"How dare you fucking kill Hedwig! You killed my owl!" Harry shouted, wanting to give the greasy git a good punch to the face.

"Oh that annoying white ball of fur? She was in my way, her death means nothing" Snape remarked coldly.

"You-!" Harry started, raising his fist to slap his most hated professor in the face, but was restrained by Ron and Hermione.

"Let go!" Harry shouted sharply at his friends, wrenching his arms from their grasp. "This bastard killed my Hedwig! My only companion, she kept me sane!"

Snape smirked, but at the moment all the fury and emotions bottled up inside Harry erupted. In a fit of anger, Harry pushed Ron and Hermione away and striked a sickening crunch to the side of Snape's face.

The force of the punch was enough to cause Snape to stagger backwards. Snape looked up to see the glowing angry green eyes of Harry just in time before he was knocked out by another punch to the noggin.

Everyone stared in shock and awe at the crumpled form of Snape on the floor, sporting a bloodied up face and a black eye.

"Bloody hell Harry, he looked like he must have pissed his pants" Ron commented. There was a large stain forming on Snape's trousers, which looked suspiciously like urine.

*** Snape then raised his face with a devilish smile, "Look... At me..." He said.

Then before everyone's eyes Snape transformed. His body became smaller and his black cape whiter. At the end they were looking at a small white animal before them.

Everyone was stunned.

Severus Snape was an animagus. He was Hedwig all along.

**** It's actually unknown, though it most likely was neither Snape nor Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.
#+end_quote

I usually hate the "it's fanfiction" argument, but this was a deliberate divergence from canon. The prompt is mildly reminiscent of The Princess Bride where Voldemort would serve as an analogue for the main antagonist of the film. I thought it would be funny for the analogue, Voldemort, to correct Harry's grammar in the most pedantic manner possible. It was not meant to be taken too seriously, or serve as commentary on canon. Besides, Hedwig wouldn't have died if Voldemort hadn't wanted to kill Harry.
