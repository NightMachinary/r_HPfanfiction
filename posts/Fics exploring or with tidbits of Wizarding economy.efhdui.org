Are there any fics with at least a small spotlight on one of the interpretations of the Wizarding economy?

Transfiguration, duplication, reparo, etc. So much should change, enough to make it unrecognizable to any muggle pattern.

Reading some posts on this has peaked my interest.


** I always took wizard money in the HP universe to be deliberately nonsensical, more a concept of money than anything fixed to any meaningful value. That's why 1000 galleons could be a massive amount of money sufficient to act as seed money for a business, while 700 can be about the cost of a vacation to Egypt for a family of 6, and 10 is a stadium price for a pair of magic binoculars. No single value makes sense in all cases.

*** It /is/ all somewhat wobbly. But the arguments for an economy that is a little post-scarcity also start to make it possible to explain prices... a little.

The stadium viewers, if actually 10 galleons (?!), have got to be JKR commenting on price-gouging at such events. That is more than then price of a wand!

** I've wanted to write one on wizarding real estate for a while, because the housing we see in the books makes no sense. Wizarding tents and bags are bigger on the inside; why are houses limited?

**** IIRC the Burrow gives the best example of houses seeming to be limited. I think it was described as being obviously held together with magic. That it was all sorts of different pieces stacked on top and next to each other.

If houses weren't limited why couldn't the Burrow have 8+ rooms while still looking "normal"?

***** It might be in the way it was built and then expanded? Maybe it was a normal-ish house, and then over years or generations they added on to it a piece at a time.

Draco's comment on meeting Ron suggest the Weasleys have a history of large families.

One thing that is certainly odd is that a few of the expanded tents together, or expansion charms in each of the rooms, could give to a bigger living space without the ramshackle appearance.

I wonder if JKR had the expansion charms idea before Harry went to the Burrow. Oh! Didn't she later say that Charms wear out after a while? That would certainly answer my thought... if the family got lazy about renewing them and just wanted something permanent, or I guess it is normal in “old” countries to seek that permanence in housing.
