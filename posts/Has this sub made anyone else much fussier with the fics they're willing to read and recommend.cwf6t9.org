There was a time when I'd read any and all Harry Potter fics, as long as they were of a sufficient length and kept spelling and grammar errors to a minimum.

Then I grew up a bit and developed standards. Authors had to at least be moderately good at writing a coherent story, and Death Eater apologia and other such directly problematic things were right out. But still I plowed through fics like a college student goes through beers!

Now, after a year and some change on this sub, like a junkie I need more for each high. But now, what I need more of is quality, and every discussion thread I read makes what I need more and more specific. Just today I was going through a recommendation thread, opening up fics and closing them "No, this one is whitewashing Snape" "No this one is bashing Snape too much!" "No this one has polite goblins!" "No this one is a muggle wank!" I've become a Goldilocks for Harry Potter fanfics. Please send help, or alternatively fics that you think are "just right"!


** Yes. 100%. And it made me super paranoid when I took a stab at writing my own story that it would be picked apart here as an example of what NOT to do.

*** Easily the biggest reason I'm reluctant to write something myself. I once saw someone ask for reviews on a fic he/she was writing on the hpff Discord. Instead of constructive criticism, the author was completely roasted due to the fic setting off several of the things people in that place dislike.

While I didn't read the fic in question, from what I saw of it, it wasn't crack, meaning the reactions were genuine, which I found very offputting.

There's other reasons (I'd probably cringe at my first attempt after writing a bunch of other things and develop writing skills), but nothing that would stop me from writing entirely -- my mindset being "there's always something worse out there".

**** From what I've seen I would not equate the Discord and this subreddit. From my experience the Discord is much more brutally honest and blunt with their comments than most here. When I've seen similar requests here most of the commenters are respectful when offering critiques/suggestions.

My story actually has come up on reddit a few times and the critiques I've received have all been fair and respectful. Not saying one is better than the other...just different.

** Not sure if it's the sub or a general growing up amd reading a lot thing. For me it's also a thing of beingused to the fandom. If I read a new book or watch a new movie, there is more of a need for fanfiction and not that much out there and I'll read everything. A few months later, I'm already more picky.

** This thread taught me about some tropes that are popular in this fandom, but since I don't like any of them all that much, I simply avoid those fics. I've noticed that I just have become very specific after reading several fics. But knowing what you want doesn't help much if that thing hasn't been written yet. Now there are even certain elements in the original novels, particularly those involving romance, which I cannot stand because I saw so many of them in poorly written fanfics.

** Oh yes. I look at the early parts of my favorites list and go 'I read that? Why did I read that? Clearly /something/ was wrong then.'

** If you have problems with /both/ Snape extremes, you're going to have a really hard time finding anything, more than any other caveat you brought up -- since authors almost always put him in one of the extremes.

Personally, when I started, I had no standards. At all. Eventually, I started developing preferences as well as repulsions -- some things that I previously didn't mind reading at all, I could no longer stand. As those stabilized, I almost exclusively read fics of certain kinds. However, I still have very low standards beyond "fic fulfills one of my preferences". Sometimes I read fics outside those, but that's rare. As I exhaust the (not all that large) list of fics with my preferences, I have a progressively harder time finding something that interests me, meaning I have to lower standards even further and increasingly read fics I've already read. At some point, I'll have exhausted the list of fics with my preferences completely and I'll probably stop reading HP fics beyond the occasional new fic that ticks my interest.

*** I thought I was the only one with such views on fics. And I have the same problem- now I read fics I don't particularly enjoy because those I want to read haven't been updated or the author hasn't started a new fic. But I know a fic has to fit my preferences which include some characterization details as well.But I know that as long as that happens, I will not care about pacing or idealistic romance because I get what I want. But I am annoyed with myself for having a narrow focus because there's nothing to read:)

** In some respects, yes. Commentary on what others like or see in fics that I have read often make me reconsider my own thoughts on the matter. Why /did/ I think that fic was so good? And what made it different from other fics that are constantly being spawned out (read: practically every fix-it fic out there)? But thats the point is it not - to get different view points and ideas under debate and hear different opinions.

In many ways it has made me more critical of certain fics and ideas. For instance, while Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is a good fic, with time and new ideas I began to recognize its flaws (which so did the santi from his final commentary). It rather closely followed canon despite the setting, and often negelected character-building and storytelling for focus on the magic. While I still like it, time has tempered that view and allowed me to see it as an imperfect gem.

On the other hand though, I generally don't make recommendations based necessarily on what the 'consensus' is. My first focus is 'What fics most appropriately fit with the request?' If there are fics that are looser in that, I qualify it or offer a reasoning for /why/ I would offer my recommendation, but only if they meet the most critical parts of the request (i.e. who the main character is, what the focus of the story is, etc.).

I do generally avoid recommending fics with terrible or egregious spelling, grammar or plot points, if only because as a writer I cringe myself when reading them.

** This sub didn't make me fussier since I've only been here a few months but been reading hp fanfic for a few years. The past few months I've only really been able to read fics that break wildly away from the typical Hogwarts storyline and I think I figured out why. We've all read the original story. First year Quirrel and the stone, second diary and basilisk, third dementors and Wormtail, Fourth Triwizard tournament... Many fics don't break away from the general plotline and we all know the story, the world, the layout of events to expect. For the most part we already know what's going to happen no matter what house Harry is sorted into or who he dates or how powerful or weak or smart or dumb he is. We've read that story a hundred times told a hundred different ways with a hundred different Harrys. And that takes a lot out of the excitement. It's not that the fics are written objectively bad, it's that we've already read fics just like them and there's no spark of mystery to the plot anymore. With no mystery and excitement even a well written fic can feel bland. Because when you read the same story over and over you expect to get something better each time.

The Arithmancer trilogy, for example, was an excellent story that broke away from some of the more general storyline tropes. It followed Hermione instead of Harry, showed her struggle as a muggleborn instead of Harry the halfblood orphan, and was written really well. If you were still new to fanfics it's definitely one of the top ones I'd recommend reading. But the first 5 years follow almost all the general Hogwarts storylines. And that means you know what to generally expect when you read it. You already know Quirrel is possessed, the diary is a horcrux, Sirius is innocent, a death eater is pretending to be Moody... It's an amazing fic especially for people who are new to fanfiction, but the first 5 years of the story do lack the spark of excitement that comes from not having any clue what's going to happen, even though The Arithmancer is great.

That's why fics that break away from the traditional tropes that happen Harry attends Hogwarts seem so good by comparison even if they're not written objectively better. Take Whispers In Corners for example. It doesn't follow any of the conventional tropes or plotlines. Harry isn't rich, he isn't all powerful, he's alone, and Hogwarts isn't involved in the story at all. The canon storyline is all in his past, this story happens years later. And that alone makes it a good read, we don't know what's going to happen. You probably haven't read that storyline yet and have no idea where it's going to go and it's exciting again. It's exciting to not know where the story will lead or what events to expect. Combine that with Esamas great writing and it became one of my favorite fanfics.
