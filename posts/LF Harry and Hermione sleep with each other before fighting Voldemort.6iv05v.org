Im looking for Fics where Harry leads the Rebellion against Voldemort (can be in the Canon or Post-Hogwarts) and he and Hermione sleep with each other the Night/Evening before the fight against Voldemort begins. Well, im actually just interested in the Scene between Harry/Hermione, no matter if its just erotic, detailed or just an innuendo. The Reason why they sleep also doesnt actually matter (Hermione wants to calm Harry and make him feel comfortable/relax before the War begins. Or may it be to make her pregnant for the purpose that if he dies, she has something of Harry inside her (i know Notebooks and Letters from chemprof has such a scene). So i thought about a Oneshot, but if its a long Fic, im fine with that, but if so, you could tell me the chapter. And since its just the two of them, it doesnt actually matter if its AU.


** *Time is the Fire* fits this well. They sleep with each other in chapter 13 linkffn(6033933)

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.
