Sorry, I know most of you aren't interested in Severus Snape/OC stories, but I am, and I tried to filter SS/OC as a pairing in the app and it shows 0 stories.

Which isn't true. When I put in the characters without the pairing filter, there are stories with the pairing marked. I tried pairing OC with others, but it shows results with them, just not SS.

I know this is a small thing but it's been bugging me a lot. Is this just a glitch on my own device? Or everyone else has it too? Are there other pairings with which this doesn't work?

I tried going to fanfiction.net (where I know this works) but because I've installed the app it just directs me to it again and again.

Thanks in advance.

*** Glad to know it's not just my devIce. I would go to the website, but it keeps redirecting me to the app. Thanks a lot!

** Eh, move to AO3. This is one of the reasons it's better.

**** AO3 works fine in my phone's browser. I don't know what I'd need an app for.

*** I use both, but AO3 doesn't have the same collection of stories fanfiction does. Anyway, thanks.

*** Why is the filter in AO3 better than [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] in your opinion?

**** The filter works, for one. Plus it has no ads, and a better interface in general.
