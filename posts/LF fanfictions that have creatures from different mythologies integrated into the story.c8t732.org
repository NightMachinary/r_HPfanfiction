** I always thought something that incorporates Slavic mythology and folklore would be interesting. And no, I don't mean the stupid fanon veela. There's so much potential there. I even wonder if Koshei the Deathless served as an inspiration for horcruxes.

** linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noddlehammer)

From what I remember it has a Quetzalcoatl and a Skinwalker. It may have more. Haven't read it in a while and it's a super long story.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
