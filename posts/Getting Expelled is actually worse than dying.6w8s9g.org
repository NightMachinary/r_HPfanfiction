I want to see a fic where if you are expelled from Hogwarts, you face eternal slavery or something. Anything that is worse than death will work.

***** As far as I know, Harry and Snape were far from usual in how their were treated because of their magic. I don't think Hermione was bullied before coming to Hogwarts, and if she was it probably wasn't related to her accidental magic at all, but more to her bossy know-it-all tendancies.

******* But I'm not seeing your point. Unless, like the Dursleys or Tobias, the parent of the muggle-raised kid /already knows about magic/, I think people simply don't /notice/ accidental magic for the most part. The only person who might take notice is the muggleborn themselves, whose fear disappears once they learn about the wizarding world. I find it very unlikely pre-Hogwarts muggleborns are chronically subject to bullying in the muggle world.

** A lot of stories do this, as clearly it's worse for Muggleborn like Hermione. She already knows people out there want to kill people like her, even in first year. She actually pays attention to history, both mundane and magical. No /way/ she hasn't read up on the last genocide in her country.

And Harry is told before the trial that not only will he lose his wand and get kicked out of school, but he'll lose the ability to do magic at all. So there is some sort of extra "fuck you" to people kicked out for violating the Statutes, unlike merely kicked out of school like Hagrid.

No evidence that Hermione would face this just from getting expelled. But both her and her parents will be serious threats to the Statute even if it is only her wand being snapped. Mind wipes all around is certainly in the cards for a violently incompetent government, like canon's, even if it isn't "official" policy.

--------------

Still, JKR is a terrible world builder, so it was obviously in canon a "ha ha look at the swat" line, and the author intended nothing more. Propping up the jocks and mocking the nerds is very much JKR's thing in Harry Potter, for some damn reason.

Maybe that is meant to be Harry's point of view? Isn't clear to me.

How so? It may not be practical, but I could see a de-wanded witch or wizard staying in the wizarding world. I mean, squibs and non-wizards like Hags do find a place in it, if not a very comfortable one... besides which, isn't there sort of a loophole in the law? Sure, your /current/ wand is snapped, but do they ever say you're banned from buying another one? The re-wanded Hermione could then be smuggled off to the Burrow once in a while to practice magic undetected by the Trace. At the appropriate time she can pass her NEWTS, and voil√†!

**** What you're describing here is all reasons for a bigoted, power-tripping Ministry worker to arrange a mind-wipe on expelled Muggleborn. Just to make sure.

Hagrid's dad was a wizard, and ALL squibs are already in the magical world. Muggleborn aren't, and without a child (held hostage) in school, what's to stop a stupid, pissed-off Muggle parent from blowing the whole thing?

The bigot's point of view here is clear. And what you're suggesting with Hermione is only the /second worst/ scenario for them. And one that wouldn't be available to completely unknown Hermione in first year.

***** Hmm... well, you make the bigots' case pretty convincingly, but /are/ they in power? Especially as in 1991 Cornelius Fudge had only barely started his term, and most measures passed under Bagnold (with Dumbledore's approval) would still have been in place. To me, while what you describe is what the bigots would /like/ to be able to do, such laws weren't on the books because Dumbledore and Bagnold had kept them off it. Certainly, under the unholy triumvirate of Minister Fudge, Advisor Umbridge and Grey Eminence Malfoy, the laws could have changed, but I refuse to believe Dumbledore would have let it stand pre-1994.

****** Who said anything about "laws"? And what would even canon Dumbledore do to stop it, exactly?

- He does nothing to stop Muggle-baiting that Arthur Weasley handles day in and day out.
- He does nothing to stop mind wiping being the go-to solution to handing Muggles, even when wizards intentionally expose it during sporting events.
- He does nothing about Dementors being used as guards, or even ensuring due process for friends.
- He does nothing about clearing Hagrid's name or finding the Chamber of Secrets for about thirty years.
- He does nothing to find Voldemort for a decade.
- He does nothing to prepare for the next blood wars /for a decade and a half/.
- He does nothing to fix Hogwarts' house system even after decades of being headmaster, despite the well-known 1960s Robbers Cave experiment results on RCT--something a school teacher knowledgeable about Muggle means to the extent that he regularly goes ten-pen bowling and brags about it should /really/ be aware of.

In short, something corrupt and abusive /not happening/ because Dumbledore would fix it is not credible world building to me.

******* I don't mean actually stepping in personally as you seem to imply. I mean legally arguing in the Wizengamot against the unfair laws and supporting motions to repel them proposed by Minister Bagnold, in his authority as Chief Warlock and Chief Mugwump. While he didn't actually go out and /Finite/ cursed biting doorknobs, I'm convinced he encouraged giving more funding to the Department of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, and supported the Muggle Protection Act in the Wizengamot.

As Hogwarts hadn't turned into Durmstrang by 1991, I think Dumbledore may have failed as leader fo the Order of the Phoenix, but not as a pro-muggle political figure. Also, I have read a very convincing theory of why he didn't push for Sirius to have a trial, ask me to PM it to you if you want more detail.

Obliviation of an expelled Muggleborn would, methinks, have to be a matter of law, not of corruption. Obliviating the parents perhaps, but calling in Obliviators to obliviate a /wizard/, that would have to be on the books for it to happen.

******** I think we're talking past each other.

Even magical law isn't literally magical in canon. That's why I'm saying the law doesn't matter, on either side, but especially for the Death Eaters.

Canon Dumbledore is a Neville Chamberlain type figure. He clearly didn't clean up enough after the war, and it comes back to bite him in the ass later. He compromises with "ex" Death Eaters instead of directly confronting them, because he wants peace. The canon magical UK isn't post-WWII Germany, with the Nazi party outlawed. It's 1932 Germany. It's 1960s South Africa.

I'm sure your point of view of how the law works is the kind of thing such a character as canon Dumbledore would use to salve his mind. But that doesn't mean people wouldn't be doing wet-work behind his back, if a Muggleborn were expelled. Which might be why it never seems to happen in canon.

Except maybe that one Hufflepuff. What ever happened to her?

If you're talking about Sally-Anne Perks, the consensus seems to be that she was muggleborn and her parents pulled her out of school because of the /Heir of Slytherin/ business --- possible sending her to Beauxb√¢tons instead.

*** No, he wouldn't firstly he isn't a mundane - hell, he was born into a pureblood-line (yes, his mother was a muggleborn, but his name and fame still count for a lot!)

Not to mention: HAGRID (!) - there's more purebloods who want to kill him (for being a "disgusting half-breed") than Harry (Not all Purebloods are deatheaters or even supporters after all) - who even got the pieces of his wand back!
