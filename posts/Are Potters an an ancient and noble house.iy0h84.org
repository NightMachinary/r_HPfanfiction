Going through the fanfics, I found some where they have the Potters as a noble family and Harry is a lord in wizarding society. But they're always stated as a “well known family”. So what gives? Are they an ancient house and if so, how? If not, why do people write the Potters out as such?


** It must be noted that "Ancient and Noble House" is probably not any kind of official term in the books, but rather, at best something /the Blacks specifically/ styled themselves as. Nor does there seem to be any /actual/ nobility in the Wizarding World. Bigoted purebloods see themselves as "noble" by /virtue/ of being purebloods, but there's nothing more to it.

All that being said, the question can still parse as: were the Potters an "old family" in the same way as the Blacks and the Malfoys, albeit not blood-purists? Judging by more recent Pottermore canon, it doesn't seem they were ever the types of snobs who'd own Manors and specially-enchanted London houses and so on. But even that acknowledges a long line of wizard ancestors. And they do have a Gringotts Vault filled with a significant family fortune. In addition, the Potters are descended drectly from the Peverells, and retain a certain magical heirlooms from them. So /that/'s certainly a point in favour of the Potters being an "ancient" family of warlocks. Just not a "Noble and Ancient" one!

*** I knew the Potters were an ancient family going back to the Peverells, I just didn't think the Peverells were a noble house. It always struck me as weird because while the Potters do have a seat in the Wizengamot or at least they did when Henry “Harry” Potter was alive, and They were also on the list of “sacred” pure blood families until they weren't, it never stated they were a noble house. As for the Noble and Ancient house thing, I assumed that was part of the HP lore because of how Victorian-era wizarding society was. I mean they have the social elected as the government body and they wear robes which haven't been worn in a long time.

Seats on the Wizengamot are not family owned. I don't remember the details but basically, every time a seat is "free" (either because its owner chose to leave it or died), the other members will "elect" a member of the society to take his place (it reminds me a lot of how the French Academy works with its "Immortals").\\
It's not "The Potters had a family seat", it's "Mr Henry Potter was elected during his life".

The term "Sacred twenty-eight" comes from "The Pureblood Directory", a book published anonymously during the 1930's. It doesn't have any legal power, and the book can't show any research to prove its claims. It's basically just a man (though to be Cantakerus Nott) that say who he thinks is Pure, and who he thinks isn't. Families like the Potters should have been included into this list (they were Pure at that time), and were purposefully ignored because of Henry Potter too outspoken Pro Muggles ideas and their name (though to be of Muggle origin). It's just a piece of propaganda for Blood Supremacist.

It's also wrong to say that Magical Britain is stuck in the Vitcorian-Era. Regardless of their fashion trends, the "Wizangamot robes" is just a piece of traditions (similar to how some "Muggle officials" like British judge wear these old wigs), and their habit to use old items comes from Magic (magic can make an item work better than a muggle one and last forever, so why change it).\\
It's probably better to consider Magical Britain as a foreign society that, while it can be seen as quite behind in some aspect (House Elves are basically slaves), can also be very progressist into others (gender equality as been around since centuries by the time Harry entered that world).

***** It may be worth noting that everything about the Sacred Twenty-Eight and almost everything we know about the Wizengamot are somewhat dubiously canon. Almost everything we know about them comes from Pottermore and other comments from Rowling, which some may not consider canon, or may at least have an easy time ignoring because they want to do something different in their story.

I think that all we know about the Wizengamot from the books is that they have some sort of judicial function, Dumbledore was the Chief Warlock, and the identities of a few of its members.

****** Also that its possible to kick someone out as Chief Warlock, and that Aurors and Ministry executives can serve on it (which basically means there's no independent body to act as a check on the Minister's abuses of the law, which explains a lot).

**** Robes aren't Victorian, though. The /movies/ gave a Victorian vibe to the Wizarding World, but in the books it's much less present; it actually diverged from Muggle Britain around the /Renaissance/, and is more of a case of independent development since the Middle-Ages than of being "stuck" in any particular /past/ era. There is at any rate absolutely no support in canon for there being inherited seats on the Wizengamot --- it is pointed out that Lucius Malfoy is /not/ a member of the Wizengamot, and shouldn't be allowed to attend its meetings, he just keeps sneaking into the Ministry anyway due to his personal acquaintance with Fudge.

*** Same here. I always found the fics with Harry being a lord boring because they just make him op politically and financially. Then it just leaves him to find the villain and win.

**** I'd love to see one where he inherits the lordship and title and that's it. Money's all gone, sorry, along with the political power.

No, at least not in canon. The only use of the phrase in the books is the black family referring to themselves as such in a tapestry in Grimmauld place.

  If not, why do people write the Potters out as such?
#+end_quote

It's a setup for power fantasy OP!Harry trope.

*** Wouldn't be the first time there was something plot changing. I mean we've got what? Harry was going to have a younger sibling with Snape being The Godfather, she then comes out later saying Harry and Hermione should have gotten together and then there's rumors that she said the same thing, but with Draco, then the entire existence of Cursed Child. Wouldn't surprise me.

No, he was not. I have never been able to find any evidence that JKR said anything of the sort. That is someone's headcanon which has been floating around for a very long time.
