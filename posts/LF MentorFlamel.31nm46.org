Mentorship doesn't actually begin until chapter 4 of book 2: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9196576/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heir-of-Slytherin]]

Very overpowered Gary-Stu Harry, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. Mentorship with Flamel doesn't begin until 300,000 words into the story, but he's one of my favorite characters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect]] would be a good fit. Additional good points include: written by Brennus, manipulative!Dumbledore, H/G (if that's your thing).

** I've heard good things about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5950889/1/Time-makes-a-difference][Time Makes a Difference]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10375810/1/Bloody-Love-and-a-Sad-Destiny][Bloody Love and a Sad Destiny]], and have had them bookmarked for a while but never actually gotten around to reading them. The former has Harry thrown into the past straight after Riddle's attack in 1981, the other one during a dystopian seventh year timeline in which Voldemort's already won.

There's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1254121][Little Nicky]], which is an oddly titled, crackish little fic. Just a short, ironic, plot-defying oneshot. Not fantastic but amusing as a quick read if you're in that kind of mood.

The Flamels do seem to be under-exploited characters.

/Edit: I quite like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/712276][Alone and Palely Loitering]], even if it really doesn't fit your brief. Not so much Flamel-as-a-mentor as just/ Flamel. /I've only just remembered it./

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]] is probably the best example of this with any length.

As I recall Harry is already a bit of a badass and Nicholas and Perenelle are more like friends. Still, they help Harry a lot. I don't really remember the plot too much, but I remember I really liked it and check it now and again to see if its been updated.

*** This story has its moments, but it wins the "Desperately In Need Of An Editor" award by a mile. The author has some good ideas, but just goes /on/ and /on/ about things. Harry's Sorting takes what feels like 5K words.

It can't win by a mile. There are stories desperate for at least [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8984932/1/][three]] editors. Some need around [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][twelve]].*

*I know that editing does not work like that.

***** Hah! Totally with you on /Heart and Soul/. I think more than an editor, though, that author needed a defibrillator or an IV drip of caffeine or something. Technically sound writing and some interesting developments, but man, chemistry between characters was just non-existent.

Smart observation. I think a significant portion of his problems came from waving a wand over Fleur's character and saying, 'she wears a Mask Of Indifference.' It felt really disingenuous and a hamhanded way of sanding down the rough edges of a canon character to make her into a Mary-Sue. Very difficult to create conflict between characters - or as you say chemistry between them - when they are basically perfect in every way.

**** /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ should be considered for the award as well. The fic has some truly epic scenes, amazing worldbuilding, complex politics and great characterizations, but it sometimes goes on and on, and it gets bogged down with too many uninteresting subplots and side characters . I still love the story, but a good editing would have made it indisputably one of the best fics in the fandom.

** There is a nicely described mentorship by Flamel in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (WiP; 695,420W), but it happens further into the story and unfortunately doesn't last for too long.
