So far, the only WBWL stories I've managed to find is that it is never discovered Harry is the real one. I really want to find one/some that have everyone discovering the truth that their beliefs were wrong instead of it being all /hush hush/

Bonus if Harry isn't some emo, hate-filled, all powerful god that can smite everyone with a single look. Love me some forgiveness stories where you can slowly see the characters building their trust in each other back up.


** Not exactly what you're asking for, but "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" is the best other boy who lived fanfic imo, just a shame it was abandoned

*** Just on the off chance people aren't aware, I'd like to add it goes to chapter 17 (I think, I know its a few more chapters anyway) on DLP than it does on fanfiction.net , but you will need an account.

** Linkffn(Antithesis) hits quite a few of these marks. Note that there is definite angst in quite a few of the earlier chapters, but Harry does grow as a character. Great tragic story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** I got quite far but just couldn't continue it, too tragic for me. Its the only story I've read which I simply can't stand to continue, it's really well written but far too dark for me.

  Twins, One chosen one forgotten. Albus made a mistake that night and now the one he chose must go back to fix it or else Voldemort wins. He must save the true Savior...his brother Harry.
