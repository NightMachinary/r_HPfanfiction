:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all.

I'm trying to find a fic I read awhile ago and I'm hoping that there's someone here that knows it.

From what I can remember harry is sent to a school which is hard to find by Dumbledore I think in either his 2nd or 4th year and he isn't happy about having to come back. I think it's a drarry fic but not 100% sure on that.

I can also remember that while there he has been trained extensively in a lot of differnet magic aswell as dueling. I can also remember that the school is run by a headmaster who is friendly with harry but the school is led by I think her name is morrigan le fey. There is also merlin in it aswell.

I can also remember that morrigan wanted harry to run the school. Not 100% on that.

Hope that someone recognises it.

Thanks
