We are voting for new fics soon, and we want you to join us!

We read several fanfics a month together (you can pick and choose which you want to read), earn house points for it, and we have a lot of other optional events, including writing challenges, art challenges, trivia, movie streams, and we are hosting a virtual snack and paint soon! We are an 18+ group, so please ensure that you're of age. :) There are about 350+ of us right now, and plenty of room for you! We're a supportive, multi-ship community that just wants to read with other fans and make some great friends along the way.

Today, at 3:30 EST, we are watching Lilo and Stitch, so we'd love if you'd join us in time for that - maybe you can sneak in one of our fics before next month as well!

Next week, we are watching Goblet of Fire! :)

Give us a join! [[https://discord.gg/YFcTC39]]
