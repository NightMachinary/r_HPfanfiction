Greetings, fellow humanoids. I am Omnimessiah, and I work as a beta for 'The Serpent's Garden', a crossover between Harry Potter, and Fate/Stay Night.

The story is a general 'What If ?' scenario, where Harry manages to summon Semiramis the Queen of Assyria as his Servant during his early life with the Dursley family, with consequences occuring promptly. The world is a merge of Nasu- and Potterverse, with both communities living there. We try to evade most clich√©s inherrent in the genre, while trying to keep it relatively realistic, so don't expect glaring plot holes the size of Jupiter, or sudden and inexplicable deus ex moments.

Now, without further ado, I bring you the story link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12213666/1/The-Serpent-s-Garden]]


** I really hope there will be a Ginnymort walking around with her own agenda. Considering Dumbledore didn't come to aid Harry directly in the chamber in canon, he probably wouldn't have been able to prevent the heir from doing whatever if there was no one to open the entrance. But since 4th year is a go I'd assume that Voldemort hasn't made contact with Riddle or the diary failed.

Also I can foresee Harry being very persistent in the grail war when his mother is the heroic spirit that is at stake. I can't see him sacrificing Illya though (Why the hell did Gilgamesh kill her if she was the lesser grail vessel? And why is she a master when she can't grant herself a wish? I'm barely acquainted with the Fate series and only through the crossovers I've read and this part is so confusing. Is this only the case in UBW route?)

Getting sidetracked. I already had your story followed. Gilgamesh needs to die, even if he's being influenced by Angra Mainyu, or whatever is going in his pompous head. He's not even supposed to be in the war in the first place (cheating OP asshole). Zouken and Voldemort need to kiss... share the worms... ah, ignore that. Old Man Acht can join Dumbledore in sucking lemon drops and share memories of ruining children's lives.

I have no idea where I'm going with this... so I'll stop now. So far your story is one of the easier to follow so kudos for that.

*** There is already an alternative plot concerning the Chamber of Secrets, this one having more to do with the Nasuverse side of things.

Also, Ilya was a master in the war mainly because that was what her grandfather made her into. Her circuits were enhanced vastly, just to hold the awesome strain that summoning a powerful Servant would put on them. Apart from that, the Einzberns only cared about winning the war, and finally re-achieving their lost True Magic- Heaven's Feel.

And last, but definitely not least, all credit goes to Dragonofshadows115

Because Gilgamesh wanted to unleash the Angra Mainyu mud upon the world to cleanse it of the weak humans. By putting Illya's core as the lesser grail vessel into a magus body, it'll cause the mud to manifest. She's a master because the Einzbern got tired of using outside help, so they modified her to summon the strongest card in the war. In previous wars they've tried different tactics (3rd, they cheated and changed Berseker into Avenger, causing Angra Mainyu to be summoned, and later stuck in the Greater Grail. 4th, they hired outside help in the form of Emiya Kiritsugu, and gave him Saber, the strongest Servant in that war, as well as Avalon, which made him immortal). Illya being an Einzbern homonculus, has the ability to skip the thaumatological process and get to the result by funnelling enough mana into it. With 6 servants worth of magical energy, she can open back up the path to Heaven's Feel/Third Sorcery.

I'd highly recommend at the very least read the FSN Visual Novel before starting any detailed crossover like these.

**** Either that or go read the wiki in-depth, although it's quite the brain-twister in places.

Gah, that's a pretty terrible idea. For one, why would you bother reading a crossover with a franchise you don't even know. Plus, the wiki is still pretty inaccurate (its gotten better in the last 2-3 years, but it used to be absolutely garbage)

**** Wrong answer!

It's because Gilgamesh is a dick.

***** Actually, his view is absolutely archaic (because he himself is thousands of years old and is a copy of a dead guy from that era), but he does whatever he think is best for humanity is a whole. This is the guy that killed the bull of heaven to save his people's lands and crops. In Extra CCC (where the world is destroyed by mana depletion and only a small percentage of the world remain, mostly Magus), he's chill and more than willing to help you out, since the people remaining are the strong who survived, not a bunch of useless consumers/parasite he observed in the 10 years between Zero and Stay Night

*** Crosswind of Fate by Wayfarer2000 is the only decent one I've read so far that isn't some self insert garbage that makes up 80% of fanfiction

**** I could have written a better review and I'm altogether too lazy to review on FF.net, despite many good stories I've read.

This /is/ good though.

Please make it to 100k at least, if you don't manage to complete it. All the other over 100k ones didn't seem very good, and I usually only read fics over 100k, because otherwise they're too short. You're lucky I read this post, otherwise it would have been awhile until I read this, if at all.

Good luck though!

***** Thank you. I am intending to get it to at least 80k or so, but it'll likely spill over. I have a planned ending for the fic, all that needs to be done if filling in the bits in between now and then :)
