Nobody is posting a prompt because they have an idea that they wish they could write but have decided to inspire others instead. Of course not. Every prompt is just an oddly specific request and you hope someone will write it so you can read it.


** Pretty much yeah. But if someone else wants to write what you want to read then that's a win-win I guess.

** Not always; not all of the ideas I have are things I'd particularly want to read, or at the very least I don't care whether I ever read them or not. Some of them, sure, but others are just "I need to get this idea out of my head. Maybe it'd be useful to someone else and thus not go to waste..."

*** Some prompts I've seen are the "same old, same old" you see on FFn. The ones that do stand out, however, are the 'unique' ones, like the aforementioned "Teachers Shipping" prompt.

Not to toot my own horn, but when I post a prompt, I try to think of unusual, out-of-the-box ideas that I hope will entertain people.

**** Mine are all "I've got this idea, and I can't competently write it myself but I'd like it to /be/ written. Maybe if I share it, someone else will pick it up or it'll inspire them in some way." Some are also "I want this story to exist, and would love to read it, but it doesn't exist and I can't write it." Most of what I've actually written came from "It doesn't look like anybody else is going to write this, so I might as well give it a try" coupled with my muse spitting out plot elements or scene fragments.
