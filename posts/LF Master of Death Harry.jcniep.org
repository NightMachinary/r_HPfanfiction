** 1)Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus ¬ª As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job words: 443k+,

2) When Harry Met Tom ¬ª When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry Mod powers [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12793151/1/When-Harry-Met-Tom]]

3) October ¬ª It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

4) tell me whether he is dead LullabyKnell Summary: Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. ‚ÄúHey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòthe mirror's stopped working'?‚Äù

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637]]

5) The Wastes of August Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry came back from death with the ability to look into the future. And he can see the general decay and decline of the wizarding world, exposure and war with the Muggles, and the extinction of magic in a few decades. He takes action to prevent it. (Oneshot but really good)

6) Resurrect The Living (slash) fascinationex Summary: Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse. Additional Tags: * Master of Death Harry PotterSlow

7) you belong to me (i belong to you) (slash, mod) Child_OTKW Summary: After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11270490/chapters/25203408]]

8) On a Pale Horse ¬ª AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing

10) Harry Potter and the mountain of pure diamond (slash) Maximonstre Summary: Many, many years after the defeat of Voldemort, Harry has accepted the truth : he is what can only be described as a god. To relieve his anxiety of eternity, he travels between worlds. One day, he stumbles upon one which is far too similar to his first one for his peace of mind. And in which lives one little Tom Riddle, determined to pierce all the secrets of his new guardian...

11) Pride of A Graveyard Flower by (slash) watchingvfall_n_drown Summary: the concept is Harry's necromancy and how he deals with it in a new body

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25467943/chapters/61776418]]

12) What He Grows To Be Severus_divides_into_H (Slash)

Tom Riddle is a frightening coil of darkness, cruelty, and greatness, and changing him is Harry's only hope for saving people he loves. Going back in time, he takes Tom from the orphanage, but his optimism shatters with every year they spend together. Tom still longs for darkness...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19042240/chapters/45228508]]

13) His Twenty-Eighth Life by Lomonaaeren (slash) Summary: Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
