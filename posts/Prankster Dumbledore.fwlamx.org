I saw a prompt a month ago, and my comment became fairly popular, so I thought of continuing it. Here's the first part, and my new addition.

"What did Umbridge do /this time/, Minerva?”

Albus sighed/moaned in his throat. The school year had barely even started yet and he was loaded with paperwork.

"She had the gall, /the gall/, I tell you, to say that she was afraid of the dropping quality of education in Hogwarts, and that too to a bunch of first years. If you don't do something, Albus, you may just find that one of her paintings has managed to scratch her to death."

"Now now Minerva, calm down. We both know that her position in this school is beyond my control at the moment. We must try our best to give the young students our knowledge and teachings, and to follow the ministry guidelines precisely, or they may have enough reason to get rid of us."

Even as he said this, his mind raced through the proper charms and transfigurations required to achieve Minerva's idea. He shook his head. It was time to focus. If he showed any disinterest, he may find his own face with the scratch marks of an angry cat.

Minerva sighed, blissfully unaware of the inner turmoil inside his head. "Yes, I know that. Can't you do anything Albus? Must such a foul woman be allowed to roam the hallways of Hogwarts?"

But Albus heard 'fowl woman' and his mind produced a series of images with Umbridge as a fowl, each funnier than the last one. He had to use all his Occlumancy to stop himself from laughing out loud.

"Yes, it is regrettable, but the Minister has simply refused any meetings to discuss her," Dumbledore said in a grave voice. "We must bear her burden for now."

With that, and a heavy sigh from Minerva, the meeting was adjourned and she left via the rotating staircases.

Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, turned his mind to the stacks of paperwork conveniently disillusioned and kept under his desk. His hand got to work, signing and initializing with the efficiency that only comes with experience.

His mind was free to wander, however, and so it did. He constructed step by step procedures to make her look like a chicken to everyone else, complete with squawking noises and weird movements. Soon he reached the end of the stack, popped his knuckles, and stretched.

Long ago, there had been a time when he was the biggest prankster in Hogwarts. But age and experience had deprived him of his pranks. After all, you couldn't be a Chief Warlock, and a prankster. What mischief he had managed to cause, stopped because of Grindlewald, and ultimately, Tom Riddle. He couldn't, in any good faith, be seen doing pranks when the outside world was terrorised and scared. No, he had to be the unflappable Greatest Wizard of the Century, to calm them down and help with the war.

But that was a decade ago.

He used the wand to change his robes to bright, colourful and moving patterns, and strolled through the evening lights to the kitchen. He could have ordered the elves to his office, but this gave him some exercise in his old body, and he got to enjoy walking in his home. The pear turned to a doorknob, and he entered inside a room of barely contained chaos. Perfect.

He ducked his head and strolled inside, conjured a small table and chair, and sat down. One of the elves saw him and quickly made its way to his table.

"What may Professy be wanting today?" it asked quickly.

"A cup of hot chocolate and some biscuits would do, Telly."

"Right away!"

Within minutes, a steaming cup of hot chocolate and delicious biscuits were kept at his table, and he started enjoying his light evening supper.

Until he felt a timid tug on his hat from his back. He turned to find a tiny elf staring at him jumping from toe to toe. He turned his chair fully, now facing the elf.

"What can I do for you?" he asked kindly.

"Uhhh. Tinkly can't say..."

He nodded. "As the Headmaster of Hogwarts, I give permission to you to speak whatever you want."

The elf sighed visibly, but quickly straightened up. "Professy pinky be using bad quill on students."

/'Bad quill?'/

"What is a bad quill?"

"It be using blood from their hand to write."

His temper flared.

A few utensils dropped from their shelves.

The elf got scared.

He got his magic under control.

But not his temper.

"When did this happen?" he asked rigidly.

"Today."

"And who was the student?"

He knew not to have a preference for his students, but his mind was saying /'Please let it not be--'/

"Harry Potter."

The cup on his table vanished and the chocolate spilled all over. A wave of his hand vanished the mess, but his mind was plotting bloody murder.

The next morning, the Daily Prophet had a polarising headline that would change the Wizarding World for years to come.

The newspaper read "Albus Dumbledore has resigned from all his positions!"

A smaller headline read, "Umbridge to be the new Headmistress!"

--------------

*Start of part 2*

Umbridge was very happy as she made her way to her office. It had all gone so well... A little too well, some would say. She didn't care for those someones. In fact, they were horribly dirty mudbloods who were begging to be sent off to Azkaban, in her humble opinion.

She clenched her teeth when the Gargoyle took three seconds to open, and even then was very reluctant in relinquishing his guarding position for her. She would have a talk with the board, surely they could remove the abomination.

She bobbed her head, satisfied that her honour had been restored, and made her way to the rotating staircase.

That was when things started going wrong.

As she approached the staircase, it stopped moving, standing completely still. Unbothered, she started climbing. And she climbed. And climbed.

She started huffing, surely the office wasn't that far above? She looked up, and to her astonishment, the office was exactly where it had been.

Looking down, she saw that she was only on the first step on the staircase.

She glared at the stone architecture, who did not respond, because it was, in fact, a stone architecture.

She started again, and noticed that the staircase seemed to be revolving backwards to stop her progress.

Furious, she shot a blasting curse at the staircase.

The spell did what could be expected from a spell named “blasting curse”... No, it did not cause bedroom problems in wizards, get your mind out of the gutter. Ew.

No... it created an explosion near the end of the staircase. The stone wasn't harmed. The human, unfortunately, was.

She was thrown high, in a parabolic arc, impacted the ceiling, and dropped on the floor like a ball of rubber. That is to say that she bounced off the floor and hit the highly decorated wall, where some of the trophies shattered as she fell down in a heap on the floor.

Seeing her so thoroughly trashed, Dumbledore allowed his disillusionment charm to dissipate. He smirked in a job well done.

That memory was going right next to the day Argus Filch brought a giant dildo to his office, claiming it to be a new device that let students smoke questionable herbs. He shook his head, went to the staircase, and started walking backwards, as he wanted to come down. Soon he reached his office.

He wondered how long it would take her to figure out this simple trick.

‘Probably never,' he realised, ‘at least until she realises that she can just apparate to the office.'

‘And when is that going to happen?' His mind asked.

‘Probably never,' he admitted.

OoOoOoOoO

Cornelius Fudge entered his office, and stilled. A letter was waiting for him on his desk. He was pretty sure that his secretary had not delivered any such letter.

He swished his wand and summoned his patronus.

“Did you deliver any letters directly on my desk, Kate?”

The return patronus was swift, “No, I did not. Should I send the security?”

“Please do.”

The security made of highly talented pure-blood aurors made its way inside his room, and slowly inched towards the desk, casting spell after spell to dispel any traps.

One of them finally reached the desk. He levitated the letter, and carefully cast the detection spell. Everyone waited with bated breath as each test came back negative. He sighed in relief and shouted “All clear!”

At the word ‘clear' the dungbombs placed near the door under disillusionment charms exploded.

Nobody had time to shield or cast bubble-head charms. Soon the dust had settled and the whole office smelled like, well, like dung.

Annoyed, Fudge stomped over and ripped the letter from the auror's hands, discarded the blank envelope, and started reading. And then stopped reading and threw it away. The letter was rather short.

/This could've been worse./

His annoyance increased, and so he failed to notice how the letter was laced with a potion, and his hands were now fins.

He did notice when he tried to open his office door and his fins slapped helplessly against the round doorknob.

He took a deep breath to shout curses and to the unknown menace when he realised one vital thing. The room hadn't been cleared of the dung.

The resulting coughing and sputtering fit lasted for a full 10 minutes, and the healers brought from St Mungos took another 2 minutes to force him asleep.

The head healer scratched his head.

When, and how, had the Atlantean Plague returned? And how had it managed to infect the Minister?

OoOoOoOoO

Harry sat in his dorm thinking about his shitty life and generally being an angsty teenager who didn't trust his elders. A case could be made that his case was more genuine than his fellow teenagers, so perhaps he could be excused for his behaviour.

Even Dumbledore had abandoned the school and he didn't know what to do anymore. Why had he been sad about getting expelled, again? Oh, because of the Dursleys. Hogwarts was simply the lesser of the two evils.

These thoughts were stopped rather abruptly as a piece of paper hit him in the chest and came to rest on his lap.

He looked around but did not find anyone , even under his bed.

Curious, he gave a look over the crumpled up piece of paper but soon opened it. The message was rather short.

/This could have been the killing curse./

Wide eyed, he looked around much more carefully, looking for any shimmer or such in the air showing an amateur disillusionment charm in use. He did not find any. Hi quickly pulled out his want from his front pocket.

Another piece of paper hit his head, this time from behind him.

He quickly unfurled the paper.

/And this could've been a stunner. You need better training if you even hope to fight the dark wizards, much less the dark lord himself. Start applying yourself. And take the Occlumency training seriously, I will only reveal myself once you're adept at keeping your thoughts secure. Till then, start reading the books kept on your trunk. And try to master the shields and ‘accio' spells, specifically./

It was unsigned. And the handwriting was one he didn't recognise.

He looked over at his trunk, only now noticing three huge books kept there.

He straightened his shoulder, picked up the books, went to his desk in the dorm, and started reading. His invisible benefactor was true. He needed training. And he would get the training, whatever the cost.

OoOoOoOoO

AN: This story is writing itself, I swear. I have no solid plot in mind as of now, and am open for suggestions and ideas.

** This is honestly great fun to read so far. Its like the normal start to an independant Harry story where he suddenly realises he needs to actually try, but its an invisible Dumbledore throwing paper at him!

Maybe have Dumbledore going round the castle and pulling similar kick up the arse wake up calls on other students and teachers that need it throughout the normal OoTP story line. Like the students that take part in the Inquisitorial Squad, Filch, Snape etc.

​

But as it stands i think this is a perfectly fine one shot too!

*** Glad you enjoyed it. I'm thinking of making Harry his apprentice, and he starts teaching him all sorts of magic, most of it focused on pranks but some badass magic as well. He starts giving answers before Hermione, and it starts pissing her off. Ron is all for his mysterious benefactor, especially because he's tormenting the Slytherins using his new magic.

Oh the possibilities are endless.
