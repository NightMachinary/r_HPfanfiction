:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fic I read a long while ago on ff.net where Hermione had been deafened during the Malfoy Manor interrogation and Fred was blinded by the wall, and they ended up together and helping each other deal with their respective new disabilities. I have had a hankering to read it again but can't seem to find it anymore. Does anyone remember the title/ have a link?

Would also appreciate any kind of similar story of coping with a physical disability.


** This is the one!

  Hermione woke up after the war with a terrible surprise. Her life is forever changed, and she is going to have to learn how to live with her new handicap. If her new life wasn't going to be hard enough, she also has to deal with rengades who believe that Voldemort's view of Muggle Born's were correct. Can she accept her new life and help a friend find healing as well?
