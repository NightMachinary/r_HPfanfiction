I've read /The Iron Sky/ on ao3 and really enjoyed it. And the premiss was really good and I wonder if there are any other stories where Harry didn't magically survive.

Another one I read is a time travel fic with Draco, Hermoine Luna and some others. Harry killed himself and Luna took Draco Hermoine and others back in time to change the past/future?


** The Boy Who Died is a work that explores what the world would have been like if Harry had died along with his parents. I read it a month or so after it came out and it's legitimately the start to a series I've ever read. When I say start to a series, it's the first book out of four so far, but the author updates once a week.

*** That was actually very great. I read the first two in the series and I had to stop on the third one because I have actual school to accomplish

  A true single point of departure leads to a world without Harry. Changes compound- and no one is safe.

** This fic fits but I don't think it's what your looking for; I'm gonna link it anyway since it's pretty well written. Also, it's dramione:linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4377774/1/Midnight]])

This story is about a world where both Harry and Neville had died so there was no chosen one. It's seems to be a pretty good match to what you're looking for.
