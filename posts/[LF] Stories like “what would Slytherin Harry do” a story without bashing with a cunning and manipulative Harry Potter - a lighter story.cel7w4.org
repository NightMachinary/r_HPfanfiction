** Though there's bashing, It really is a Slytherin Harry where he's extremely manipulative, cunning, ruthless, but not evil DE Harry. If you want, its on ao3, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes)

It has bashing (I know you've asked for no bash, but there's reason for it) of James and his lawyer friend(OC) and his brother, at least in the begining. But I don't see it so much as bashing, as it is hating.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
