Both Salazar Slytherin and Tom Riddle have put Parseltongue locks and protections to keep people other than other Parselmouths out of certain locations or to protect treasured items, so using Parseltongue for magical purposes is technically true in canon. Coupled with other types of wards/charms, it could be a good way to keep things safe. And if spells could be cast by saying them in Parseltongue, it could have a strategic advantage in combat as except for Voldemort, opponents won't know what you're saying or what the spell is until they see it, which could cause them to have a harder time blocking or dodging.

Out of curiosity, why does the idea of Parselmagic get such hate? Is it just because it's an Indy!Harry thing, or can it do too many things in fanon?


** I don't think parselmagic actually gets hate at all. From what I've seen people actually like fics with it. The problem is when the parselmagic is done poorly and turned into some divine level unbeatable magic that requires zero effort. When portrayed like that it's just bad/lazy writing. Its like in a lot of powerwank/op Harry fics where he becomes god tier without effort by abusing some facet of magic. A lot of times readers like the branch of magic but what the fic does is just bad.

******* I hope you are not being sarcastic lol

Dumbledore wouldn't be able to help Harry in any way since he can't read or understand parseltongue.

And just because Harry can it won't mean he will be able to master all parselmagic available to him in little time.

I see this as a good way of removing some of the misconceptions for parselmouths. Imagine Harry saving people in front of a crowd by hissing at them.

Again, parselmagic healing wouldn't be something too OP. He wouldn't be able to bring people back from the dead or cure every malady the world has known. No healing saint Harry who finally finds the cure for lycanthropy or can heal any mental damage. With dark magic, in some cases he might be able to lessen the effects and in some less ‘dark' completely recover people from them. An example would be Dumbledore's cursed hand, Harry might, with the help of Snape's potions, slow the curse giving him more time or lessen the pain/after effects of the curse, but Dumbledore would still die from it.

Both for me. It's usually a trope featured in the same borefest fics with edgelord Hadrian, Gringotts, Weasley/Dumbles bashing and lordships.

Also due to the nature of these fics the "parselmagic" tends to be extremely powerful and makes everything else irrelevant.

OP characters need to face opponents/challenges appropriate to their power level, possibly just or more powerful than themselves. For instance, Goku and Superman are constantly being challenged in power/weakness and have to find a creative solution to win, like train more or use their wit.

Edgelord Hadrian on the other hand just casts his wandless^{TM} parseltongue family magic - accompanied by some edgy tantrum - and everyone else bends over.

Also in canon Parseltongue is just a language, with objects being enchanted to only respond to it. You could to the same with any langague really, like Klingon and only Star Trek nerds would be able to interact with the enchanted objects.

** Parseltongue in canon is just a language. Some things are enchanted to respond to passwords in that particular language but it could be done with any human language. Also why need to say the spells in parseltongue when you can cast them nonverbally? Unlike parseltongue which Dumbledore also understand despite not being a parselmouth, no one can really guess what's in your mind if you are a good occlumens as well. So I think canon already offers us a more efficient alternative. If parseltongue is used in a creative way I think no one complains. If it's just used as an overpowering device, the story in itself is shit and it typically has bigger problems than parselmagic.

** I have no idea if it's hated, but most of the time it does not get near as much credit as I wish it did.

I recall that some years ago, in fics, it was a popular idea that parselmagic could used for healing, but it seems to have died down.

Sometimes, indy!harry has some kind of block on it, but it's never actually explained- it's just ''dumbledore thinks it's dark and bad and somehow blocks it'', so that's inventing something like, out of the blue, and being super unhelpful about explaining what that ability does.

I agree, in canon it's used mainly to lock things, or keep them protected. I'd say that's a theme of parselmagic: it locks, it keeps information private (though it's not confirmed to have a written system, I think), it protects, it hides etc.

As for magic purely in parsel, maybe it's very exclusive, idk, family magic? But it could also be just another way of saying the spells. I think there's a difference between having a spell that does the same thing as accio in parsel and hissing ''accio'' in parsel, and that is very much something I'd love to expand, but I don't have the creativity for it.

** I think that Parselmagic is super cool. It would be something like creating spells or charms but making the incantation in Parseltongue instead of Latin, That would be such a big privilege because only parselmouths could cast them (or if someone learns to speak it ? Ex Ron in DH ? )

But yeah, I don't get why it's hated. I think it has something to do with the type of fics where it's used. It's most of the time some super independent Harry that makes 0 sense. But if used well it could be really cool in a fanfic

** Absolutely. Maybe tie it to the fact that snake's perceive the world in a very different way to humans (in a far more metaphor-oriented magic system). Parseltongue has fundamental differences to human languages. Countering a spell cast in parseltongue without knowing parseltongue itself is difficult simply because the counterer doesn't have the same instinctive understanding of the underlying metaphor of the magic.

On a related note, experienced mages tend to pick up several "casting languages" for the variety of metaphor and intent each language and culture provide.

Because you can either take it to the extreme, any language works for such an actions, or atleast, any magical language works and then it turns into a shitshow as people learn rare languages just to take advantage of it, or you limit it to parseltongue and make it a birthright, which always leads to familial magic.

** My headcanon is that spells specifically designed to be used with Parseltongue incantations are almost exclusively in the area of Healing, when talking about European spells. I'm not sure what other non-European cultures with significant snake presence in their folklore associate it with, but whatever Parseltongue spells these cultures produced would be in the area that they associate snakes with.

I don't like it when Paselmagic is made out to be super OP though, it would be like any other language on Earth. The only real edge I think it would be fair to have over magic in any other language is to make any Transfiguration/Conjuration of reptiles easier, and obviously making passwords only vulnerable to another Speaker.

I also love the idea of an alphabet being created for it at some point in history.

** It is a cool concept, but you yourself prove why people hate it with your first sentence.

It's not ever used as a cool concept. It's just giving arbitrary superpowers to magic.

There's no such thing as a "parsel lock." Every fic I've ever seen that uses "parsel magic" uses that concept, and it's nonsensical.

Tom Riddle and Salazar Slytherin put a */password/* onto an */enchantment/*, and that */password/* just so happens to be in an obscure magical language. If Dumbledore put a mermish password on the gargoyle to his office, did he use a merlock? Is that mermagic?

I'm not trying to insult or attack you, but this is exactly why people don't like it. It's certainly why I don't. Casting magic in parseltongue, if you could manage it, would carry some distinct advantages. Nobody who wasn't also a parselmouth would know what the hell you were doing, for starters, they'd have to blind guess what was about to come at them. And just like how certain languages are more or less conductive to things like math or expressing artistic concepts, you COULD make the argument that since it's all just rolling hisses, that parseltongue is a language that is uniquely suited to freely casting spell after spell after spell, with all their translated incantations just rolling into each other in one long sibilant hiss.

But nobody ever uses that. That's never what it is. It's always parsel locks and unique parsel spells and other vague and ill-defined superpowers.

The advantages of learning how to freely use parseltongue are that you've effectively just cheated silent casting for every spell that exists with zero effort, because nobody knows what your words mean and you can always quietly hiss under your breath. And that you can put passwords on things that nobody will be able to ever open, because you put the password down in an impossible to learn language.

I'll do us all a favor and refrain from bringing up how Ron got into the chamber in DH.

** The reason I dislike "parselmagic" is that it goes against the spirit of the rest of Potterverse magic. Potterverse has, as one of its central themes, a certain equality of opportunity to what one can do: with general smarts, hard work, and good teachers, a Muggleborn can perform the same magic as the heir to the most august of bloodlines.

Exceptions exist (parselmouth, metamorphmagus), but they don't let one do that much over and above what the Hogwarts curriculum allows. A universe in which inborn (or bloodline) talents actually had a strong effect would look very different and fascinating in its own way. However, it would require additional worldbuilding, which entails giving other characters inborn talents of comparable potency. That raises the difficulty of pulling off the fic significantly.

On the other hand, most of the time it's just a plot device to give Harry yet another unearned power-up; and then you might as well just say that he has a ginormous magical core.

And it makes sense!

The mouth of a Parselmouth has a different structure than the mouth of a normal human being, it's more similar to that of a snake, which allows them to make the hissing sounds of Parseltongue. When they bite someone, their canines become longer and sharper to pierce the skin and reach the veins. And a Parselmouth's bite is lethal, because they produce their own venom which is extremely deadly and can kill someone in a few minutes for muggles and a bit longer for wizards.

There is no antidote for a Parselmouth's bite, nobody knows anything about it because of how rare Parselmouth's are.

Only another Parselmouth can survive Parselmouth Venom, but even if they don't die, it's gonna be painful and it'll take weeks for their body to completely eradicate the Venom and they're gonna be weak, sick and constantly feel tired until the venom is gone.
