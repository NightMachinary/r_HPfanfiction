I'm going through characters that never seem to get a good bashing by anyone. Mine so far are:

Neville: Is always shy and quiet but with a secret inner courage and would/ will be one of the most powerful wizards around if only his overbearing gran would let him buy his own wand.

Luna: Beneath her strange and unfairly bullied exterior lies a font of hidden wisdom and insight.

Dobby: the abused house elf whose actions related to cursed bludgers are always instantly forgivable. One you free him from the Malfoys, dobby (otherwise known as 'magical deux ex machina' or 'yoda') is the best and most helpful companion you could possibly ask for.

** Hagrid - while completely befuddled by the Headmaster's awesomeness, he is nonetheless a decent and heartfelt man of little guile and much humor. Bash-authors don't trust him but they don't vilify him either.

Charlie Weasley - as cool as Bill but isn't competition for any harem-building Harry with his eyes on the best canon-confirmed hottie. His absence is his innocence.

Tonks - like Hagrid, would be assumed to be loyal to the Headmaster but without nefarious intent or actions. For that matter most Hufflepuffs are safe bets, with Zacharias Smith the exception- he's an obvious blowhard to be shoved into a sea of fire for the comedy.

*** It's not nearly as harsh as bashing in fanfics can be, but in Santi's /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/, Flitwick is neglectful of Harry (who is sorted into Ravenclaw), refusing to help him learn more magic outside of class, being unaware of how other Ravenclaws are treating Harry, and whatnot. It's a significant influence on why Harry decides to transfer to Durmstrang. But Flitwick is later regretful of his actions, and I recall he's treated somewhat sympathetically here, so maybe this isn't the best example. Even when being bashed, Flitwick gets off lightly.

**** That's not being bashed. Bashing is when the character is made OOC, mainly by grossly exaggerating the negative points of their character while getting rid of the positive points of their character, in order to make a character that the author dislikes in canon to be so bad that everyone who reads the fic will start to dislike them also.

Commonly, it is coupled with the character becoming so mind-numbingly stupid that Harry can beat their plans with ease, theoretically making Harry look bad-ass.

**** Actually, I would argue Percy is even less likely to follow the family, as shown in OotP. However, he is so detested by the vast majority of the fandom that he is unlikely to get a sympathetic edit in a Weasley bashing fic. The twins are the right combination of rebellious enough to not follow the crowd and fun enough that people want to write them in a positive light. People can imagine themselves being friends with the twins, while Percy seems like a giant stick in the mud.

"What're you doing there, luv?" Bellatrix asked, never letting her eyes wander off the disgusting mudblood before her.

"I'm preparing our playball for Hermione to run around the yard with. I'm certain it will be loads of fun." Luna answered, her voice as ethereal as ever.

"Now, why would you do that?" Only a slight fading of the mad grin on Bellatrix' face betrayed that, once again, her plaything had surprised and subsequently confused her.

"You see, beloved." the blonde witch started, her eyes full of mischief. "I was wondering how one would turn the Tripping-Hex into a lethal spell. I have found the solution."

"What? You want me to save this piece of filth? She knows something and I will have it out of her."

Luna replied, "She doesn't have much imagination. If she says she's never been in your vault, I'd believe her."

"You'd believe anything, my pet!"

Luna replied with much patience, "I don't believe that you understand. There will be no cutting. If you think her blood is filthy, you shouldn't leave it spilling all over your sister's house. And what did we agree about names?"

The madwoman let out a whine. She loosed her grip on Hermione's arm and trudged over to stand directly in front of Luna.

Luna stared.

Bellatrix drew her wand, but stopped.

Luna stared.

Bellatrix swung her arm out, ready to backslap the slight-framed witch before her. Then she took a breath and her arms slumped to her sides.

Luna whispered, "What did we agree?"

"I'm the pet."

"There you go. Now, you can slap that uppity Granger a few times because she needs to know you're scary, but that should be enough."
