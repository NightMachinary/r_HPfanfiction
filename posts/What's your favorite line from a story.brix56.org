** An author called displayheartcode [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13290002/1/][just posted a fun]] male!Hermione/Ron one-shot, and I loved this moment after "Hector" punches Malfoy in the face during the Death Eaters' spree after the World Cup.

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy's noise made a meaty sound and blood gushed down his face. He dropped his wand and started shrieking. Hector felt like making more bad decisions, but watching Malfoy run off felt good enough for now.

  Stunned, Halley and Ron stared at Hector.

  "We can't use magic outside of school," he reminded them.

  "Good night then, Professor," Lily says. "And good night to --- what is your phoenix's name?"

  "Fawkes," Dumbledore says.

  "How revolutionary of you."

  "Ah, yes," Dumbledore says, with his own smile, as the phoenix lets out a croon Lily hears as goodbye, "even I was once a young revolutionary."

  As the door shuts behind her, Lily could swear she hears Dumbledore murmur, "How lucky we are some revolutions fail."

This heart-breakingly ironic line that Andromeda delivers to Sirius and Regulus in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948481/1/][Blackpool]], about how they need to just keep their heads down and not piss off their family:

#+begin_quote
  "Promise me," says Andromeda eventually. "Promise me you'll try. It's unfair, I know. But you can't escape it right now, because they will find you, and they will drag you back, and unfortunately they have every right to. Just try not to make it worse. Those years will seem long. But you'll have the rest of your lives to look forward to."

** Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694)

Second year Harry goes to visit Dumbledore's office and after a short discussion about elf rights, Harry utters the following...

/Harry said, "But that's not what I'm here about. I found the Chamber of Secrets and I'd like to use it as a clubhouse, but Hermione says it might have dark magic so I thought you might check it for that and also maybe install a lift because right now getting in and out is a pain."/

** These first are from the same fic. It's a second POV Andromeda one-shot. The whole thing is stunning. I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called. I have a epub version stored with no title pr author :((.

“There is a difference between good and evil. You know that. But if anyone asked you to draw a line in the sand, you would laugh. No line, no man, no mirror can distinguish between the shades of grey in a person's soul.”

""That was my cousin Andromeda. She married a Muggle-born when I was ten and taught me that not all fighting is done in duels. She's the reason I'm a Gryffindor.”

From “Grow Young With Me” by Taliesin19. I started laughing very hard when I read this.

“We played Aurors and Death Eaters," Rose said, grabbing another chicken leg. Harry frowned. "I despise that name. Why do you have to call it that?" "Everyone calls it that," Al said with a shrug. "I was a Death Eater, Daddy," Lily said. "Oh, lovely," Harry said.”

And there's this one. It's from some TMR/HP pairing fic but I have no clue which one.

“you know...love exists beyond that place called good or evil...love is more than that..."

  So this was where the war ended: not on a battlefield and not with a bombing, but in Anthony's London flat, in front of the telly. He had stuck his wand out of sight, out of mind, and he was curled up on the sofa with a bowl of ice cream and a bag of crisps. He absently dipped the crisps in the ice cream while Holby City ran in the background. It was disgusting. He didn't care.

** Oh! My favorite comes from the story /Faith and Understanding,/ which chronicles the friendship between Ginny and Luna, and Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Link]]

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** This is one of my favourite lines (more like most recent favourite line).

‘It took Harry two hours to regain use of his magic after it'd been sealed away, but he was stuck inside of the chains for another two days, until he finally managed to pick the lock by doing nothing but wiggling his eyebrows. It was a very complicated eyebrow-wiggle.'

Honestly, everything from linkffn(9469775) is pretty awesome. Scratch that, everything from the author (at least Harry Potter-wise) is great.

Another one would be this:

--- "Are you sure you're okay?"

"I'm fine... just a dream." She lay back, pulling the blankets back up. "Just a dream of days gone by. I'll tell you about it, but not tonight," ---

This passage followed after a 4 chapter arc in which you followed the main character through a lifetime. It ended in tragedy, and then this passage followed... it really had an emotional impact. Linkffn(9860311) This is from Chapter 7, which is the conclusion of the short story which starts in chapter 4.

This one isn't that impressive alone, but the build up to it... I legitimately laughed in excitement when I read it.

"He was done! He was so bloody done! That was it! From this second onward, he was going to do, in everything, what she damn well pleased!" Linkao3(8495269)

A few more:

"She would walk into the darkness with the light at her back, knowing what she was turning her back on and how wrong it was of her to do. " Linkffn(9081608)

"When the rays of the morning Sun touched the bridge, the snow was still falling lovingly on the dead body of the black-coated man with messy hair who sat kneeling against the railings of the bridge, eyes closed, a smile of peace curving his lips, which glistened with a strange frost, as though someone with a face of snow had been kissing him." Linkffn(11467524)

"She's not supposed to exist. It makes her fascinating.

It wouldn't be such a problem, if being fascinating to them didn't mean you no longer have many basic human rights." Linkao3(10608933)

I'll stop. '"I'm going to give you all a little lesson in proper pureblood etiquette," Harry replied. "As I said before, Luna is my friend. That means she's under my protection." He smiled. "Who can tell me the proper response to an attack on someone that is under your protection?"

A dozen wands appeared in a dozen hands. "You're all alone here, Potter."

"That's right," he agreed coldly.

One of the seventh years hit the door with a locking charm. "No way out, Potter."

"You fools," Harry laughed. "Do you even realize what you've done? You didn't lock me in here with you, you locked yourselves in here with me. Shall we dance?"'

Harry is an adult and put in charge of the Auror office and someone from the office goes missing. Everyone's telling him not to worry about it but we get the line:

"The words remind me of something. Someone else who never returned from a holiday... bloody hell, Bertha Jorkins. I groan to myself. No one went looking for Bertha Jorkins, either, and look what happened to her."

and then a little later on

"/Bertha Jorkins, that was her name..."/

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000792][I Can See Us Dying ... Aren't We?]] linkao3(1000792)

** I shall not die, alone,

but kin to all the powers,

As marry as the ancient sun,

and fighting like the flowers.

How white their steel, how bright their eyes!

I love each laughing knave,

cry high and bit him welcome to

the banquet of the brave.

Yea, I will bless them as they bend

and love them where they lie,

when on their skulls the sword I swing

falls shattering from the sky.

The hour when death is like a light

and blood is like a rose---

“You have never loved your friends, my friends,

as I shall love my foes.”

  "Sometimes, when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a long, long time..."

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/6/]] My fav lines from Seventh Horcrux

1."It's a lottery."

Hermione rolled her eyes. "That's ridiculous."

"No, believing that a big cup can choose the greatest champion based on a name on a slip of paper is ridiculous. What's it do, analyze the handwriting?"

1. I tore a strip of parchment off a sheet, scribbled my name, and shoved it into Hermione's hands. "Make use of your terrible, Muggle origins and start throwing."

2. "There is something seriously wrong with you," Hermione murmured.

"Thank you," I said. "Speaking of something seriously wrong, there's Ron!"

** It'd have to be the following line in Chapter Fourteen of A Black Comedy by nonjon:

"I'm not a parseltongue," Harry tiredly explained' "I'm a parselmouth. The language I can speak and understand is parseltongue. And if you've ever seen an anaconda you can understand why I sometimes get called a parselcrotch."
