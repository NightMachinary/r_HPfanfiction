So no Weasleys if there is an H/G romance, no Daphne romance if he is adopted by the Greengrass family, no Tonks romance if he is adopted by them and so on.

No involvement of Voldemort, the Malfoys, Snape or any other Death Eaters, neither as romance nor as romance, please. Preferably not Lupin or McGonagall either.

*** I mean, I started to write it because I was annoyed by the lack of similar themed stories. As much as I enjoy romance, it was annoying that Harry always ended up with a romantic relationship with someone from the adoptive family which ruined the previous dynamics.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/945579][Hermione Granger & The Child Protection Movement]] - not a harmony series.

Five part series, 306k words total. Not marked complete, but does have a satisfying ending (there is potentially a 6th installment).

Part one is linkao3(Muggle Management) - don't worry, the rest are novel sized.

  What happens if Hermione notices signs of abuse in Harry during first year? The Wizarding World may not have laws against it, but the Muggle World certainly does...

*** Lupin is a useless pity party who was never there for Harry and then ran from his pregnant wife, breaking their marital vow three months into the marriage. Sirius did a lot more to help Harry during years 4 and 5 despite facing summary execution if he was caught.

And McGonagall was absolutely useless and not there for Harry either. If her reaction to children having words carved into their skin is "keep your head down", then she shouldn't be around them.

#+begin_quote
  Slash
#+end_quote

I wouldn't mind Harry/Wayne Hopkins or Terry Boot. But none of the popular slash pairings appeal to me because I find most male characters in the universe boring and the few who are interesting cannot be paired with each other or it would ruin the arcs (eg Edward Tonks and James Potter).

#+begin_quote
  Snupin
#+end_quote

Hell no, although they might deserve tobe inflicted on each other. The only Snape pairing I'm interested in is Snape/Dementor, or maybe Snape/the Veil.

**** Well alrighty then!üòÖüòÖ

I agree with the first half of this comment. And honestly, the whole of the Lupin/Tonks relationship seemed a bit weird to me simply because - at least to me - the whole of them being together was just war circumstances. I personally don't think they would have been a thing if there hadn't been a war raging... I don't think Remus or Tonks wanted to have a kid, and the only reason they got married is because that's what was expected of them and Lupin more than likely wanted to do the "right" thing. Still flaky as shite though for bouncing out like that though. He's too lukewarm for me in canon so I try to give him character growth in my own stories.üòó

Yeeeeah. It's probably not for you.üòÖ I hardcore ship Drarry (and Snupin). If it isn't endgame Drarry, or with Snupin as the main ship, I don't bite. I *do* ship other pairings. Even have a few het favorites - I'm obsessing over Theo Nott/Padma Patil and I love them so much!!! üòÅüòÖ

Again, we won't agree here but that's cool. I *get* why you don't like him. Lol. But I go for the redemption arcs for Snape, Lupin, Sirius, and Draco/Malfoy's. I don't like them completely out of character but well...better than canon.

***** Why would Sirius need a redemption arc? The only thing which even remotely qualifies would be him telling Snape how to get past the willow, and that was only dickish towards Lupin and can honestly be resolved with a "I didn't know Snivellius was that mentally retarded that he'd go Werewolf spotting on a full moon".

I'm honestly curious about Padma/Nott. How is that even a thing? She has one scene, he is a background who believes in racial superiority and does nothing other than laugh at Hermione's parentage once. How can that ship be a thing?

****** The same as all other ships...imagination? ü§î lol

But really, fanfiction is so popular because you can take canon and make it into something that you enjoy and give characters more depth and time for growth. Most of the children who became DE's did so due to familial duties. Even if they thought they were better than Muggles/Muggle-born Rowling didn't give any of them a chance to repent or make different decisions because if she had, the entire story would have turned out differently.

So yes, I like to imagine that Theo and a few of the other Slytherin's had someone they felt safe enough to turn to. Someone to offer them another option besides falling into the destructive path of racial/blood superiority. Honestly, this is why I have issues with a lot of the staff. They let the entirety of the school ostracize the Slytherin's enough so that they are isolated from their peers. They have no other adult to turn to other than Snape.

And almost the entire cast of HP could use a redemption arch. Everyone has made world changing, dumbarse decisions. Sirius included. And not just for the Lupin/Snape thing. He decided revenge would be better than taking care of his godson. And I don't particularly care for him seeing Harry with James colored filters on though I can imagine that we won't agree on the Sirius aspect. I don't hate him, but he definitely has enough faults to want to give him the opportunity to grow /up/. He didn't have the chance to in canon - due to his own mistakes - and I just don't like him all that much when he's half insane from Azkaban (and for abandoning Harry).

***** Correct me if I'm wrong, but Harry never gets adopted right? Amazing story, I've read it a few times and I love it, but damn I'm confused. Where is the whole 'adoption' from? Unless I'm thinking of a different story, the only adoption this story has is sweet little Natalie. She gets adopted by Sirius and Marlene. So, I ask, what are you referring to by him being adopted by the Tonks?

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
