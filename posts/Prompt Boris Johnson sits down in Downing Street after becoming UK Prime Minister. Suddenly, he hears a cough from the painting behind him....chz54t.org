** "Let me make sure I understand you," Boris said to Minister Granger. "Magical Britain is a member of this /International Confederation of Wizards?/ An organisation which imposes laws on Britain, not least the Statute of Secrecy?"

"That's right, Prime Minister," Hermione said.

Boris shook his head. "Unacceptable, my dear. Brexit means Brexit. Britain has had enough of these so-called /experts/ at the ICW dictating cauldron thickness."

**** I have fun imagining Hermione as the biggest proponent for leaving the ICW.

The ICW blocking her proposals to permit Goblins to own wands, to give equal rights to house-elves, to eliminate legal restrictions on werewolves or to experiment with fusing magic and Muggle technology, all for the greater good of the Statue of Secrecy.

Hermione still being Hermione has a very rose colored view of how such a thing would be done and the effects such a thing would have and campaigns with great vigour and enthusiasm for leaving the ICW, only to find out after the vote, that theory sometimes clashes with the real world and spends the next few years trying to leave without completely isolating Wizarding Britain from the rest of the magical world.

Her progressive agenda meanwhile suffers from a backlash at the home front when the Goblins decide that if they can have wands, they don't need to be bankers and close Gringotts, minimum wages for house elves mean a tenfold increase in the costs of Hogwarts, several children are bitten by werewolves and fusing magic with Muggle technology is a difficult and long process and the few results are a mixed bag at best.

Many people would say it has been voted on once (the 2016 referendum), and others would say 2 times (referendum + 2017 general election). Some people would say it's been voted on 0 times, citing the lack of specificity in any of those votes.

**** Indeed we are. But - to steer this away from politics and towards HP - the ICW is generally depicted as much more like the EU than the UN. Specifically:

- It has the ability to legally bind its member states (the Statute of Secrecy is not just an international treaty, it is directly enforceable within domestic British magical law).

- Its activities include the harmonisation of legal standards across its member states.

For the latter, see this very EU-like exchange from GoF:

  ‘A report for the Department of International Magical Co-operation,' said Percy smugly. ‘We're trying to standardise cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin -- leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three per cent a year --'

  ‘That'll change the world, that report will,' said Ron. ‘Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.'

  Percy went slightly pink.

For the last several years I have felt like the various conflicts created by a magical nation leaving the ICW would make for a good backdrop to a post-Hogwarts fic.

1. It's an original political problem, not just a repeat of blood politics like so many post-Hogwarts fics do.

2. It functions as commentary of contemporary political issues.

3. It would be a nuanced, multi-faceted issue suitable for adult characters (as opposed to the black and white morality of the canon books, suitable for children).

4. It's a problem which does not coalesce into a single "big bad" like Voldemort, and thereby avoids the classic problem of all post-Hogwarts fics: villains who are more powerful than Voldemort feel inherently improbable (and cheapen canon); villains who are less powerful than Voldemort feel like they should be defeated easily.

"But the Harry Potter books! And movies!"

"Ah yes, that was the late Albus Dumbledore'S rather clever plan to uphold the Statute. Plant the idea to write about our world in the mind of a Muggle author and help her just a teensy bit with the first book so that the stories would become famous. Now, we can go around wearing cloaks and carrying wands even in Muggle London and just say we're cosplaying. We're hiding in plain sight." The wizard was smiling broadly.

I dislike cursed child because they forced situations in canon that were better left to the imagination.

Sure they could grow in the time between, but that's a narrative cop-out. You don't have to write a believable redemption for Draco, you can't explain why Harry is suddenly a terrible father, and you can't explain why Ron decides he's going to brew love potions.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** I remember how I had naively made a post on the main HP sub, just a few days after joining Reddit, asking how various US presidents would have reacted to a wizard suddenly popping out of a painting and telling them that magic existed. And one redditor got me into a long endless and aggressive argument because he was supremely offended that I had jokingly used "He who shall not be named" to refer to Trump.

Man, that really taught me a good lesson in how to behave, react and ignore on the internet

** Imperius the hell out of him so that things can get back to normal. Actually, I could see a fic where that explains Trump's bizzare Twitter behavior (as a result of the wizards trying to get him ax-ed from governing and it backfiring every single time). It would also explain why Trump is fond of certain catch phrases from being over obliviated.
