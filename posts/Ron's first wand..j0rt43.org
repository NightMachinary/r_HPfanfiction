I have been reading about wand wood lore because I was bored and it is surprisingly interesting, and I just realized something about Ron's first wand.

Ron's first wand, was Charlie's old wand: Ash and Unicorn Hair, 12 inches.

According to Mr. Ollivander, "The ash wand cleaves to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. This tendency is extreme if the core is of unicorn. "

People always comment on Neville getting a new wand and that making him absurdly more powerful. I think its about time Ron gets some respect for going through a year of school at probably less than half his magical potential. And then he passes second year with this already very underpowered wand broken!


** I mean, my main comment on the wand thing was always just "What manner of eejit sends a kid to magic school without the literal single thing they need to function?"

You can make do without the robes, you can make do without the owl, you can even make do without the books, but the one thing you absolutely need to have in full working order is a wand. And not one, but two sets of guardians fucked that up.

And yes, I know the Weasleys are poor, but it's literally the one thing you cannot cut corners on if you want your child to be able to do anything whatsoever. You need a wand that works for you for magic school, that's just... not negotiable.

*** its always kinda annoyed me that you inherit wands, maybe as secondary ones, but if you have to have something new as a witch or wizard it's a properly working and matching wand.

it should almost be required for hogwarts students to have a wand check to actually be informed if a wand matches its owner or not

*** This is why I kinda hate Nevilles grandma. Like... I can understand the Weasleys. They lived by hand me downs. Hand me down books, hand me down robes, hand me down pets. But Neville? As far as we know he comes from a decently well off family, maybe more than decent. And for his grandma to force his fathers wand onto Neville? At great harm to her grandsons wellbeing... Well. It doesn't sit well with me. She stunted his magic, his education, and put him through some bad bullying.

I'm 'middle-class privilege' as fuck, so I've never had to live by hand-me-downs, but I know grief can do some really fucked up things to a person. There's a reason 'parent was never the same after other parent's death' is such a pervasive archetype in modern media.

I'm not justifying her actions, mind, just providing my observation/explanation. Understandable or not, it's still not the best choice she could've made and it lead to a lot of problematic consequences for Neville.

Also, second point that literally just occurred to me - if it's Charlie's wand that Ron 'inherited', then what the heck is Charlie using? He's not dead, and he is working in the magical world, so he needs a wand, so what the heck is he using? Did he get a new wand while his old one was still existing? Is that a thing?

Charlie being good at Quidditch and Charlie loving dragons are canon. Charlie dropping one for the other is fanon (and quite a common trope).

******** Yeah, I wondered. I personally like the idea, because it explains things like "we haven't won the cup since Charlie was captain' when he only graduated the year before.... which makes me think he was a younger captain, and quit for his seventh year.

Of course, in reality, JK just didn't put that much thought into what was just a fun kids story at that point. I suspect she just didn't think about Charlie's graduation age.

** Yeah, add to that the fact that education almost certainly builds upon previous experiences, it's even more impressive that Ron does so well. People don't give him enough credit. He duelled three death eaters at the same time in the ministry and came out only confunded. Meanwhile Harry, Neville, and Hermione were struggling to deal with two death eaters. Hermione silenced a death eater forgetting about nonverbal magic when she's studied to NEWT level magic. Harry forgot his wand and tackled a death eater. Neville was Neville.

** I know we know that "the wand chooses the wizard" but is it a known thing in the wizarding world too? I mean - clearly Ollivander knows, but the average Wizard and the average Witch? I not so sure about that. We have several Canon and Semi-Canon sources that Wizards and Witches used family-wands.

Beginning with Isolt Sayre who used Slytherins wand followed by Charlie and Ron, Neville and in the last battle Draco who used his mothers wand. McGonagall did nothing to change that for Ron or Neville - two students in a year/house of 10 - which make 20%. Also Hagrid states that Ollivander sells the best wands - that means he's not the only one who sells them. Maybe it is known by the Ollivanders that each wand chooses his owner but not a commonly accepted thing? Maybe it is common that Wizards and Witches use wands that do not fullfill their full potential - which is why Ollivander got more and more popular because his wands produces the most powerfull owners? It's only a theory - but it would make sense.

The business has been around since 1000 years before Hogwarts.

Unless only Garrick himself figured it out so it's only been around for like 50 years. In which case his family should be ashamed.

edit: It appears my guess is actually the correct Lore, Garrick himself invented the method of pre-making wands and letting them select wizards, were before wizards would bring wandmakers magical substances for them to craft a wand out of.

**** The only other wandmaker that's mentioned in Canon is gregorovitch if I'm not mistaken. Viktor Krum talks about how he was one of the last ones to purchase a gregorovitch wand before the old wizard had retired. Unfortunately we don't learn a lot about him except that he and Ollivander didn't like each other very much and they only really agreed on the properties of Hawthorn wands. I wonder if gregorovitch would have been enraged at the laissez-faire attitudes of the teachers at Hogwarts.

It's a specialist skill so we can assume that each region served by a magical school probably has one or two wand makers of Their Own. It would be interesting to know if that level of Parental negligence would fly at ilvermorny or Mahoutokoro.
