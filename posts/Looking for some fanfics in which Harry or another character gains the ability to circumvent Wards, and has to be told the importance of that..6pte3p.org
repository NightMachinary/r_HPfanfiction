** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood]] is a fun read which has that.

There's a few heist fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]], but they don't tend to spell out the importance so much as take it in stride.
