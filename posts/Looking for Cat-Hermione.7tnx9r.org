I found a poorly written story where Hermione was stuck in her faux cat form after second year and I was wondering if y'all knew any with a similar idea that were well executed and decently written.

Long/short I don't mind. I just want to see what people do with the idea.

Thanks!

I know that this isn't what you requested, but the only Hermione cat story I could think of was an awful smut fic.

This fic deals with a Harry that more or less prefers being in cat mode. I think it was decent enough considering what it is about.

If you want me to remove the recommendation, let me know. I hope someone comes along and can offer you something closer to what you are looking for.

have a good night :D

***** Lol I just closed it. I'll have to find it again for you tomorrow. It's really bad though, despite it's seeming potential.

There's just constant plotless random sex and it feels like it was written by someone high on hormones

** There is one that I know of that does fit the description, which is linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2062614/chapters/4483347]])

However, it is a Harem fic, along with being a Porn with Plot fic, so if thats not to your tastes, then okay. Its a longer fic though, and quite well written.

** I feel like I remember one where Hermione was permanently a cat human hybrid and she had to leave Hogwarts because she was classified as a beast? I remember it being okay but unremarkable, probably WIP too? I don't remember much more unfortunately, sorry I don't have a name or link or anything.

** I don't think I know of any where Hermione is stuck in her cat year second year, but I know of other fics where she is stuck in her animagus form. Are you interested in those?

Edit: found [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/214856][this]] on AO3. Very short but WIP.
