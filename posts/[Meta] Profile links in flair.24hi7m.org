Some subreddits have custom flairs which you can mouse over and see a link (for example, MAL profile in [[/r/anime]], or Steam one in [[/r/SteamGameSwap/]]). I was thinking that it might be pretty neat if we could do that here with FFN or AO3 links. No idea how hard that would be to implement though.


** I like this idea, I'll take a closer look at it this weekend but it shouldn't take long to implement.

** The Hufflepuff subreddit has that! I bet if you messaged the head of that subreddit she would help you set it up, or tell you who set it up for us :)
