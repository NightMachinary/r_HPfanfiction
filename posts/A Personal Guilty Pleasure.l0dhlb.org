Im looking for pics where the MC (preferably HP) just flexes on people.

Like I want him to just do some massive overkill just /because he can./

Ex: "Oh your house broke down. Lemme try and fix that" (cue a single reparo which fixes the whole dang house) and he just walks away like's nothing at then

Please no slash/femslash. Doesn't have to focus on pairing. Preferably complete or regularly updates fics but if not that's fine.


** I'm going to suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]] because Harry does epic stuff and really undersells it, but it is technically femslash. The pairing is irrelevant to the plot, sort of just shows up in the last chapter/epilogue with some pretty minor hints previously. If you are okay with that, then it's an amazing read and is complete at around 90k. One of my favorite fics to reread.

**** No. The author just borrows characters to fill in spots and needed a journalist.

#+begin_quote
  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.
