:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Some time ago I took screenshots of some quotes from a fanfiction (possibly two? I'm not sure if they're from the same story) I was reading because they both really hit home with my struggle with anxiety. I wrote the quotes in a journal and for the life of me I cannot find their source! I know this is like searching a needle in a haystack but as a last resort I thought that maybe by chance one of you would recognize these quotes!

The first one was said by Draco Malfoy:

"You don't do anything but get through today. You handle the fear for today. You deal with the anxiety, and the shaking, and the tears for today. Then, the next day, you do the same. You only have to live with it for one day, not all at once. If it gets easier, great. If it goes away, fantastic. If it doesn't you take it one day at a time. That's all."

The next quote was said by Severus Snape:

"You are not broken. Wounded, yes. Damaged and in pain, absolutely. But none of it is irreparable. You are still here."

Thank you in advanced to anyone willing to help or that may possibly have an idea where these are from!

#+begin_quote
  Six months post-war, Harry meets Grayson Wenke, a famous Quidditch player. Harry believes he's found the love of his life, and a Happily Ever After ending suitable for the storybooks. When Grayson slowly goes from Prince Charming to a monster behind closed doors, Harry finds himself trapped, and alone, and fearing for his life. When Harry realizes he's pregnant, the opportunity for escape - and a real Happily Ever After - presents itself as none other than Draco Malfoy. The only question is if Harry is brave enough to take a chance, and strong enough to heal.
