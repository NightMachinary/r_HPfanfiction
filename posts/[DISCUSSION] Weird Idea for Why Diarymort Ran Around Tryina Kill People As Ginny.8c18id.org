Maybe it was some sort of digestion type of thing?

Like, Horcruxes usually aren't supposed to /eat other people's souls/ I think, so it was probably difficult for Diarymort. To help with that, he is trying to get Ginny to kill, and crack/shatter/shred her soul so its easier for him to absorb? So he puts her in the situation, but makes /her/ give the command to kill?


** You really get the sense that Diarymort is a sixteen year old psycho playing supervillain; a more mature version of Riddle wouldn't announce that he'd taken a hostage, especially if he needed to keep her in privacy to enact his re-embodiment. He also probably wouldn't have sent the Basilisk out to forage in the school so often.

Young Riddle would feel the urge to flex his muscles & exert his powers, just to reassure himself that he was mega-mage; defiant, unstoppable, and mustache-twirlingly nasty.

*** You make a good point, but I can't help but think that "Young Riddle" sounds like a SoundCloud rapper.

**** The suspicions came from two things. Harry walking into the site of the first attack and Harry revealing his parseltongue ability during the duel. Both of those relied on Diarymort knowing that Harry is parselmouth but doesn't know about it. Which he had no way of knowing before he started his attacks.

****** Yes, because, as I written in my previous comment, he walked into the site of the first attack. And he walked into the site of the first attack because he heard basilisk and followed it not knowing what he hears.

** Well, it did say that every time Ginny poured her feelings into her notebook, it got more of a hold over her soul. So because of the large blanks in her memory and waking up covered in rooster blood, she got more stressed and afraid and put that into the diary in a feedback loop. So it certainly helped.

I still say that the whole possession thing in the books was on account of Voldemort's prodigious natural skill with legilimency. When he was young he wouldn't be capable of it, but as a horcrux it could definitely allow him to act as a parasite. Then again it could be a function of the Horcruxes themselves. An unattached piece of soul is an unnatural thing, and so it instinctively tries to reattach itself to a soul in whatever way it can.

**** Right, and possession is at least one of the pinnacles of legilimency. That takes a lot of work, more than seven years' worth. But if the Horcrux's need for a host is innate, then Young Riddle would instinctively know how to do so.

** Each horcrux is influenced by the item it is created with: the ring with the resurection stone sill tries to get you to die, the diadem is intelligent enough to keep itself unseen and safe, the locket acts as a raving Gaunt,...\\
The diary seek to be a confident, to get you to "pour one's soul" into it. Unfortunately for it, it was the first horcrux and the sanest part of Tom RIddle, and Voldemort kept writting in it; over the years and Voldemort descent into insanity, the diary tried to give him good counsel but instead made Voldemort angrier and angrier, so he found a way to torture it, leading it to believe his goal in life was to purge Hogwarts from unworthy (read : muggleborn) students. Add to that a transfer of Ginny's infatuation for Harry, which the diary misunderstand (even alive and "sane", Tom RIddle did not really understand such feelings), and you get your recipe for mustache-twirling evil.
