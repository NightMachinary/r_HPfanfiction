I am searching for other stories besides a new chance by CallunaRubus where Harry Potter goes to a magical school in Australia either by himself or with Hermione.


** Linkffn(If I Knew The Consequences I Wouldn't Have Done It by raspberrydreams), during the summer following second year Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley try to force Harry and Ginny into a betrothal contract "to resolve the Life Debt Ginny owes him." He doesn't take their actions well and in short order gets adopted by the Grangers and moves to Australia.

I'm not particularly far in at this point, but he and Hermione /are/ attending school in Australia while Britain undergoes all sorts of changes in their absence.

  Harry is surprised by the side effects of having saved Ginny in the chamber. Turns out people he trusted were lying to him. There were many people who wouldn't have done what they did if they could forsee the consequences of their actions and Harry's reactions.
