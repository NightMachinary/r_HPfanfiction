I have read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) and linkffn(To be a Slytherin) and the potter family drama comes from something I can understand (getting in different houses; going to different schools) not that the parents are negligent to one kid and deserves to be in prison.

Are there others like this?


** Okay, so this is similar to what youre looking for...except with James instead of Harry. I haven't finished reading this one yet, but it's enjoyable. linkao3(A Tale of Two Sides)

  James and Emma Potter are twins - inseparable. They have their Hogwarts years planned out: pull amazing pranks, find all of the castle's secrets and stuff their brains out. There was no question about their House: "Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!" James says, lifting an imaginary sword. But what happens when the impossible happens?Eventual pairing: RegulusxEmma, slight SiriusxOC

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I like this one. Harry has a younger sister sorted into Slytherin. Although, they don't dislike each other exactly. There's just some tension because of her sorting. Lily and James are also still alive. linkffn(10804018)

  Sophie Potter is the younger sister of the infamous Harry Potter. Her life at Hogwarts should be set, but things take an unexpected turn when she is sorted into Slytherin. Being green is never easy, especially when those cunning folk will befriend you just as fast as they would cut your throat.
