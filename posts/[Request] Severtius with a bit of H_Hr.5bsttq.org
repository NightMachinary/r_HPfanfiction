I love reading Snape being Harry's mentor/guardian/friend, The Best revenge is my favourite among a few. What I am looking for though is a mix of that and romance between Harry and Hermione. Preferrebly long. Thanks ! PS: what are Ur other fave srvertius


** There is no H/Hr romance in it but A Year Like None Other ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072]]) is one of my favorites Severitus stories.

In Care Of was also quite nice : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

*** I think that was actually the username of the person who made a fic challenge involving Snape as Harry's mentor. So they were all Severitus' Challenge fics.

** Blood Magic by Gateway Girl is great (the complete version is on Schnoogle, not ffn). It's mostly Severitus focused, but there is a little bit of H/Hr. The writing is really excellent, with lots of sassy lines.
