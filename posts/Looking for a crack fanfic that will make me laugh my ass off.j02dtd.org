** 1) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Pure crack really funny

2) Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

3) Triwizard Tales » - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

********** 1)Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance Watermelonsmellinfellon Summary: Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021]]

2) Insane Asylum Escapees » This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/Insane-Asylum-Escapees]]

3)Escapologist Harry Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry]]

4) Allure Immune Harry Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]] I hope that you like these too!

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
