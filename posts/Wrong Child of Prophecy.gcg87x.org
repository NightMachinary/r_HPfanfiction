Harry is the Boy Who Lived, but Neville is the child of prophecy. Everyone assumes that Harry has to be both(Nearly 100%). Voldemort marks Neville sometime after 4th year (Probably during DoM battle) and only a few people start doubting. However, all everyone talks about during that battle is Voldemort returning and Harry/Dumbledore's actions, so no one gives a crap about Neville's marking. Not exactly WBWL fic, but a Wrong Child of Prophecy (WCOF).
