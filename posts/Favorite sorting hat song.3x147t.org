Hey guys, I was just rereading To Fight the Coming Darkness linkffn(2686464) and I loved the song found in chapter 30. What is your favorite Sorting Hat song?


** I feel kind of bad for saying this but I always skip the song.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
