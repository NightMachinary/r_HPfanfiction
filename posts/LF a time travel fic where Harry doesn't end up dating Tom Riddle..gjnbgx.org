I want to read a fic where Harry is transported to the 40s, but gets paired up with anyone other than Tom Riddle. I mean, he could still be dark and Slytherin, and joins Tom. Be equal and all. But perhaps he could date one of his followers (Avery, Rosier...or even an OC). I read one fic where Harry stays at the same orphanage and becomes a brother to Tom and gets adopted to the Potter family, and Harry dates Alphard Black. I liked it. It

It can be Dark!Harry, Slash or otherwise.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293][Realignment]] by Puzzled) although in it, Harry isn't really a main character as much as someone who's presence can be seen through the changes to time.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
