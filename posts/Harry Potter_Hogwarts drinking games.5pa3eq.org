What are some interesting drinking games you've come across while reading fanfics? So far I've thought of simple truth or dare games that would involve very low doses of veritaserum. Additionally, I've come across quidditch pong, but are there any other drinking games that you think the students at Hogwarts, Ilvermorny, or any of the other wizarding institutions would play?


** played at hogwarts, have a shot each time malfoy say "when my father hears about this"

... and half the population dead from alchohol poisoning.

** Exploding snap could easily be turned into a drinking game, e.g. just take a shot of firewhisky when a card explodes or something like that.

Also, this isn't a drinking game, but I would love to read a one-shot about a drunk Ron arguing with his wizard's chess pieces that refuse to listen to him.

*** That gives me an idea for a story (Tho I have no idea how), where a powerful wizard (Maybe Dumbldore, Harry, Voldemort, etc) creates some of those mildly-sentient objects, but since they are stronger they either do something wrong or its too powerful so then there is now completely sentient chess pieces that regenerate. Well I assume that they regenerate when smashed. Would most likely be a crackfic, but I'd never write it.

** Beergardium Leviosa - Two drinker levitate something. First to let it drop has to drink his cup.

Polychoose - High Card. Each player takes a card from a stack. Highest card has to drink from concealed bottles. Every player dropped a hair in one, but only one is a polyjuice. The one who drank the polyjuice has to do shots until the polyjuice wears off.

** I'd think a HP fanfic drinking game would be best.

Drink every time someone acts out of character (bashing, suddenly speaks like an adult, etc).\\
Drink every time someone mentions "Lord", "House", or "Ancient and Noble".\\
Drink every time someone suddenly masters something after reading a book.\\
Drink every time someone is polite to a goblin or otherwise show's that "he/she is no ordinary wizard/witch".\\
Finish your drink every time Harry winds up with a new girl. Only take a drink if he broke up with the last girl and is monogamous.

I'm sure you're probably dead now but just in case you're not: Drink every time you read something that makes you cringe or annoys you.

** I remember reading a fic where everybody starts to take shots whenever Harry mentions his scar and after finding out he uses it to get all the death eaters super drunk and beat them easily. Don't remember what it was called though.

** Shots of love potions that don't wear off until you kiss someone.

Drink when you see something in a crystal ball.
