I'm writing a fic where Dobby can't inform Harry of the RoR so I'm trying to think of how they would discover it


** Neville finds it by accident trying to avoid crab and goyle

** Its near the ravenclaw rooms right? So have luna find it by randomly pacing back and forth thinking of something when the door appears. From there she mentions it to neville who thru trial and error figures out what the room actually does.

*** Is it near the ravenclaw place? I thought it was more near the gryffindor place. And Luna doesn't seem one to pace in my mind. Good suggestion though. Thanks

**** fair enough i dont really know why but if one character is just going to walk down a corridor back and forth just thinking i always picture Luna. Works with anyone you think might fit. Another idea is harry seeing some random names disappearing from the marauders map, like he just notices that a name isnt on it anymore when he saw it before and eventually realizes that name disappears when it gets to the 7th floor so he goes to look into it and finds the room.

*** I was thinking that, but I was having a hard time figuring out 1: how to get them to the kitchens and 2: how to get an elf to disclose the information

**** 1. Twins? Marauder's Map? Maybe someone is embarrassed or doesn't want to deal with the Great Hall for whatever reason?
2. They naturally want to help. Talking about the problem in front of them will do it.

**** They're elves, just ask.

"Hey, know any place private we can uh... work on a project?"

"Oh yes, young master. Just go to the Come and Go room. Whatever you need will be provided."

****** Harry and Ron were discussing options for the training location, Hermione's contribution so far consisted of rereading /Hogwarts, A History/ in the hopes a suitable spot might be mentioned in the sacred (to her) text.

Ron suddenly piped up, "Maybe we should ask Fred and George? They know this castle better than anyone."

Harry nodded, "True, they even discovered the kitchens."

This caused Hermione to up look from her reading with a glare, "Honestly, it wasn't much of a discovery. The house elves have worked there forever. They slave away cooking for us. And cleaning. They've been cleaning this entire castle from top to bottom for generations. They scrubbed places the twins have never even thought to look."

Hermione continued, really getting into her SPEW rant, but the boys hardly noticed. A light bulb had gone off over their heads and they turned to each other as one, "The elves."

** Hermione has read about the RoR in "Hogwarts: A History" then someone remembers Dumbledore's comment at the Christmas ball in GoF and someone else remembers finding a room just when they needed it.

*** Ooh maybe. It would probably only get a brief mention in Hogwarts a history tho, so that might not be much help. And anyways they won't know the location. Good idea tho
