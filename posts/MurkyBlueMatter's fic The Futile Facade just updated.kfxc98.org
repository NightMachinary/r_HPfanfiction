Her potions skill is definitely a danger, but she has made sure to separate it from Rigel, who supposedly didn't succeed in learning to shaped-imbue. Professor Snape knows Rigel and Harry well enough to probably guess it, but he might choose to keep it to himself.

"My cousin, on the other hand, wanted to come to Hogwarts as well, as she had a very similar interest in potions, but couldn't, of course"

But now Snape knows that there was no "of course" about it. "Rigel" claimed that a half-blood could not attend Hogwarts, /while sitting in Hogwarts as an illegal half-blood/. So, if "Harry couldn't come to Hogwarts" was a lie, then perhaps Harry /did/ come.

****** Snape also has met Rigel during the holidays, so he knows that the true Arcturus must either be complicit, or else entirely replaced, for years, by an impostor skilled enough to fool all the Blacks and Potters including Harry. And he knows Rigel well enough to doubt the second possibility; Rigel isn't likely to murder someone or lock them away indefinitely for personal gain, and is too inseparable from Harry for a ruse between them to work.

With the likelihood, then, that the true Arcturus is conspiring, Snape can consider: who might Arcturus have trusted to replace him, and why? And, there is one person whom Arcturus is known to trust above all others, and Rigel has already revealed to Snape that he and Harry are studying each other's curricula because Harry loves potions and Arcturus wants to heal for his mother's sake. And Snape knows that Harry has large magical reserves, but also has the skill to conceal them, and he has seen the two of them /use each other's wands/ - but then he /didn't/ see them use their "correct" wands after switching "back". And Rigel laughed off the idea of being swayed by threats against Harry, not because of any lack of concern for Harry, but with apparent total confidence of Harry's feelings.

** Has anyone else observed that Riddle is going to be half a dozen kinds of furious at Rigel about this? Not only did he completely undermine the political objective of having a pureblood trounce all contestants, by revealing himself to be an imposter and a halfblood, with all the time and expense of running the Tournament now potentially serving the Light's interests; not only did he /still/, despite that revelation, block Riddle from ever introducing discriminatory legislation again; not only did he potentially flip Snape's allegiance and cost the Party an agent inside Hogwarts; as well as all that, he also revealed that the terrorist Voldemort is another version of Riddle (remember, Voldemort not only looked like a younger Riddle, he also complained about Harry using the name Riddle) /and/ that he's half-blood too!

No doubt some of the Party members will persuade themselves it's not true, but there will be other, more thoughtful members who quietly realise that it's plausible. Riddle's best evidence for being the heir of Slytherin is his Parseltongue, but /half-blood/ Rigel Black is a Parselmouth too (whoever Rigel actually was, his Parseltongue ability is solidly confirmed at this point, and his blood status has just been made plain). And with that evidence now shaky - "Riddle" isn't a wizarding surname, and anyone could trace him like Harry did and find the sad tale of the Gaunts. Riddle is /not/ going to be happy about Rigel turning a spotlight on his own blood status like this.
