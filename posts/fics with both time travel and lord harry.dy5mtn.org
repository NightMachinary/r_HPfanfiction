there was a post a bit ago about your favorite tropes and it got me thinking. time travel and lord harry are my top two favorites so i was wondering if there were fics that had both!


** I think Linkffn(Delenda est). It's been a long time since I've read this and I might be getting it mixed up with the Azkaban one.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** In Triple Trouble, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12983913/chapters/29683959]]) Dark Lord Potter travels back to '91 before his sorting in his 11 year old body. Thing is Voldemort and Grindlewald also travel back in time too.

** I just read linkffn(12125771), which definitely has both, though I can't say I'd recommend it if you're looking for a serious story, and the author doesn't make much effort to explain the crossover elements to anybody who's unfamiliar with Stargate Atlantis.

*** As someone that was unfamiliar with Stargate I can say, that is not really true.At least for me. He explains easily enough that I understood everything that was happening. Same goes for all the other crossovers he wrote by the way. Most don't seem like they would work (HP/Jurrassic Park, HP/Hawaii Five-0) but they were really fun reads. "Harry Potter: Geth" and "Harry and a Vampire" being by far the best in my opinion.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
