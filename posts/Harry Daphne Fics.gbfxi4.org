[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8274039/1/A-Different-Kind-of-Magic][A different kind of Magic]] Luckily I found this fic, and I really liked it, but the author stopped writing and there are only 4 Chapters. There was no update since September 2012. I really wanted to read further but cannot, so I was just thinking if anyone has read this then he or she can suggest me some some fics that are similar to this one.. Please I really want a fic quite similar to this one. P.S For those who haven't read this: In a gist it's a 4th year fic, in which Harry meets Daphne near the lake(because he was pissed off with everything, his name came out of goblet, ron and Hermione bailed on him). There encounter was not very friendly as the ice queen was not friendly, but as the story continues Harry falls for her but she doesn't give him a chance (every time she yells at her or just doesn't shows interest).. So yeah I was just looking for a fic where Daphne doesn't give a crap about Harry but Harry tries hard to win her friendship and she doesn't shows interest, but as the story she continues she starts noticing him nad then they become friends and ultimately she also falls for her..... something like that...


** Can you give a little more information on what you liked about it? There's a lot of daphne fics out there, so if you give a few details about what you liked, people who haven't read this one in particular would help.

**** Alright. So a fic where she's colder towards Harry at the start, in Hogwarts, and ends up with them together, more or less?

****** Just wanted to double check - because sometimes, people have just one aspect they're really looking for (eg, just the coldness towards Harry and not limited to Hogwarts).

I haven't read any that specifically match up with those constraints (or that stuck in my mind as good) - however, maybe take a look through the long lists of fics here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dq95en/harrydaphne_compilation/]]

It's the most comprehensive list of HarryxDaphne fics I could find on the subreddit. If you scroll down in the comments, each of the fics gets a call from the ffnbot, so you can read the various descriptions.

** “A Most Peculiar Girl“ is similar. Sadly, it is just a oneshot linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356003/1/A-Most-Peculiar-Girl]])

Then maybe these stories by James Spookie: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8678295/1/Things-We-Do-For-Love]]) linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5598642/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrothal-Contract]])

Not exactly like that, but still a great oneshot with a cold Daphne in the beginning: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8230512/1/A-Very-Good-Reason]])

  With some amount of horror, Daphne realized that she could not remember the last time she had even protested his presence. When had that happened? Was Harry Potter her...friend?

  It's been done, but here's my shot at the old Marriage Contract type story. Harry and Daphne Greengrass find out their parents put together a marriage contract when they were born, now they must deal with it.

  Harry looked hard at her for a moment, and then asked "what would you do if I was your friend?" The question took her totally off-guard and she stared at him for a few seconds. Then, in a strange voice, she replied "I don't know Potter."
