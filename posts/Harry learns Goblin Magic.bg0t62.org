Hi all, I am an avid Harry Potter fan, I was wondering if you have any recommendations for stories where Harry is taught Goblin Magic? This means using Goblin Runes, Language and not using a wand at all.


** For future reference, you'll get more replies and recommendations if you properly flair your post.

Try posting again, but with the 'Request' flair.

The recommendation flair that you used is for when /you're/ recommending that other people read a story.

** I've seen plenty fics where the Goblins teach Harry various things, but from the top of my head the only one I can suggest right now is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337/chapters/4677915][Gringott's lesser known branch]] . In which Harry grows up in Gringott before attending Hogwarts. It's a bit clich√© with Harry being all cunning and political at 11 etc. There is a bit of bashing, I think. But the Goblin aspect is very interesting from what I remember.
