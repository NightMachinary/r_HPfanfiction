The story begins with an elderly Harry & Fleur--wherein Fleur is already dying. Harry follows soon after and when next he wakes he is young again. As the story goes on it turns out Fleur was also transported back in time. They then probe each other trying to find out if the other also time-travelled.


** I have a notepad file copy with 54 chapters I got from a fellow user here (fanficarchive). It's been suggested I upload to dropbox, but I've never used it before and I haven't found the time to try work it out (It's probably obvious, but tech is not my strong suit).

Anyway, would you like me to add you to the list-to-let-know when I finally get that worked out and uploaded?

EDIT - if anyone else reading also wants it, comment here and I'll add your username to the list to notify when I get it uploaded. I'll probably just post a link to this sub and do the mention alert thing for any usernames.

It seems like a fanfiction downloader, not an uploader? Or am I misinterpreting something? I literally just have a txt file with all 54 chapters on one file - the original FFNet posted thing is deleted. If I can do anything with that on ffebook, I don't understand how to it.

** So, thanks to a PM that reminded me that GoogleDrive existed, I don't have to try to work out DropBox to post this. For those who haven't seen the other thread, this is a link to a Harry/Fleur time-travel story by Izwan that got deleted a while back due to reviewers being dickbags.

It's a txt file, unfortunately, but it's well-formatted so the usual issue of incomprehensible block-text isn't a problem.

Apparently I can't mention more than three per comment or it doesn't work, so apologies in advance for the first comments being all tags from me. I promised to update some folks when I posted this, I'm not spamming.
