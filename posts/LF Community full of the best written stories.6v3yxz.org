I want to go through a bunch of high quality stories. I'm tired of reading stories that look interesting only to be completely murdered by the writing. Preferably really long stories too.

Note: I already checked out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/]] and there doesn't seem to be too many stories that are at a length I would like.


** If you don't mind me stroking a dick or two, [[/r/HPFanfiction]] has compiled a pretty decent list of fanfiction from all genres/pairings/plots and is available in our wiki.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/new][Introduction]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/431b2q/harry_potter_fanfiction_an_updated_introduction/][Longer Introduction]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3d40r7/guide_so_you_wish_you_had_more_harry_potter_the/][DEFINITIVE Guide for Beginners]]

And, finally, the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index][Index]], which contains the best of ships, character-centric, general recommendations, most recommended, crossovers, and genres.

**** I never understood why it says 32 stories in the description of the community but I can only see about 15. Do I have to do something special?

** I would recommend Fanfiction.net author ShayaLonnie. She has a variety of different ships, many completed stories and they're all a nice length with good writing. Her fanfics are honestly my favourite. She's also on ao3 if you prefer to read there.

** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/#library.2]]

Click through their library to find stories. They have a rating system. 4 and 5 star stories is what they consider good.

They have a particular taste. Let me put it like this, Some of the things I like, they would rate very low, but I have to acknowledge that everything /they/ like is stuff I would definitely call high-quality.
