** "OH DARLING what a /charmant/ mask!"

The middle-aged muggle ran up to him, gently clutching his face between her soft hands. "But this cloak just won't do at all, it just hides that GORGEOUS bod. Come on, off with it."

Utterly confused, the young man, not one inclined to much thought and used to taking orders first from his strict mother and father, then from his terrifying Cell Leader, undid the clasp, letting his robe fall.

"Mmmm, you are a pretty one. The rough linen, the leather, it suits you. Let me take some photos!"

Michael had almost regained his self control and was picking up his cloak when she bustled back in carrying a large camera and - he didn't see how - activating lights brighter than any domestic lighting charm.

She had him pose this way and that, without his shirt on, with it on ("Hmmm, I think ... yes ... you need to work out more sweetie ... interesting tattoo").

Eventually she seemed to calm down, and running a long slender finger over his chest she changed his life. "With these designs I can make you rich beyond your dreams".

None in the Ministry yet knew it, but London Fashion Week 1996 was the doom of Voldemort, because Vivienne Westwood got the design to the Intellectual Property Office first, and she could afford better lawyers.

** Said muggle (He feels like a "Steve" to me) was super excited. Finally Elon Musk's promised flame thrower was here.

Steve was in his garage, flaming things up that were unnecessary.

The DE comes, into the garage, ready to start spelling everything to move and tap dance and rattle, to scare the muggle.

Steve sees two dolls tap dancing and uses the brand new flame thrower against them.

The DE now shits his pant. The muggle's 'wand' is larger and his fire spell is deadlier.

Steve sees a man, wielding his wooden controller and operate the dolls, and fires at the wooden stick, which of course catches fire dutifully, like any well raised kindling should.

The DE is now terrified and runs screaming. Can't even buy a new wand, coz Ollivander is in that idiot blonde ponce's dungeons.

He sells the gold in his pockets to a muggle jeweler. He runs to turkey. His money will last him longer.

FYI: Steve on the other hand is a lovable geek, who acted quicker than he would have, because he had a horror movie marathon with his buds, and they d watched both Chucky and Annabelle.

*** I can see a Muggle-born wizard/witch talking to his/her father/grandfather/uncle/or other male who is in their late forties or fifties and in the know about the wizarding world. The Magical kid is telling their relative about Voldie & the Death Eaters and how they are targeting Muggle-borns and their families. This older male relative had fought in Korea and decides to get in touch with his old friends for help. He finds out that his old friend Hannibal is working as a soldier of fortune. (Canon The A-Team TV Show Hannibal fought in Korea) He brings The A-Team to Britain to help defend his family from these Terrorists.

We find out that all 4 members of the team are wizards but none of them know about the others. Hannibal and his mastery of disguise is a Metamorphmagus. BA and his ability with motors is a form of technomancy (taught in the US but not Britain) Face and his ability to con most anyone are strong Compulsion charms. I can see Murdock as a quidditch player who took to many bludgers to the head. His ability to survive any of his crashes and to also keep the others from being seriously hurt as magic of some sort. As well as his ability to fly things that are not in any condition to fly.
