As title says, any fics where Harry was supposed to get an introductory letter as a muggleraised, finds out he didnt get one, and it has some sort of consequense? Bashing is welcome.


** "OMG, Harry Potter is dead. Attendance at Hogwarts is required, not doing so is like breaking an unbreakable oath!" McGonagall cried, "And I messed up on his letter because I was looking at a Quidditch Magazine! He never knew! I sent his letter by mistake to some boy named Party Otter!"

*** Meh canon is standard letter, with no information about the magical worlds laws, regulations, magical information, and other pertinent information :) all sorts of things a fanon-competent introduction might include :D

**** Exactly my point.

Harry, in canon, didn't get any sort of introductory package :D

***** Ahh i see what you mean now. Sadly we never see any direct consequenses of it beeing withheld from him (or him even finding out its a thing)

****** I was thinking "what about canon" as well tbh.

I mean, Harry gets a ton of letters sent and then Hagrid goes along to "explain." Which he does epically badly.

Hermione gets McG to go along and explain, which probably explains a lot. I bet Minerva pointed her towards some useful books - the ones she mentions on the train for a start - and explained some shit to her.

I think the direct consequence of this is seen throughout canon - Harry is left to sink or swim. Ok Hermione is more into books than him and will have done her research. But she clearly had a grounding from a competent adult witch, whereas Harry got "Slytherins bad, Gryffindor good, here's an owl, work out how to get on the platform yourself." There's repercussions to that all the way through.
