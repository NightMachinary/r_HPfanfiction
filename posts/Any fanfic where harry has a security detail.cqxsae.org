I know this may sound like a strange request but I'm looking for any fanfics where Harry has bodyguards or something similar for whatever reason, whether it's because he is the Boy-who-lived (AKA Saviour of the wizarding world) or for any other reason (An example being Harry being the last heir of the Potter/Peverell family - that's bound to hold some value right?). I just think it would be a hilarious scenario if Harry had gone about his daily life in Hogwarts surrounded by security, I think it would have made things a lot easier. Thanks!


** ...I now have the hilarious mental image of Harry being the unwilling recipient of many, many games of "Get Down Mr. President!" Especially from the Twins.

*** At least he's not Donald Potter.

"Donald, duck!" Would get old *fast*.

Kind of a funny Super Harry fic

  When Tonks is forced to go undercover as Harry's bodyguard at Hogwarts, chaos ensues. Who ever said that fighting Dark Lords couldn't be fun? Slow-building Harry/Tonks. Fifth year. Rated M for crude humor and a few adult situations.
