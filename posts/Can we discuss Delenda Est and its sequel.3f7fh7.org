I feel like it started off incredibly promising then dovetailed once it went back to the future. There was a massive tonal shift and I don't think it worked. That's not to say it was bad, I definitely enjoyed the first story very much.

Also I think that for all the talk of it being canon before the time travel everyone acts very OOC. Harry never actually gives a decent reason not to go to Dumbledore nor is it explained why Bellatrix is so different in the past.

That's another thing, didn't like the characterisation of the Black family, it was way too tame and I didn't see them kicking Sirius out a year after the end of the past section.

As for the sequel, I think it's terrible. No need for it and the dimension travel is jarring and again everyone is OOC. Also I despise the super edgy Black Triplets^{TM.}

What did everyone else think of it?

Yeah this pretty much describes how I feel about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it (Well for the most part) up until it went back to the future. I stopped reading shortly after and didn't bother with the sequel. However it remains to this day one of my favourite pieces of Fanfiction. Most of the past with Harry affecting it was fantastic.

I feel like this was a great idea with brilliant execution, up until a certain stage. Then it went downhill. Fast.

** I think the overall idea of the story is great, with the double time travel. I also think the method of time travel is canon-like plausible and the best I've seen done in fics.

I really enjoyed the time Harry spent in the past as a teacher, it was very interesting to see him interacting with the students. Even if some of the reasoning for things was wanting. Like you I think the story lost a lot of focus, the ghost of Harry Ashworth bit especially.

I actually liked young Bella. I liked seeing how she was an intelligent fierce girl looking for a cause, and Harry gave her one before she fell into Voldemort's camp.

Overall I think the fic is a very good one, and with a rewrite to clean up some of the sloppy bits, and a few tweaks to the characterization it could join the undisputed pinnacles of HPFF.

*** Young Bellatrix was easily the best part. While I enjoyed the back to the future part well enough, I did find it lacking. It is far from the worst fanfic I've ever read. Very far. So that's good.

I'd love a spin off with Harry being stuck in the past as a teacher. Skip the whole time travel back to the future and just focus on the first Voldemort war with Bellatrix side kick/love interest.

The way that Voldemort didn't die yet still lost all his power for a decade particularly irked me.

Haven't read the sequel yet because I dislike reading ongoing works. Especially ones with update times in the months or even years. I forget things that happen.

That for me was the start of Harry being so stupidly powerful the rest of the story was just treading water until he could be bothered taking down Voldemort.

** I liked it as a whole, but Bellatrix and Harry (to a bit of a lesser extent) becoming as hyper competent as they are once they got to the future at everything and it just wasn't quite as good as the past parts. Voldemort also didn't feel like a threat and almost nothing had changed since they jumped to the future which I found ridiculous. It's easier to say what I didn't like than what I did because there's a lot less. I like the elder Malfoys and Blacks, but I always wonder wtf happened to Regulus? He never appeared, he might have been mentioned a time or two, but they never really talk about him being with Voldemort and he never made the switch with the locket.

The sequel isn't nearly as good. It has a few moments, but it's overall a lot more boring than the original.

** I don't have anything to add and I agree! Interesting premise and start, but then it's fanfiction colors showed.

** I would have preferred that, instead if a sequel, there was a spin-off where Harry and Bellatrix aren't sent to the future.
