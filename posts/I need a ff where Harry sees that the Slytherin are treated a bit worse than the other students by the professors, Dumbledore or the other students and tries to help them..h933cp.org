•Like when they were told to go back to their dormitories despite the fact that the Slytherin's is in the dungeon where the troll is supposed to be •Or when they try to be nice to firsties and are snarled at because the others think they want to insult or harm them •Or when in arguments they are get punished but really didn't start it and everyone knew that

I would like Harry to see that and wants to help their image. He gets to know them and sees that they are just like him. Children. Teenagers. Who try to survive in a school where everyone thinks they are evil because of a colour like when everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin just because he could talk to snakes. Who have fun, are happy, are sad, cry and are afraid just like everyone else and don't talk in that swollen, heavy "Well met heir Zabini, it is a glorious day, isn't it?" speak.


** I'm currently co-writing a fic that explores some bias against Slytherins. They also talk like normal people, lol, although their way of thinking is not particularly comprehensible to Harry in the beginning, he befriends a Slytherin who kind of... opens up his narrow thinking.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
