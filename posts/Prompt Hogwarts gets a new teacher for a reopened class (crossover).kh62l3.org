As the 1990--1991 school year is almost over, the teachers notised that there is a high demand from the fifth years for an alchemy class course to take in their N.E.W.T. level.

They didn't have an Alchemy teacher ready so Dumbledore just hired one.

The teacher's name: Edward Elric

Quit with the low-effort prompts.
