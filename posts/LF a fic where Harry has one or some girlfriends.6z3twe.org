Not at the same time in a harem way. But basically a fic where he has a normal childhood and is popular with the girls. Preferably not ginny or Hermione.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** linkffn(7659033) In the they shook hands series harry befriends malfoy in diagon alley and becomes a slytherin. The main plot is very similar to canon, but harry is more social and befriends a lot of people. he also has relationships with different girls and has dates with a couple more. he gets his first girlfriend in third year and a couple different ones later.

linkffn(12240216) in rogues bet harry was raised by sirius in a world without voldemort. the story takes place in seventh year and has Harry who is quite popular with the girls attempt to woo daphne. This is the most normal harry story I know.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.
