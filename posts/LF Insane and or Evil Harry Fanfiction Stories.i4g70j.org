Looking for some good stories where Harry is an Evil and or insane person who enjoys being that way much like in the story The Black Ashikabi by Grimheart [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10777989/1/The-Black-Ashikabi]]

Any similar type stories to this would be greatly appreciated thanks.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** I read Linkffn(12867536) a couple of weeks ago. I've read Black Princess and even that fic didn't even begin to reach the level of malevolence of this one. The Downward Spiral Series is exactly what you want in an Evil!Harry fic. There aren't as many dark rituals, but Harry and his love interest (I won't spoil it) are enamored with torture. I admit that even for someone like me, it can get too brutal sometimes, but it's an evil!Harry fic. He will harm innocents rather than just people who deserve it. He also sides with Voldemort and the Death Eaters are protagonists. The first couple of chapters are weak, but it gets better.

*** I appreciate the suggestion, I think I just found the next fic I'll be reading. It sounds exactly like the kind of thing I'm looking for.

** Linkao3(Antithesis)

Someone else recommended this a few days ago in a different thread. I'm in the last stretch of reading it. It's... interesting. Very fucked up, and decently written. I can't say that I've enjoyed it, but it's kept me hooked for the past couple days.

It's not exactly what you're looking for, as Harry doesn't exactly enjoy being the way he is. Sometimes it seems like he does, at other times he's miserable, though where I'm at now he seems to be accepting, though still not happy.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
