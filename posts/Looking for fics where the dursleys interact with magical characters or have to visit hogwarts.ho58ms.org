I remember reading one fic where the dursleys had to be brought to grimmauld place on Christmas day and the Weasley's saw Vernon shouting at harry.

Am also interested in any fics where someone finds out about the Dursleys neglect or abuse. Preferably hogwarts age rather than younger, but I've read most of the ones I've found on thus sub so am happy to take anything! TIA!

*** Huh, I wonder why they split it by years on AO3, but not FFN

**** I think it's because of AO3's series feature.

  Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. AU.Harry and Dudley's first year at Hogwarts. Highlights include bullying, subversive tactics, new friends, and misplaced magical objects.

** Of course, the biggest of them is linkffn(The Day The Dursleys Came To Hogwarts by ordinaryguy2).

However, I like even the more positive ones like how they are described in stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs Granger]].

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
