We all know that when Voldemert's killing curse was reflected back at him after casting it on young Harry Potter in 1981, he inadvertently created a horcrux that was bound to Harry. However, a second horcrux was made that night as well. A sliver of Harry's soul fractured from the whole and bound itself to Voldemort's wraith. Now, neither can die while the other lives.
