I was wondering if y'all have read any good fics where the Malfoy's have a daughter, could be older or younger than Draco. It seems like such a cool concept to read, so please tell me if you've read any and the fic name. Thanks!


** You'll be the death of me is pretty good! I haven't read it in years.

** If you're strong enough to read an abandoned fic, I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]]. It's a self-insert in the body of Draco's sister. Super great and I like how it takes on political theory.

** There's linkffn(A Life Twice Lived) which has draco sent back in time to a female version of himself. A bit odd, but its a wonderful book; the author's other works are also wonderful, too.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
