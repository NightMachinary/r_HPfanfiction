In the last few fics I've read, slytherin!harry or gryffindor!draco or whoever just don't make friends for ages and get bullied for not fitting in. I don't like it, it's depressing and not very believable. They're eleven, I'm sure they'd figure out how to make friends!

So does anyone have fic recs where a character goes to another house and does has a good time? Preferably with Draco or Hermione in them. And no adultXchild pairings or wealsey-bashing pls thanks


** Quite a different Harry (Harriett actually), but she does well for herself and befriends Draco and Pansy in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense).

As for Hermione - well, she's around, but not at Hogwarts. Things get complicated on that front!

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** linkffn(Magical Relations) (IIRC) has Slytherin Harry with friends, and kids that actually act like kids instead of mini politician chessmasters. Abandoned last I remember though :(

** I've spent a lot of time trawling the Internet for Slytherin!Hermione fic. My conclusion is that there is a crap-tonne of decently written Dramione fic in which Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, and the only downside for the vast majority of those is that the whole fic takes place in a Bizzarro-Potterverse in which Slytherins don't have any real blood-prejudice, and Gryffindors are the ones throwing "mudblood" around. I think /Green Girl/ is the most popular one. (And yes, Weasleys usually get bashed, along with Dumbledore.)

Complaining aside, there are some Slytherin!Hermione fics that do avoid that pitfall:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic, but I've gotten some indication that the author is getting out of fanfiction altogether, so it will probably never be finished.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl): Ron isn't portrayed in the best possible light, but at one point I feel that he even comes off as a sympathetic victim of Slytherin bullying. Updates rapidly. A bit sueish.
- linkao3(Brilliant, but Scary by Free Range Snallygaster (RemedialAction)): VoldemortsUnknowingDaughter!Slytherin!Hermione+Slytherin!Harry that does as well.
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen): Slytherin!Hermione+Slytherin!Harry; probably abandoned.

Surprisingly, there is a dearth of Ravenclaw!Hermione fic in which she isn't treated like crap.

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): the best one I know: it's what HPMOR /should/ have been. Updates very slowly.

  Hermione Granger is special. She's always known it, really, even before she received her letter that informed her she was a witch, and even before she could do the little tricks that kept away the bullies and left her time for her books. It was too bad, of course, that she had never met anyone quite as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to a right and proper school for witches and wizards.And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

** Scrambled Sorting: linkffn(13256350)

Basically /everyone/ gets Sorted into a different House than canon because the Hat thought House rivalries were getting out of hand. After an initial adjustment period, /eventually/ most people get along fine afterwards.

Fair warning, it's an unabashed crackfic.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
