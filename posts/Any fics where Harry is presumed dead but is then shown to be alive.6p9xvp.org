  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  What will the Wizarding world do when it's reported that Harry Potter is dead? The answer might surprise you. (Based off an idea by Rorschach's Blot, and written/posted with his knowledge.)

** "Mine" and "Hauntingly" by ObsidianPen, which are part of the "Haunted and Hunted" series. Voldemort realizes Harry is his horcrux and kidnaps him, then doesn't tell anyone about it. Even has his death eaters look for him. And his prison, when it's revealed, is really unique in fanfiction.

Despite the underage dub-con in the first story, the second is hilarious. Harry doesn't spend the story as a captive getting raped (a worry which kept me from reading it for a long time). It's full of laugh out loud moments without being crack and great canon twists on the sixth and seventh books. It does well with portraying the forms of friendship, love, and power. "Hauntingly" also ends beautifully. HP/LV slash.
