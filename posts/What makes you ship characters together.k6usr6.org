When you are coming up with a new pairing to read about (could be one you think would actually do well together or one that you are just curious to see how would play out) how do you choose them?

Do you look for people that seem to have similar personalities? Similar interests? Opposite personalities? Were already friends in canon?

Examples of pairings you like to read about and explanations appreciated!


** Honestly, my 'ships' tend to just be pairings that I think have a fun or interesting dynamic and that varies depending on what characters are involved (the dynamic has to fit the characters as well as being fun and/or interesting) and how the writer writes them. I'm not sure if that's very clear, so to give some examples and explanations as requested:

My Harry-Fleur preference tends to be more passionate and tumultuous (think the Lie I've Lived end of things, rather than the His Angel end) because I like the back-and-forth and up-and-down of it all and I tend to favour that kind of mutual support and life-propulsion in ships generally anyway, but I find it works particularly well with the kind of Fleur those fics write.

My Harry-Hermione preference tends to be more of a partnership - the two of them, back-to-back, taking on the rest of the world together. That dynamic of exchange and 'specialised roles' type teamwork where they both play different parts in their partnership is fun and interesting. That's for both M/F and F/F, btw. :)

Harry-Luna is just comfortable and accepting and sometimes a little sad, but wise and poignant throughout. Can see them curling up in front of a roaring fire, having a quiet evening with a book and a crossword after a long trek through some rainforest somewhere. Same with Hermione-Luna or Ginny-Luna. Luna pulls people out of their comfort zone, reveals some truths, then goes and relaxes comfortably, all without blinking or really noticing any of it.

Harry-Bellatrix tends to be the time-travel 'fix the hurt' dynamic of Delenda Est where Bellatrix is a bit damaged and Harry is a bit patient and it's all nice in the end and has that partnership element from the Harry-Hermione pairings too.

The few Harry-Draco fics I've enjoyed have tended to have a very confident Harry and a very baffled Draco, with their dynamic being a lot more... stumbling. That relationship knocking Draco out of his assured-superiority worldview and their dynamic basically developing as he recovers from that is something I enjoy reading.

The two Harry-Voldemort fics I've enjoyed have both taken the same 'getting to know the man behind the mask' approach and both have a similar 'Voldemort and Harry have the same fucked up sense of humour' vibe. I enjoyed that "We're not so different, you and I... we're both utter dicks" thing they went for. :D

I haven't really read a lot of femslash that isn't fem!Harry, so a lot of the dynamics tend to be pretty similar to the straight pairings, since the characters are rarely all that changed.

*** Ahh u put that well. There are def dif dynamics that can make each work. Passionate/tumultuous vs partnership with specialized roles vs dark similar past and humor. Any recs on Tom/Harry, fleur/Harry with that dynamic u mentioned, Hermione/Harry with the partnership angle?

**** I haven't gotten my Harry-Hermione fics resorted into folders yet (long story, but basically I have a big filing system of internet bookmarks and everything went horribly wrong while I was trying to Calibre them, so now I have a couple thousand fics in a folder and I have to recreate my filing system from scratch), so I can't find any actual pairing fics with that dynamic, but the perfect non-pairing example of that dynamic is Stages of Hope.

The two Tom-Harry fics I've enjoyed are Like a Ghost in my Town and Full Circle. Like a Ghost in my Town is a series - the first one is alright (I didn't particularly enjoy it), but the second one is the one I prefer (and it's very, very different to the first, so if you don't enjoy Stand Against the Moon, do try Nose Against the Wind - you'll pick up the backstory pretty quickly).

For Harry-Fleur, there's The Lie I've Lived, Ingenio Ab Artifex, Si Vis Pacem, and possibly When A Veela Cries. There's definitely more, but those are the ones I have to hand (again, I'm still resorting my collection).

I can't directly link Ingenio ab Artifex due to mild violation of rule 8 (very, very mild - to the effect of 'we went upstairs and had a great half an hour' - and Fleur starts off with no idea Harry is underage and is horrified when she finds out) so the first link below is to the author's profile (JaimeJabs).

When A Veela Cries is sort of it, but flips around a bit for plot reasons.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

I'm a fan of Harry/Hermione/Luna as well, because between the three of them they keep each other balanced, and have some startling similarities when you get down to it.

**** Thank you. I'm glad it made sense to people - I wasn't entirely sure if it would. :D

I totally agree on Harry/Hermione/Luna. I think Faery Heroes put that one best in that bit where Harry talks about the trio's relationship (Chapter 14, if you wanna read it), but the balance meets similarities thing you said pretty much summarises it. :)

There are so many interesting ships out there, and there's usually at least one writer writing them with a dynamic I enjoy (even if only as background characters).

** Well if we talk about Harry Potter in specific I generally go for slytherin/slytherin or gryfindor/slytherin. An example would be daphne greengrass/ Harry Potter, For that particular ship I think it's because Daphne was seen as very cold in most fanfics involving her and Harry is Harry. I can also why and why not they would work out which makes it more interesting for me. An example of a Harry/Daphne fanfiction is:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1865182][The Eight Year Universe by Holz9364 and Mort623]]

It is a series with 4 pieces and it had an interesting plot.

** I ship Harry/Ron and Harry/Ginny because in my opinion they have great chemistry, similar sense of humour (which we know Harry values greatly, maybe more so than anything else), they enjoy each other's company, have similar interests and fairly similar attitudes and values (like family).

Harry and Ron are fiercely protective of each other, and the fact that Ron was the one Harry would miss the most adds to it. They encourage each other; Harry encourages Ron to improve his Quidditch skills even though everyone see him as hopeless. Ron takes his brothers to Little Whinging in a flying car in the middle of the night, fully well that he broke the law and would anger his mum, because Harry, a kid he'd known for less than a year, wasn't answering his letters. They're a bromance turned romance.

As for Harry and Ginny, she has the temperament that can bring Harry out of a dark mood. She doesn't make a big deal out if things, for instance their temporary break-up. She gets him and the way he thinks, as she clearly states just at that same moment. She is strong enough to not back down even when Harry is in one of his rages, and she's not afraid of his temper, unlike many others. He is willing to open up to her when he didn't want to talk to anyone (the Easter egg scene in OotP), and rather than dismissing him, or nag, like Hermione would have done, she waits for him to speak, and then she finds a solution. I do wish we could see more of their relationship in canon, though, and how Harry is good for her, but he's the narrator, so we don't see her perspective that well.

** I look for those that are chaotic but together can be an unstoppable team. They support each other and they are willing to bend their morals for the other.

Also, the enemies to allies to lovers, slow burn. They both noticed they have a common goal, why be enemies if they can work together? That completely buys me.

**** I've been reading a lot of those kinds in Ao3, my favorites are the old ones that are basically novels or series with the number of words and the amazing world-building but there are some new fics there that are actually really good. Just look in the tags and you'll find them.

If I can remember one I'll let you know.

** Reading a really good fic with that pairing is all it takes for me to fall in love with it BUT only if I don't already ship that character with another one. So, if I already like Luna/Cho Chang (Just an example) Even if I read the most amazing Luna/Neville fic I probably just won't like it as much.

It's pretty weird but my head just does that and now I'm stuck with some weird pairings like Pansy/Hermione (I guess there are more rare pairings, but still).

My favorite one is Harry/Daphne (The moment I read Ice cream just sold me out, even though most of them are bad), but since there's so many of them I'm not running out of them soon.

I still can read other pairings like Harry/Hermione and actually like a lot of them, but it's just not the same for me anymore.

** I prefer canon or canon complaint couples and I only ever read Slytherin romances... Lucius/Narcissa, Bellatrix/Rodolphus or Bellatrix/Voldemort, or other Death Eaters with OCs that fit into canon, Draco/Astoria, etc.

I think the reason for that is because when you have "good" characters-- people who are kind (or at least kindly-intentioned), honest, attractive (in looks AND personality)-- it's simple to pair them with anyone: lovable people are easy to love. I find it boring to read about yet another person falling in love with Hermione or Harry.

A good Slytherin romance on the other hand should focus on dark, complex characters who somehow still manage to feel love for one another amidst so much hatred. I think it's fascinating.

*** Why only canon couples? Just curious.

I love how you phrase that: lovable people are easy to love. It's simple to pair them with anyone. I so agree but I would not have been able to pinpoint why. I love dark complex characters and seeing how they are viewed through the other persons eyes. It's also exciting and interesting to have dark or morally grey characters. And I like that you said Slytherin/Slytherin because while I do like interhouse relationships...some of the fics can be very “good person falls for bad person because they think they can fix them” (a very common trope in general) which I don't care for because it feels unfair to both people involved.

Do you have any good Bellatrix/Voldemort, Bellatrix/Rodolphus, Death Eater/OC, Draco/Astoria fics to rec?

**** I like canon because the thing that appeals most about fanfic for me is filling in the gaps of a story I love rather than telling a totally different story with familiar characters. Just personal preference, nothing wrong with other ships and plot lines!

Agree that trying to just turn someone good is generally disastrous. Even in 'canon' fics I see it a lot in Lucius/Narcissa stories. People are convinced that she's good, married to this much more evil man, but I don't buy it. I think he was more outwardly violent, but I think her beliefs were every bit as harmful as his.

I do have recommendations! They are all very M rated though (hey... I said I like romances haha)

Draco/Astoria rec: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5564695/1/Dirty-Little-Secret][Dirty Little Secret by JustAudrey07]] it's not Cursed Child compliant since it was published in 2009, but I love how willful and difficult both of them are in this story.

Bellatrix/Voldemort (and kind of Rodolphus too): I've recommended this story so many times now that I feel like I'm practically spamming the subreddit but EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT it's so good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11682174/chapters/26295996][surrogate by 17734]]

Bellatrix/Rodolphus: There is not a lot of good Bella/Rod out there as a focus. In fact I think a realistic portrayal of them is really too dark to be posted on ff... and you'll see that if you try to search them there. The top non-AU stories have them as a background couple, they just aren't very popular. That said, an author call Sionnain used to write them in the early 2000's and they were gritty and dark and obsessive. Not sure where those can be dug up though.

If you want to try your luck with Wayback Machine and have the patience for a lot of dead links, there used to be this fantastic site around ~2006 called [[https://toujourspur.com][toujourspur.com]] that was exclusively dedicated to Black family fiction and it was great. I've managed to unearth one smutty B/R one shot by Kirixchi that sort of encapsulates how I picture them: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20041111164411/http://www.toujourspur.com/viewstory.php?sid=248]]

I don't have any specific stories that come to mind for a Death Eater/OC... I just sort of like it as a background couple. I like seeing mentions of Theodore Nott's parents, descriptions of Evan Rosier's romances before he was killed, Rabastan before prison, etc!

** I'm a sucker for enemies to friends to lovers. When I started in this fandom I got really hooked on Draco and Harry and then I fell out of that and started reading Tom Riddle/Harry fics. Mostly AUs and time travel stories where he never becomes Voldemort. I also love friends to lovers but I don't really have any of those pairings in this fandom but I was absolutely obsessed with Steve/Bucky from the mcu at one point.

**** Anything by this author. They only has a handful of Tom/Harry, mostly stick to Draco/Harry but I like reading this person's fics. There's one Tom/Harry one that's currently a work in progress. It's a soulmate AU and I like it. All the other ones for the pairing are complete and I would recommend any

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lomonaaeren]]

Also I see in another comment you like slow burns but this next author has a lot of light hearted short fics and I really enjoy her Tom/Harry. This person's sense of humor matches my own nicely

** Here's two of my favorites atm:

- Katie/Marcus. They're opposite in personality and house. Forbidden love. I like the idea of Marcus changing sides because he loves Katie so much. And, I dunno, I think it's interesting. And I'm kinda a sucker for younger girl/older guy

- Percy/Luna. She's totally opposite to him and it's interesting to read about their dynamic together. I also like Percy to be paired with Katie
