** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but I really like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/][Realizations]]. The gist of it is that the Dursleys move to Australia and abandon Harry, who goes to live at the Leaky Cauldron for the summer - but he ends up using a disguise, so the whole Wizarding World considers Harry "missing".

He doesn't technically leave the Wizarding World, but he does leave his role as the famous Harry Potter, so I think it has a lot of the same appeal. (Plus he does make some Muggle friends and I love their whole plotline).

The plot gets a bit convoluted towards the end but it's really good overall imo, I hope you like it!

#+begin_quote
  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

** Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash Well written nuanced eventual friendship fic that deals with Harry's ptsd growth as a person and his adult reasons for leaving the Wizarding world highly recommend it. It's not edgy at all.

  Thanks to a special interest in Muggle culture, Pansy comes across something rather interesting on the internet: someone who looks very much like Harry Potter is posting videos of himself dancing on YouTube under the name "Evan James".But Harry Potter has been missing and unheard of for years. They say he couldn't take the fame and he'd just up and left the UK behind, with rumour placing him somewhere on the Continent. When Pansy shows Draco one of the videos, something ... well, awakens in him. Something he had very much tried to move on from and forget---that he has loved Harry Potter ever since they were fourteen.Pansy convinces Draco that it's time he travels to Ibiza to find Harry and "shoot his shot", once and for all.

** I really can't remember the name, but there's a Drarry where Harry's tired of everything and leaves for Venice i think? And he's a DJ/YouTuber. Draco works with charity, host's big events. It's on AO3, has around 50k words if I'm not mistaken
