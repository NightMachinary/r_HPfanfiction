Either that hit their stride this year or started this year. Or even that finished this year.

I've not read any fanfic in 6+ months and I've not really been on reddit over summer.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** I really enjoyed linkffn(the dark lord never died by starfox) which started and ended this year. Starfox, a pretty active member of this community, has written a couple of pretty popular stories this year, actually.

And I'd say linkffn(Harry potter and the prince of Slytherin) really hit its stride this year.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath.

** [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] and [[/u/Starfox5]] are now my top two authors, who happen to write topics I like and update regularly.

Fics finished by them this year:

*Patron*, linkffn(11080542)

*Petrification Proliferation*, linkffn(11265467)

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146)

*The Dark Lord Never Died* is already linked by someone else.

--------------

Fics started by them this year:

*Animagus at War*, linkffn(12088294): only three chapters so far, but highly promising. The OC La Pantera is so scary and funny at same time.

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): my favorite WIP fic right now.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): not for everyone, but for those who are into a romantic Trio and WW2 naval history, it's an excellent fic.

*Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue*, linkffn(11961978): the best 'Muggle Wank' fic I've read so far, high plausible too.

--------------

Other great fics finished this year:

*A Marauder's Plan*, linkffn(8045114): 900k words covering a single year, Sirius centric

*Not From Others* by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], linkffn(11419408): best canon-compliant, Ginny centric year 7 fic by far

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): my favorite completed fic this year. Love the Trio here.

*** Piggy backing on your comment - [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] has another couple of stories that are rather delightfully good.

The Arithmancer - started in 2014, finished in 2015.

Lady Archimedes - started in 2015, going strong this year with pretty regular updates.

I believe both of these are well worth a read. I'm providing a link to Lady Archimedes, since it's the one that's currently updating.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][*If the Sun Goes Black*]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][*There Is Always the Moon*]] are really good Drarry mystery-ish fics set a few years after Hogwarts. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098). There is Always the Moon is one of the best fics I have read this year - if not the best. It is a creature fic without falling into any of the usual tropes. If you like Drarry, you will love this fic.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
