As JKR has written it, the story has always been, for me, about a young boy discovering a new world and having adventures, basically, the destination is not what counts but the path you get there from.

Too often, I've seen the tone of fanfiction to be only about making Harry powerful; a weapon. As if there is no purpose to the entire story but the fight against the Dark Lord. It isnt wrong, per se, but a lot of authors take the Harry Potter story to be "stupid" as "We see no real change to the world; even after Voldemort, bigots are still bigots, and there is still so much discrimination, so what's the point." It may be only me, but the way I see it, the series was about only and only Harry's life on a personal level, and all the different issues and pieces of knowledge about the wizarding world were steeped in his own opinions, and maybe in some cases, lack of knowledge. However, I meant to say, I feel this is the main issue that comes up in a lot of fics, by focusing entirely on Harry being the boy-who-lived, rather that being a kid who gets to know a new, magical world, gives the character a very unrealistic feel. (Seeing an eleven year old all serious and into politics and everything else).

Not really the same issue, but there are a lot of little points that are the general views of a lot of people in the community, that I'd like to hear your opinions on, the most major being the relationship between Harry and the Dursleys. Yes, I am not saying they didn't mistreat him, or work him hard, but honestly, I don't think it is nearly as terrible as the community makes it out to be. The way Harry behaves in canon, he isn't really that opposed to the way his life is (specially talking about the start of SS). I can see why so many people feel he's been horribly abused, but keeping in mind that the first few books especially were aimed at a young audience and had a lot of exaggeration for emphasis, and Harry's own way of thinking, it makes it seem like the dursleys were just strict guardians who treated him as a ward rather than a part of family (the lack of love or gifts). The first interaction we see with aunt Petunia, notice, she says "I want you to look after the bacon", implying that although he was asked to cook, it wasn't his duty, more like a chore. He *was* unhappy, I'm not saying he wasn't, he was treated like an outsider all the time, even treated /meanly/, but that's the line between being mean and abused. The biggest part of it is, he behaves like a normal kid, joking a little, well, at least sarcastically ("what's this?" "Your new school uniform" "Oh, I didn't realize it had to be so wet") to arguing ("Get the post" "Make Dudley get it"). I see parallels in the way hes treated; being made to work - chores, go to your cupboard - well, being grounded, and so on. The way he behaves, it never shows him being afraid of physical violence (by adults, not the bullies), as we see the time Vernon actually hits him takes him completely by surprise. To those referring to the frying pan incident (CoS), the way I see it, it wasn't really meant to hit him, as he very casually ducks, so there wasn't any amount of fear. I guess I'm ranting now, sorry.

Well, I'd like to hear all your views, and if you feel there's some fic that captures this theme, or near it, please share (Harry as a kid, not as a eleven year old adult forming alliances and God forbid, thinking about his actions). Thanks for reading such a long rant.


** More than love or friendship, the Harry Potter series is about /choices/. Voldemort /chose/ Harry over Neville as the threat to him, after /choosing/ to believe in the prophecy. Voldemort gives Lily the chance to live, but she /chooses/ to sacrifice herself for Harry. Harry /chose/ to argue against Slytherin, and thus became a Gryffindor, and so on and so forth.

Harry and Voldemort are dark reflections of each other. Both coming from unloving family situations, are orphans, have brother wands, and even look similar. Yet, as Dumbledore said in CoS, it is choices that define us. Voldemort chose one route, Harry the opposite. Voldemort chose to fear death, Harry chose to accept it.

Heck, the prophecy that is so important in the last couple books? Only is important because Voldemort believes it to be important. And this is what pisses me off about a shitton of fanfiction. They come up with some crap about prophecies always coming true, subjects of prophecies being bound to the prophecies and nothing else can harm them, prophecies warping reality/circumstances so they come true. Harry never faced Voldemort because some prophecy forced him, but because he chose to. He /chose/ to go after the Stone. He /chose/ to plunge into the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. He /chose/ to save Pettigrew from Lupin and Sirius. He /chose/ to stand tall and fight Voldemort in the graveyard instead of just allowing Voldemort to kill him. Harry /chose/ to go the Department of Ministries to save Sirius. Harry /chose/ to accompany Dumbledore on an attempt to gain a shard of Voldemort's soul. Harry /chose/ to leave all he knew behind and hunt for horcruxes with only his two best friends. Harry /chose/ to walk to his death to save everyone. Harry /chose/ to come back to life. Harry /chose/ to face Voldemort at the end, when everyone thought he was dead and could have fled.

Choices, free will. That is what Harry Potter is about. Not Fate making everyone its bitch.

*** I agree, but I would like to add that the concept of choices is coloured by a bizarre twist on Calvinism, as far as I've been able to determine. Dumbledore's talk of choices is oft misquoted.

#+begin_quote
  "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly *are*, far more than our abilities."
#+end_quote

So while people may /choose/ to do things, there is a strong thread of people having an essential nature that dictates those choices beforehand. This is reflected in many aspects of Rowling's world, from the cliquishness of the adult characters, to the Sorting process, to the stereotypical nature of many of the supporting characters. The Sorting in particular has some very odd social constructs built around it, and I don't think all of them are in-universe so to speak. Rowling's hangups about social structures show through, too. Your choices matter, because they show others what you /truly are/, not because the outcome is in question. Voldemort would never choose differently, it's just not in his nature to do so. These books are, from what I can tell at least, 'The Scorpion and the Frog' writ large.

There may be no overarching 'Fate' controlling the Potterverse, but you are utterly helpless in the face of your own intrinsic nature.

** I think that the tendency of many writers to focus on the weapon aspect of Harry is because they rightly point out that every member of society is handed a loaded gun that from their very first year of use, are taught the ability to brutally murder others even though it is framed as being something else (Diffindo, the Severing Curse). With that in mind, these children are generally not taught to use these incredibly powerful tools as weapons, but instead to focus on the more practical day to day uses of them. But with a class called DADA, it is always going to be in the back of their minds. Furthermore, it seems like every generation, a dark lord emerges in every society, so clearly theyre all doing a bad job about educating the next gen. Id like to see a fic where wands are not allowed use outside classrooms until graduation and even then, there are "safeties" put on the wands. (and im not talking about the Firebird Series)

As for Dursley violence, you can be desensitized to it without necessarily getting PTSD. Some of the darkest fics I have read took the abuse to the highest level possible before introducing harry to the magical world. One I can recall was pretty amazing, but I dont remember the name of it.

*** It is a very valid point, but keep in mind, magical people have a very high resistance to harm, and at least for me, magic is hugely intent based. The resistance, as i say, if you look at it the same way, when Buckbeak claws Draco, just think what the affect would be to a non magical. A huge creature, as big as, say, a horse, and with sharp talons, rearing up and putting it's claw to you, it would definitely go right through. And also, in ny mind, diffindo would be enough to maybe cause shallow cuts, but not much more, as even a (according to me) dark(ish) spell like Sectumsempra had the effect you expect with diffindo. Also, the kind of healing that the world has access to makes it a lot harder to harm unintentionally. Yes, the potential is there, but a gun is honestly a very very bad comparison, as at the core, a gun can only harm. Maybe a Swiss knife, yes, you can cut someone with it, but it's not really that easy to kill, no way without trying. And also, even though you could use a curse from a wand, you also need to know how to, and have the level of power/expertise.

I'm by no way saying it isn't a weapon, just that the society that uses it would not have this perception.

As for the Dursleys, well, what violence? That's my point, isn't it, looking at canon, you see there isn't any event that could *be* abuse, not just seen by Harry as such. The closest it comes is bullying by Dudley and his group, and the dursleys ignoring it.

**** So I would counter in this fashion. Spells can be weaker or stronger. A strong enough cutting curse can decapitate or cut someone's throat. And youre right that the healing potential is a difference, but I have already shown how that may not matter in certain circumstances.

Magical society for the most part is shown to be pretty stupid. Inbreeding really has taken a toll on them.

I think shoving an 11 year old boy into a cupboard is pretty terrible. Not to mention there are locks on the door of it right? Thats nuts. Theres no direct evidence of Vernon or Petunia beating him, but Dudley definitely did, especially with his gang.

***** The potential for harm is there, and it is a lot, but as you said, they are taught to use wands as tools. And I can see why Harry as a weapon is appealing, I myself like the plot when it's done well, just, when you take an eleven year old and then try to use this plot, it makes it very hard to believe. Training in magic, alright, it's all okay, but always, what comes with it is the /thinking/ like an adult, the maturity not present in young children. A story I read, not really pertaining in any way to wands/weapons, one of my favorites, is Fantastic Elves and where to find them, ans it is so amazing for me because of the way we see Harry's thoughts. The author gets the childlike thought process, that innocence very well. Thats the core that's missing in most such stories.

As for the cupboard, it wasn't just a little box, but it had a +cot+bed, a place for all his clothes, the few toys he had, and everything. It was really bad if them to only give him a cupboard, though. As for the locks, I think all rooms and cupboards already have a latch/lock, don't they? I don't think they purposely had one installed. Yeah, I see what youre getting at, but still, the way it's seen by the community, I feel it's a little much. Maybe im wrong here, but his personality at the start of the books is what makes me feel this way.

Edit: It was a bed, a proper full bed, with space under it for lost socks to hide. I don't know why I remembered cot, maybe from some fic...

***** Technically, Diffindo is a cutting /charm/, though, not a curse.

It's definitely something dangerous, I agree, but they do have magic protecting them from harm in various ways and probably a way to attach limbs back with a single spell for as long as there's no curse damage. So with that in mind, you'd probably have to put a lot of effort into it to make using it on a wizard or witch actually lethal. And while oh, sure, it is a possibility, we shan't forget that many mundane things that we have access to can be quite deadly if you put in a lot of effort as well. Our own bodies can be used as weapons, and if you are creative enough then so can most tools we are using; the question isn't “can you?” but rather “do you?”, and though the answers we've gotten from characters in the actual series vary greatly some fanfiction authors seem to be under the impression that every character would answer “yes” to the latter one.

As for the cupboard, the books never mention how big it actually is and what the movies show (a tiny bit of space) isn't actually canon, but it isn't uncommon for some house designs to have a “cupboard under the stairs” that is actually quite a sizeable storage room at 6 or 7 square meters (give or take 70 square feet) and just awkwardly shaped due to having a slanted ceiling, and Madame Rowling's later notes confirm that his cupboard is one of those. Oh, sure, it definitely is very much not a good thing that they put him in there, but it's not quite as drastic as some fanfiction authors make it out to be; they're still arseholes and definitely not good people, but they didn't make him sleep in a place the size of a cargo crate.

Well, kind of not. The entirety of their behaviour towards him is emotional abuse via neglect and other stuff; likewise, the fact that he talks back to them is not proof that it's all good, but rather something that likely had happened because of said abuse, as a form of defence, and this is also where his whole problem with authority comes from. That said, most people writing fanfiction know nothing about abuse, emotional or physical, nor do they even seem to be aware that emotional abuse is a thing, and the results we get from that is the overly exaggerated caricature with them beating him to death every day or worse.

So yes, they did abuse him, but no, it isn't the kind of over-the-top thing some people are making it out to be. There wasn't a boy who was so scared of everything that he couldn't do anything; instead, there was a boy who lived at the same place as people he was related to but did not live /with/ them, could not rely on them, had nobody /for him/.

For example, his studying habits, they aren't (as some tend to think) something that happened because of the Dursleys threatening him not to get higher grades than Dudley (what a ridiculous idea that is, in any case), but they definitely are something that happened because with nobody caring about his grades nor giving him any acknowledgement for trying there was no need for him to try at all. In a similar vein, the fact he tries to talk to them (like the bit with the flying motorcycle in the first book), isn't because everything is fine but rather because he is under the impression that nobody cares about him any more than the Dursleys, and thus that nobody cares about him at all, but he knows he can't just escape and go somewhere else and he still needs to talk occasionally because people generally do have that need and so with nobody caring (seemingly) he talks to anyone; this is why he's gotten attached to Hagrid so quickly despite Hagrid being visually a bit scary, as the guy did demonstrate to Harry that he does care specifically about him, and this is also why Harry stopped talking to them outside of when he needed to after the first book.

** For me, Harry Potter isn't so much about the story of Harry as it about the setting of the wizarding world.

And, while the canon story makes sense in light of external factors(writing for children, trying to force a theme, etc), internally the story is deeply flawed and makes little to no sense. Fanfiction often tries to correct that, to my approval.

** What do you want? A few hundred thousand words of Harry growing up, getting excited over the same things he did in canon, overcoming the same obstacles he got through in canon, with the same lessons in canon, with just a few thousand words of new stuff? At that point, you might as well just read the books over again.

Most people, even /writers/, seem to hate breaks from canon. Yes, you /could/ have Harry all excited over broomsticks again, but since we've already been there and done that a billion times, it's a bit dull. Since canon is fussed over like the community is its helicopter parent, it's not like you can take Harry on wild new adventures with any sort of ease. He still needs to deal with Voldemort, be mentored by Dumbledore, make friends with Hermoine and Ron, etc.

That being the case, even with their interests being so restrictive, their expectations are incredibly high. After all, unless a work is unbelievably good, it will "never hold up to the books". This is despite the quality of the books, mostly the early books, being /vastly/ overstated. As somebody else already pointed out, there are massive issues with the universe that go completely unaddressed, and therefore don't actually hold up to any sort of scrutiny.

If the story you want is to be well-made, it would have to start from the ground up. It would, in essence, be a Harry Potter reboot fic. Naturally, it would be very poorly received. It could do original characters in an original plot. New heroes, new perspectives, new adventures, new challenges, but would you even read it? It's not, after all, the characters people love.

I think you're asking for things that just aren't feasible. A fic written like the first book would just be outright poorly written for anything but children. A fic that corrects the obvious issues with the series loses the original tone. A fic which circumvents it all doesn't have enough to hook the vast majority of readers.

*** I think you've hit the nail on the head, really. Just wanted to elaborate on the canon thing... I suspect it has to do with suspension of disbelief. A large number of people in the fanfiction community have already suspended their disbelief for canon, therefore fics that are cut similarly to canon receive benefit from the pre-existing suspension. They are more easily believed, in short, because they are familiar.

If you reboot, or drastically alter the Potterverse to actually make sense, you are almost writing an original fiction loosely inspired by Harry Potter, and therefore you run into both readers who do not suspend their disbelief due to it being original fiction, and irate fans who believe 'you changed it now it sucks'. It's like... it's no longer good enough to write a mediocre canon-compliant H/G fic, because you're asking people to suspend their disbelief separate from the canon they've already accepted, so your writing has to be at a much higher standard. And due to the reverence you not to earlier books, you could actually write /better than Rowling/ and people would still hate you.

** The massive problem with the themes in the Harry Potter books as I see them are twofold. The first is the obvious upping of the darkness factor as the books go on. In PS the Dursleys treatment of Harry isn't meant to be seen as some horrific abusive treatment of a child, it's all just a framing device for a childrens book, one that's been used for hundreds of years the protagonist is a downtrodden servant to a horrible family but it turns out that he's actually really special. Harry Potter is basically magical Cinderella, that is all it is, it's a whimsical kids book about a kid who finds out he's actually a rich, superfamous hero wizard. It's kid wish fulfillment.

However as Rowling decided to target the original readers as they aged with the next books (smart move) they get darker and darker. As that happens it becomes difficult to reconcile the earlier whimsical adventures with the darker later series. I think she realised this and toned down the extent of the Dursleys abuse in subsequent books.

The second problem when it comes to fanfiction is no matter how dark the books get, they're still young adult books. They also happen to be the best selling young adult fiction books ever with a hugeee fanbase consequently every single little scrap of information has been deeply read into, every character interactions EVERYTHING. This isn't ASoIaF where every minor sentence may hold a clue to a characters feelings or motivation but yet people still read the books that way and they use it to pull character motivations and opinions that might not be there.

** I think the problem is the unintentional mixed dark themes that are never properly addressed. Even if it was childrens fiction, the world should have had some semblance of cause/effect crime/punishment.

Instead we see a home life that was unjust, possibly criminal.

I'm pretty certain its at least a reason to take a child away if you make them sleep in a locked cell under the stairs. Lock them in their room and feed them through a cat flap etc. But we never really see any resolution or comeuppance to the Dursleys and no adult ever speaks out or up for Harry. If they did we have to assume they were obliviated so Harry could stay under Dumbledore's blood protection.

Teachers attempting to kill Harry nearly every year he is at Hogwarts and very little is done about it, Harry has to take care of himself because the adults are nincompoops.

Corrupt government... is probably the most realistic portrayal since sometimes there is nothing you can do to fight back short of full revolution.

Dumbledore knows Harry has to fight for his life, yet never gives him more than a normal education. It is super easy to see why people believe he was meant to die all along.

The unintended themes of the series lead to dark conclusions. As a child you may not read into it much, but as an adult it is either a series of very evil but coincidental events happening to a child, or there is a mastermind behind it all training a weapon of war who will answer to the wise grandfather figure.

Another example is how apparently, the Malfoys once again got off completely clear of charges at the end because Narcissa decided to help Harry. No justice at all.

Fanfiction takes a dim view of many characters based on these themes, and attempts to correct them. Making Harry a CAPABLE weapon instead of sending him off to die is just one way to fix what is perceived as a very wrong situation.

*** Dumbledore is the most complicated character in the series, and yes, most people see his decisions as highly questionable, the fact remains that, realistically, even if Dumbledore had decided to raise Harry as a weapon, it honestly wouldn't have worked against the "most feared dark wizard of all time", as the Dark Lord was reputed to be; highly skilled and experienced, I really dont think Harry would have defeated him in fair combat.

Even leaving that out, yes, I agree we don't see enough justce in the series, but Dumbledore was truly trying to give Harry a chance at being a child, rather than having the prophecy hanging over his head.Maybe it was wrong, maybe not, that's a personal opinion. I personally think he wanted the best for Harry; that he truly cared.

More like, what was everyone /doing/ in those seventeen years? Harry was apparently teaching his kids to fear Slytherin. Ron was apparently learning to -- well, not /hate/ muggles, but certainly view them as less than human. Hermione was, it seems, happily ignoring this /and/ the relative contempt Ron had toward things she thought important.

We segued from a heroic victory to banal evil.

For me, it feels like it's about fatalism and predestination and a bit about how you shouldn't fight the "natural" order of things.

Tom was born of a pitiful mother (who really deserved better) and a father she raped (which isn't excused by her home life). He started tormenting the other kids with magic by the time he was ten. He received a wand with immortality as one of its traits -- immortality being against the natural order and therefore evil. And all his steps from there were evil. Dumbledore saw that evil in him from the outset, but he couldn't take any steps to curb it; he just looked on with suspicion and disapproval, even before Tom did anything unspeakable.

Harry was born of good, loving parents. He was a good boy because he was protected by his mother's love, which sheltered him from the effects of his family's abuse. He followed Dumbledore like a lamb, always stayed on the side of the Light -- except for a couple brushes with the Unforgivables, but he's a good boy, so that can't affect him, right? And then he goes to his death like a good boy, to contrast him with Tom, who did everything he could to avoid death.

It's not important whether Draco tried to kill or /torture/ Harry - either way, lethal force to defend himself is justified. Especially since Harry has to expect that Draco will not leave him alive after torturing him, since he'll not want to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban for casting the Trorture Curse.

******** The Longbottoms were tortured for a long time by a master of the curse. Draco probably didn't even have the kind of sadism necessary to fuel a proper Cruciatus, as we see in DH, and he wouldn't have killed Harry, as we see in the beginning of the year. He used the curse in exactly the same situation that Harry used it - in a time of extreme emotional aggravation.

It's very important whether Draco tried to kill Harry or just to bring him pain. This isn't even nuance, that is... the basic difference between instant death and a short bout of pain. It's mind-boggling how you just take those to be of the same severity. People who think Draco was trying to kill Harry instead of just hurt him are the same who think the Dursleys beat Harry every day instead of simply neglecting him. A complete distortion and misunderstanding of canon.

I also don't know where you take your morality or law from. In reality, the use of lethal force is very rarely justified by law. Notice that Crouch only authorized the use of the Killing Curse when dealing with Death Eaters when the war got very severe. There's a long tradition of military ethics about what is okay to do at war. The term "war crime" refers, in this instance, to the use of lethal force when other ways of subduing an opponent (i.e. Stunning) is optional. You'd know that if you had actually bothered to read about actual war history instead of wars in fantasy fiction. All of this is even without mentioning the extreme complexity of Draco's situation in HBP (in real wars, when someone commits a crime under a threat to his or his family's life - like Draco explicitly said in HBP - he might not be punished at all).

You could make a case that "reasonable force" means stunning should be done - but that only works if the stunner is actually as effective as the lethal spell. And even in that case, Harry could easily claim that, faced with being tortured, he didn't think of using that spell, and that would be an excusable overreaction - a judge wouldn't expect him to keep his calm and act fully rational if threatened with a Torture Curse.

********** First off, don't inject your own morality into this. We're talking law here. Lethal force is something that's only employed when no other means of protection are available. It doesn't apply in this case.

If someone wants to torture you, you are /not/ allowed to use lethal force, not according to the standards of the western world. The assailant's intentions are irrelevant. And, as I said, I don't think Draco had it in him to use the Cruciatus to its full extent - it would have been hurtful, but not torture, as we've seen with Harry's usage of it in OotP. (And it's not exactly an isolated case in the series - one can make the claim that Hermione's parchment curse tortured Marietta, and, according to you, it gives Marietta the justification to kill her.)

A stunner would be just as effective as a Sectumsempra. Harry would certainly, in this case, have an excuse, but it doesn't mean that this is the acceptable reaction. You'd expect him to use a spell like a Stunner, which he knows intimately, rather than a spell he never cast before and that doesn't know the effect of.

The final point here - if we go back to the original comment - is that Harry was punished for what he did. He was punished because what he did went against everything that Hogwarts teaches. First, he caused a potentially lethal injury to a fellow student instead of using a Stunning spell - or just getting out - and second, he used a curse which he didn't know, which he never cast before, and that /could/ be lethal to his understanding (/"for enemies"/). Hogwarts teaches to use magic safely. What Harry did is something that simply should not be done, no matter the situation - spells have to be practiced and taught properly, because even the most harmless spells (Levitation for instance) could have the most terrible consequences if cast improperly.

What Harry did was understandable, and there's no doubt that the issue is complex - both for him and Draco - but it is certainly not justified by law.

The use of lethal force IRL and in HP is very different, because, as I said, using a Stunner is just as effective as a Sectumsempra, while IRL you don't have that level of control with guns. Still, you'll find that most European countries aren't so lax about it.

The key here is intention, which is made much clearer when using magic. If your intention is to hurt or maim, it is unlawful, while if you're just trying to subdue, it is legal. To use a curse that maims instead of one that stuns is certainly regarded as unreasonable by law - both state law and war law.

************* You know, I do understand what you are trying to do, and I don't agree with some of the things the other side writes, but here is a little thing for you:

Regardless of the intent, getting hit with a Cruciatus means likely being disabled and at the mercy of someone who already is, by the time of casting it, demonstrating willingness to use the darkest of spells. Even if he does not possess the mental or emotional aptitude to use them fully, it still is very dark and very illegal and I don't think it needs to be said that though Cruciatus is on a lower level than Avada Kedavra they were taught about those spells---alongside Imperius---at the same time and as the three worst ones. In that regard, Harry could and probably would be excused had he gone overboard with defending himself.

The reason he actually didn't get excused is simple, if you think about it. Because Harry stopped Draco from casting rather than stop the curse from affecting him and only then fighting back, there's no proof of Draco actually doing anything like that, and at the same time there's proof enough of Harry casting a curse that might not be as bad as those but still undeniably is dark stuff. As such, he was in a situation where he was the one who cast the darkest spell and the other party was actually harmed, so it mattered not what spells anyone /attempted/ to cast but couldn't; to put it simply, there was proof that Harry cast a dark spell at Malfoy, but no proof of Malfoy doing the same. And there's no excuse that “oh, he didn't know what the spell does” because /what kind of idiot uses an unknown spell in a fight/ and with him already having a history of not particularly caring about authority figures it wasn't much of a stretch to think it done deliberately by Harry.

If you have non-lethal means which are as effective, then you should use those - but that's usually not the case in our world. We just had such a case at court yesterday.

Harry had all the reason to assume Draco would torture him, and then kill him to cover his tracks. that's a clear cut means of self-defense.

Your weird, sick idea would mean that if someone wants to kidnap and torture you, you'd not be allowed to shoot him in self-defense. That is not the case, I assure you.

Self-defense does not apply to revenge, it's in response to an immediate or on-going attack. Again, you seem to not understand the law.

What Harry did is justified by any decent law since in his situation, no one could expect him to react cool and controlled and choose a stunner as if he was an experienced auror. He was a kid, threatened with torture and death, and simply reacted with a spell he hoped would save him.

Don't confuse self-defense with "lethal force". It's not the case. I've already explained why shooting someone is extremely different from cursing someone. If someone is raped and shoots the attacker, he does it in order to incapacitate the attacker. It might lead to death as a side result. The intention here is the difference. Harry had a way to subdue Malfoy without using lethal force, and he chose a potentially lethal way. That he was confused is understandable, but it's still /not/ the way to handle things legally.

Draco was acting under threat of death to his and his family's life - duress. In many Western courts, that would absolve him of guilt. Again, this is actual law, not your idea of what a "decent law" is.

There is a current ongoing legal debate in Israel over a soldier who had shot a terrorist after the terrorist was down. The soldier claims that he did it because he thought the terrorist was still dangerous, which is understandable, but there are witnesses who claim the opposite - that the soldier simply wanted to kill the terrorist, who posed no threat. In this case, the soldier would go to jail for using needless lethal force. The very same could be said for using a lethal curse instead of a stunner.

And, once again, let me remind you that we are talking about a school punishment here, not a court punishment. And Harry certainly deserved that punishment, if only to teach him not to use curses which he doesn't know the effect of and could potentially be lethal, in a fight where he /didn't/ intend to kill his opponent.

You're presenting things as black or white, right or wrong, but as I said, this situation is much more complex. It isn't alright killing someone just because he had committed a crime, when you can subdue him at any other way.

Whether Draco should have been punished is an entirely different matter, which has more to do with Dumbledore's stupid plan than with the school or justice.

******************* Harry had no way to know that Draco was "Under duress". And he shouldn't be punished for his reaction because we cannot expect him to act perfectly in that situation. That's my point. Its not alright to kill someone for a crime - but it's alright to kill someone if they are attacking you with an unforgivable. Expecting kids to have the skills and wits of a veteran Auror, and punishing them for the lack of that is wrong and sick. What the punishment drove home was "Defending yourself against an unforgivable is wrong" and "Draco can do no wrong!" All the drivel about poor Draco caring for his murderous father and his mother, both supporters of Voldemort, is pointless since no one told Harry that. All Harry knew was that Draco got off again and he was punished. Lesson learned.

*** It's part of the running theme that's been there from book one, unfortunately. From the beginning, 'ambition' is seen as evil. The house of the bullies and bad people is associated heavily with being ambitious, and wanting to achieve great things through whatever means one has. By contrast, the exalted Gryffindor house is a house of the passive, in bravely embracing that which is expected of you, rather than fighting it to become something greater, like a slimy Slytherin might.

Harry receives a magical item from Dumbledore that makes him completely unseen, therefore the perfect passive observer, and also is related to the Peverell myth in-universe. Which brother survived? Oh yeah, the one who hid and acted completely passive rather than attempting to actually do something with his life-changing gift. And so, the pattern repeats itself. Wanting to do things that are important to you is denigrated, like Hermione with her house elves. Doing what others expect of you is exalted as your nature, as per Dumbledore's little chats with Harry. Don't be ambitious, go with the flow and be brave about it. God help you if you're poor, and don't have a fucking vault full of your parents' cash to fall back on in times of need. According to Rowling, if you're from a poor starving family, it's probably better if you just starve, because being ambitious and wanting to actively raise your station in life is unnatural, and in some cases, evil. Classism, basically. Know your place, peasant.

God help you if you don't have rich friends of your parents to randomly give you a top-of-the-line Quidditch broom, so that you never have to worry about winning ever again. If Harry had had to use a crappy broom, and won anyway, that would be something, but he's practically cheating in canon. He denigrates the Slytherins when Malfoy's father buys a bunch of new brooms so they can beat him, yet nobody points out that his Firebolt is... well, doing exactly the same bloody thing. And this hypocrisy is seen as a /good/ thing, that should be emulated. God, some of the messages in the HP series are just absolutely poisonous when examined up close...

The Voldemort/Harry dichotomy is an important part of a larger pattern, and I think you're absolutely right in pointing it out.

*** Actually they weren't starving him. He got three meals a day; the only meal we see is a bowl of cold soup which, while being a shitty dinner, provides enough sustenance for a small twelve year old.

I'm partially playing devil's advocate here, but honestly, what we see in PS and COS was the extreme of their treatment. In PS he got his 'longest punishment to date' which was about a fortnight grounded; this is based on the assumption that Dudley's birthday falls in early to mid June, and he was ungrounded when school let out. However, I'm also assuming 'locked in the cupboard' is being grounded (ie, he can attend school but is not allowed to roam outside afterwards; is allowed out for meals and washroom use) and not literally being in the cupboard 24/7.

In CoS, he was also essentially grounded (albeit indefinitely). But, by his own admission, he wasn't /ever/ starved in his life (GoF believe is where Harry says it 'the dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he had never been allowed to eat as much as he liked'); again, I am interpreting 'not allowed to eat as much as he liked' to mean he wasn't allowed seconds or thirds, rather than denying him full meals.

All this said, the first few books obviously have exaggerations and are more fairy-tale-esque than the later ones, so I tend to dislike viewing them through a real-life lens, because as we all know, keeping a child in a cupboard is abuse IRL; but in PS it's just part of the fairy tale nature of the evil family trope.

*** They had him locked up / they had grounded him for the debacle with Dobby, where they not only got to know that he wasn't allowed to use magic, but also that he (supposedly) *had*. Also, as [[/u/derive-dat-ass][u/derive-dat-ass]] said, they didn't really starve him.

I don't ever expect fanfiction to be canon, or even be close to it, but I'm expecting a Harry Potter fanfiction, not a random book. Not that it was a bad story, but look at Emperor. Is it unreasonable to expect at least /something/ to be set in the world, except the fact that magic exists and you've named your OC Harry Potter. Deviation from Canon is good, it's excellent, but at least be in the world of Harry Potter.

** I agree with you, OP. There were a lot of themes in canon who are being, for lack of a better word, bashed in fanfiction and in the fandom. The triumph of friendship and compassion over individual power and ruthlessness, the nostalgic appreciation of an older form of culture, the whimsy charm, the rejection of pretension (Tom Riddle turned into Lord Voldemort - take note, Lord Potter fans), and, most of all, the weaknesses and flaws that all people have. All of those are simply shat on in fanfiction and fandom.

That's not to say that I completely agree with these values, or like these themes, but they are what made this series so beautiful, and eventually, successful, in my opinion. You can subvert and dismiss them, but to bash the books for them simply makes you look like you didn't even enjoy the series - in which case, why are you even here?

The world fanfiction presents very often lacks the humour of the series - it is usually completely boring, technical, pent up and lacks wonder. Not to mention that the humorous, sarcastic qualities of characters like Harry and Ron are so commonly ignored. This humour, in my opinion, is what separated the latter books from being just another grimperp young-adult angstfest. The tendency to exaggerate the Dursleys' abuse is a good example of the lack of subtlety that results from lack of humour.

Instead of faulty, morally questionable characters, you get these perfect, savvy, flawless, totally good or totally evil little kids, who just don't feel real, and aren't likeable in any way. The nostalgic whimsical tone is mistaken for incompetency and backwardness, often replaced with a bureaucratic, machine operated, soulless world that is supposed to be an improvement. You can see it very clearly in this thread, where every flaw the characters and institutions have is criticized, instead of accepted for how complex and interesting it makes everything be.

About your request, It's probably not coincidence that the story I believe best captured the essence of the series - linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) - is a crack story.

So what? The point of fanfictions is NOT following slavishly the theme of any canon series, but to create stories readers find ENJOYABLE. I and many other readers find it very ENJOYABLE to tear down that evil government called the Ministry, something you haven't even denied yet.
