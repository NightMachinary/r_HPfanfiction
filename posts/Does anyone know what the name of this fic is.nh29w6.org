** I cant remember the actual word count, but it was a long fic

I clearly remember, an elf going to harry sad that he'd been freed by hermione (spew) Harry then re-binds the elf to hogwarts. Harry the goes into the gryff common room, is asked how the hell he got in there, responds that he can cause he is the heir, hermione she states that they're slaves and she's making them happy so he tells her off that she doesn't understand truly what she is doing that she is killing the elves

Read it a little while ago, think it was an older fic
