It's an idea that has been sitting in my head for a while now, but it's basically an AU, possibly crossover fusion of HP and some of the story/lore from Final Fantasy 14?

So instead of being protected by Lily's sacrifice, Harry is saved due to the blessing of Hydaelen, has access to the Echo (depending on the strength, can see/experience others memories to certain degrees). Voldy is either a pawn of or is an Ascian, hence the whole body hopping shenanigans.

Arithmancy would be possibly expanded to borrow from FF14's Arcanist, seeing as they use mathemagic to summon Carbuncles etc. There would still be wands, but they'd also help with aptitude for the different casting styles in FF14, instead of the job stones. Perhaps the Philosopher's Stone could be a job stone of sorts instead of a magical MacGuffin.

It's all really just a random hodge podge of ideas in my head at the moment, but, thoughts?


** Fucking do it.

I love au's so all long as the changes implemented affect the story and it's not just a rehash of canon then go crazy
