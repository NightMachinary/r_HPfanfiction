**** Which i personally think is the better one of them.For what I've gathered most people seem to prefer "The difference one man can make" but for some reason i could never really get into it.

I love Asharas character in Last Lion and I just prefer the story line of Harry kind of finding out about his past life bit by bit more than just throwing Harry into Westeros. (and I wish it would update again :()

***** I have to absolutely agree with you. "The difference a man can make" just seems like a gary-stu-ish plot that destroys the wildling culture. There's not really something one can relate to the source material in regards to them.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom, and finished with a battle outside her tent. Now, she has to decide between staying and helping Robb Stark and the Northern army, or returning to her universe. And that line is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros.

*** Lol. I have to try this one.

EDIT: It's surprisingly good. Unfortunately it doesn't particularly live up to its name because it was abandoned before it could get that far. Still worth a read, though.

I honestly wish there was more of these. I didn't realize until reading it how tired I was becoming of "super intelligent moral high-ground"!Harry stories.

***** It was just kind of refreshing. The author kind of exactly writes how I imagine Vincent Crabbe may deal with being transported to GoT.

In essence: Kill inferior beings (although, he's better at it than I imagined he might be) and fuck whores. He's not amazing at spellwork, but he uses what he knows.
