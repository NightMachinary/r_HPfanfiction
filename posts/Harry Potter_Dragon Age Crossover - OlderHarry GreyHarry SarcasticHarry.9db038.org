All Right so this is just a part of a ficlet but I'd venture to guess itll be pretty fun to write. let me know what you think!

​

Just a taste -

​

-------------------

“Ah so you know who *I* am, but alas, I do not know who you are...?” the black haired wizard's voice coming out rough both from not having had any water for a day and a half and his having recently hit thirty. His beard was long and rather unkempt as was his wild hair. He had not worn glasses since he was banished from his home realm. /Nope, don't think about that./ His dirty leather trench coat was stain with blood almost all over except for the arms which had been removed and currently had his plate arm armor sticking through the holes. He know his Orlesian breastplate was dented to shit from the Seekers. /Fucking daisy chantry bootlickers./ It was an expensive breastplate too. Gifted to him for saving some random Orlesian mage, /Du Fonf, De Fer?,/ from 2 rogue templars a few months back. Gold, Silver and steel could stop a claw from a Wyvern, damn thing. /Trust me I've tried it./

The Woman finally answered in that rather pleasant accent of hers, “I am Seeker Cassandra Pentaghast, of the Chantry, and yes, I know a great deal about you... Harry the Bartender, Henrik the Mercenary, Hadrian, Advisor to the Hero of ferelden, and most recently Imrus t-”

Harry interrupted with a deadpan, “So you know a lot, wondered how long it would take to put it all together. I mean not as if every name was a variant of the other... fucking medievals.” he muttered the last part under his breath.

“So Seeker of Truth, you want the truth about me yes, perhaps my connection to every Hero in the past 10 years, Ferelden, Orlais and Kirkwall?” Harry knew how this was going to happen. He would spill, he quickly decided, /well not all of it, owe that much to Hawke/. He had wanted this story to be told and truthfully, a hero would be exactly what the world need when it comes to those fucking Templars and Mages.

“Yes, but I have no doubt you will need to be convinced so I to-” Harry quickly interrupted.

“No need Seeker... I'll tell you everything, from the Ostagar, to the Vigil's Keep, to Kirkwall...even to fucking Tevinter if I have to... no, don't worry, I'll tell you what got us into this mess”

**** Just read both your first chapters and I've got to say that I hope this is continued. This crossover is so rarely done right and this is one of the better DA/HP fics I've read.
