A lot of books are pulled down from ff.com. Anyone know any interesting ones that people may be missing out on?


** My favorite story that's no longer available is Harry Potter and the Transfer Student, which was a fairly long one-shot by Enterprise1701-d. The author removed it, removed all the HP elements, and made it into the core of a larger work that he's selling commercially called The Magic Warped. The author has a link to the ebook on Amazon on his page.

It made sense to me to have it become a standalone non-HP story, because it had centered around a couple of visitors to Hogwarts from a very stratified and hierarchical society, presumably elsewhere in Europe, that seemed to ignore the existence of the Statute of Secrecy. The aristocrats were those most capable with magic, with lower social ranks based on ability down to the peasants who were non-magical.

They had a different system of magic and rigidly-observed niceties of social interaction.

The major thrust of the story was Harry's interaction with, learning from, and growing relationship with the senior visitor, and the problems she had with her magic and protecting Harry. In the climax, the senior visitor learns what form her magic would have taken had it not been damaged by a traumatic experience when she was younger, but she dies in the process. The story ends with Harry withdrawing from Hogwarts so that he and Sirius can join this other society.

** Out of the Night by Raining Ink - After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

One of the best Dark does not mean Evil fics I have read.

Raining Ink pulled it around 2012 as they want to write their own books. It has since been reposted to [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] by RememberFics, with full credit going to the original author.

This is what RememberFics posted about this story.

This author only had one main story but what a story it was! One of the most popular fanfiction of the *Harry Potter* fandom on this site, the worldbuilding this writer did was phenominal. The way magical society is broadened and deepened is often very similar between different stories but that is a trap this author didn't fall into and the writing just felt magical. In fact, I often wished, as I read this story, that this was canon. In the end however, the author decided that the amazing universe that they let us peek into would take too much time to finish as they instead want to dedicate more this time to Original work.
