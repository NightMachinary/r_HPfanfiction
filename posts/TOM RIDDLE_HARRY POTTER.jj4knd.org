do you guys have any fanfic recommendations? Harry has a relationship with tom riddle / voldemort which leads to romance. I like to read when there is a scene where Tom spends time with Harry without any Death Eater knowing, and in the future they will know but guessing along the way.

This is a fanfic that's been really driving me crazy lately. The slowborn is totally real!

Or just drop any Tom/Harry that You think deserved to read!


** ***1) To Kill You With a Kiss Paimpont Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

2) The Intruder Time Travel. A nasty business for Auror Harry Potter. A remedy against boredom for Tom Riddle. When two opposing forces collide, something new is created. HP/TR Oneshot

3) What He Grows To Be (angsty but lovely) Severus_divides_into_H Summary: Time travel MOD story were Harry raises Tom with all his optimism and care but still has to deal with Tom's dark side and obsessive traits its very nuanced and written with care.

4) you belong to me (i belong to you): Bamf Harry Potter who takes no shit from Tom deals with the Mod aspect amazingly! Child_OTKW.\\

5) The All Seeing Eye Glass seacaptain Summary: When Harry lands himself in 1942 he officially stops caring. Surrounded by witches and wizards that are blissfully ignorant that there's a time-traveler in their midst, Harry resolves to make his own changes, which results in some interesting and unexpected consequences.(It's an amazing time travel story with beautiful character dynamics)

6) Little Prince on B612 by Run_of_the_mill It's simply a story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it. It's a Tomarry Time travel story were both Tom and Harry love the little prince and Tom sees Harry as the beautiful rose in the story. Lovely underrated story.

7) When a Wizard Wishes Upon a Star by RandomBirdEvent this looks like your typical Harry goes back in time to slytherin but I really enjoyed it because Harry actually seems more canon and in character while still having slytherin traits. He is funny sarcastic and lively rather than morose and dark.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23221393/chapters/55595515]]

8) Gilt in Silver and Gold by Araceil its a funny Tomarry story were Harry goes back in time but is in Hufflepuff Tom underestimates him and harry stick out his tongue and basically gives the middle finger while ruining the young dark lords plans

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23670349/chapters/56822665]]

9) When Harry Met Tom by The_Carnivorous_Muffin its a master of death Time travel Tomarry story Harry is female and usually I don't like gender-bending fem Harry story but her characterization is fantastic, dynamic, and fun.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

10) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin Again from the same author phenomenal MOD concept with a lot of surrealism and interesting philosophical questions

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831]]

11) History Rewritten by FreezePride its an amazing time travel slow burn Tomarry story were Harry starts off by mentoring Tom in to a better human being and watching the character growth is amazing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13590255/chapters/31195569]]

12) The Untouchable by TreacleTeacups its an apathetic MOD Harry very interesting characterization. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14371158/chapters/33178122]] 13) Jonquils and Lightning by Lomonaaeren its a BAMF Harry story were Harry travels to a calm dimension to live with the Potter Family except Tom from another dimension also comes and tries to recruit Harry to fight in a war. Basically Tom is infatuated by Harry and Harry just flips him the bird

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14178429/chapters/32682234]]

14) Earning His Notice by Lomonaaeren A series of fics where Harry Potter has traveled back in time to Tom Riddle's youth, and has managed to avoid Tom's notice at Hogwarts by pretending to be an ordinary Muggleborn and then working in an apothecary's shop thereafter...a plan that comes crashing to the ground when one of Tom's Knights attacks the shop where he works.

15) Harry Potter and the mountain of pure diamond By Maximonstre Summary: Many, many years after the defeat of Voldemort, Harry has accepted the truth : he is what can only be described as a god. To relieve his anxiety of eternity, he travels between worlds. One day, he stumbles upon one which is far too similar to his first one for his peace of mind. And in which lives one little Tom Riddle, determined to pierce all the secrets of his new guardian...(MOD, au Harry)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15418380/chapters/35785989]]

16) Heir Apparent MonsieurClavier Summary: When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous---and hilarious---assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best. A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one. Hilarious Time travel Voldemort Harry story that gradually turns in to a Harry/Tom Story

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25010857/chapters/60562639]]

17) I must be your favourite, right? FlyingLizards

Summary:

Tom Riddle meets a strange boy who roams lost in Hogwarts.

The legend of Slytherin's lost boy; someone who appears and disappears in the blink of an eye, all throught history, had never really caught his attention

Until said boy appeared to him.
