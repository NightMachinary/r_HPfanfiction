Are there some well written Crack Fics that aren't “lol so random”?Bonus points if Dumbledore is evil or just insane.


** The word 'oops' can have a variety of meanings, depending on whom uttered it, and when.\\
A first year Hogwarts student in charms class says "oops"? You may point and laugh at the feather stuck up his friend's nose.\\
A waiter at a fine restaurant says "oops"? Quickly make haste to avoid the descending bowl of soup, if you would.

Lord Voldemort himself, at a stone circle where seven ley lines intersect, upon the summer solstice, in the middle of a potent magical ritual, says "oops"? Evacuate Britain immediately, go to the moon if you can, or see if there's any space on that Mars mission run by those muggles. Basically, run like hell.

And...ah, yes, that would be why you evacuated. A /massive/ earthquake resulting from that flubbed ritual, wow, I'd call it an 11 on the Richter scale! If you fled into space then you could quite easily see a large fissure, splitting the British landmass in two, running a wonky line from Ullapool to Brighton.

I must say, that /is/ a Long Crack.

*** That list is AMAZING. Slowly going through it now. Thank you so much for compiling all of these!

I remember reading a bunch of these when I was first getting into HP fanfiction - all the fics by Rorschach's Blot, nonjon, jbern, and BajaB are taking me back :')

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3724434/1/101-Chapters-Why-Severus-Snape-Hates-His-Life]]

this is a really hilarious one about Snape and his adventures with the death eaters and the order. Tons of OOC and modern pop culture references but it was hilarious.

ALSO, really funny fics which are basically the first two years of hogwarts via fb newsfeed format.
