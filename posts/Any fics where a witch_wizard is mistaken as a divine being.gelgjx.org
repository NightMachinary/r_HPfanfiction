I've recently found this neat little story (Warning, OOC fem Harry) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7667233]]) and I'm wondering if anyone knows anything else like it.

Doesn't matter if it's a crossover, has OCs, has OOC characters, etc. Just looking for someone from the Harry Potter world displaying magic and being mistaken as a god.

  All in all, Hariel wasn't mad at whoever had brought her here. Sure, there was no indoor plumbing. And yeah, okay, all the food was pretty bland. And the villagers in this primitive little corner of the Earth were terrified of her for some reason. But honestly, Hariel was loving it. It was about time she got a vacation. Fem!HarryPotter. Goddess!Hariel. Hariel/Harem(?)

*** Haha, me neither! I know nothing about the other fandom for around 60% of the crossovers I read.

** Found another one. Also fem Harry, surprisingly. At first I thought the Godric that is mentioned was Godric Gryffindor.

Warning: It's not as good as the last one IMO. Also, crossover, soulmates/soulmarks, abandoned, etc.

  He has loved her since their first meeting when he was little more than a dying boy and she the Goddess that healed him. [Fem!Harry/Godric]
