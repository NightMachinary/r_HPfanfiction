Or if not better fully, then they become able to at least communicate a little way or something can be done for them.

They're just one absolutely tragic part of the series. Maybe it's me looking on as an adult, but the sheer darkness of what was done to them really hits me really hard. Especially the impact that comes from only seeing them once, that bombshell being dropped, and then us never seeing them again (I think), but suddenly having this horrible context to Neville's life.

  The Firewhisky became a habit after that, though they would both insist that it was a friend, not a crutch. The kindly intermediary that moderated their visiting across the bar on busy nights, slow nights, work nights, weekends. It loosened their tongues. Post-Hogwarts, Epilogue-Compliant.

** Do you mind if it's a very minor part of the fic? I almost don't want to rec this fic because 99% of the fic has nothing to do with this, but linkffn(debt of time by shayalonnie) has this.

I also want to mention linkffn(the art of self-fashioning). Harry (who is not the BWL) has parents with brain damage, and he's going to heal their brains through transfiguration. A very . . . odd fic, because of Harry's unusual characterization. It's not there yet, but has been updating weekly for a very long time now, so the author will get there eventually.

** I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4188012/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-One-A-New-Bloodline][Sharingan Harry]], a 4 part series so far (forth book is incomplete and hasn't been updated and doesn't look like it's going to be any time soon sadly, which is a shame since the enemies Harry faces are only finally getting interesting- magicals mostly being no challenge for ninja training), where in harry has the Sharingan eyes from Naruto- and it's a fairly decent crossover in my opinion though I'm sure most will disagree with that, Harry casually notices and mentions the cause of the Longbottom's states to Neville- in such a disregarding and somewhat insulting manor that Neville tries to attack him for it- but it turns out to be true- and they're soon cured.

I think it's a WIP, and basically Harry (I think?) finds a way by using the elixir from the Resurrection Stone (after Flamel's wife gave it to him to use). But there is only enough to save one of them. I don't want to spoil too much but if anyone could find this I'd appreciate the assist.

**** That's right. Thank you so much. Oh and how disappointing, it's not a WIP. It's that great story that really took a turn at the end and seemed to be setting up a great story but jbern never picked it back up.

Has anyone ever tried to pick this up in jbern's stead? Or just made sequels based off of this storyline anyways? I would love to read a good continuation of this story.
