So in the past I've read a good few fics that start out well but devolve into Harem shit which in all cases ruins the fic for me. Do well done ones even exist? I was just curious and interested in reading something I normally avoid. Slash is fine. I'm not a homophobe


** Witches of Westerfield hasn't been announced as a Harem but its looking like it will head in that direction

**** I only found and read this one this week... And now it's linked here.

It's kind of like watching a train wreck in the making in slow motion though. And I mean that as a compliment. I think Harry is the only one who doesn't know something's up. I kind of love watching the collection of "other shoes" lining up and getting ready to drop. I can't wait for Harry's horrified realization of just what he's gotten himself tangled up in.

** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685][The Firebird Trilogy]]/ has harems built into the setting in a rather interesting way: Witches rule the magical world, and force powerful wizards to have their magic drained by harem bonds with multiple witches until the wizards are no longer strong enough to pose a major threat. Harry (the protagonist) doesn't actually get into a harem until rather late in the series, though.

*** If you're gonna recommend Firebird you need to mention how dark that series is. Lots of death and rape. It is a well written story with some great concepts but at times it devolves into nothing short of torture porn.

*** I liked the development of the romance in the first fic a lot. It was sweet and creative. I read the other two but they never lived up to the first.

I don't like reading about gay relationships, especially those written by teenage girls so clearly I hate gay men. Sign me up Hitler!
