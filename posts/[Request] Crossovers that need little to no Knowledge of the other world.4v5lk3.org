Something like Brown coat, Green eyes where is like harry goes into this new world and the reader can learn about it with him?


** Hmm... I can't really give a good judgement, since I only read crossovers of universes I'm actually invested in, but I'll just give you some that might fit the bill.

linkffn(8501689) *The Havoc Side of the Force* has some great humor, features a careless, ruthless Harry and a great set of new companions. Its a really enjoyable read, despite the First-Person POV.

linkffn(11115934) *The Shadow of Angmar* is in my opinion the best HP x LotR crossover out there. Harry is summoned to Middle Earth and tried to go home. He meets some interesting characters on the way and Steelbadger does a great job of building on the meager information we have on the east of Middle Earth. Since its a fic mostly featuring parts of Middle Earth not even fans of The Hobbit and LotR have seen before, you get eased in quite nicely.

Also, you can read anything by steelbadger, really. The guy (girl?) writes some great crossovers.

linkffn(11157943) Another Star Wars crossover, *I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For*, but this time I doubt it eases you into the universe slowly enough for someone unfamiliar with it. I like the Harry in this though, and the ripple effect his magic has in the galaxy of the Force. Its goofy and light-hearted for the most part, but rather slow. It also updates like once every semester (but I can't complain since I'm equally slow).

Then, of course, there is linkffn(11098283) *The Black Prince*. It is one of the two best HP x Game of Thrones crossovers. In it Harry is the son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister and his connection to the world of HP isn't revelaed (yet). You will need to look up one or two things from the GoT wiki, but honestly, if you haven't watched the series by now, do so.

linkffn(11132113) *The Difference One Man Can Make* is also a great HP x GoT crossover. It starts before the time of the series and by now (chp. 18) has reached that time. I think it eases you in nicer than The Black Prince, but is way less focused on Harry's inner conflict and more on the conflict of the Kingdom he builds around him. It also updates fairly regularly.

And at last, I'll do a shameless self-promotion linkffn(11690341). *The Salem Settlement* is my take on HP x Fallout. I think I explain things enough for people new to the Fallout series, but I have to admit, that is not the focus I have when editing. See for yourself, maybe you like it. Warning: I'm an update-sloth.

*** I've only read two of these but I can highly recommend both of them - The Shadow of Angmar and The Salem Settlement.

For the LOTR crossover I had only seen the films once, so I think it explains everything pretty well as I was able to follow along.

For the Fallout crossover I had no familiarity with it at all but all the ideas of nuclear disaster are not fandom-specific. The characters are developed well so I was able to understand the background of the Fallout plots.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

if you don't mind going outside of HPland linkffn(Jedi Harris) is good. Buffy/SW cross, one of my favorite fics. I didn't know a thing about Buffy but muddled through ok.

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.
