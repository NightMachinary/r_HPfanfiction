I'm looking for a story that portrays a more realistic account of Harry's time with the Dursleys and Privet Drive. Too often in fics the Dursleys are pantomime villains who Harry endures for about half a paragraph before skipping of to Hogwarts. Vernon is violent and abusive you know the score. I like how in the books Harry comes to a grudging understanding with the Dursleys and i'd be interested to see how other people interpret this awkward relationship

I want a story where we actually get a sense of the family dynamic, more fleshed out Dursleys! Harry's interaction with the rest of Privet Drive would interest me too. I'm not that interested in what happens to Harry when he gets to Hogwarts if he even does.
