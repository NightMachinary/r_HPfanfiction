I need something to fill the void. Open to most stories, obviously doesn't need to be the same. Just looking for the same vibe or characterization. A story with Harry as a leader/member of a resistance, as a soilder/fighter, involving a war, conflict, and so on.

I would prefer it to be post-Hogwarts.

I would also prefer Harry to be main, but the way it's executed in Beyond the Curtain is excellent, so it doesn't necessarily need to be his POV.

#+begin_quote
  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry now guides the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. Canon loyal, not dark. Adventure, not angst.
