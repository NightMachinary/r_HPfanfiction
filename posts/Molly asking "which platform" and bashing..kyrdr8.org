I'm missing something here. First; what is this referring to and second; what is the justification for bashing? I haven't read any stories worth remembering that ever brought this up.


** When Harry is lost in King's Cross in Philosopher's Stone, he hears Molly ask "now which platform is it?"

In fan fiction it's used as a small part in a grand scheme by Dumbledore to hand pick Harry's friends in an effort to control his life.

** This is probably not exactly comparable because I am not a parent, but if someone dialogued the questions I ask my dog daily I'd look like moron ("is it... [insert meal] time? I do not know you tell me!!"). If she was just asking "what's the platform" for Ginny's benefit of answering "9 and 3/4", I think thats fine and normal parent stuff. Absentmindedly asking aloud obvious questions is not a basis to bash.

*** Yeah, I have to think that the detractors may not have raised seven children of their own... Rhetorical or obvious questions exist for very good reasons.

** As others have mentioned the meeting on the platform may be the first thing that folks think is suspicious. One thing that canon does not make clear is whether or not there are other methods to access the platform (floo, apparition, etc).

Now many fans believe there must be because they can't really see the Malfoys and other dark families being willing to have to be in the muggle world and dealing/interacting with all the muggles as they make their way through downtown muggle london and a crowded King's Cross Station.

If there are other methods then the Weasleys being on the muggle/mundane side makes less sense as they are purebloods and have access to the floo and apparition.

Now if there are not other methods of access then the Weasleys being there is not suspicious. And asking about the platform could just simply be a mother entertaining her childrwn while reaffirming the knowledge of where they need to be for her two younger children.

How loud she is talking depends on where you sit on the Weasleys being part of a plot against Harry. It could be low conversational if you don't believe in a plot or it could be shouting loudly if you do believe in a plot. Of course, you need to figure whether they are using muggle notice me not charms.

*** Apparation probably works, but I doubt there's a Floo at the station, otherwise they would have used it in book 3 with Sirius Black on the loose. And it makes sense that the Weasleys wouldn't use Apparation since there's so many of them. Plus you have to load up their school supplies.

*** Even if there are other methods to get there, perhaps Arthur thinks going the muggle way is interesting, or some families might just feel that going that way and crossing the false wall is an important part of the whole experience.

** In the first book, Harry meets the Weasleys because Molly is loudly asking which platform the train is on. People say this is suspicious, because they've been bringing their kids there for like a decade, and did it themselves when they were younger

** It's just that Molly should know on which platform the Hogwarts Express is. She went there herself for 7 years and brought 5 of her 7 kids there year after year. That's why her asking "which platform" doesn't seem genuine. So she might have said it to lure in Harry. Some theories and Fanfictions say it's the first step of a grand evil scheme of the Weasleys or just Molly or even Dumbledore to manipulate Harry or get access to his vault etc.

*** It's actually a pretty well-known parenting trick - asking an otherwise-uninvolved child something you, as the parent, already know is a way to make the kid feel involved.

It's basically the same trick as giving your child the grocery list when you go out grocery-shopping - even if /you/ know the full list, the child feels like they're being helpful if you let them read it out loud.

The /only/ thing that might be suspect is that she asked it in a place where muggles might overhear and dropped the word "Muggle" - which honestly, no-one on a busy train station is going to give a damn outside of someone /looking for Wizard-specific words/.

Anyone else is either not going to pay attention to the conversation at all, or pass it off as either having mis-heard or Molly saying some old-timey slang term they're unaware of. If they only heard the actual "what's the platform number" part, that's /extremely/ easy to just pass off as Ginny making a joke.

*** Possibly quite true. But remember these are children's books that we are now looking at with adult eyes. So all of these various "discrepancies" don't register when you're a pre-teen/early teen. But now when you're older they stick out.

And I'm glad all of these "holes" exist as it gives lots of areas for fanfic writers to explore in their stories by developing a reason for why the holes/discrepancies exist.

*** Same, or being a mother she is asking her children questions she, already knows the answer too, to get them to try and think for themselves. Lots of parents do this, and it is Ron's first year maybe she is doing it for his benefit or doing it to keep the children focused (remember she has five kids with her and while Percy will probably behave the twins are notorious trouble makers and Ron and Ginny are younger and possibly easily distracted) getting them to look for the platform probably stopped them all wandering off. I doubt JK put this much thought into it though.

*** I generally feel this way for basically everything regarding Dumbledore. I get why people hyper analyze everything and treat all the characters as if they are real people who have motivations for everything they do, but personally I'm fine just accepting that Dumbledore didn't do more to help since he wasn't the main character and JKR wasn't even considering him most of the time until the later books. She definitely wasn't intentionally trying to assign any sort of alterier motives to him. He was basically just an occasional plot device, not a real character with agency in the earlier books, and I'm fine using that to explain any inconsistencies and just ignoring them.
