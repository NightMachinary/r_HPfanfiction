So I've been writing my first HP story for a few months now and am unsure as to how I'm meant to answer reviews. So far I've just been sticking them in as ANs but I didn't do that with my most recent chapter because I think it detracts from the story to have that section in there.

Normally I'd just leave it alone but with a few of the reviews (complaints) I've gotten as of late I'd like to sort of explain what's going on.

I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that I'm incredibly inexperienced with writing and my idea didn't translate well into words when I actually wrote it. So I feel the need to justify myself and the story.

I think the few reviews that all have the same sort of complaint are probably a common query but are also potentially hurting my chances at new readership so that's why I'd like to address it and would like to know how best to do so.

Thanks in advance, would really appreciate any advice.

My story in case you were wondering: linkffn(12423601)

Thank you.

If I believe, there is a way to respond directly to the person?

Or you could try interpretive dance.

*** Thanks for affirming my choice! But yeah, I think I'll just send PMs to those that either really bother me or provide the sort of criticism I need.

** I kind agree with those critical reviews of the last chapter, too.

If you don't want your story to lose popularity, DON'T DUMB DOWN your characters to manufacture drama or jam the plot into certain directions. Since this is a time travel, readers will be more interested in your hero kicking serious asses than engaging in angsty escapades.

I don't know what you have planned down the road, maybe Ara's actions (or inactions) will be explained in later chapters. In that case, you can always answer those critical reviews by asking them to be more patient.

*** Thanks for your opinion!

And I totally agree with you on what readers want out of a story like this. I mean I want the same thing, because to a certain extent this is wish fulfilment for me also. Only difference though is that I don't think it should be that easy - nothing ever is. So I'm sort of trying to provide a more human response to these types of situation - I'm probably not a good enough writer to accurately express that yet.

But yeah I think it's more likely a patience thing- for both me and the readers. I'm just going to continue writing what I want to and hopefully that should answer some concerns.

** It's up to you whether you want to address them or not. You're not obligated to respond to anyone just as they're not obligated to leave a review of your work.

I will say that if you feel the need to explain what's going on in your story via author's notes rather than the story itself, that may be part of the problem. You're new to writing and you're learning, but you're doing it in a very public fashion with putting your story up for public consumption, so you're going to have to take the good with the bad and learn from both. The reviews may cause some readers to shy away and there isn't really anything you can do about that except make your story better.

The last thing you want to do is get defensive as that will just turn readers off even more. Continue learning, continue writing!

*** Thanks. You're probably right that the best way to respond to it would be through the story itself.

I think I just got impatient and jumped the gun with wanting to respond immediately rather than actually progressing with my writing.

**** It's no worries! Totally natural impulse. You are showing your baby to the world, so of course you want to jump to its defense. You want to take reader feedback into account and use it to develop yourself as a writer, but keep in mind it's your story--you don't have to do what readers say you should do. It's not choose your own adventure. If writers did what readers wanted them to do George RR Martin would have wrapped up the Game of Thrones series ages ago!

Use the feedback as you sit back and plot how you're going to knock their socks off.

***** You're making a lot of sense to me.

And yeah no worries on that end, I have a definite plan for the story and I'm not really planning on altering that. But always open to advice to tell me if I'm doing it in a way that's not a complete mess.

Really makes me wish the ffn review system was like ao3's.
