Magical Birth Control. Tell me, what you all read in FanFictions on that topic? Love to also hear your opinion on the matter. You have any ideas on charms, spells or magical device that would help on this ? Reading smudd, Drabble or any other soft porn to porn HP fanfics I only read things like: ‚He did something with his wand she couldn't see‘ , ‚turning away and grabbing his wand he did something with his wand..‘

Maybe I haven't read enough yet. Some writers don't just don't go into the matter and let „things“ happen as if pregnancy doesn't exist. Which is ok as it is a fantasy story of a fantasy world...

** yeah. I just read one where ‘the charm' has a one in four chance of failing which is pretty brutal

It's generally pretty general in the fics I've read too, though no hidden wand movements. There's no way I would trust a dude if he was acting sneaky like that!

in some there is a different one depending on your reproductive system, and in others there is a yearly or monthly potion.

I've spent a bit of time thinking of menstrual products too, how magic could help things be way less messy.

** I always thought it'd be a potion or a root or something they would have to take (and could forget, if that kind of story drama appeals to you). Rowling's world is supposed to be 'Like Ours but Magic' since they have spells where we have taps and screwdrivers and cars and such. So, it would make thematic sense to mimic the real world equivalents - maybe they could get a potion like the Pill, or a temporary runic tattoo/charm/enchantment for the Implant, etc. Though I dread to think what magical hysterectomies or vasectomies would look like. Really gotta hope that's more than just a vanishing spell. :D

*** By vanishing you mean penis vanishing spell? Like a person could actually do that to someone with a flick of a stick?

**** Vasectomies don't remove the penis, they just cut and tie off a tube inside it. But yeah, I think they could. Magic is conceptual, after all, and we've all made those jokes about a wizard 'knowing what to do with their wand'. ;)

** Most of the time, authors/characters tend to just say something like "I'm on the potion" or quickly cast a contraceptive spell and be done with it. It's basically the equivalent of saying "I'm on the pill" and moving on. And most of the time, that's perfectly sufficient for the purposes of the story.

If you want to go into more detail in a story, I think the best way to do it would be to take real world contraceptives from time periods where people believed in magic/before the Statute of Secrecy and treat them as magic. And history gives a lot to work with, most of which sounds uncomfortable, unhealthy, and/or ineffective with modern knowledge. But some of the better options are:

- Spells. Infertility was sometimes blamed on a curse, which sounds like the basis for a contraceptive spell.

- Various herbs, fruits, and other plants. Some of which were surprisingly effective in real life. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium][Silphium]] gets a special mention for being particularly effective and for being extinct, as far as muggles know. And if plants can be contraceptive, I think it makes sense for them to be used in a contraceptive potion.

Some of the more memorable implementations of contraceptives in fics I remember are:

- A contraceptive spell that also lubricates, making it easy to remember to cast and to tell if it was cast correctly.

- There are contraceptives of some sort in the pumpkin juice at Hogwarts, specifically to prevent teen pregnancies. It has suddenly occurred to me that this could be paired with the typical Indie!Harry attitude of "I don't drink pumpkin juice because I'm better than everyone else and I want to rebel against magical society in every pointless way possible" for some very amusing crack.

** Not such an uncommon subject, as far as I can tell.

I remember some unfinished fic where Harry's condom broke and Ginny got pregnant, and it turned out wizards need specially enchanted condoms (a subconscious desire to procreate or something). Then there was a fic where Madame Pomfrey saw Ginny and Hermione walking funny during Christmas and handed them contraception potions just in case (with Mrs. Weasley giving them another dose during the summer vacation). Then there was a fic where Harry's returned parents caught a glimpse of him with Ginny and later Lily handed them a book on the subject (which had a day-after-spell, among other things). Another one has Ginny and Harry delaying their first time until they can brew a potion. There was a crack fic where Harry's body produced anatomically impossible amounts of semen in an attempt to compensate for the contraception spells, and Harry combined a contraception spell with one to help with the defloration pain. I would rather not post links, not least because I'm not sure how many of these fit the no underage rule. Oh, and there are some sex-ed class fics as well, although they do seem to focus more on breast enlargement for an unclear reason.

** Usually see a potion lasting 3 or 6 months which has the added effect of eliminating monthlies.

Have also seen both male and female targeted contraceptive spells.

** I saw no stories that talked about it in detail, it was always just a throwaway mention of some kinda contraceptive spell or something like that.
