Yandere Tom/V is my kink.

My favourite ff so far:

"What He Grows To Be" by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Severus_divides_into_H/pseuds/Severus_divides_into_H][Severus_divides_into_H]]

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle is a frightening coil of darkness, cruelty, and greatness, and changing him is Harry's only hope for saving people he loves. Going back in time, he takes Tom from the orphanage, but his optimism shatters with every year they spend together.\\
  Tom still longs for darkness. Tom stifles him in his possessiveness. Tom is fixated on him to the point of destroying the world just to keep him.\\
  But Harry loves him. And the future changes.
