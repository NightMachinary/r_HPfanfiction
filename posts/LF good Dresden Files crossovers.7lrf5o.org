Already read the one that everyone had read.


** reread a bunch of Dresden crossovers like 5 months ago; here's my thoughts on some I'm assuming u meant the denerain series so wont mention those

deal with a devil is another harry gets lash coin; don't remember much other than its overpowered harry, and it was marginally better than denerian renegade series due to the fact harry actually had some character growth/devlopment linkffn(11188292)

my fav crossover was Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain felt it had the best crazy harry portrayal I've seen also had good dialogue, harry gets summoned to Dresden verse by evil warlocks, also has POV from both harry's linkffn(3468902)

also their was a DresdenXSong of ice and fire that i read that i never finished cuz Dresden kept making problems for himself (which i guess is keeping him cannon compliant shrug) [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336499/]]

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

*** It's meh honestly, I liked the premise; where Harry thinks his life is a dream, it was pretty well written but the characters are a bit OOC, especially Harry (as in Potter)
