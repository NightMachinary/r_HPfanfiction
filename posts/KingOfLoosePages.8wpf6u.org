Anyone know what happened to KingOfLoosePages on ff.net? His page has a really good HP/Naruto crossover, and a sequel, but the sequel isn't complette, and there's no notice of anything else on his page or live journal about anything at all.


** Sometimes people just up and leave the fandom, no notice given. Could be a lot of different reasons.
