TPSR is the start of a series that has young Harry meet Tonks pre-Hogwarts (Tonks is aged down to be the same as Harry) and Andromeda is a pretty prominent part of the story. Honoestly I can't actually recommend this series, though. I really enjoyed it despite its flaws (and there's a lot) but then in the later books it starts stirring up drama between the main cast for some of the most retarded shit the author could come up with. They're all acting out of character (in series character, not canon character) and passing the idiot ball around in order to force Harry to be angsty (to which the author basically says "yeah I wanted Harry to be angsty deal with it") when there's already plenty of actual shit to deal with in regards to Voldemort and the actual plot. It had a lot of promise and interesting ideas but I couldn't get past that.

SoP,DoB is a really interesting one with more of the Black family dynamic you seem to be looking for. It's not perfect and it plays a lot of tropes straight, like politician Blacks (and some Harry) and family magic and whatnot, Harry becomes somewhat of a Mary Sue, and the Liger thing (it makes sense in context but spoilers) was 2edgy5me and I'm an edgy motherfucker. But if you can get past that it's a pretty interesting and enjoyable read. Although I have a soft spot for fem!Harry fics where Harry becomes a girl either through accident or because she was diaguised as a boy from birth or whatever the excuse is. Unfortunately this one is unfinished and hasn't been updated since 2017.
