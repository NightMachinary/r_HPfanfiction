** Here are my personal favorites:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] by seeker68. This is one of the best-written, most canon-compliant post-Hogwarts fics I've ever come across. It is complete. It has an awesome sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][31 Bottles]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War]] by Mrs_Granger. Maybe not quite as well-written as Learning to Live Again, but the plot is more interesting. It is complete. It has an amazing and very long sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] by sand_dollar. A neat take on Harry, Ron and Hermione moving on with their careers after the war. Story is complete and has a sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][If Spring Ever Comes]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304679][Evolution]] by sophie_hatter. This one is more of a love story focused on Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione. It is still a work in progress. Full disclosure, I beta read for this one. Personally, I think it's brilliant.

*** I second Summer After the War and Winters After the War. They were some of the first fanfics I read, and I really liked them at the time.

**** I'm sad that Mrs_Granger isn't writing any more. I would have loved to see what else she could come up with.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and answers!]] It's my hands-down favorite fanfic ever. Little0bird captures the essence of JK's writing, and extends it. The only qualm that I have about this piece is that it stays true to canon, and I'm a pretty big H/HR guy....

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King]] - "The Sea King" - probably the first version of "19 years later" that I liked. There is something special here.

** I'm a fan of Northumbrian. Characterisations are usually on point, cannon compliant, interesting stories. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6446][Shadow Walks]]- HP meets the multiverse theory, incredible well thought out read.

Rare example of using this entire Multiverse thing beyond "I want AU that technically is not an AU".

It sits in Angst/Romance but I would classify it as Adventure/Romance - there is angst (at start), there is properly used fluff and incredibly satisfying ending.

Also, certain small ideas that alone make this worthy reading (like this tidbit about certain robber).
