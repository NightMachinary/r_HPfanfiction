I recently read Harry Potter Mercenary again and I have a craving for something similar. Perhaps a Harry that has lost all fucks to give, and will only lift a finger after some serious monetary incentive. Any ideas?

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

** linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?)

Harry was basically raised by overpowered mercenaries from the Narutoverse, and he sets up his own branch of their bounty-hunting agency in the HP world. He also tends to complete his contracts to such a rigorous degree that UN peacekeepers think that small-scale nuclear devices have been set off in third-world countries.

**** Depends on what you look for. Knowing some Naruto will help you with the first few chapters and some times along the way. Its a crack fic though, so if you can accept things as you go along you should be fine without any Naruto lore

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** more soldier than bounty hunter / mercenary, but IIRC these have a similar feel:

linkffn(Per Ardua Ad Astra) crossover with Stargate Atlantis

linkffn(Khaveyrim) crossover with NCIS, same or very similar premise

  AU Harry pays a high price for booting Voldemort out of his mind at the end of OotP - he is stripped of his magic, but gains something ... other. He starts a new life in the non-magical world, and adapts his skills to join the RAF and later 'The Regiment'. He is assigned to the Atlantis Expedition and, through overcoming adversity, will find a new home and family amongst the stars.

  Spin-off AU of Per Ardua Ad Astra. Harry lost his magic and became a soldier. Ziva lost her sister and became a spy. Theirs is an unlikely bond, a friendship forged in fire, blood and loss that endures despite divergent commitments to duty, country and agency. First only friends, who became something more - something deeper, more powerful. They are, and always will be 'khaveyrim'.

** Linkffn(Life's Hope, Death's Hunters)

Pretty good read, the only part I didn't enjoy was the rather anti-climactic ending. It had a good build up, though, and Harry and Hermione use the bounty-hunter business as training to defeat Voldemort rather than because they don't gice a fuck.

*** For any looking into this; while the premise sounded interesting, the first few chapters are full of cliches and the writing is pretty choppy. I stopped around chapter 5, it just wasn't worth continuing. It felt like an "I've read this before, and it was better written elsewhere" story.
