** If you manage to put your entire soul in a jar in the hp universe, then your body dies. Then you are now stuck in an object unable to do more than get annoyed at people. The result?

Swear jar.

** There's a necromancy fic like this centered around the triwizard and it was set up amazingly for a sequel or more but I think the author said they never planned on it being more then the one story. Unfortunately I don't remember the name at all maybe someone else can think of it
