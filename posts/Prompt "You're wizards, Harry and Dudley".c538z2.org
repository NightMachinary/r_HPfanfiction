Despite Vernon and Petunia's dearest hopes and assumptions, apparently not /all/ the accidental magic around the house was Harry's. Nobody expects it, but Dudley gets a Hogwarts letter too.

And then (since his horrified parents won't let their son see such poison either) he gets four, and then eight, and then one hand-delivered by Hagrid just like his cousin... What happens next?


** There's a really good one that's basically a character study of a magical Dudley through the years. Harry isn't a huge part of it, but that kinda makes it nicer, as Dudley can grow on his own.

  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.” The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. “I've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.”“And I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

** Magical Relations had this, granted there was only one set of letters.

Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone also had a magical Dudley Dursley, but he was a time traveler to boot. One of the Professors delivered the letters since Dudley was a muggleborn.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.
