Looking for any fan art of Harry Potter from the fanfiction Blindness by AngelaStarCat

I would like to see somebody make a good interpretation of what this version of Harry Potter looks like with the scars across his eyes and his staff along with maybe a depiction of the deathly hollows surrounding him.

Also I can not pay for any commissions, much like the average redditor I am Flat Broke
