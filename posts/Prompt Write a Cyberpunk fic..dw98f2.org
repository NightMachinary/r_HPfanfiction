** I wrote something in that vein once: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12066162/3/Braindump-Ideas-un-edited-unfiltered-and-available-for-anyone-to-use]]

Not quite on that +commission+ prompt you posted, but thematically similar.

*** I think no ones responded yet because they have all realized 'Holy Shit! That's an awesome idea! I have to write a whole fic on that!'

**** In general this community reacts well to prompts, as long as the prompts are written like [[/r/WritingPrompts]] does.

I think you set too many conditions, hence why I called it a commission. With that many requirements it seems more like a request than a prompt.

** Don't forget Justin Finch-Fletchley, whose (possibly noble) parents may well be able to afford tech that's better than what a pair of dentists could.

*The good news:* Our little Hermione/Colin/Dennis/Justin/Harry's genetic modifications are a resounding success, and the child is highly intelligent, emotionally stable, perfectly healthy, and very attractive; there is no sign of rejection or other failure to integrate bloodstream nanobots; and s/he has taken to her/his cybernetic implants like a proverbial fish to water and is taking full advantage of them, making full use of the additional 8 senses, always looking up facts in the Encyclopedia module and already adept at using the Coprocessor module for basic pattern recognition and estimation tasks, accessing the Memory module at about the right level of frequency, and mediating the three very well.

*The bad news:* Upon arriving at Hogwarts, those implants will probably fail, and our little Hermione/Colin/Dennis/Justin/Harry will die.

Or, if you want to be generous, their own magic will somehow integrate the implants so that they still work in Hogwarts; in which case, you have a bunch of super-genius kids who cannot relate to their unenhanced peers, which sounds like a perfect recipe for more Dumbledores, Grindenwalds, and Riddles; who have more in common with each other than with the rest of the wizarding world. (Of course, the Physics submodule in the Coprocessor would be very confused.)

** Yeah, this is more written like a "challenge."

Let me reformat this for you.

Write a fic where the muggle world has advanced to cyberpunk levels of technology. There are several things which must be true in your fic:

​ 

Hermione is incredibly augmented. From her body, to her brain, she has technology throughout it.

​ 

The Wizarding World has no clue of this advancement until the beginning of the story.

Magic must not affect the advanced technology.

The Cyberpunk world must impact the Second Wizarding War in some way.

And, finally,

Every muggleborn(and Harry) must also be augmented, but less so than Hermione.
