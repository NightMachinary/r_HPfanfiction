They don't have to be the MC, just in the story more than in canon.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any length/Old or New. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc


** The link below if for Order of Mercy, it's a story set during the seventh book that focuses on Bill an Fleur and a bunch of other characters and it is one of the best versions of their relationship and the rest of the Weasley family that I've seen. Hope you enjoy!

** Bungle in the jungle is an original adventure starting Harry and Bill somewhere in south america. It's an older fic but I really enjoyed it.

** linkffn(Behind the Curtain by Bobika) has Bill playing a substantial role though he isn't the main character. Sadly, I don't know whether the story will still be updated. Chapter 18 wraps up the first arc so you could stop there and skip chapter 19, which is the start of a new arc.

A fic that features Charlie is linkffn(Fox Ears by Starhorse). It has a sequel that focuses on Bill but I can't remember the title.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, then the war. Harry now guides the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. Canon loyal, not dark. Adventure, not angst.

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
