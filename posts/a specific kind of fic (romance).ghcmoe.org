I was wondering if anyone can recommend me some good HP fanfiction? I've recently acquired a taste for stories taking place at Hogwarts with OC characters, though if you can give a fic with the OG characters that is too good to pass, I won't say no either. I'm looking for a cute rivalstolovers story between characters from different houses, maybe between a Slytherin and Gryffindor, preferably slowburnnn & well written :)

I ask for an OC story because I've read Drarry and Dramione (which kind of fit the criteria) but while they're good fics, I want a “feel-good story” with no previous bullying, usage of slurs or a “sectumsempra” incident to gloss over. I just want that rival house, glaring at each other from different tables, realizing the other is hot but “oh shit they're my rival”, sharing classes and trying to be better than the other, coming to Hogwarts every new year with new pranks to pull, crazy quidditch matches kind of tension.

You get what I mean haha. And this goes for any straight, gay or lesbian romance, no discrimination in my search for these kinds of fics.


** I don't know any OC fics that fit this. But I do know a Haphne fic that does this premise quite well. Don't Look Back in Anger - linkffn(13408959) follows this idea pretty closely I think and the relationship makes sense.

  There are two similarities between Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass. Both of them are partial to their mothers and both of them hate each other passionately. When they are elected as the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts, can they put aside their personal issues and work together? AU with Neville as BWL. Rated M for multiple reasons.
