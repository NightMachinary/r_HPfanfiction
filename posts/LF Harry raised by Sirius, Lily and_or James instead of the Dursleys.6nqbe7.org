I already read the entire Saving Connor/Sacrifices series and loved it. I also enjoyed Harry Crow which suggested other alternatives. I just started reading fan fiction about six months ago so the world is my oyster and I appreciate your help! I


** I always like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), for stories in which Harry was raised by his own parents. This fic should no longer be considered just as a fanfiction, but an original fiction with HP characters and settings.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** Ah okay then, there's an absolutely fantastic story called Harry Potter and the Soul Bond by Keira Marcos. She has her own website, keiramarcos.com. Harry is raised by Sirius and it is Harry/Hermione.

Are you interested in Harry being raised by Severus?

****** Fixing Past Mistakes by Debstheslytherinsnapefan is bomb. I love all her stories. A New Place to Stay is one of my faves of hers. It isn't Severus raising Harry from childhood but he does become his father figure in 5th or 6th year I believe.

Another excellent one is Harry's New Home by kbinnz. I have read it maybe 5+ times and I still adore it. It is relatively light hearted, charming, Severus becomes Harry's father figure in first year, so again not from babyhood but still he very much 'raises' him. I would highly recommend!
