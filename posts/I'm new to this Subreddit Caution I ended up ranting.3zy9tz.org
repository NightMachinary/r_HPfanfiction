I actually started reading Harry Potter fanfic January of last year and It has been the only thing I've read everyday since. I mean EVERYDAY. I thought it was un-healthy at first of how addicted it became. At first I would read any H/Hr fanfic It came to the point that I didn't even want to read my pairing anymore because it honestly aggravated me how much Evil! Manipulative!Dumbledore and Weasly bashing (I don't mind mild bashing Ginny or Ron but Bill/Charlie/Twins/Arthur bashing just feels too weird to read. I'm indifferent about Molly) there was that came hand in hand with this pairing.

Than I ran into Time Travel. Drarry( Draco becoming blind from Quidditch is my all time favorite fanfic from this pair). Super! Powerful! Harry, Super Powerful! Time Travel! Harem! Harry. Askaban! Harry. Abused! Harry (it became a guilty pleasure until people OVER did it and had Snape calling him pet in one fanfic that i read, no...just..ugh. So far my favorite one is where Harry becomes blind and Severus actually trains him instead of becoming mother goose.)

Which reminds me....Soulbound fics can burn into the blazing inferno that is hell. It's like someones shouting in my face "THEIR IN LOVE AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT! LOOK AT HOW MUCH LOVE THEY HAVE!"...Oi!

Then there's Harry "too many names" Potter fanfics with all his houses around the world and so much gold and blah blah blah blah...I don't know how many I've read . It's like people are smashing the numbers on the keyboard when they want to say how rich he is. Making me want to punch people through my phone. Repeatedly. (I appreciate those who write Powerful! Harry over Powerful! Rich! Harry)

There are also plots that sound really interesting but get ruined because the writing is so in your face. Like someone is reading a list of events, NO TRANSITION WHAT SO EVER.. "He did thing. Then he ate a thing. They all laughed at a thing. Another thing happened. An event happened. Let's not talk about why or how he accomplished a thing, BECAUSE REASONS". These kinds of stories make me just stare off into space thinking about re-evaluating my hobbies.

Come September I couldn't read any fanfic without ideas of fanfic to write coming to me. (Thank Merlin for my Fantasy Football obsession)

I've had a year of pent up annoyance and I couldn't discuss this with anybody. NOBODY I KNOW READS FANFIC!. I just found Dark Lord Potter becuase I was looking for Ginny debates. At the same time I found this Subreddit today so I needed to release some extreme stress. It's really hard to try and bounce ideas of stories when the only person who you know reads fanfic is yourself...Heck I get ideas for stories and plots while listinening to Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Three Doors Down, Rise Against, BFMV and Disturbed.

So if your still here and read through all that ranting.

How do I go about asking for opinions about a story I have in mind? Do I just post it or is there a section here where I post it?

Also if you want to comment about any of my ranting go right ahead. I like to know what people think about what I said.


** A. There are other beverages to try aside from Red Bull. Herbal tea might be worth a shot.

B. Story ideas are welcome, so long as you are willing to have people tell you what they think. They may even tell you what they think about your ideas, but it is equally likely that they'll start discussing Centaurs... with tentacles. It's a theme lately.

C. If you choose to write, get the help of a beta-reader.

D. 'I've' is short for 'I have' and is not spelled 'Iv'- that might be roman for '4' or a medical term for an intravenous feed, but it is not a subject and verb contraction.

Now I can only read things that are far away from canon like wand and shield linkffn(8177168), growing up kneazle linkffn(6690487), marauder or next gen stories. I also have the problem that I can't read anything without getting the urge to write my own. I have actually written about 70000 messy words with enough storylines to make a million and abandoned it.

Make a post with your idea to at least have a sounding board. It's frustrating to be excited for something and not having someone to talk about it.

I'm up to 6 reports in a ~45 days for people plagiarizing, especially DLP 5* authors and stories. I don't know if it's a bot or a really dedicated troll, or perhaps even someone with a severe mental disorder and a desperate need for validation, but regardless it's gotten really, really bad recently. I'm not sure if the backend is capable of a more thorough banning, but ffnet is in desperate need of it for this person.

Edit: and I'm not talking just one or two things, their account is literally 200+ stories that every last one of which are in the top 5k reviewed stories. All have been banned but occasionally another one pops up having slipped through the radar.
