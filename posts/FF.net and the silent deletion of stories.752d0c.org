Something that is really starting to grind my gears, is how FF.net silently removes stories from your favourite list when they are deleted from the site - without any kind of notification. Why can't they keep the entry in my list and mark it as deleted, or at the very least send me a PM "Yo, story x on your fav/follow list has been deleted". Meh.

Any way around this except obsessively keeping a local favourites-list in a text file or a google doc?


** I would recommend using Calibre with FanFicFare to download an update your stories. Works with *a lot* of different sites, and you can put everything on your ebook reader with ease.

*** Yep, I learned early: download, don't bookmark. Can't even tell you how many things I lost in the days of little themed archives that would go dark with no warning. Buffy fandom had a bunch of those.

*** Calibre has been a life saver for me. My library is filled with both favorites and stories I've yet to read but don't want to risk being deleted before I read.

** The staff working on ff.net is one of the worst I've ever seen. Because they are the biggest website hosting fanfiction, they don't care about customers.

**** The price you pay to get things for free.

Considering how many great stories are on FF.net and generally how reliable the site is, I really cannot complain too much, even though I think it has huge rooms for improvement.

***** Guests is another one.

Moral of the story is that if you aren't paying for something online that makes you the product. If they aren't selling your activity then a site will go under without third party funding. Patreon is pretty darn sweet for this reason.

** fictionhunt.com has all of the HP stories from FF.net, even the deleted ones.

The only way they get removed from FH.com, is if the author emails them and asks to remove them. That seems pretty rare, but does happen.

** Well I expect the authors have good personal reasons for deleting fics. I can't see what use it would be getting a notification that a fic has been deleted. If you can remember the author's name there might be an explanation on their profile.

Exactly and if FF.net bothered to tell me I wouldn't have to wreck my brain about the author name or the title of the missing story. Also the author may have just moved to a different site and if FF.net told me that they deleted their story I might find it again.

To avoid the situation where you finished the story a month ago and just go about your days, confident it's still around for rereading at some point in the future, only to find a year later when you actually try: "uh? where did /that/ go? fercrisssake I /had/ favourited it... what was it called again? gaaah"
