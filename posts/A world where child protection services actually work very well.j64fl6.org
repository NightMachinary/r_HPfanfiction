Or any fanfic where Harry gets out of the Dursleys before going to Hogwarts and work on some traumas. Something that can make me cry gets extra points.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

***** I just passed the whole day reading and omg.

Hermione and Harry acting-like-brothers is the plot I didn't know I needed it. I just really wanted so much to Dean and Harry to beat the living shit out of Ron, but I won't spoiler' the fun (ha I'm funny ha/s) to anyone wanting to read it.

I'm just sad the author last update was in 2012. That wasn't the kind of tears I was talking about, but ill take what I have.

** The Innocent series by MarauderLover7! Sirius breaks out of Azkaban early and raises Harry himself, the series is currently on book 4 and is still being regularly updated. Also features a Gryffindor!Draco with a Slytherin twin. Definitely tugged on my heartstrings a fair few times.
