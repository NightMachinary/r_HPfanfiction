  AU after HBP:Chap2. After OotP, better choices are made: instead of staying a passive influence, Albus becomes an active part of Harry's life; and Ginny becomes a better friend. And at the end of summer, the hunt for the Horcruxes begins! H/G

** There's the Child of Hogwarts story by AimeretVivre. linkffn(11829846)

Basic premise is Harry being adopted by Albus/McGonagall after his first year at Hogwarts. Author is on the third story of the series- it was moving at a quick pace but has slowed significantly, although it's definitely not abandoned, I just think the author is busy in life lately.

  First in a series of canon-based stories, which will follow Harry Potter from the summer before COS through Hogwarts. When Harry returns to the Dursleys after the events of PS, his summer gets off to a terrible start. Albus intervenes, taking Harry back to the castle. Come see how multiple POVs and changing relationships slowly shape Harry's world! Mentorship; Training; Adventure.
