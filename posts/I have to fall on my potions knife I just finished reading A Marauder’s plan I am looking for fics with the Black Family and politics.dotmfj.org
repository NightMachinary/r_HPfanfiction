Or battles. I am looking for the most hated of tropes The black family uniting /rebuilding and wielding power. Maybe a redemptions story if possible. Something like the A Marauder's pan. A fic with the Black family taking on Voldemort or raising harry. I am a fan of Andromeda, Sirius , Regulus and Arcturus Black or fics that have the characters written well. Anything with dueling or Sirius teaching Harry Warding magic would be great. Any pairing or romance is fine. I am just looking a well written Black Family fic.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.
