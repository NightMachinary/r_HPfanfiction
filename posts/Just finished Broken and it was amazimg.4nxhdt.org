One of the best books I've read this year, FF or not. I'm always shocked to read something so good and realise that no one is making money out of it.

Wow.

** Alright, I'll give it a shot, although from the summary it doesn't sound like something I'd read.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

** Yes, this story. I read it years ago and I still remember how good it was. I cried so much. It is so worth reading.

** Yep, it's really good. I only read Draco stories if they are post-Hogwarts and if they don't turn him into a saint. Developing Draco into a person can be really interesting, but there's few fanfiction clich√©s I hate more than fanfic!Draco.

** I read it a while ago and I thought it was absolutely beautifully written, probably one of the most well written fics I've ever read at that time but the story itself was very emotionally heavy.

No one was happy for the entire story and that honestly was a bit emotionally draining for me to read.
