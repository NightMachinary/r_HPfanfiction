** I'm Polish so the first fanfics I ever read were in Polish too. The only reason I got on the Internet in the first place was to learn more about Harry Potter. I discovered something called "Fanfiction", a new word I never heard before and I somehow thought that this was some kind of unpublished excerpts from the books lol. I was around 7-8.

I remember reading fanfic in which Dumbledore dies - the fanfic must be written after GOF has been published but before it was translated to Polish, because 'Deatheaters' had a different name than in the official translation. It was titled "Alternative ending of the 7th book" and depicted 7th years during their leaving ceremony on the last night at Hogwarts. I was shocked with this death because I thought this was official and then relieved when I learned that fanfiction was, in fact, a fiction created by fans. Oh, the irony.

I did manage to find this fic thanks to web archive and its an interesting circumstance that in this fic, Voldemort hides in the wand of one of the Hogwarts professors. The latest this fic would be published would be 2001 because that's when Polish translation came. If anyone is interested, [[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20051228132658%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrypotter.org.pl%2Findex.php%3Fpokaz%3Daz7t][here is a link with google translate]], most of things still make sense despite auto translation.

linkffn(not your ordinary love story by Londonwitch) linkffn(paradigm shift by rocklobster)

There are others that probably got taken down. I just remember snippets of them but had no luck finding them ever again. One was a fic where Lily was torn between Remus and James (none of that Snilly back then) & another was Lily becoming a spy for the Order because she was actually Voldemort's daughter.
