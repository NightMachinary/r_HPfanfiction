. I'm planning a fanfic that starts in the 4th year and there is no Harry there, the scenario is practically the same. But I can't get enough creativity to develop Voldy's steps in a situation where Dumbledore is the only hope but he can still kill him through Snape. lets go. - he recovers the body, - explodes askaban, - takes a few months off to recover completely in silence -, and in less than a year 'he' kills Dumbledore and takes over the ministry and officially reveals himself and blah.

Is this a logical sequence of his steps? can anybody help me ? ðŸ˜­D:


** Was Harry never there or died at Godric's Hollow and someone else temporarily defeated Voldemort or did Harry die pre-Hogwarts while at the Dursleys or in 3rd year somehow? Those would lead to completely different sequences of events.

The least change would require Harry dying sometime in 3rd year or during summer after 3rd year, I can see your scenario occuring then. Mauled by transformed Remus? Kissed by dementors? Killed by escaping Pettigrew hoping to garner Vodemort's favour? The wizarding world would be grieving.

If Harry was killed by the Basilisk before stabbing the diary, then we would have a young Tom Riddle going around.

If Harry died pre-Hogwarts or in first year, then Voldemort would get the philosopher's stone and resurrects earlier. Your scenario could fit then, but the timeline may be shifted. By 4th year he could already take over the wizarding world, and Dumbledore would be at disadvantage of not knowing about horcruxes as Lucius wouldn't try to get rid of the diary. Or, if Voldemort can't get it out of the mirror, then he potentially also could resurrect faster, using the same ritual as in canon, but with random person substituting Harry and Quirrel's help instead of Wormtail's (no need to drift without help for 2 years).

If Harry was never there, and there was nobody to defeat Voldemort, then he would take over the wizarding world back in the early 80s, so there would be no need to get a new body or get his followers out of Azkaban.
