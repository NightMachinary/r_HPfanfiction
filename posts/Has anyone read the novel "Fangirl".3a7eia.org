Has anyone read the novel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangirl_%28novel%29][Fangirl]] by Rainbow Rowell? It's supposed to be about a girl who writes HP fanfiction, although in her universe the series is called 'Simon Snow'. Would any of you recommend reading this book? What did you like/dislike about it?


** I would mostly recommend it, but I found it extremely frustrating that one of the main plot points was completely dropped at the end - which was so bizarre, like, the author spent so much time writing about it and then just forgot to tell us what happened?

But other than that, I thought it did a really good job of capturing the fandom experience. I could definitely relate to the protagonist.

*** I haven't read the book yet, so I don't know which plot you mean (thanks for not spoiling, haha), but I have heard that the fanfiction that the protagonist is writing is also being published if that's the one you're looking for.

** I loved the book. It explores something we as fans all must face, and probably have faced, by accepting life outside of fandom. It's easy when we're younger to embrace and fill our lives with the fandom we love but as we get older it fades away (though never completely) to make room for adulthood and we also have to accept that those around us lose touch with that world too.

It was a great read and I found it incredibly relatable as its a challenge I've found my own life, finding balance between fiction and the real world. As a con, I didn't care for the men she encounters as love interests, but they were realistic which is probably why (no man is perfect and they're all capable of being clueless dicks sometimes). No sugar coating there.

Two thumbs up!

** I noticed this book at the store and thought it sounded interesting. I didn't end up buying it but meant to add it to my goodreads to-read list and totally forgot. Thanks for posting this. I might see if my library has a copy.

** Fangirl is a great book! It portrays fandoms pretty accurately, but also focuses on other things, such as Cath's life and difficulties. The writing is pretty good, and the main character, Cath, is a really well-fleshed our character. I would recommend it to anyone.

** I really enjoyed it. I feel like it's popular right now to have a geek girl be the main character in YA, but this book hit home more than most because it actually felt the most like my experience in high school/college. I'm not a huge geek, but I'm a massive fangirl and it was refreshing to see fangirls written about as people who have lives outside of fandom as well as wonderful and meaningful friendships within fandom.

10/10 would read again.

** I love, love, love Fangirl. Not because of the fandom aspect (though it was nice to see that represented in a book), but because Cath was so relatable and the coming-of-age story was realistic. People have said that this isn't a book ABOUT fanfiction, it's a book about a girl who just happens to write fanfiction. And I think that's true. It's a novel about growing up and changing and losing your old hobbies and finding connections with people they wouldn't expect. So if you're reading this book because of the Harry Potter (okay, "Simon Snow") aspect, you'll probably be disappointed. But it's a great contemporary read.

I was annoyed by the random fanfiction excerpts, though. It felt like the author just inserted them in there to fill up space. There's no reason we need to see so much of the fanfiction if it doesn't serve a purpose.

On a slight tangent, I can't help but imagine Emma Watson as the twins because she can play both the nerdy type and the glamorous, popular-girl type.
