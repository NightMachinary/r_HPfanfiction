Ok so I have been reading a lot of fics with draco in them and most of the times he is called a coward by other characters because he could not kill Dumbledore. Is the inability to kill a person a sort of personal flaw. I mean he has already managed to impose the Imperius Curse on a girl, managed to smuggle poison and stuff , repaired the Vanishing Cabinet etc. Why is he a coward?

Also there are some fics where he leaves his parents behind and joins the Order and is now termed as "brave" by authors. Would'nt that action be far more cowardly? I mean he is leaving his parents behind to suffer the anger of Voldemort while he hides. I never understood the exact reason as to why Draco Malfoy is termed as cowardly.


** I don't like hating on characters but:

#+begin_quote
  "I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. "And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!" Ron yelled.

He's pretty cowardly, not for being unable to kill Dumbledore but because he pulls shit like this.

Before that he's portrayed as a schoolyard bully who hides behind his goons and his family name/money. Of course he will be seen as a coward by many fanfic authors, and treated as such in their writing.

**** Walk away with dignity. Granted, I haven't read the third book in awhile, so I'm mainly remembering how things went down in the movie. He looked like he was practically cowering.

Instead, he could have stood up to her and said something along the lines of, "Granger, hit me again in that barbaric muggle fashion and I will be forced to defend myself." Then, looked her in the eye to make her think he was serious and walked away with his back straight, instead of running away and clutching his face, crying about how nobody could know that had happened.

He's afraid of what others will think, instead of being Slytherin about it and twisting what happened if anyone tried to use it against him. Because if anyone had, he could have lied and said how weak Hermione was physically and magically. That it didn't hurt and she is such a muggle she didn't even think to use her wand.

The teacher that he's been suspicious of his intelligence all year. You can't even claim that Harry is mistrusting authority right here, as Flitwick or Sprout were perfectly valid teachers to go to if he felt McGonagall was going to ignore him again. In addition, Harry is stupidly lazy. Upon finding out that Voldemort is still alive and after him, he doesn't care. He spends his time playing Quidditch or Wizard's Chess or doing anything other than preparing for a threat to his life. After being chosen for the Triwizard Tournament, he cares more about performing well than finding out why anyone would put him in such a dangerous event that it killed all three competitors before it was cancelled. No matter how you look at it, Harry doesn't just act brave, he acts stupidly reckless and brave.

******* This is a teenager we're talking about. They're known for being unreasonable at times. Even if Harry thought Lockhart was stupid and a bad teacher, he was still the DADA expert who supposedly did all the things he had written in his books. Harry does care about Voldemort being back! What is he supposed to do? Even if he trains every minute he gets, he's never going to match Voldemort's power and experience. Never mind that Umbridge breathing down his neck makes it really difficult, plus upcoming OWLs. He did try to prepare other people as best as he could (Dumbledore's Army). I think he's right not to give up Quidditch or Wizard's Chess, because for him it would mean giving up /living/. With the constant threat of death it's even more important to have moments like this when he doesn't have to worry about anything and can simply enjoy being a kid and being alive. He has had little enough of this in his life as it is. As for the Triwizard Tournament... it shouldn't be his job to find out who put him in it. Surviving the thing as a 14yo is hard enough work as it is without playing detective, as well. There are adults in his life who should be capable of finding out who put his name in the cup, e.g. Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall etc. They didn't have any success, why should Harry?

If Harry truly followed that logic, he'd simply off himself, since there's be no hope of winning at all. But he has no reason to think that. He knows that somehow he defeated Voldemort at the age of one. He knows he defeated Voldemort by burning his face off in Year 1. All of this points to him indeed having a chance of defeating Voldemort.

But all of his actions during the Tournament were stupid. Faced with imminent death, beyond denying that he placed his name in the cup, he doesn't do anything. He doesn't even bother to check up on any laws or rules to find something to help him. He doesn't consult with a professor at all to see if he could find a way out (it wouldn't be considered cheating probably). Upon finding out that there are dragons, he relies entirely on one spell to save him. He spends relatively little effort to find something to save him when he discovers the secret of the egg. In order to make Harry Potter work as a story, Rowling had to have the idiot ball passed around constantly. Thus characters' forgetfulness, impulsiveness, recklessness, all of that is magnified to the point of stupidity. As Harry is the main character, we see the idiot ball in his hands directly the most, and thus he acts (and is) stupid.

And I for one think a grown-up Draco is the perfect partner for Harry. He'd never take any shit from Harry, always tell him the truth, and never be blinded by the Boy Who Lived stuff. I suggest going on AO3 and filtering by Kudos. You might be surprised at how good and beloved some really epic slash fics are.

******* Harry/Draco would be the same as shipping members of the Waffen SS and survivors of Auschwitz whose entire family were killed by the Nazis. Sure, it happened very rarely but in more than 99,5% of the cases, there's too much water under the bridge for anything more than begrudgingly staying in the same room. And Draco spent years believing in blood purity and calling for Harry's best friends to be murdered, praising genocide and being an arsehole so I don't see any reconciling happening there.

Forgiving childhood missteps is one thing but war crimes are something entirely different. And Draco committed several of those.

There is exactly one viable slash pairing and that is Harry/Neville. All others either involve war criminals, men who support genocide, abuse of power/statutory rape or border on incest (if we go with canon Weasleys as Harry's family). There are simply not many decent male characters in the Harry Potter universe. Compared to a whole lot of good female characters.

******** In my experience the same people who decry Harry/Draco or other slash pairings go on to ship Indy!Harry with just about every female Harry Potter character. The point is, it's not real. It's just for fun or to explore different character dynamics. So shipping two fictional characters as a way to relax cannot be put on the same level as excusing real life monstrosities.

I'd argue that some of the most recommended fics here are not even close to Harry's actual characterization, and that's fine because ultimately people like wish-fulfillment. But it's just hypocrisy to sneer at Harry/Draco and then go on to ship Overpowered!Harry/Hermione, Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Daphne etc which are even more implausible.

********* I am not a fan of harems, Daphne Greengrass or OP Harry. The only multi pairings I can see working are Harry/Luna/Hermione and maybe Harry/Hermione/Fleur.

But let's take a look at the mental acrobatics necessary to ship Lunar Harmony and compare those to the ones needed to ship Harry/Draco.

Lunar Harmony:

- There needs to be some sort of attraction between Hermione and Luna

- Both have to like Harry

- Harry has to be ok with two girlfriends who also like each other

Harry/Draco:

- Well, we either need a lot of historical revisionism and turn the magical SS into good guys or have a seriously dark Harry that sides with the murderer of his parents

- Harry has to be gay/bi

- Draco has to be gay/bi

- If we didn't turn the Death Eaters into the good guys Draco needs to sort his shit out before second year (mudblood incident) so we are massively AU

- If we go post-war Draco has a lot of sentences to get through. Just his attack on Katie Bell in HBP would get him hanged for treason against the Queen, thrown into Azkaban for life, sentenced to a lifetime of prison for war-crimes and another couple years for attempted murder. And he committed a lot more crimes than just the attack on Katie.

Canonically, the Malfoys came out of it unscathed. Lucius Malfoy himself was not punished so this is really not an issue. I'd think the bigger issue would be Harry and Draco reconciling the enmity of the past years but I can see post-war Drarry working.

The point is you need a suspension of disbelief for both. One isn't better than the other.

******** You do know that we're talking about *fan* fiction? Which isn't all canon-compliant? Like, have Draco be a bit less off-putting at first, have him get close to Harry for some reason around fourth year. (Shouldn't be hard: Harry's representing Hogwarts, unjustly or not; have to keep up the Hogwarts reputation. Even the worst fourth year should be able to beat Beauxbatons, and Draco has to make sure of it.) With a bit more social grace, Draco could view blood purity as publicly rude and so avoid it most of the time. And then, with time spent with Harry (half-blood), Hermione (Muggleborn), and Ron (blood traitor), he could potentially come to see (awkwardly, gracelessly, with some amount of anguish) that blood purity isn't quite true.

In fifth year, Draco has a personal crisis about whether to side with his parents or Harry. At that point, he could side with Harry, breaking his family ties; or he could try to divide his loyalties, acting as a spy.

Which applies to the canon Harry/Ginny relationship. But the squickiness comes from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect][Westermarck effect]], which tapers off sharply after the age of six. Harry doesn't meet any of the Weasleys until he's eleven. Squick factor also comes from inbreeding, which isn't a problem with adoption.

Luna's half as present as Ginny; Fleur, one third. And now we're below the level of Dean Thomas, who doesn't have anywhere near enough characterization to be viable as the canon character and would be more OC than anything else.

********* *Westermarck effect*

The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction. This phenomenon was first hypothesized by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo. Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation.

******** I'm certainly not the only one, judging from the most popular pairings on fanfiction sites with literally thousands of kudos, comments, and support.

I have zero interest in het pairings myself and don't read them at all anymore. It's incredibly unfair to say to say that there's no value to slash pairings. If it was that deviant to like them, no one would read them. You certainly don't have to like them, but maybe don't insult those who do? I've never insulted a het pairing in my life, especially when I think they're terribly unsuited for one another. Honestly, I'm pretty baffled that some of you are being so nasty. I've always loved fanfic communities for being tolerant, kind, and supportive.

I'm also more than a little confused about your giving full, adult-level Death Eater blame to Draco. He was a child in an adult's war. He was definitely a little asshole, but it's clear in canon that he intensely regretted his actions and did what he did because he was terrified of Voldy killing his parents. Come to think of it, even though he didn't kill Dumbledore, he was pretty brave for the first time by seeing through his plan while under constant threat from pure evil. He clearly didn't want to do what he was doing and I'm surprised that you all didn't see that in canon. And even though I don't like Cursed Child, JK obviously added that he and Harry could be civil and work together. An actual friendship is hinted at between them.

I'm not sure where the animosity comes from, but don't kid yourself that you're following canon in your hatred of Draco. I am a teacher and I'm constantly amazed at what assholes my kids used to be and how much they've changed (like, changed from redneck racists into kind, loving, accepting people.)

I guess the fanfic community isn't as supportive as I thought. And that's a huge bummer.

********* I am not blaming everything on Draco but let's look at just one of his childhood crimes.

He used an unforgivable curse on Katie while giving her a booby trapped necklace to kill Dumbledore. The imperius alone gives him a lifetime stay in Azkaban Resort. We also have attempted murder here, as well as high treason, something punishable by hanging in 1996. And let's not forget that he breaks the Geneva convention multiple times by not being a clearly recognizable combatant, hiding behind civilians and using them to wage war.

Childhood crimes are stealing a bottle of vodka or getting caught with a gram of weed, not being a terrorist and high treason against the crown.

I am not saying that gay pairings are wrong, I am saying that pairings between Harry and most guys make absolutely no sense because most of the male characters we see him shipped with (Draco, Snape, Lucius, Tom Riddle/Voldemort, the Lestranges...) would face at least lifetime in prison for their WAR CRIMES if not outright execution. They are not hot guys who made mistakes, they are murdering, raping scum that broke dozens of laws and supported a genocide because of their sense of racial superiority.

********** I get your point. I do. But did he have a choice? I would argue no. And I think JK would argue no as well, as he clearly didn't go to Azkaban. Yes, it was terrible. But Harry also used Unforgivables at least twice that I can think of. I just don't see Draco as being equally culpable of Death Eater crimes as Lucius or any of the adults. He was basically living down the hall from and sharing a bathroom with pure evil and forced to torture people. He grew up with an unrepentant asshole racist for a father and had little choice but to follow that path. That's what happens to children ("you've got to be taught.") Then he was given an impossible, twisted task by the most terrifying Dark Lord of all time with his mother's life on the line. What are his options? What would any of us do in that case?

I think JK makes it very clear that he wasn't evil, just a kid caught in an impossible situation facing horrors he had no way of dealing with. I think it's incredibly clear in HBP that he doesn't want to do it. And all you have to do is look at Cursed Child to see how JK feels about his character. He is redeemable in her mind (and in Harry's.) I feel like seeing Draco as an evil, racist criminal isn't fully seeing the character we were given. There's a lot more going on with him. I've thought a lot about this. He's my favorite character because of this complexity. He's never been black and white (namely black.)

Your point about all the adult Death Eaters is right on. But I don't put Draco in that category.

#+end_quote

He could have run or contacted Dumbledore. I don't see Voldemort chasing a single guy through New York City, Las Vegas, Sao Paulo, Singapore and Sydney. Just take Narcissa and sneak onto a plane or a ship towards a different continent. That is not difficult with magic. But he chose to go through with being a Death Eater. And his regret does not give Katie back six months of her life. It does not undo any of his crimes.

************ His entire life was being the person his father wanted him to be and his father taught him from birth that Dumbledore wasn't to be trusted. And he was 16. I teach 16 year olds. They make the worst decisions ever about their assignments. I can't imagine when faced with having to kill a teacher or watch your mom die that any 16 year old is going to make the same thoughtful decision as an adult would. I'm NOT saying that teenage Draco was good. But again, JK clearly shows the remorse, clearly shows him struggling badly. And then she doesn't sentence him to prison, redeems him as an adult, and even starts a friendship with Harry. If you don't think he was punished appropriately, your issue is with JK. And again, Harry also uses Unforgivables to achieve his ends. They are two children on opposing sides fighting an adult war with the upbringing they have. If the intention was for Draco to be a stone-cold, unabashedly evil kid, he would have been one. But the redemption (and the doubts) start to creep in around Book 6. It's not accidentally on JK's part. She's pretty good at writing unrepentant evil. And Draco's not it.

Regardless, I agree that I would have liked to see him seek asylum. That is one of the reasons I love fanfic. You get to read hundreds of different versions of events. I've read Draco seeking asylum, Narcissa killing Lucius, Draco's obsession with Harry (cause there's one in canon- no doubt) turn him away from his father. I've read Draco in Azkaban, Draco's wand snapped and him relegated to the Muggle World. I've read Lucius dying in prison, the Ministry taking the Malfoy fortune for war reparations, Draco struggling to get work. I've read Harry sorted into Slytherin and changing Draco's mind about blood purity before he's too far gone. I've read Draco helping kill Voldemort and destroy horcruxes. Thank God for fanfic so we can see those alternatives. But there is still a canon turn towards the "right" side for Draco, even if one has to read to abysmally disappointed and poorly written Cursed Child to see it.

Also, one of my favorite fanfics (which does eventually become Drarry in later "books") is Aeternum's Leo Inter Serpentes on AO3. It's a complete retelling of the entire series with Harry sorted into Slytherin. Yes, Draco IS fundamentally less douchy from the get-go, but what I love about this massive fic is that no one keeps anything from Harry, Snape makes some different choices, and the kids seek out ADULTS and aren't on their own. Sure, it's not as compelling as the original, but it provides some neat "what-ifs." Like, what if Harry learned about the prophecy earlier and could learn how to fight and Occlude earlier? Or what if the kids had just gone to Snape right away about the sorcerer's stone? A lot of it makes a ton of sense!

************ And come to think of it, I do agree with you that readers forget just how evil the Death Eaters are. Which is one of the reasons that I buy Draco's redemption. Because the books never detail what living with Voldemort and the Death Eaters would have been like for Draco. And why would the books contain that? What the books show already is deeply disturbing, but can you imagine if canon wasn't rated and we could see how the Death Eaters probably would be in real life? Cause JK never goes as far as rape or threats of rape, but you know that would be true. It's the ultimate way to control someone. I think (with strong hints from canon) that Draco was pretty much on board (if only to make his Daddy proud) until he had to live with Voldemort and his evil minions and be constantly threatened. I imagine things like, "if you move against us when you're at school, we will rape and murder your mom" were bandied about. I think living with them completely changed him and it's why he can't kill Dumbledore. He also would have given up Harry in a second at Malfoy Manor at Easter if he was as deeply evil as you suggest.

Long story: there is definitely whitewashing of evil characters in canon and fanfic. But Draco is not the same as the adults.

******** So, I just checked Archive of our Own. There are 150k separate HP fanfics. Sorting by Kudos, irrespective of ratings (explicit, mature, etc) the top 10 most liked HP fanfics are ALL slash and 9 of the 10 are Drarry (Draco and Harry.) They all have roughly 9,000 Kudos each. So I would say you're firmly in the minority.

Edit- #79 most popular MIGHT be considered het, but it's a General rated fic where James and Lily are alive and are listed as a pairing. After that, the first het fic on AO3 is #150. And the vast majority of the top 150 fanfics are Drarry.
