Spoiler of PoI ahead. If you haven't watched it yet, it's recommended.

The Machine could see and hear everything but it couldn't work on it's own. Death is something similar to that.


** Person of interest is one of my all time favorite tv shows, at least the earlier seasons anyways. And I think that this could be a very interesting take on the whole MOD trope.
