So I've read both Relatives by HJP Squared ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7998766/1/Relatives]]) and Picnic Panic by LeQuin ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/Picnic-Panic]]) and I'm wanting stories in a similar fashion to theses. Where either Harry has to turn up because Ron is being rude or to cover for Ron because he didn't want to come, has to lead to Harry/Hermione in the end as well.

​

Hope you can help!

:D


** So I thought this was accurate to your ask but a quick glance through has shown me wrong.

But I'm posting it anyway.

** Both of these are horribly OOC by being the Lord Potter crap. I don't like Harmony (and bashing of anybody) generally, but at least in its better versions (like linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities)), they manage to keep the canonical middle-class bourgeois character.

Would it be possible to have just one-shot Harry helping save Hermione where normal Ron would just make a normal stupid mistake, like all humans do? In both these it is just too obvious how it will end.

And of course, if the Picnic Panic behaved as Hermione's parents, dentists, prescribe, i.e., by cutting on sugar, it would help.

*** Neither of those story had Lord Potter at all, one he had real estate, and another he was knighted for services to the Crown.

You're just an idiot.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play
