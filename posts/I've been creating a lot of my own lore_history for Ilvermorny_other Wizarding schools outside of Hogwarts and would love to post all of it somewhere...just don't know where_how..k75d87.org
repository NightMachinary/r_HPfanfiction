Hi everyone. The title's pretty self-explanatory, but of course I'll be expanding on it below:

In my free time, just for fun, I've been doing a lot of world-building surrounding the less-discussed Wizarding schools, notably Ilvermorny. Originally, I was going to write an OC fanfic based there, but I have gotten so wrapped up in expanding this already very interesting world that I've barely written my actual story. If anything, I've written some snippets from a "historian" OC of sorts (well, a student at Ilvermorny that's aspiring toward being one) as well as some more history textbook-esque entries about the school, the surrounding town, things like that.

After all of that, I'd love to post everything online in case someone else would like to use it for their own fanfic about Ilvermorny (or if they just think that fake history is interesting) but I'm not quite sure where to post, especially since I haven't been writing a regular story; it's just a variety of mediums, like diary entries, notes, spells, textbook chapters, and art randomly spliced together. Would something like this be better suited for a blog/website, or would something like [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or ao3 be better for it?

Anyway, I'd love to hear your opinion on it, or if you'd even want some sort of expanded fake history thing for places outside of Hogwarts/the UK. I also thought I'd specifically ask you guys this since it technically is a form of fanfiction, just not in the more traditional sense. Thanks in advance for the help/advice!

EDIT: Decided to go the Tumblr route for now, just to get things started! Thanks everyone! Here's the link: [[https://wizardingworldhistory.tumblr.com/]]


** Ao3 or Tumblr.

I would definitely love this, as this could be used as a base for other fan fictions. I remember there being a fan fiction on ao3, that described the architecture of Hogwarts, with all photos, maps and guides, and the author said that the writers were free to use the information displayed. ^{I'm sorry, I forgot the name.}

** You could just post it on ao3 or tumblr, definitely - there are worldbuilding blogs on the latter and fictional non-fiction on the former.

I'd say try create some sort of unifying framing device, personally. Maybe add in some notes and commentary from Hermione and call it research for an essay or class presentation, or write it as Bagshot's first-draft attempt at a new textbook, etc. Find something to tie all your separate notes together somehow, even if they just stay snippets of textbooks and diary entries.

Definitely make the usage rules you want clear in the opening Author Note. I'd suggest also doing something in the summary too - either a brief hint at the guidelines or just tell them to find them in the AN. A lot of people just skip ANs, so it's best to be sure if you feel passionately about it.

** Toss it up on ao3 and send me a link: if I ever get back to my oc fanfic based on ilvermorny (I also went down the worldbuilding rabbit hole and errrr), I'll absolutely take a look!
