** Obviously Delenda Est, but I assume you've read that if you liked Wind Shear.

Try Linkffn(I'm Still Here by Kathryn518) if you haven't already. Harry's a bit more angsty, but it's a good approximation.

Maybe Linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair). Kind of a stretch, but could work.

Linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgency) is probably the closest in terms of setting, but easily the weakest of the 3 in terms of quality.

You need to remedy this.

Also, maybe try Linkffn(A Clock on the Face of Hell by IdSayWhyNot).

It's hella abandoned though.

****** That sounds about right. Most crossovers seem to be Harry Potter in the World of These Other Guys. But "strange" I don't see. My two favorite crossovers are linkffn(browncoat, green eyes) (HP goes to Firefly) and linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) (Hellraiser comes to HP). Characterization stays about right (or I've read enough fanfics that it didn't seem super strange to me).

But things like linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot; Dimension Hopping for Beginners) (HP and many) and linkffn(Denarian Renegade) (HP and Dresden Files) are really good reads, although DR doesn't focus nearly as much on HP's style as it does on the DF magic, as far as I remember - that being said, no prior knowledge of DF is needed to understand what's going on.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
