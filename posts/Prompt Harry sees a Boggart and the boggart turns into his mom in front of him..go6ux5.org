He's not afraid of her, (per say) but afraid that her death was in vain, and that he should have been the one to die instead.

Can be during third year or afterwards, perhaps his Boggart changed.

Any stories with a similar idea would be great as well. It's something I could definitely see Harry think and feel.

Note if it's part of a story it can be a minor or main part of the story, I'm fine either way.


** I feel like this could go two different directions. On one hand Harry breaks down and isn't able to actually use the spell. Or he is so enraptured by the boggart that he continues to seek out boggarts to see glimpses of his mother. Interesting prompt.

*** I could see it working either way for him to be honest, him either being able to use the spell or him not being able to use the spell, especially if you allow it to happen after Sirius' death, pushing him further into PTSD and depression in general, I could see it being an incredibly angst-y fic.

Plus yes, it could be like the Mirror of Erised all over again and he wants to confront Boggarts to see his mom.

** Not exactly what you asked for. But it's kinda along the lines.

Harry creeped up the stairs aware of what was lurking behind the attic door. He closed his eyes and braces himself for whatever the boggart was going to show him. He had seen so much since he was at Hogwarts as a young boy, he highly doubted that the pest would turn to a dementor. No a wizarding war and years as an auror told him he was going to see something much horrific.

“Harry?”

“Yeah, I'm on it,” Harry called down to Ginny irritatedly. Never mind he had been working practically 80 hours this week and had a ton of paperwork to do tonight. He wished Ginny would have just taken care of this.

He pushed open the door and muttered lumos under his breathe. Turning slowly to see where the damn thing was about to pop out from.

“James?” A soft voice from the back called.

He came more into the room and stopped dead in his tracks as familiar red hair and vibrant green eyes came forward. He couldn't even breathe as his mother came closer. He stared at her wide eyed as she sauntered towards him.

“James?” Lilly whispered, coming closer so that the light from his want made her skin practically glow.

“M-mum?” He felt the beginning prick of tears as he took her in. She was so young- had she really been this young when she died. He looked her over and tried to think about the picture of him and her in the book Hagrid gave her and realized she had been. Tears really did begin to flow as he thought of his own age now in comparison.

Lilly took a step back. Her eyes dancing all over him as she realized he wasn't James.

“It's okay,” Harry reassured, he put out his hand in the same manner he did when he was on a case and trying to help a victim who didn't quite understand what was going on around them. “It's me. Harry you're son.”

Lilly just shook her head and took more steps back. “No. No no no. Where's James?” She demanded, turning about as though he were somewhere in the attic with them. “James! James!”

Harry scowled and reached out to brace her against him. To calm her down. But stopped. His mother was dead. This-this thing wasn't his mother. This was the boggart. He fumbled back as his mother continued to scream for his father. This didn't make sense. Why would he see his mother. He tried to process what was happening bf in between the chaos of his mother's shrieking and couldn't.

“You're dead. She's dead. This isn't real,” he reminded himself fumbling to get his wand hand steady to cast the spell that would rid him of this nightmare.

“I'm dead,” his mother gasped, stopping her shrieks and staring at him in disbelief. “I can't be. I-“

Harry paused, the sadistic part of him wanting to know why it was he was seeing her.

“I can't be dead,” Lilly shook. “I'm -I'm just 21. I can't be dead.”

Harry didn't say anything. He stood there iron faced waiting.

“I can't be dead!” Lilly shrieked defiantly. “I haven't lived!”

And though it was just a boggart those words hit him harder than he expected.

“I didn't live! I didn't do anything!”

“You defied and fought one of the most darkest wizards of our time. You died saving me and I went on to defeat him.”

Lilly's lip quivered and her face contorted as she held her hands to her torso and hugged herself. “You think that was enough for me? You think that was living?”

“That's not living!” Lilly howled, her voice giving testimony to her agony. “That's dying! I died well! I didn't live! I never got to live! Do you think my ambition was to die for you! Do you think when I was a girl that's what I dreamed of?”

“You married my father and you had me you two were in love and -“

“Oh, so you think my great ambition was to marry and have a child?” Lilly challenged savagely, her tears flowing down her cheeks freely. “You think I'm that vapid?”

“No, of course not. I-“

Lilly tried to push past him to the door, but Harry was quick to push her back. This was not his mother and the last thing he wanted was for this this big to get downstairs and find one of his children.

“Let go of me! Let go of me!” Lilly screamed, kicking and clawing at any bit of him she could find. “I want to live! Let me out! I want to travel and see the world! I want to eat and dance! Let me go! Let me go! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I'm young and beautiful I shouldn't be rotting in the ground.”

Harry felt Lilly's body go slack against his and jumped away as she tumbled to the ground. Curling inward on herself as she wept and screamed. “I shouldn't be in the ground. I want to live. I don't want you. I want to live.”

He finally got his hand steady enough to bellow the spell, but the problem now was he couldn't think of anything comical to replace her with. He tried to calm himself down, but each scream vibrated him to his very core.

When the door swung open and Ginny appeared in the room to witness his nightmare he rushed past her to escape. He just couldn't take it anymore. He was in the middle of spilling the contents of his stomach in the hall when he hear Ginny's voice bellow our ‘Rididdikulus'.

A few moments later he felt Ginny's hand on his shoulder, but he squirmed away from the touch. His heart was hammering in his chest and his mind felt as though it had been put through a blender and then back in his skull. He didn't want to be touched he didn't want comfort he just wanted to work out what had happened in there. Why he had seen Lilly and what it meant.

“Harry,” Ginny soothed.

He was crying he realized. Damn it all it wasn't even real and he was crying.

“I need to go,” he said tightly. Standing up and grabbing his cloak in the hall closet.

“What? Harry, no. We-“

“I can't talk about this,” Harry snapped, rushing to the door and appearing the moment he stepped outside. He was in such a state that he hadn't even realized where he chose to go until his feet was on familiar ground.

***also I wrote this on my phone so I'm sure there are a lot of grammar mistakes :/

** Defense Against The Dark Arts Classroom

"Your turn, Harry!" Lupin called out. He'd considered not letting Harry face the Boggart; everyone's fears were bad enough without seeing the Dark Lord in person. But, he had decided that it might be healthy for people to be able to laugh at the most feared man in the British Isles. Harry stepped forward cautiously, desperately trying to think of a way to make a Dementor funny. However, a Dementor was not what came out of the wardrobe.

Lupin swayed where he stood, and Harry actually whimpered at the sight of Lily Potter's body laying in repose. Her red hair was splayed out in a fan behind her; if not for her unnatural stillness and pale skin, she could have been sleeping. Harry's heart froze in his chest, but the Boggart was not yet done torturing him. Boggart Lily's eyes snapped open and came to stare at Harry; "her" gaze was filled with rage and disappointment. The creature began to speak in a voice Harry had only heard in his nightmares.

"I can't believe I died for you. How foolish of me to waste my life on someone as pathetic as you!" Lily spat, "No grades worth speaking of, your only friends are a bookworm and a lazy redhead. You can't even protect yourself from Petunia or that worthless scum Vernon!". Lupin tried to interpose himself between the two people; tried to raise his wand; tried to just open his mouth and say something, anything, but found himself unable. The Boggart Lily seemed to take a breath, as if preparing to say more, but she was interrupted by an unexpected source.

Hermione marched forward, wand sparking as she held it at the ready. "Oi, Potter, why don't you try the bookworm on for size?" she said boldly, pushing Harry behind her. The Boggart sneered at her and began to shift, turning into McGonagall. Before the creature could say anything, however, Hermione went on the attack. "Riddikulus!" she snapped, gesturing violently. Professor McGonagall found herself wearing a skin tight cat suit, easily recognizable to the Muggleborns in the room. The class laughed, a hint of hysteria coloring the sound, and the Boggart exploded into wisps of smoke.

"Harry? Harry, wait!" Ron shouted, causing Hermione and Lupin's heads to snap around, catching sight of a distraught Harry as he exited.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
