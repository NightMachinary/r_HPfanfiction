Unless the future Harry came from was one where Sirius didn't die because of Bellatrix, it is sooooo hard for me to wrap my head around a HarryxBellatrix pairing. It just...no. Past!Bellatrix hasn't killed Sirius yet but Harry still experienced the trauma of losing a loved one to her. Fanfics tend to gloss over that with a few reflective paragraphs before Harry is like “ok” and enters a relationship with Bellatrix. But I... would like to see one where Harry doesn't comply with her interest. (Past!Bellatrix tends to be portrayed as being in love with power as opposed to blood which kind of seems a little meh to me but that's a discussion for another day.)

** Stepping back, linkffn(12317784)

They do get together, but there's the whole agony over what her future-self has done. It also has an explanation for her... attitude in the future.

​

He has even more agony over Pettigrew.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
