:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once read a fanfic in which harry takes a break from the magical world after defeating voldemort and goes to a muggle college. It was harry/hermione. If anyone knows fanfiction like that please help.


** What about the other way around? “Love Is Like A Rose” by liquid lily linkffn(2870133) is the post-War Hinny, where Ginny studies at Oxford. It has been obviously written by an Oxford student with good knowledge of the area.

  Years have passed since Ginny graduated from Hogwarts and last saw Harry Potter, but when she runs into him one morning in Oxford, how will their newfound relationship bloom, and how will her family take it?
