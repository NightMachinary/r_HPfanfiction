** I haven't read the denarian series, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/562135/GreenGecko][Greengecko's]] Resonance/Revolution/Resolution series is one that I enjoyed, but at times was really uncomfortable with Harry's lack of control over his...less moral leanings. I hated seeing Harry act like that, but couldn't stop reading because the story is so engaging. He's really quite evil for a time. Harry is adopted by Snape, and both are straight--wonder of wonders!

*** Never read this story but heard that Harry only really goes "dark/amoral" in the second or third part. Is that so? How is the first part?

**** I'd have to go back and look, but that sounds about right. Harry's still in school for part of the first one, and then starting Auror training. It isn't until he's a bit into his training that his demons start to overpower him. I read all three back to back so I don't quite remember where each one starts and ends, but I enjoyed them all.

**** I can't explain too much without giving away spoilers, but through a big chunk of it I just wanted Harry to get back to the Harry we love, the Harry that wouldn't DO that, dammit!

It's a very well-developed story, with aspects to magic I haven't seen elsewhere, new characters that I didn't mind because they were so well written, and a lot of plots and subplots going throughout the whole thing.
