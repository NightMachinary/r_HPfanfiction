I was just thinking about the idea of a female Voldemort and wondering would that result in less respect, or being seen as less threatening by Dumbledore, would she end up with more female followers, would Bellatrix still be as obsessed, would literally nothing change? Just interesting.


** A female Voldemort may have a different powerbase. We know that he was chummy with his fellow Slytherin alumnis. Voldemort would arguably have a completely different set of Death Eaters at the start of /her/ Dark Lady career. I also don't think that Dumbledore is one to underestimate someone because of sex or gender. Since the physical is removed from the wizarding world for the most part, one could even argue that the "strong sex - weak sex" dynamic never found entry into wizarding society (with a bit of additional worldbuilding).

I think a very interesting divergence could be found when the Black sisters became male. Who would they marry? How would the House of Black be organised, given that male Blacks could continue the line? Would Bellatrix even /be/ a Death Eater, or would she be able to express her sadistic tendecies through other outlets blocked to her as a woman?

Sirius being female would also be interesting. We know that for all the equality magic brings to the table, father and mother are still rather different roles (judging from the Weasleys). Siria (?) taking on the role of a mother for Harry could make for some great butterfly effect thing from the point of them getting together. Maybe even so far as to get Siria completely away from Azkaban as she was Lily's friend and not Jame's and... (insert explanation here) ...so of course Siria couldn't be the traitor.

Or Alba Dumbledore, greatest witch of the millenia. She defeated Grindelwald in duel, even though ...*gasp*... she was pregnant with his baby. Wolfgang Gellert Wulfric Dumbledore would of course be taught the values of his mother and the Dumbledore family would be a beacon of virtue, kindness and mercy among the wizards of Britain and the world. It would be the great-granddaughter Adriana Dumbledore who would fall madly in love with the good looking muggleborn Liam Evans. Their daughter, Poppy Alba Evans, would become the Chosen One to defeat the Dark Lady Voldemort.

And imma stop here. I have things to do and this is far too much fun.

** I'm going to go for some left-field choices here, so:

Hagrid. The oversized orphan girl who loves magical creatures would be interesting and it would be a really fun subverted gender dynamic, the kind of female character we don't usually see in really any media. Umbridge would also probably hate her even more.

McGonagall being male would be interesting. I see a love-hate relationship (platonic) with Snape just like they come to share in some fanon. Male McGonagall might interact differently with Harry too, and would have possibly a closer mentor-prodigy relationship with Dumbledore - although potentially with rumours spread about them.

Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix all being male would make for an interesting dynamic. Narcissus being political and marrying into the femme fatale Malfoy clan and taking his wife's name to continue the line. Bellatrix as male /and/ Voldemort still male would be very interesting - Bellatrix marries to satisfy his family's wishes, but always dreams of something else, and Voldemort lets him indulge in everything beyond his family's strict control. (I'm uncomfortable about making a major gay villain, but it would be an interesting take on the character - and as a woman, Bellatrix has her fans as a villain, gay male!Bella would still get a following I think, like Scar from The Lion King.) Andromedus, the oldest brother, disgraces the family by being taken with a muggle-born witch - or possibly even a wizard as well; making all of the Black brothers into people in unorthodox relationships, and immediately contrasting Andromedus with his brother Bella.

Neville, possibly also gender-flipping Gran Longbottom. Fem!Neville, a naturally timid, shy, and underpowered-seeming witch being contrasted with her strong, independent witch mother, the former Longbottom heiress, who was a war hero would be a very interesting take on the character I think.

*** If Bellatrix was male and Sirius female, you might as well swap their names.

So Sirius was now the brutal and insane enforcer of Voldemort, and Bellatrix the Marauder who defied her family. The new Marauder dynamic and relationship with Lily would be very interesting.

**** Could be either way, but given that I'm basing the fem!Malfoy on Lucius, I don't see her, as the last of the line, changing her name and becoming a Black and having to be subject to Walburga, and/or the other Black wives.

If her husband marries into House Malfoy she keeps her position as queen of the castle and earns herself a consort. For Narcissus, as for Narcissa, the marriage would be an emancipation from what seems in canon to be a somewhat vicious household. I've always headcanoned Narcissa marrying quite young in order to escape her family; being the rich Mrs Malfoy would likely be preferable to spending a lot of time with her no doubt angry parents, and Bellatrix.

** Neville would have the biggest character story change. If you remember, his Grandmother keeps making him feel inadequate by foisting the expectation that he'll live up to his father's legacy. If Neville were female, it is highly likely that the grandmother would treated him more...neutrally for lack of a better term. Not to mention she likely would not have put up with that dropping out the 2nd story window shit his uncle put him through.

*** Well, it's debatable on the latter point, as they were doing it to make sure that Neville's name gets written in the book and that requires an explicit display of underage magic from a child. One could argue that Neville's grandmother started with her expectations from him at a very early age which was what made such inaneness a necessity for his name to be written, but that is not a given so it might or might not have still happened.

Female Neville would probably be all sorts of adorable as a kid, though; at least I can't imagine it differently.

** I mean. The lame obvious answer is Harry. Gender swap a main character and it butterfly effects the whole series.

The more fun answer is I think what if petunia was lily's older brother instead of her omd sister? Perry?(can't be Peter cause there already is one and that'd be confusing) Completely different type of relationship. And maybe that means less resentment and jealousy. Which means maybe no shitty home life for Harry? How ugh would that change things?

  Perry?
#+end_quote

Let us use “Narcissus”; flower-themed and I say it fits because of Petunia's personality.

That said, I don't think it would have necessarily changed the relationship of hers with Lily all that much as far as the bad side of it goes, but it definitely does provide a hook for an alternate foster family for Harry (unless you want to write a crack fic with Vernon and Dudley and a male Petunia, but that's ... yeah, crack), and therein lies quite a lot of possibilities indeed.

** I think for many older characters it would depend on how much gender roles differ in Wizarding Britain - something open to interpretation.

For the younger characters, it depends on how the other characters treat them. If Harry is female, will that result in Draco and Ron hating each other even more, instead of Deraco hating Harry, because the (subconsciously maybe) compete for her attention? Will she be even closer to Hermione, or more distant? Will Snape see her as a way to make up for his failure to save Lily instead of a reminder of how he hated James Potter?

** I think changing the any of the marauders sans James would probably have the biggest effect, since they might have developed feelings for him (assuming we keep them all being straight).

Same with Snape, a female Snape would probably not love/obsess over Lily (again assuming she's straight) enough to betray the death eaters. Then again a female snape might not even join the Death Eaters since Snapes way in was befriending all the male Death Eater Recruits, and I don't Bellatrix would have been interesting in befriending a younger half-blood (She's the only female Death Eater I can think of? Was Narcissa marked/active at that time?). She might also not have such a hateful relationship with James which might keep him closer to Lily, and the lack of anti-Gryffindor/pro-Slytherin mindset might prevent him from joining the Death Eaters anyway.

Ginny would also be interesting since her place in the family is the only girl which makes her special (I might be getting my fanon/canon mixed up here), and if she was a boy then that would be gone, so she would probably have completely different relationships with the rest of her family. At the very least they would probably let Gin ride a broom.

Regulus would probably never betray the Death eaters either, considering that his main role model was Sirius, if Reg was a she her main role model would probably be Bellatrix or Narcissa, at the very least they would have more influence on her development, so she would likely be more pro-Voldemort than he originally was.

** Well, [[/u/360Saturn]] already did a fairly good job of laying some out, but I've got a few others.

Delores Umbridge would be interesting, and possibly even more hated by being male, making him more Tom-like, with a cool charm, rather than Delores' simpering sickly-sweet demeanor.

Severus Snape would be interesting as well. She had feelings for Lily, but in a bid to deny her sexuality, fell in with the Death Eaters, leading up to calling her a Mudblood.

Dudley Dursley being gender swapped would cause a big difference as well. Daisy would most likely be less physical abusing of Harry (no more Harry Hunting! Yay!), but the emotional abuse would probably go up in leaps and bounds.
