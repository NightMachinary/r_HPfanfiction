** That isn't really on-topic here, but if you're looking for a recommendation for a /fandom/ that has a lot of good fanfiction, I'll recommend Worm.

** My #1 fic of all time.

Slice of life, hillarity, hijiinks fluffy bois, an suspictionsly unguarded ventilation shaft, racist people getting what's coming to them it has it all. A prequel, an actively updated sequel. Active discord server with dozens upon dozens of authors.

Undertake post pacifist fic, reasonable character development, good memorable oc's.

  The experiment was simple in principle, and even if it hadn't worked as planned, it would have been a step in the right direction. But something went wrong; time and space turned inside out and upside down, and the best hope for monsters to escape the Underground went up in flames with half of the C.O.R.E. Facility. Years later, after the Barrier was finally shattered, that unplanned experiment bears unexpected fruit. And Royal Scientist Wing Ding Aster has a lot of catching up to do.
