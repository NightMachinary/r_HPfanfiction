I /really/ want this.


** A plot twist where you kill off your two main characters when the book is marketed for people who really like to ship them together... that's fucked up. I highly doubt you'll find something already written.

*** For a serious story, I pretty much agree with you. But if we think about potential trollfics, this seems like a solid idea for one that could very well exist.

I do remember seeing something similar: a indy!Harry/Severitus trollfic which starts out with [[/spoiler][Snape revealing to Dumbledore that Harry was secretly his son. Meanwhile, Harry had escaped Privet Drive and gone to Gringotts, where he was told about the many Potter vaults. They were warded to only allow those with Potter blood entrance without harm. Yeah, it ended up pretty much how you'd expect.]]

  ONESHOT, PostOotP. Parody on Severitus and Independent!Harry stories. VERY short, practically joke format.

*** I can kind of see a vague outline of a plot like that: Voldemort seduces Harry to get him to lower his guard, then kills him; it wouldn't be the first seduction+murder plot. Of course, Harry would have to be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ft4xx/slytherin_orientation/d2cae5h][ophidiosexual]] for that to work.

A more plausible plot might have Voldemort seduce Harry with promises of power and by feeding him Manipulative!Dumbledore conspiracy theories. Then, when Harry, say, revenges himself on the Dursleys and thus loses Lily's sacrificial protection, Voldemort betrays and kills him. It might make for a pretty decent tragedy.

*** You could have a failed murder attempt and that could be really funny or a really tragic betrayal depending on the story. Harry actually getting "murderized" does make it just a trollfic.

** I don't know any Tom/Harry, but I know a Tom/Hermione one that goes exactly like this, except Tom kills her because he's insane and in his head it's an act of love. I imagine a Tom/Harry where Tom kills Harry and it's not a trollfic would work the same.
