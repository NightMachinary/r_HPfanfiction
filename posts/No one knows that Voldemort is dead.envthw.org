Voldemort died the first time with Harry, but it was too traumatic for him, or his parents(who were still alive) to remember that it wasn't a simple death eater attack. After several years, thee ministry and the light side thought that Voldemort was planning something, while the death eaters thought he was away for a huge project, which was what he said before he left to kill Harry. Basically, everyone thought Voldemort was still alive when he was dead


** I haven't read it, but as I understand it (and the title shows it as well), linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) has a similar premise, though instead of being an assumption everyone makes it's a charade knowingly perpetuated by the Death Eaters.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Atonement linkffn(13349364)

Harry pulls a gun at the graveyard killing Voldy moments after his ressurection. Then Wormtail, then the rest of the Death Eaters one by one as they apparate in. Harry returns to Hogwarts via portkey and pretends nothing happened. That's chapter 1.

  Harry received some useful advice before the third task. The butterfly effect will be going full-speed. Not everyone is happy with the changes. Enjoy

** Voldemort dies, but the death eaters assume he'll be back in another few years. Some try to search for him while the others take turns disguising themselves as Voldemort and leading attacks to keep the public believing that Voldemort is still around and to keep the movement from collapsing, in the hope that when Voldemort comes back he'll be happy to return to a country that's practically already under his rule. The good guys try to kill "Voldemort" but obviously don't get anything done because he's already dead and they're just killing pretenders.
