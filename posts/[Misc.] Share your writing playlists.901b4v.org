** As in music we listen to while we write?

I only listen to music without any words into it, and usually game music. The Witcher 3, for example, has amazing music for setting a scene in your mind. The Witcher 3's base game, the music for the DLCs, the unofficial soundtracks you can find on Youtube, the live recordings, there's so much of it and a piece for nearly any scene you want to paint. Even fight/action scenes. Especially fight/action scenes.

Skyrim and Oblivion also have great music, especially if you want something soothing. Dark Souls and Bloodborne, as well. Oh, and classic Runescape music too. I don't really have a playlist, but here's a couple of links from my recent likes on Youtube. You can put them on repeat by right clicking on the video.

*** Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Probably should've added more clarification...

Orchestral or lyrical is fine!

*** Just to add to that, high quality versions of the Witcher 3 soundtrack are available for free in the [[https://i.imgur.com/gHaKQzW.png][game files]] if you've bought the game.

** Depends on the scene and if I have to get myself "in the mood".

If I have to write action scenes I like listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUPGa15Oto][metal]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q5Qowx99Zs][metal link 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-2yuGgp_U8][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ls_ydHstU][link4]]), some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB8Ci7X5HUU&has_verified=1][electronic music genres]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJcshA4J82I][link2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khchqRIPN4U][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTicwhTatGY][link4]]) or some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gJ3HzBbdxI][aggressive rap]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Ex-ubaU6A][link 2]]).

For love scenes I have a few go to tracks that I find to just fit. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjvNUNXhkU][link1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hUBBJgPf5A][link2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NmKp5A8i3M][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoLMGSBGYc][link4]])

And for scenes where magical effects play a big role, I also have a few songs. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJmiyFD6PM][Song1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fnPwj1AMpo][Song2]] , [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4Yvbm6Tw4][Song3]].

For the other stuff I mostly don't need to zone me into my writing, but love, action and the mystical is hard to get a good mindset for sometimes.

** Nice to know I'm not the only one who prefers music of the orchestral kind when I write. Lyrics will mess up my writing, so I definitely enjoy movie soundtracks.

** I usually only listen to music before writing, not during, but I'll just listen to whatever I feel like really, I'm not really one for mood music. So usually just a Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits or Tom Petty album, maybe with a Bob Dylan song thrown in. (yes username checks out lol)
