I've read several creature Harry fics lately, and he's been a Neko, a Siren, and an Elder dragon. Most creature fics are veela, werewolf, or vampire harry. Any recommendations of new different creatures would be accepted. Secondly, Ron bashing is common is the fandom, so when I find an occasional fic with a loyal ron, it's a nice change. I wanna step it up a notch, anyone knows fics where Harry and Ron are an unstoppable duo, or a powerful pair of warriors?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]], pretty much exactly fits your second request.

  Summary: Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

*** That's a pretty amusing one. Like an old buddy action movie or something.

** For uncommon creature Harry, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]. (I won't give away the creature, as it's part of the reveal.)

** I know I've recommended this basilisk!Harry fic before, but I really loved it

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4385420/1/Serpens-Armarum][Serpens Armarum]]

I can't remember what his relationship to Ron is though, but seeing as it's a manipulative!Dumbledore, I'm guessing it's not looking good.
