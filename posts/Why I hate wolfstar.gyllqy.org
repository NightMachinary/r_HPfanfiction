** I know there's a lot of fic that portrays their relationship as fairly fluffy and sweet, but they're two pretty complex and damaged characters who dealt with a lot in their lives. Remus is a werewolf, Sirius was a teenage runaway, they both got drafted into a war straight out of school, and at age 21, they each thought it was possible that the other might be a traitor. They were separated for 12 years, during which Remus still thought Sirius was guilty, and then when they finally were reunited, Sirius was cooped up in his parents' house going nuts - and then he died a year later. Even if you view their relationship as romantic, it's hard to judge Remus too harshly for trying to make the best of things afterwards. It doesn't paint Remus and Tonks' relationship in a very healthy light, but honestly, I don't know that it seems all that healthy in canon either. Good people don't always make good choices, and in fiction, at least, that tends to make them more interesting.

** I think Sirius/Remus make the most sense as a slash couple, but you are missing a few points. Sirius was locked up when they were all, what, 21? So really, Remus had plenty of time to move on to Tonks, since he hadn't had any meaningful interaction with Sirius for a decade. Also, Snape didn't love Lily. It's impossible that someone could put out a hit on a woman's husband and toddler and have anything other than a disturbed and dark obsession. I can't see even Voldemort being that creepy.

** Remus wasn't exactly moving on, as in actively pursuing romance right after Sirius died. Tonks clearly pressured him into a relationship. She pounced on him when he was at his weakest, mourning Dumbledore, when he lacked the strength to keep saying no to her. I can totally see that as the sort of abusive relationship an emotionally broken man would be susceptible to.

** Does he move on or does he get bullied/coerced into dating Tonks? There's nothing in the story that makes me think he's thrilled with the relationship and the fact that he wants to run away when he knows she's pregnant makes me think he never wanted to be there in the first place
