I've got two ideas right now:

- Cosmetologist: Eternal Glory Edition
- Rise of Lav-Lav, Dragonslayer Extraordinaire

but I'm sure there's better ones out there

** I'd go with the LavLav one.

I have no good ideas for another title, but a good description could be

#+begin_quote
  Professor Trelawny always said that the Inner Eye works in mysterious ways. Therefore Lavender doesn't question what she sees but already begins to wonder which dress she should be wearing when she is commendated for winning the Triwizard Tournament.

** 17's the age limit, they said.

Brown by name, brawn by nature.

Lavender gets picked.

A flower blooms.

A flower blooms in adversity.

From make-up to magic cup.

That's all I've got.

**** It would be hilarious if Harry still has his "saving people thing" and tries to coach Lavender, somehow ending up as her Yule Ball date along the way (after watching her fail spectacularly at dodging exercises, Hermione jokingly suggests that he should try teaching her how to dance for footwork and things go their natural way from there on).

Hardcore fan Harry (complete with scarf, No1 glove and Team Lavender T-shirt/hoody) would be another fun way to add even more comedy to that story.

***** that... was actually the plan... I mean Hermione thinks Harry is tryina bag Lav-Lav, so she doesnt help, Harry basically helps Lavender teach herself Illusion magic by telling her to think of it as 'giving reality a makeover,' goes to the ball with her, then he introduces her to M.C. Escher for the second task, ect...

****** Imagine the name piece coming out of the Goblet, Dumbledore starts reading "Harry..." and turns the snipped around only to stare at it for like five minutes and everyone is wondering what the hell is going on. Ron already has his accusing stare directed at Harry when Dumbledore quietly reads "Lavender Brown" before reaching into his golden counter (from the movies) and pulls out a shot of Firewhiskey while everyone is like "what did he say?"

Also, please don't turn that into outright Hermione bashing. It would be a lot more fun to have her torn between "protective big sister" who wants the best for Harry, therefore thinking that he could do better than the girl she has not had the best interactions with and supporting Harry in his half pathetic, half adorable attempts at wooing her. Maybe throw in some reconciliation prior to the Yule Ball where Hermione comes to Lav begging for help and Lav is like "you need to slay another dragon? Because that's boring and I was hoping to tame the next one I see." and Hermione only replies "I need help taming my hair".

******* Oh, no, it's just Harry feeling responsible for Lavender's entry ("In all honesty this was probably a plot against me gone wrong, so...") and helping her, Hermione thinking its some misguided attempt to woo Lavender and as such specifically not helping, Lavender being confused and scared, and Dumbledore trying to keep the tasks as un-deadly as he can.

And then it becomes Hermione and Harry staring in horrified awe as Lavender /destroys/ the competition.

******** Is she not helping because she's jealous or because she thinks that Harry is ridiculous about it (honestly, just ask her out, no need for that "save people" spiel)?

Because I feel that the second one would fit far better into a comedic narrative. Hermione constantly egging Harry to just go for it while he is like "I'm just trying to be nice here".

********** I'm glad to help. The overall premise can be the foundation of so many hilarious situations, from Hermione walking in on Harry and Lav snogging, Lav dreading a lecture only for Hermione to hug Harry and say "told you so" up to Hermione writing a mission log (Day 43, Mission accomplished: Harry finally got his head out of his arse, found him snogging Lavender in the common room. Unrelated note, where do I find another parselmouth? The sounds Lav made make me think that I'm missing out on something really good.)
