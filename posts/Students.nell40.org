So I wanted to know if you guys think theirs 40 students every hogwarts year Since their was 40 students in Harry's year.

Granted we don't see the other students but it could be a stretch at least to meü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


** I think Harry's year was one of the smallest in recent history. I'm about as bad as JKR when it comes to my numbers and population, so I avoid hard numbers when I can (but better with my calendar).

So Harry's class starting with 40 and ending with quite a few less (normal is to lose a few, so would have happened to a lesser degree anyway) may have been followed by a similarly small class, but then it's possible the numbers climbed. These would have been the children conceived and born during the 1st Blood War, when potential parents were either leery to do so or killed. Also, I believe that muggleborns were sought out and killed as well, further reducing the numbers. The class starting in 1993 should have been larger, although I couldn't say by how much, and I would expect some sort of baby boom effect to increase class size through the 90s. There should be some sort of dip around 2008 as well.

Going way back and considering the size of the castle, I honestly believe incoming classes were much larger at times, but I couldn't guess exactly how big. Considering the school is close to 1000 years old, there will be a lot of ups and downs due to war, disease, politics, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if there had been classes with less than 40 at some point in the distant past.

Also, I think the Marauders era classes were larger, but not huge; maybe 60-70 kids? At least that's my head canon.

*** Specifically for the Marauders, I think it's very likely that there were more than 4 boys in Gryffindor, they just had an extra dorm.

** Harry was born about 10 years into the first war with LV, so his year should be quite small - possibly the smallest of all during the time he's at Hogwarts.

His parents were born approximately 15 years after Grindelwald was defeated, and 10 years before the first war against LV officially started.

In Snape's memory, Harry counts (I think) around 150 students taking their OWLs. Given that at that point the war had been going on for 5-6 years, I would add a few more who are getting homeschooled, who transferred to another school or who had died already.

So we have 150-200 children per year being born in the 60ies, followed by a sharp decline during the 70ies down to the 40 children born for the 1979/1980 year.

After Harry defeated LV, the birth rate should rise again, though not as fast because quite a lot of people died during the war.

** I think Harry's year is likely one of the smallest in recent times, IIRC, I think it was the fourth year sorting (?) that was noted as taking a long time because there were so many more students. This would make sense as a couple years after the war a lot of people would relax enough that a baby boom would likely happen.

Still, I don't think the Hogwarts population was ever that big, I doubt, in recent centuries anyway, that there'd be more than 20 students per house, per year (or around 560 students total).

** It's clear that there were more pupils in the past, just from the unused classrooms. What isn't clear is the reason.

Harry's year being especially small because of the war happening when they were conceived doesn't hold water - if we apply data from real world British demographics during WW2 their numbers would vary from the norm by about 2%, and whether that's 2% up or 2% down depends on exactly when you look. If you apply data from German demographics (if you want a culturally similar nation more devastated by the war) then you're looking at a drop of around 5%. There were 40 in Harry's year, so that being 5% down implies 42 in a normal year - but really, 2 in 40 is indistinguishable from random variation.

I have three theories.

The first is that wizard-kind is slowly dying out. Either the world is becoming less magical, or they are becoming less fertile perhaps because of endogamy over the centuries.

Second, there have always been 40-ish in a year, but Hogwarts used to have more years. It is solely a secondary school by the time of the books, but perhaps it used to also offer primary education.

Third, competition from other schools has reduced Hogwarts numbers.

*** I think the Magical world would have been hit harder by the war, because the community is smaller, the nature of war is very sudden and targeted (British citizens in the war were relatively safe at home, compared to existing with the hundreds of death eaters who could pop by with no warning and kill you in a few minutes).

Also, magical people seem to largely have the child rearing habits of wealthy professionals, I think the second most children in a family is the 3 Black sisters (also the Dumbledores), everyone else is either an only child, part of a pair, or a Weasley. I'm sure people like Dean and Seamus have more siblings but I can't use them for statistics if I'm never told of them.

** So from what we are shown (not told), I'd say yes. On average, give or take. (The out-of-book explanation is that Rowling simply failed to mention more names, also in Harry's year, she acknowledged this.)

For FF, however, I like to bump up the numbers to ~90 per year, which just about fits without adding teachers, and makes Hogwarts a bit more reasonably matching with what we are told (size of rooms, seats for quidditch, total population etc.)

** I like to headcanon Percy's year as being quite small, too, but that's mostly because we only have four named students and I hate making up names. Then it follows that the ones in between are also small, but I think it climbs after Ginny's year (she was a few months old at the end of the first war, and is the youngest in her year.).
