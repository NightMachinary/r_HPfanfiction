SIs don't seem to be as popular in the HP fandom as some others like Naruto, but it's one of my favorite genres. I recently found a pretty new SI fic that I really enjoyed but it doesn't have that many reviews or follows yet so I figured I would recommend it here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]

If you like SIs I would definitely recommend checking it out. If you don't then it may not be for you as it doesn't really do anything that would attract people who don't like other SIs, but give it a shot if you are curious.

Premise is pretty standard for an SI, woman from our world falls into a magic mirror, and then is transported to the HP universe as an 11 year old and goes to Hogwarts where she is sorted into Hufflepuff. She thus far hasn't interacted with Harry or Ron, but has had some effect on some major events and is friends with Hermione and Neville, so that's a bit different than where the SI becomes besties with Harry. Story mostly focuses on her and canon characters who were named in the books but didn't really have any screen time, plus Hermione and Neville.

In general I've found the plot really interesting so far and the writing pretty good.

** Word of warning, OP linked the most recent chapter rather than chapter 1. I read it and kept expecting a scene break with the si explaining what happened and some history, until I got to the end and noticed I just read chapter 17.

** Thank you for recommending my story! I just wrote three more pages this morning. It's fun to write.

I enjoy reading SI's too. Have you read the Perks of Survival? I thought that one was a lot of fun.

You're right though that Naruto seems to have more SIs for some reason.

*** I have not read that yet. I will check it out, thanks.

I think with Naruto it's because Dreaming of Sunshine became so popular (depending on what you sort by, it's the second or third most popular Naruto fic on ffn) that it inspired a lot of people to write their own.

In HP there aren't any SIs anywhere near that popular.

As to why DoS was able to become that popular when no HP fic has, that I'm not sure of. I suspect it partially has to do with timing and consistency. DoS started when Naruto was still ongoing, but most of the way through, probably at it's peak popularity. And has been consistently updated for 7 years.

I think the only place it exists is the space battles forums: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

Not the best format to read fics, but I like the community.

*** It stands for self insert.

It's when someone from our world, usually someone who is familiar with the source material, is either reincarnated or transported into a fictional world and then lives out their life there. Often the character is supposed to be, or at least be loosely based on the author. However it can be a completely original character too and the fic will still often be called an SI since the premise is similar, but could be called an OC Insert instead.

Sometimes the insert is reincarnated as a canon character, but usually they are a new character not present in canon.

** I like oc's an reincarnations fics. SI's always have a need to justify their behaviour, even to readers. Brcause it's, well, a self insert, and nobody would admit to being a bad person. So SI's aren't really SI's; But, I call them that anyway.

*** I have no idea if the main character in this fic is supposed to be the author or not. Even when it's an OC not based on the author a lot of the times fics call themselves an SI for simplicity sake. I mean there's not much difference premise wise between an author or an OC being reincarnated in a fictional world.
