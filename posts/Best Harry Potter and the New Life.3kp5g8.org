Which are the best Harry Potter and the new life continuation? Hopefully with some new chapters. I don't mind changes such as pairing or harem as long as it's another universe Harry going back to the past interacting with his family.

Anybody have any recommendations? Basically rewrites of Silver Aegis story! I've only found one by freckle force but it only had two or three new chapters :(


** Such a thing isn't possible. It is HPFanfic Law that all Harry Potter and the New Life re-writes must either be abandoned before actually reaching the point the original fic (while not changing anything at all, never really understood how that works) or they must be utterly batshit insane.

Like, the only way anyone's allowed to do a rewrite is after filling in a form:

By adopting this fic you agree to do one (or both) of the following:

- Make no actual changes to the story at all and abandon it after 3 chapters.

- Insert a single really stupid element. Like, say, a Godchild twin for Harry.

*** Surely there had to be one! I read something about one with Harry/Fleur pairing and another one where Harry had twin sisters and one of them was paired up with Hermione haha...

I just want to read anything, doesn't matter if abandoned :/ although anything that has been updated at least this year would be great!

**** For the life of me I can't find the original Harry Potter and The New Life by SilverAegis.. I did read a couple of suggestions listed below so it got me curious about the original one. Do you perhaps have a link to it?

**** I wouldn't recommend any of them. The last couple of them are better than the first few. I still don't understand what a shadow mage is but I'm sure that super duper special 10 year old heir to all 4 founders Harry Sue does though.

*Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru:* Similar premise to the New Life one, much fucking weirder. Even in just the first few chapters this story suffers from special snowflake syndrome so hard it's not even funny. Harry is reincarnated into his 10 year old body for unexplained reasons. When they go to get wands before they head off to Hoggywards Harry is so weird that none of the wands fit him so he gets a super special wand that was left with Ollivander's family when an exiled Asgardian (who happens to be a smoking hot woman) died. When he uses magic with it, he turns into a girl (who happens to be hot) and on top of this, he is apparently the fucking son of Loki or some shit like that and that's never really explained. oh, and all those 10 year old's he's surrounded with? He can't stop fucking thinking about how he fucked all of them when they were older. Stay the fuck away from this one. It's not only unfinished, but it's just /bad/.

*Harry Potter and the New Life:* Instead of a rant, here's an excerpt from the first chapter.

#+begin_quote
  "Don't worry they are my family too. I am a true earthling or the member of the very first human race. We have more powers then you can even comprehend. We expanded our civilization across the universe. The stronger people amongst us could move from one planet to another in an instant. They could destroy galaxies at their whims. A long time ago before I was born, a deadly war broke out because the people got greedy because of their powers. Our Emperor stopped the war. Barring his allies and family members he took everyone's powers; thus creating the modern day human beings. The theory of evolution is just a hoax created by us to hide our existence. I am the Emperor's youngest son. Recently my own powers were increasing at a rapid rate. Fearing that I may not be able to control myself, I split my essence into two equal parts."
#+end_quote

Well.. Okay fine. I lied about the rant. Here it comes. Siriusly? Someone took this shit seriously? This ain't a crack fic so someone out there must've. I skipped around a bit to find some of the better highlights: Harry is the heir to Gryffindor and Slytherin, he's a superspecial shadow mage (whatever the fuck that means) and the Sorting Hat announces to the entire school that he's super duper powerful. (on a side note, fuck the boring ass sorting hat. The only good sorting hat I've seen is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] where the thing spends it's time insulting everything that moves)

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived:* I only read the first few chapters since it didn't really catch my attention. This one's average for what seems to be a fixit fic. It's proofread and has good grammer. The first part follows the original pretty much exactly.

*Harry Potter and the New Lives:* I don't have the force of will necessary to slog through all of this. Again, what the everloving fuck is a shadow mage? On the bright side, the Hat is a sarcastic asshole. As I mentioned earlier, I love that. Too bad we have Harry Sue as the main character instead of it.

*New Lives and New Battles:* It's the same shit as all the others for the first few chapters. I'm sloggin through another variation of this. I'm sure if you squint it's an okay story.

***** Thanks for the post. I'm pretty sure I read Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived and found it /okay/. I started reading one of these last night, and Sirius had a Japanese wife so I figured that was a good enough reason to stop.

It's basically the same premise as the ones that that guy linked, but actually good instead of complete shite.
