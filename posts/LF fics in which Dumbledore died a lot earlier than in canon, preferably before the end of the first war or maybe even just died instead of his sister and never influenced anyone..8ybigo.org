Everything is welcome.

Thank you.

Edit: I'm very curious, if there is anything. Dumbledore seems to be in every fanfic. He is everywhere, all time travels, all AUs, even the fics that do not play at Hogwarts, the only ones without him are those in which he is canonically already dead and he usually gets mentioned even in those.


** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) somewhat fits your request. Dumbledore isn't dead, but Salazar Slytherin is the ruler of Wizarding Britain so Dumbledore isn't in the picture. The Order of the Phoenix is referenced on occasion as a band of notorious outlaws, but Dumbledore is very much in the background as of this point in the story. Additionally, the writing is fantastic, and the world building is original and interesting. It's a WIP, and I've reread it several times because it's so enjoyable.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** In The Unwinding Golden Thread, linkffn(11261838), Dumbledore isn't really part of the story and he dies off-screen before the war with Grindelwald is over.

** I don't think I've ever read a fic where this happened. I don't even know what such a world would even look like. I guess o have read a few fics where he gets sidelined though pretty early so I guess that is similar

** linkffn(5150093) fits the request pretty well. Dumbledore gets captured by Grindlewald during their duel (?) and then dies very soon after. The world is massively AU compared to canon, with Grindlewald conquering a lot of the world and most of the characters we know ending up in his army. I'm doing a fairly crap job explaining it but give it a go if that sounds interesting. It's pretty gripping stuff. Lots of action Edit: The story is 'The Skitterleap' by enembee

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/][The World as We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Dumbledore was dead in the other dimension, but canon Harry still decided to pick a fight with the local Voldemort, under lousy operational security. Things went well for a while until Voldemort made a key breakthrough and royally fucked them over.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
