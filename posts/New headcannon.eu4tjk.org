"Harry, I invented something! This hat will help you defeat Voldemort!"

"Thanks Hermione!"

*Some time later*

"Die Potter die! Muahahaha!"

"I don't think so Voldemort!"

/Reaches up to hat/

/Presses button/

/A flap in the front of the hat opens, revealing a metal object/

/Voldemort gets shredded by the recoil-less infinite ammo miniature minigun hidden in the hat/


** In this Verse Hermione aka Penny and her trusty familiar Crookshanks aka Brain. GoGo Gadget Head-cannon!

*** In the early 20th century giving people nicknames that rhymed with their name was a fad. Hence Dick as a nickname for Richard: Richard shortens to Rick which rhymes with Rick. William shortens to Willie or Will which becomes Billy or Bill.

Hermione becomes fanon name Mione' which half rhymes with Penny. It's actually plausible for this to happen.

Also instead of Crookshanks have Sirius as Brain. It would be easy to make a sarcastic comment about him being the brains of the outfit. The name sticks and he is Brain the dog.

Gadget Harry could be him taking enchanted items to an extreme. He looses a hand as well in the GoF resurrection scene as Pettigrew is feeling really petty. Harry doesn't want a silver hand like Pettigrew so he creates a better enchanted version. He gets more war torn and gets more parts replaced. Like a not shitty version of Moody. Seriously they can make teacups dance but he's stuck with a crappy peg leg? Makes no damn sense whatsoever.

Anyone is more than free to take this and run with it. I couldn't do it justice and have time to write it with everything else I'm currently handling.

Hope it inspires someone ðŸ˜„
