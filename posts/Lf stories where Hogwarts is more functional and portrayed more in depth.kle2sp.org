Like fics where there is more than like 10 staff for all the kids, there is maybe a school counselor, there are more measures in place to make Hogwarts a better school, maybe more in depth about rules. Like honestly in canon, Hogwarts sounds like a creepy place that only the fanatics would send their kids to, and only because of the prestige, not for the education, I mean, Hogwarts doesn't seem to provide a good education, or a good environment, or even normal government-abiding rules, even with magic!


** I don't think we in the UK actually have School Counselors - unless you mean in a therapy sense, and those are pretty rare. I've certainly no memory of them, and wikipedia seems to say that our equivalent are the Heads of Year.

Ah, okay. Wikipedia is correct, then. Huh. Guess it's either been too long for me to remember or I've repressed the memory like I did with most things from my secondary school years. :D

Indeed. A sad truth of it, really. No matter how much 'confidentiality' school services try to have, everyone always knows who went to the nurse/councillor, don't they?

Good that your school has one, though. It's started to become a little more prevalent, but they're still pretty rare, and most of them are like nurses and take care of a whole area of schools.

********** Stigma certainly is a bitch. Luckily for my area, the local big city has a shitload of services available, so if young people are unwilling to go to their school services, there's always a charity or private/statutory organisation somewhere who'll take them, but even then access isn't always easy.

I almost wonder what a school shrink in Hogwarts would be like. With Harry Potter in their care, probably stressed and weary. :D

*** I don't think there tends to be someone with a dedicated title, but both my secondary school and sixth form had a "welfare team", who were normal teachers who had gone on courses, and you were encouraged to talk to them if you had any issues.

My sixth form also had a chapel (Catholic school), and you could talk to the priests as well if you preferred, though idk how relevant that is to Hogwarts.

**** Ayy, Small world. My Sixth Form was Catholic as well, though we didn't have any priests (that I know of - I'm only nominally Catholic) and due to being in the middle of a city and the corresponding space constraints, most of our on-site chapel actually housed parts of the art department (including a pretty snazzy dark room). :D

But that's cool that your schools had that. Probably better that they were the teachers you'd know and possibly get along with than strangers who only come in every so often on their 'rounds' of the school region - though even the trained teachers can sometimes struggle if they haven't also got the experience and confidence to go with that training.

It really isn't that common to have mental health teams like that, and only 70% (ish) of primary/secondary schools actually have any mental health professionals at all. So, yeah, it is getting better (70% is double what is was half a decade ago), but it's still not ideal.

***** I'm not even nominally Catholic! I only got in because my secular secondary was part of the same academy trust. I'm fairly certain we did get dedicated chapel rooms though, not that I ever went in them.

I think it depends on the person when it comes to speaking about things. Some people find it easier to talk to someone familiar, while others might find it more comforting to confide in someone they /don't/ otherwise see on a regular basis.

But yeah, I think it is also worth pointing out that I left Sixth Form in 2019, so my experiences are more in line with what you'd expect for Harry's kids, not canon era. Notwithstanding the fact that the wizarding world appears to lag several decades behind anyway.

****** Heh. The more devout members of my family would cringe at the very thought. Yeah, we had rooms as well as the chapel. A significant portion of the student body were non-Christian, so appropriate spaces were provided. The main chapel area was occasionally used for smaller House-only assemblies - which really was a terrible idea in my case, as I kept getting distracted by the artwork and trying to remember which bloody archangel was which. :D

Indeed. You're definitely right about it depending - like everything else in psychology, it's entirely relative to the individual. Same dynamic applies to public speaking, amusingly enough. :)

My sixth form days were about four or five years ago, I think (emphasis on 'I think'), so I'm not that far before you. I think we've actually had a thread or two about realistic boarding schooling and applying that to Hogwarts, come to think of it. Might be time for another soon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
