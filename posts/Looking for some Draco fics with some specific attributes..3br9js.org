I am just getting back into reading fanfiction and I am having trouble finding fics to suit my taste. I am really looking for Draco fics of him changing sides/helping the good side/figuring out his worldview is wrong. I am especially looking for well written fics that keep Draco's personality (if not making him a bit more badass) and are non-slash.

Anyone have some recommendations? I'm sure this has been asked before, but I scoured old submissions and didn't find anything to help me.

Thanks! üòÅ

A book 7 rewrite. Almost 100k words so far. Draco ends up at the campsite with the Trio while they're looking for the Horcruxes. But because of certain circumstances, Draco can only speak in Parseltongue. And there's a whole subplot involving Narcissa being pregnant with Voldemort's baby. It's a hard fic to summarize, but there's definitely a sort of theme of Draco "figuring out his worldview is wrong", like you requested.

** This one is worth a registration for... [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]].

Written from Hermione's perspective, I feel it keeps Draco very in-character and is basically exactly what you've asked for.

**** I can deal with that. I'm not opposed to slash, I just feels it changes Draco's personality. I will definitely give this a go! Thanks!
