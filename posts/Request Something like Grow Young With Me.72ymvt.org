So here's the thing, I tend to hate stories where a canon character is paired off with an oc, just because the oc feels like a self Insert/Mary Sue, so I tend to stay far away from those whenever I see the main pairing being canon character/oc.

But this story, I loved the oc. I've had more then one person recommend this story, more then once and I just never bothered to read it until now.

And suffice to say, I really enjoyed the story, a lot more then I thought I would. The canon characters were great, the ocs were great, I loved the love interest Abigail. Which again it's very difficult to get me to warm up to an oc, and it did take me a while for her, but after a while I ended up loving her character a lot.

So, apologizes for the long post but I was wondering if there were any other well written stories where a canon character is paired off with an oc?

I don't want the oc to feel like a self insert/Mary Sue type of character, I want the character to feel like a character that could actually be in the Harry Potter series, much like Abigail felt to me.

The story doesn't have to be the same/doesn't have to have the same plot or whatever, but I just want well written ocs, I want to give it a try some more. OC's that don't feel like a self insert/Mary Sue.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Any Era, anyone can be the main character.

No Crossovers, would rather not have Weasley or Dumbledore bashing.

Would rather the story be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Also: I really loved how the author dealt with Harry dealing with work and spending time with his kids, it felt very believable so it doesn't have to be like that, but just more adult issues like that would be preferred in all honesty.

And I'd rather the story be with the characters in either 7th year or as young adults/adults.

And as an extra it doesn't have to be with ocs, it can be canon characters paired with each other as long as it's believable enough and as I said I'd like to see the struggles between the characters being young adults/adults.


** This gets requested a lot so try searching previous posts.

Developed OCs are rare, but Daphne Greengrass is a canon OC featured in a ton of stories, mostly as an adult so you can look at some of the better ones of that lot. linkffn(Days to Come) is a good place to start.

Personally I'd recommend sticking to mostly canon characters, since that's where the most work and quality is. Annerb has a story called half awake and almost there which is a better romance and slice of life fic than GYWM in my opinion (though GYWM is the GOAT dad!Harry fic). linkao3(half awake and almost there)

Also google hgfan1111's fics for a ton of adult Harry/Ginny romances, most of which are excellent. You can find them as word docs now since they've been taken down.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

**** I haven't read it in a while so I'm not sure I can do it justice. Harry and Daphne meet at a ministry function after his split from Ginny. They develop a relationship, but it's not an instant teenage fling - more of an adult romance. There's a bit of a drama relating to Daphne's work as an Unspeakable and Harry's position in the Auror department. It's a good slice of life fic - a bit mellow if anything, and not mind-blowing but I'm not sure there are any H/D fics that are besides maybe Unatoned which is a different story entirely.

Sorry I couldn't remember more details. Just give it a shot - if you like it, the post-Hogwarts H/D category has a fair number of decent to good fics.

*** Thanks will check them out. I normally tend to stay away from Daphne Greengrass pairings just because the authors write her as being the ice princess/queen, which is annoying in my opinion. Does the author do that to her in the story or something more to her character?

**** Daphne Greengrass has no character/personality in canon. She is a blank slate for the author to draw on. In the better stories she's a complex character built on the very few things we know about her (Slytherin, likely pureblood, not a vocal member of Pansy / Draco's posse), but there's a lot of room to work with.

Like a lot of subgenres most Daphne fanfic is not very good. Ice Queen is a fanon creation - personally when I read one, I close the tab immediately except for the couple parodies of the concept that are out there.

***** Exactly, I agree with you. When I see the ice queen persona I end up closing the tab, because while it is a fanon creation it's one that I just don't care for personally. And unfortunately quite a few stories centered on Daphne has her as the ice queen.

** linkffn(3155057)

First one that came to mind. Harry goes back in time to kill Riddle as an infant. He has to stay in the past for 10 years and ends up getting involved in WWII and the war with Grindelwald. Anyway there is a bit of a romance with a OC character, the romance is not a huge factor in the story, but it is there and there's not much Mary Sue to her IMO.

It has an unfinished sequel that I assume is abandoned, by all accounts it is much worse than the first.

** I'd recommend:

Linkffn(James and Me by Northumbrian) - Next Gen fic featuring James Potter Jr. and an OC. Will help a lot if you've read The Strangers at Drakeshaugh, but it's not entirely necessary.

Linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss by Ecmm) - Harry/Piers Polkiss's sister. She's definitely not a Mary Sue.
