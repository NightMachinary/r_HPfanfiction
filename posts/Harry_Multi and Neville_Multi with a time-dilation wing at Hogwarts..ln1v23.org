:END:
I'm trying to remember the name of a fanfiction where fourteen girls allied each other in the background and decided to save Harry and Neville from being forced by others (Dumbledore mainly) to marry girls they have no interest in (It's said that they need seven wifes each for various reasons) and they decided to do so by renovating an old abandoned wing of Hogwarts and put some time-dilation wards around it. They later all spend a month each in time-dilation with their future husband (Harry and Neville spend 7 months in total) before spending a year and a half all together, including members of their families before leaving for the outside world again. I think in the real world, the time spent in the wing was equal to like a day and a half.

A few more details I can remember: Hermione is the main wife of Harry and Ginny the main wife of Neville (Ginny love Harry like a brother, had developped a crush on Neville and knew that she would be forced to marry Harry). In the year and a half spent in time-dilation, the Grangers are there as well and use the opportunity to have another child (they couldn't before mainly due to stress from their jobs and lack of time).

Also, all the wifes are pregnant and have children around the same time. (So that Dumbledore, Ministry etc couldn't annule their marriages.)

All said like that, it sound like a mess but I swear, it was a good fanfiction. x) I just don't remember the name and I can't even find it in my [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] favourites list because it only show a total of 500 (and I have nearly 700) so it was missed.

I would really appreciate if someone could give me the name or link to the fic. Thanks. :)

  Hermione begins to learn the truth after Harry is named a Tri-Wizard Champion. The solution is not what either extect. Mostly H/HR but it won't seem so. Some Ron and Dumbledore BASHING, but not much...
