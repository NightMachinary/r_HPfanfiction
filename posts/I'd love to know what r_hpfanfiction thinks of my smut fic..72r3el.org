** I think you could work on some of the spelling and punctuation. Unbreakable Vowel, for example, should be Unbreakable Vow. Otherwise, the fic wasn't personally to my tastes. It was somewhat cathartic to read at the beginning, but degradation like that has never been something I was really into.

I also think that there should really have a dubcon warning, because though Ginny and Harry are married, there are still some non-consensual elements when she got his, ah, donation.

This section gets a little bit explicit, so I will 'advise caution' to the younger people of the subreddit:

As for the sex scenes... I'll be honest, I'm no expert on writing smut. I prefer to avoid that. Not to mention I don't really like the Harry/Ginny pairing. But please don't ever write 'her flower bloomed in front of him'. I'm not even sure what that's supposed to mean. Euphemisms like that always make me cringe--though it surely isn't as bad as that one fic I read that called a vagina a 'honey pot', and the clitoris 'a love bud'. Maybe there are people who don't mind that. But I personally find it very off-putting. If you mean vagina, just say it. Or pussy, cunt, whatever. So long as it's not something like 'blooming flower', which just reminds me of Cersei saying 'flowering' as an euphemism for menstruation.

Another thing is that I think the sex scenes could be a little more sensual. On this part I may be a little biased because of my dislike for the Harry/Ginny pairing, but the smut felt kind of mechanical to me.

Oh, and, this is not really related to the fic. I was just really uncomfortable with the use of 'faggot'. If it was intended as a derogatory comment towards homosexual individuals, maybe slap a warning in the tags.

P.S. Can we get this thread tagged NSFW?

#+begin_quote
  her flower bloomed in front of him
#+end_quote

Does anyone like to read that sort of wording? I wouldn't think so, but it's very common

** I am intrigued by the idea of 'unbreakable vowels' . . . but seriously, don't rely on spellcheck alone. There are a lot of similar errors in the first paragraphs. Words which aren't spelt wrong /per se/, but aren't the words you want.

I reviewed the first few pages so far, annotations on the side. I focused mostly on technical aspects, like grammar, punctuation, spelling - and the way you portray your characters, not on the plot itself.

** I'll have to give it a more thorough reading, but one thing that jumped out at me right away was the improper use of apostrophes. Please learn the difference between the possessive (Malfoy's broom) and the plural (generations of Malfoys). It's one of my pet peeves and really takes me out of the story.

** It's a decent idea, but there's some definite punctuation issues; commas are often lacking and far too often there's no punctuation at all within the dialogue tags.

Aslo.... "so mote it be"? HP magic has nothing to do with Wicca, or Neo-Paganism, you know.

*** "So mote it be" is a very common trope in hpfanfiction. I'm surprised you haven't come across it.

**** I have, but it always looks silly and out of place, trying to insert Wiccan undertones into a series that pretty blatantly has nothing to do with Wicca.
