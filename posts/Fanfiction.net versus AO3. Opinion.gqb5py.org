I've noticed that on here, when fics are recced, fanfiction.net is the way most people go. Yes, the bot probably affects this, but I'm genuinely curious as to how many people prefer it to AO3. I've rarely used it ff.net as I find it extremely hard to navigate and I dislike the formatting, but of course that's just my opinion, and I've found that the two sites are just about as popular as each other.

- which do you prefer, ff.net or ao3, and why?
- do you use both? which is easier to navigate?
- h o w do you use ff.net? I need some tips because obviously I've been doing it wrong


** I'd chose Ao3 both for reading and publishing.

1. It's a lot easier to find specific fics in Ao3 and have an idea what the fic is about from the tags, and excluding option for tags is great. Excessive tagging is maddening but I usually just skim if there's too many pairings, characters etc. I usually use "Entire Work" to see how many times a name is mentioned if I'm specifically looking to read a character. Also I like going through other people's bookmarks.
2. FF.net doesn't allow explicit content as well, so. I like to read romance with explicit content. Depending on how you see it, it might be a plus for FF.net.
3. Variety is definitely FF.net's strong point. FF.net seems to have more non-pairing stories. More action genre and generally longer fics when in Ao3 they are more focused on romance.
4. Sometimes I like to read the author's response to reviews and I can't do that on FF.net. I don't know if it's me but that's a plus for Ao3 as well.

As an author I think editing is a nightmare in FF.net and I absolutely hate it.

*** I really like this reply! This essentially summed up exactly why I enjoy ao3. Entire work is great, both for reading all at once and finding names, etc. I love the bookmarks feature as I've found so many great fics because of it!

I actually found publishing on ff.net easier, if only because it didn't try to mess up my formatting. Though... I've just realised that the only thing I published on ff.net was explicit, hah! I suppose it wasn't picked up on.

I actually went to ff.net and sorted through the pairings - a favourite ship of mine has around 3000 fics on ao3 and under 1000 there. That's...slightly a problem, because I really am about my romance, going to no-slashes as a break only sometimes.

**** Yeah I'm with you on genres. I skim through a lot even in romance stories and you couldn't pay me to read 100k action story on goblins or Lord-something stories which for some reason happens a lot in ff.net.

Another thing that might sound weird but I found people tend to leave different kinds of reviews on these sites. One story that I published in both sites and from FF.net I got things like "Keep up!" or "Interesting start" while from ao3 users it was quoting a sentence they liked or just plain "love it". I think it's because on FF.net people tend to post and read longer stories.

***** The review thing is real interesting! When I leave a review on ao3, especially on a new story it usually goes along the lines of, ‘I loved (this part of the chapter, this idea, etc) your writing was really nice, I look forward to reading more'. I've seen some absolutely terrible reviews such as ‘love it' and although yes, any review is awesome!! it's just... hmm. I'm curious about this now, I'm definitely gonna go and have a look at some of the reviews and see if there's a difference.

** *Fanfiction.net:*

- Much larger readership.

- Readership is more likely to leave reviews.

- Uploading chapters is a lot easier, as all formatting is preserved except for section breaks.

- Cannot link external websites in profiles or Author's Notes.

- Default page layout is far too wide.

*AO3:*

- Nicer page layout/presentation.

- Fic uploader is a real chore and in particular does very weird things to italics followed by punctuation marks, which requires extensive manual correction. Also turns line breaks into double line breaks which also requires manual correction. It takes about 20 mins to upload a chapter to AO3 and even then I continue to see errors in it when I happen to be browsing my story content.

- Tag spam makes it practically impossible to exclude non-Harry-centric fics because everyone tags Harry in their story regardless of whether he is the protagonist. When you combine this with the fact that non-Harry-centric fics vastly outnumber Harry-centric fics on AO3, it basically means that browsing for fics on AO3 is such a chore that it's unusable. Contrast FF.Net where if you set Character A = Harry, you're going to get 99% Harry-centric fics.

- Tag spam also makes it very difficult to exclude slash on AO3. A fic which is Harry/Ginny in chapter 1 before Harry leaves Ginny for Draco is going to be tagged both Harry/Ginny and Harry/Draco. So if you're browsing by the Harry/Ginny tag, the fic will still show up. This has got easier recently, since AO3 introduced the ability to exclude by tags. So you just have to save a search where you have added every slash pairing you can think of to the exclude field. Good luck finding gen fics on AO3 though.

*Conclusion:*

- FF.Net is far superior as an author.

- FF.Net is superior for browsing and finding fics.

- Once you have found a fic to read, AO3 is easier on the eyes to read it on.

*** This is probably the most helpful comment I've seen! I've published on both, and admittedly ff.net was much easier, and finding reviews was easier on ao3. Both sites have issues and both have merits.

I suppose I disagree with the browsing fics being easier on ff.net simply because I love my tags, despite the tag spam, but hopefully I'll be able to take away from this and understand what I've been missing so that I can properly experience ff.net. I still don't understand the filtering system there.

Thank you for laying out both sites for me, it really allows me to reflect on what both sites are good at and how they compare to each other.

Allow me to recommend the Docs to Markdown Google extension. Then instead of using the text editor, use the HTML editor to upload your fic. It gets everything exactly how I want it formatted in no time.

Fanfiction.net also tends to have a higher average quality for writing, I would say. A lot of smut and such on AO3 since their guidelines are practically nonexistent.

As an author, I prefer AO3. I don't have any trouble with formatting (I just copy paste from Word and it turns out fine) and I quickly got used to tagging. Some of my fandoms/ships are more active on AO3, and commenters are much kinder and easier to interact with. FFn is also THE WORST for editing a posted chapter, and they've deleted a fic of mine for....no reason. Their mods are insane.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Depends on how you browse. I prefer AO3 as reader, if I'm looking for stories on my own, because I guess I filter for tropes, not characters (like, you want Harry-centric stories, that's easier to find on ffn, but if I'm looking for something like Time Travel, AO3 is easier and more accurate to find. You can also Exclude a pairing or, like, ALL M/M, if you want). I have no idea how to find anything on FFn without this sub, lol

As I read on mobile, the FFn app is a GODSEND. The AO3 website is clean and well-formatted and all, but I can only stand it on my computer, or downloading it to an epub reader. On mobile I like to customize my fonts and sizes and night mode.

Guess we have super different points of view of both these sites :)

** Ao3 all day, man.

The search function is far more capable than FFnet's by miles. I can find tropes I'm looking for while leaving out things I don't want. I see so many people complaining about tags on Ao3, but I don't see how the barely functioning search function at FFnet holds a candle to Ao3's capabilities.

I have no issues uploading fics. The text editor is wonky, but since I convert everything to HTML beforehand I don't have any issues with it.

I also really like the organization capabilities - having actual series that people can easily follow rather than expecting a reader to go sort through an author's profile in order to find a sequel.

And there's also moral reasons. FFnet uses ads and tries to profit off of fanfiction that they didn't even write - they are breaking the oldest rule of fanfiction and it just feels wrong. Ao3 is funded by fans for fans and they're genuinely looking out for us.

I love the tagging on ao3, it's really brilliant, but not so much when writers neglect to tag, as often then I miss fics that are what I'm looking for, but just don't say it. (eg, slytherin harry. love sorting through this tag, but I've found so many untagged fics that it can be meaningless at times)

On the other hand, you get writers who tag every damn thing to the point where you're looking for something specific and they keep coming up despite not being relevant (eg, looking for a rare pair but a fic has tagged about 100 relationships. goddamnit...)

** I usually read on FFN, largely because I can't stand the tag spam on AO3. Anything I read on AO3 is usually a recommendation from somewhere else(like here).

I also like that I can browse just HP fanfics (without crossovers), or browse through specific crossovers(just HP/Avengers, just HP/Fate etc.).'

For tips try starting with a standard sort. Mine for example:

- Sort: Follows or Favorites
- Rating: All
- Language: English

Those three and nothing else to start.

From there I'll play with Length (>10k or >20k) to remove smaller one shots or brief abandoned fics. Or go big with >100k for longer fics.

Time Range is a great tool to separate active fics from inactive fics, so I'll sometimes add Time Range: 1 Month, 6 Months, and rarely 1 Week to include only fics updated/published in that period.

Since you typically read slash pick your Character A and Character B, but be sure to toggle the Pairing check box(top right of the filter window) to get those. Sometimes slash is indicated in author notes instead of character tags which require more browsing on your part to find.

If you're not looking for pairing but a certain character's involvement, choose them but don't toggle the Pairing box.

If that doesn't turn up what you want, you can also try browsing through HP communities under the Community tab. I don't read slash, but I've noticed several collections of Snarry, Drarry, etc in there.

edit: Also, if you find an author you like, then go to their profile and check out their favorites. Odds are good that you'll find something there that you like too :)

** Ao3 as a whole has in my opinion slightly higher quality stores. My only issue is they are highly pairing obsessed with most of them being Boy X Boy. While I have no problem with that as an actual relationship, reading about it doesn't really interest me. However, there are some real gems on ao3. I have heard a lot about the sorting system of ao3 but have never personally used it myself as I get most of my fic recommendations from Reddit. Fanfiction, on the other hand is what I use most frequently. Mainly, due to its awesome app and the fact that I am more used to it.

** AO3 over FFN any day.

I find it almost impossible to find fics by pairing on ffn. If I want Harmony fic, ideally I would choose [Harry P. Hermione G.]. But many authors don't mark pairings, so I have to sort through tons of fics that have Harry and Hermione as characters but are actually gen, Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron, Harry/anyone, Hermione/anyone.

While many here dislike tags, they also give you a general idea of a fic. More so, you can exclude things that you don't like, and while it won't exclude 100% of the fics with it, it would exclude most of them. You can also sort by straight/slash/femslash and exclude things like rape and underage.

I like the option to open the entire work on AO3. It's very useful when I want to reread some particular scene and don't remember what chapter it was, so I can just search the whole text. The comment section on ao3 is also much better and actually allows a discussion.

** I prefer FFN and find it easier to find the kind of fics I like. The overtagging on AO3 means that when I try to sort by a certain tag, I get a bunch of results that only use it as a minor element and aren't relevant to what I'm looking for. I also prefer FFN's system for favoriting fics. It makes it easier to find them again later especially if you are in multiple fandoms.

I have noticed that gen fics tend to be more popular on FFN and what shipping fics do get popular usually have some sort of plot besides the ship going on. AO3 gets more focused on shipping. As I usually want to read gen fics, that means FFN is better for me.

I will say that on the whole, some fandoms are more active on one than the other. I can't speak to Harry Potter as I haven't posted any fics, but I corsspost everything to both sites. There is definitely a trend by fandom where certain fics will be more popular on one site than the other.

But I digress, I only read off of ff.net personally. I find the interface of finding fics infinitely nicer than ao3. The layout, the usability, the style even is so much nicer and easier to me than ao3 to the point that ao3 is genuinely unusable to me.

If I find a fic is on ao3 exclusively I won't bother to read it unless it's of such interest to me that it likely will slot into my top 10 kinda list, and even then it's mood dependant.

This is all ofc just my opinion, and I may just be a weird outlier.

*** This is fascinating! I've been in many, many fandoms, and HP is a much newer one for me.

Honestly, I'm the completely opposite to you - this subreddit pains me because so much is recced from ff.net, and I can't handle it. Unless a fic is apparently absolutely amazing, or I'm looking for a rare pair, 9/10 times I'm going to ignore ff.net links.

I personally find that looking for fics on ff.net is extremely difficult - there aren't many tags, except for word count (which is very general, mind you), the story bio is often cut off, and even the slash confuses me.

When I first found ao3 I was extremely confused, and it was a mess. Using it years later, some features still confuse me, but finding fics is extremely easy. Word count: between __ or __. Choose specific ships to be included, exclude ones you can't stand. Looking for angst? there's a tag! looking for pwp? well uh, there's a tag! All you really need to know is how to work with the tags and it becomes super easy to navigate, though I'm sure it sounds more complicated than it actually is.

Enjoy your time reading on ff.net, and I'll enjoy mine on ao3! Maybe one day we can breach the waters and explore unknown territory.

As for AO3, while there are those who overtag, and those who undertag. I generally can find what I want there a lot faster. The one problem is those who write Lover&Lover and Friend/Friend. Instead of Lover/Lover and Friend&Friend. That can get rather annoying.

As for navigationability, I don't consider one better than the other. AO3 has the series feature to tag fics together which is nice. Especially when you're looking trough 50+ fics to find the first one in the series you want but found the 5th fic for.

For example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][this]] fic is a Harry/Daphne fic. But as you see, it is only mentioned in the description. The fic settings only mention Harry and Daphne as characters, not as a pairing. Pairing would look like this: [Harry P., Daphne G.]

So if you look for Harry/Daphne with the pairing checkbox selected that fic won't show up...

Generally, I don't take chances on fics on ffn while the tag system will make me take a chance on unfinished fics on ao3. On ffn, I always read the recommendations, those being usually older fics, so I only ever read complete fics on ffn.

I prefer fanfiction.net as it has an app and things can be downloaded easily on it and read from there. (However I find all my fics by googling what I want and then finding the user on ff.net so that is annoying)

AO3 is very annoying to me as you enjoyment is based on what application you dowload fics to. I've had wonderful experiences and awful ones. [If you now a good app to download fics on to Samsung let me know]

However if you aren't looking to download and are reading them straight off the website, fanfiction.net is better as it is much more customizable (change font and size, contrast, and width) whereas on AO3 you are stuck with the terrible default settings unless you externally invert the colors or change font size.

** AO3 is the better website, having been built by people sick of the shittiness of ffnet, and has a less toxic and hostile community for the same reason, but ffnet has more of the writers whose work I enjoy (including some that have passed away and thus will obviously not be crossposting their work).

Also, it may be partly due to sampling bias given how I look for new fics to read, but the overall character/vibe/feel of fics is different between the two sites, with ffnet having more standard stories and less of the deeply weird. There are a lot more niche interest and/or fetish fics on AO3.

EDIT: My tip for using ffnet is to start from stories you like and see what else their author has written and what fics/authors they've Favorited. Doing that (and looking at the Favorites lists of people that enjoy my work) continues to lead me to interesting/enjoyable fics, though that's slowed down in recent years as I seem to have mostly read the pre-existing stuff that fits my tastes and so now am largely watching for new content.

** For me, I used to use ffnet exclusively, but then I started moving more and more to ao3 and now I'm always there and only use ffnet for older stories that are still updating.

I might be wrong, but I feel like ao3 has an older average audience, which is good because I think it contributes to ao3 averaging a better quality of fics as well. It also has a higher quantity of slash fics, for which YMMW.

Pros of ao3 far outweight the cons for me, but that might not be the case for everyone. I really like the tagging system, as it makes it much easier to find fics of a certain trope, and especially when they added the "exclude" function, makes it much easier to avoid fics I wouldn't want to read. The only issue with the tagging is that there isn't a "main character" tag, so if I want to read fics in a fandom with a certain main character, and don't care about the pairing, there's no way to do that. The other issue (which I don't find problematic as I don't have those types of ships) is if you want to read a fic about a popular side pairing in a fandom. (I guess a good example would be Ron/Hermione maybe? You want to read a fic about them, but there are /so/ many fics with Harry and his pairing as central to the fic, with them being just the side pairing, so you can't find the fics you want in the flood of all the others). While on ffnet if you search for a certain pairing, the fics you find will definitely be about that pairing, so that's one plus for that at least.

One other thing that /super/ annoys me about ffnet are the ads. I usually read fanfiction on my phone, so I don't have an adblocker, and they've recently started putting ads smack dab in the middle of the text which is insane.

*** This is an awesome comment, thank you! I've exclusively used ao3, so it's always nice to see the opinion of someone who has seen both sides.

I find that the quality of fics on ao3 is very high, especially compared to when I was reading on wattpad. ... yeah. I can't say much for ff.net because I've only read a few things there, but I'll definitely start considering the general fic quality because I'm curious.

The tagging system is great, I was just saying this is another comment. I love specific tropes, and the tags allow me to search for these purely dependent on what I'm wanting that day. Although some writers neglect tagging, I can still almost always find great content for what is tagged correctly.

I completely agree with the pairing filtering. In other fandoms I enjoy some rare pairs, and it becomes extremely difficult to find these among other fics, as often they're just a side ship and not the focus, meaning that I end up with thousands of fics that I'm not looking for. The exclude feature does help this, but often the fics I want still do have tags for popular ships, and then I lose anything there. Often I end up looking through masterlists/suggestions instead.

The ads is... odd, honestly. With competition between the two sites, I would've thought they'd try to keep the readers as happy as possible, and ads certainly won't do that. Does anyone know if the organisers are payed, or are they volunteers like on ao3? Ao3 holds periods where they ask for donations (to support the website, not to pay them) and they usually exceed their goal before the deadline, so I'm surprised that ff.net doesn't resort to something similar and rid the ads.

** As a reader, FF.net has a larger choice of fics, however, the big problem is that the platform is seemingly completely unmoderated. Someone can troll, flood a comment section with hateful messages and the site administration will do nothing to stop it.

For Ao3, the layout is nicer, despite the sometimes overabundance of tags, it does help to make a better informed choice of what you are choosing to read. And I haven't yet seen too many trolls there.
