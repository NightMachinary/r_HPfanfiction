Okay, I had this idea and have no idea if anyone else has, but I can't get an actual chapter out of it.

At the age of 6, Harry Potter finds a Crumple-horned Snorkack. It ends up being his first friend. One the Dursley's aren't capable of seeing. By the time Hagrid comes along, Harry and the Snorkack are essentially Mage and Familiar.

Ideally this would turn into a Luna/Harry pairing, but I'm open to other ideas.

If this idea has been done, could someone drop a link?


** That's a really fun idea. If it hasn't been done then it definitely should be.

*** It might have been, but every attempt I make doesn't even get to one chapter.

I've also never found the idea elsewhere.
