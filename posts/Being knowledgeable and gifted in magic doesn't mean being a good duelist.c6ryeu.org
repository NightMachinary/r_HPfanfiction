When people ask why Grindelward, Dumbledore, and Voldemort were so powerful, the answer is usually because of (1) their prodigious skill in magic, (2) their extensive knowledge of magic, and (3) they were all exceptionally skilled duelists.

​

I would like to argue that (1) and (2) does not necessarily mean that (3) is a given. We all know that emotions and confidence can affect magic: Tonk's sadness changed her hair, Neville's nervousness and confidence issues affected his magic initially at Hogwarts.

​

*Performing complex magic in a controlled environment is a lot different than performing complex magic in a stressful and chaotic environment.* Just because a person has theoretical knowledge of complex magic as well as experience in casting such magic does not mean that they can perform the spell in every situation.

​

Good duelists should be capable of performing magic in an intense environment, have good reflexes, spatial awareness, be flexible and be continuously adapting to the changing environment of the duel. Things like experience in other duels, knowledge of different types of strategies, etc. would also be helpful. *Just being skilled and knowledgeable in magic is IMO not enough.*

​

Why is this important from a story point of view? *It allows knowledgeable characters to exists without having to explain why they aren't involve in current or past magical conflicts*. For instance, look at Nicolas Flamel. He's hundred of years old, and he's knowledgeable and skilled enough to create the Philosopher's Stone. With all his experience, skill, and knowledge he must be extremely powerful. However Fantastic Beasts 2 reveals that (a) its been a while since he had seen action and (b) he seems physically frail. He might be knowledgeable and skilled, but that doesn't automatically meant that he could out-duel a person like Grindelward.

​

This is also useful from a world-building point of view. There can now exist large groups of wizards who specialize or or knowledgeable in certain area of magic, but because they are not good duelists, they don't impact the plot. For example, there might be a Japanese wizard who knows more about Transfiguration than Dumbledore, but this Japanese wizard will never be able to defeat Dumbledore because Dumbledore is the better duelists.

​

There might be an individual who knows more about theoretical dark magic than any other living person on the planet, but they're not as dangerous because they aren't that good a duelist. Maybe their knowledge is more geared towards long rituals than quick curses that would have use in a duel. Maybe they don't have any experience in dueling before. Or maybe, they're just bad at casting magic in a stressful situation.

​

My headcanon is that all around the world, there exists different wizards and witches who are highly skilled and knowledgeable in different areas of magic (Transfiguration, Charms, Curses, Enchantments, etc.). However, most of them aren't good duelists and would have trouble fighting Aurors, let alone a person like Voldemort.

​

*In other words, it's possible that there exists a person with Dumbledore's level of skill and knowledge, but for multiple reasons, are not as powerful as Dumbledore because they are not a powerful duelist.*

​

Grindelward, Dumbledore, and Voldemort are special and historically important because they are skilled/knowledgeable, and are capable of applying that knowledge when dueling, which is a rare trait.

​

Anyways, this is just my headcanon. It's pretty disorganized but I'm hoping to see if you agree or disagree with my ideas!!


** I don't see how anyone could disagree. No way Hermione, Percy, or any of their classmates can out duel Harry. We also see Hermione struggle somewhat and make terrible decisions in combat. She got frazzled the moment she laid eyes on the Death Eaters in OOTP.

I'd like to add, though, that, regardless of the Harry you write, I'm not reading a story where he's losing duels to people he shouldn't be after like 4th year. And, depending on the way he loses/who he loses to in 2nd and 3rd, that might be a stretch. It's especially absurd when you have a prodigy/studier Harry lose to these people for the sake of drama.

And please stop having him regularly drop/lose his wand. He did that like 3 times in all of canon: CoS, when BCJ stole it, and when Dudley threw him against a wall.

** I agree with this /to an extent/. Certainly it holds for people like Hermione etc. But I think the higher you get up the scale of magical skill, the less it holds. For people at Voldemort and Dumbledore's level, stuff like reflexes etc. don't really matter anymore. Their duels are purely magical/mental, with very little physical to them at all.

Obligatory Newcomb quote, which explains this better than I can:

#+begin_quote
  Harry watched as Sirius and Snape walked a short distance away from each other. They stood apart, facing each other, unmoving for a time. Snape looked cool and impassive, whereas Sirius had an almost expectant, dangerous grin on his face.

  They bowed. Slightly. Harry thought Sirius's two-fingered salute at the end probably wasn't traditional.

  And then they were in motion. Snape drew his wand smoothly from his robes, dropping to a knee in the same action. Sirius had drawn from his holster impossibly fast, a jet of angry orange light passing over Snape's left shoulder.

  Snape flicked his wand and shot dark red spells, one after the other, at Sirius. They were aimed low, and Sirius jumped out of the way. The spells left a hissing, burning spot on the sand where they connected. Instead of pressing his advantage, Snape swept his wand in a tight circle, conjuring a rough-hewn block of stone that he ducked behind. He seemed to be predicting Sirius's movements as Sirius's counterstrike, a powerful-looking blast of white light, only made the stone block shudder slightly.

  "What does it remind you of?" asked Remus.

  Harry watched, entranced, as they traded spells. He'd never seen them duel like this. They weren't trying to kill each other, obviously, but it looked a near thing. The spells Harry recognized weren't exactly Stunners. He flinched back as a sickly yellow spell shot towards the bench, deflected by Sirius with a quick bit of wand-work. The spell impacted a shield that shimmered briefly before fading back into invisibility -- a shield that sprang into being directly above the line Dumbledore had drawn in the sand.

  "A gunfight," said Harry. And it was true. The quick, staccato blasts of light. The way they used cover. The ebb and flow of the battle, like an exchange of shots.

  Sirius charged. Roaring, he fired spell after spell at Snape, who was forced back. The tempo of the duel increased. The slashing, angry wand gestures. The way the lights of the spells were deflected, crackling against each other as the range decreased. The footwork, how Snape danced away from Sirius's aggressive strikes, turning them back, how Sirius charged ahead, each step pressing the other man.

  "Or a swordfight," said Harry.

  "Yes," said Remus. "That's what dueling looks like. That's what most real fighting looks like, too. When a pair of Aurors pin down a criminal and it becomes a pitched firefight, it usually looks something like this."

  Snape had turned the tide; Sirius's aggression had cost him. Snape sent a spell that was almost black right at the other man's head, and Sirius was forced to cast a thick, heavy Shield Charm. Even so, the impact sent him staggering back, and Snape pressed his advantage.

  Sirius dove to his right, snapping off a Bludgeoning Hex at just the right moment. Snape, who was mid-cast, could only twist to avoid it and it struck him in the ankle. He snarled, going to one knee, and slashed the air with his wand. Sirius, prone on the ground, rolled away and cried out as the spell tore through his shirt, his shoulder jerking with a crack that Harry could hear from fifty feet away.

  "That's enough!" called Remus, standing up. Sirius and Snape both got to their feet, their expressions unreadable. "I didn't mean for you two to get vicious, but I suppose it was an effective demonstration." He turned to Harry. "So, what did you think? Did that meet your expectations? Is that what you want to learn how to do?"

  "Well, yeah," said Harry, sensing he was walking into a trap but not able to see it.

  "Don't be so sure," said Remus with a faint trace of smugness. He coughed. Then again, louder. He looked over Harry's head in irritation. "Albus, the whole 'inscrutable wisdom' routine works a lot better when you pick up on the signals."

  "Ah, forgive me, Remus," said Dumbledore, folding his magazine neatly on the bench. "I was just reading the most fascinating article about the sixteen tertiary exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration..." he looked up. "Perhaps another time."

  Dumbledore stood and up and walked down the beach, stepping with care over the line he'd drawn. Sirius and Snape now stood loosely together, eying each other warily.

  "Gentlemen," said Dumbledore, bowing smoothly. Sirius and Snape exchanged a hooded glance, then faced Dumbledore and bowed back.

  Harry leaned forward in anticipation.

  They were quick, very quick. Sirius's silver spell was aimed high and left, at Dumbledore's shoulder, and Snape's violet jet of light was aimed low and right. Harry filed it away for future reference, something to tease his godfather about at a later date -- for all ways in which the two of them couldn't stand each other, apparently Sirius and Snape made a decent team.

  As the spells converged on him, Dumbledore flicked his wand almost casually, and the sand sprung up in front of him. The creature was shaped like a lion, or a bear -- something large and with four legs, anyway. The sand-creature leaped forward, its paws absorbing the spells as it threw itself, bodily, at the two duelists.

  Sirius tried diving out of the way, whereas Snape took a more direct approach, conjuring a blast of wind and directing it towards the oncoming sand lion. The creature burst apart, but the cloud of sand seemed to have a mind of its own, swirling angrily into a miniature tornado. Snape tried desperately to hold it off, fighting a losing battle as he directed wind against a storm of sand. Sirius, meanwhile, was taking advantage of the cover to take potshots at Dumbledore, who hadn't moved yet.

  Dumbledore casually stepped out of the way of one curse, sweeping his wand even as he moved and leaving a trail of fire in his wake, living, twisting flame that seemed to crystallize in place. Sirius's second spell hit the shield of flame, which pulsed with dark, angry light for a second, and then expelled the curse back the way it came, but faster, and -- judging from the way it made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand up as it passed -- with much more power.

  Sirius and Snape took cover behind a hastily conjured wall of steel as the spell literally exploded in front of them, sending them clattering to the sand in a messy heap.

  Dumbledore flicked his wand again.

  Sirius and Snape were back on their feet, hastily exchanging a few words, no doubt planning another attack, when the wave took them. One of the gentle, foot-high waves that had been lapping peacefully at the shore all morning spouted up to a ten-foot monstrosity with a frothing, scary-looking crest and rushed up the beach, crashing over the beleaguered duelists. Instead of washing away, the water remained, trapping them. Dumbledore took careful aim and waved his wand in a complicated motion. The water started collapsing in on itself, twisting, turning, contorting itself into thin lines.

  A few seconds later, Sirius and Snape were trussed up in ropes of living water, breathing hard and completely immobilized.

  The whole thing had taken less than thirty seconds, and Harry was pretty sure that had been for his benefit, that if Dumbledore had wanted to, he could have done it in three seconds. It was on another level altogether. Every move, calculated. Every defense, an attack at the same time. Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.

  "You see," said Remus, "you'll never learn to do that if you set out by learning how to fight. Aurors are specialists. You narrow your focus that much, and you eventually start limiting yourself in some pretty serious ways. Be a generalist, Harry. Dumbledore's a generalist. If you only learn about magic that helps you fight, you'll get good at it, no question. And faster, too. With the head start that you've got, if you start learning to duel, you could probably take any student at Hogwarts by the end of the year."

  Harry watched as Dumbledore dispelled the water-ropes, going over to the downed combatants, exchanging words with them, joking, laughing. He didn't look at all intimidating.

  "But," continued Remus, "if you learn about everything, if you cast a wide net, if you embrace magic as a whole, if you leave no stone unturned... things will be slow. By the end of the year, you might not even be noticeably stronger at all. But there will come a time when something will click. You'll understand something, see some kind of order in the chaos, some fundamental truth. It clicked for Dumbledore when he was a third year. It clicked for your mother when she was out of Hogwarts and engaged to James. And I firmly believe that if she were alive right now, she'd give Dumbledore a run for his money."

  Remus stood, and rested a hand on Harry's shoulder for a moment. "Be a generalist, Harry. It's the harder road, the longer road, but you have it in you. I've seen it. You put in the time, you make an honest effort, and you'll be an absolute nightmare on the battlefield. Trust me."

This is the very start of the fight and Sirius/Snape come out swinging with fast spells. Dumbledore doesn't dive out of the way OR use an obscure defensive spell, he 1. identifies the spells, 2. determines their speed and trajectory, 3. creates an animated transfiguration that targets the spells, all in what sounds like the blink of an eye. That isn't just theoretical knowledge of the spells, that's years of experience dealing with spells rushing at you (or some incredible natural talent) combined with the knowledge of those specific spells and how they behave.

Dumbledore's casual spell deflection and casting can't just be magical knowledge, his spells have wand movements and focusing that require time - no matter how fast he can think of new spells, he still needs to fit their casting and movement into the tempo of the battle and throughout the fight, HE's the one controlling that tempo.

*** I guess we're going to have to disagree on this. Magical dueling is a mental task. But this mental activity is affected by external and internal issues.

Take this hypothetical situation. There's an extremely talented wizard who grows up, goes to Hogwarts and learns everything he can about magic. Later on, he decides to make a career researching and writing about magic. Over the years his theoretical knowledge of magic approaches Dumbledore's. His skills in casting magic is also close to Dumbledore's level.

Now this wizard has never been in a duel before. He doesn't have any experience in using magic for offensive purposes against another person. Doesn't know about dueling strategies or anything like that. Even worse, he's bad in stressful or tense situation. In these situations he has problem casting magic quickly and correctly.

Now, do you really believe this individual can fight on the same level as Dumbledore?

The point of this post was to detangle the idea that magical mastery automatically leads to dueling mastery.

Being able to cast a difficult spell while alone in your room is one thing. Doing it in the middle of a noisy and chaotic battlefield, when you are stressful and panicking, and distracted by the fate of your friends is another thing.

A person who has Dumbledore's level of magical mastery does not necessarily have Dumbledore's experience nor his ability to function in high stress, chaotic environments.

  *be flexible and be continuously adapting to the changing environment of the duel.*
#+end_quote

This is the biggest skill a duelist can possess, at least in my headcanon. In the books, obviously we only get one "real" duel between two genius wizards, that being Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.

Both of them are continuously adapting based on the magic that the other is casting, and the magic they cast is less of the "jets of lights" variety and more elemental forces of nature. They're not moving around a lot or dodging, instead opting to redirect the other's spells. So it seems that when you reach that level of magical proficiency, then all the time you spent jogging around the lake as a teenager won't do you any good ;).

A lot of the duels I read that involve wizards who are not on DD or TMR's level have a lot of bolts of light flying, and usually involve the combatants dodging and rolling out of the way. Sometimes martial arts are involved. I don't really like it that much, but I understand why it's done--with this technique you can actually write longer battle or duel sequences with characters who are not as magically skilled as the cream of the crop.

I think realistically (as realistically as we can be) duels between unskilled wizards and witches would be really short. Each duelist would get maybe two or three spells off in total before one of them dies or becomes incapacitated. In an unskilled duel, neither participant would be skilled enough, fast enough, or knowledgeable enough to block or redirect every spell, so who ever got in the first lucky hit would win, assuming it was a spell that is able to kill or incapacitate. I think of it like old west gun fights. One or two shots and it's over.

As far as a battle, I think if a magical battle actually were fought with a large amount of wizards it would be chaos. In canon, the battle of Hogwarts seems to involve groups pairing off and fighting individually, but I envision larger scale battles as more chaotic. Spells, and the effects of spells (like smoke, splinters from exploding rocks or walls, great gusts of wind, rampaging animals...) would turn the battleground into a mess. People would be Apparating all over. Spells would be flying every which way. I think survival would be almost a coin toss for any wizard who enters a battle like that unless they are on DD or Voldemort's level of skill (possibly also Snape's or the Marauder's levels).

I think writing battles is probably best avoided, both because it seems /really/ hard to do well and I think wizards tactically wouldn't choose to do large scale battles either. Their skills are a lot better suited for espionage and one-on-one fighting.

In many cases the anwser is 'not well'.

He would then win the fight with any spell he chooses.

There are quite a selection of spells which will take someone out if they land even once (from the humble full body bind to the killing curse), all of them merely need to touch the target, or the target's clothing and can be fired off rapidly.

I suppose the gun might win if it's used from afar and the wizard isn't expecting it and he's not the sort of person to routinely wear enchanted clothing or keep a defensive spell active.\\
But that's not guns beating magic, it's just the advantage of a surprise attack.

*** I'm not really a fan of that logic because my headcanon was that there are more shields than protego and they are meant for different things. Wizards are more durable/heal faster than muggles. Would a stunning charm on a muggle have the same effect as on a wizard? I kinda doubt it. Also take expeliamous for instance. How wide can it be cast? Can it hit multiple targets and leave muggles with no choice but jump away. Wizards have the ability to cast arrests momentum. Could that be made into an enchantment to stop the kinetic energy of the bullets? Obviously it wouldn't be as effective against a wizard.
