I would love to read others fics where Harry (or maybe some other character) traveled through time a lot such as he is really skilled in magic.

I also loved the mysteries of the ancient city of Atlantis, the hidden library of Rome and those kind of things and I would like to see some more of this.


** One really long time loop - linkffn(a long journey home)

Several moderately lengthy time loops - linkffn(Harry Potter and the temporal beacon)

Many rather short time loops - linkffn(6966314)

These answer the first part of your request, but I don't know anything to answer the second part.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

**** You're welcome. Rorschach has a cetain style to all of his fics that makes them imperfect, but he's definitely been influential to other authors and posted a lot of unique ideas that others have built on. He's not an excellent writer but I feel he's a great storyteller if that makes sense.

** linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) is pretty great if you're looking for sheer awesomeness. It's only a couple of chapters but you won't regret reading it.

linkffn(Circular Reasoning) also gives off some of the same "feel" as Wastelands... like Harry is stumbling around with all these awesome powers but he's not completely sure what to do with them.

My first rec is going to be an original story (not a fanfic). /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]/ (W: 279,202; WiP) is a nicely written thing that suits most of your request, and reading which feels like playing an RPG for yourself.

There's also /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]]/ (W: 226,768; Abandoned) that fits the time-travelling part:

#+begin_quote
  a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] in which a desperate Harry tries aligning himself with Voldemort in order to gain political power, as much and quickly as possible. Warning for HP\TR slash and for a Voldemort that later into the story develops a teenage girl personality.

Oh, and I recommend /The Temporal Beacon/ as well.

**** Among the content that I would've recommended there isn't much more left that's both relevant to the titles mentioned in this thread and not one of those mentioned titles itself.

Still, for an HP fanfic try /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]]/ (W: 301,307; WiP). Here a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin][D&D universe character]] gets pulled into an HP one and has to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic][learn to adapt]] to the new world.

For an anime try /[[http://imgur.com/a/ODeIn][Log Horizon.^{1}]]/ The premise is that after the latest update of a popular MMORPG, some of its players find themselves inside the virtual reality. The MMORPG part isn't used just as a setting, and the producers do not often simply hand-wave things away: anything that would've mattered in an actual MMORPG, is represented in the anime as well.

There's also the more widely known film /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/][Edge of Tomorrow]]/ and the light novel /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Kill][All You Need Is Kill,]]/ from which it was adapted. You may find them enjoyable as well --- if you haven't seen\read them yet, that is.

--------------

^{1} another similar anime is /[[http://imgur.com/Yhc7MVB][Sword Art Online]]/, but it's a more brutal story, since a death of a character is permanent here.
