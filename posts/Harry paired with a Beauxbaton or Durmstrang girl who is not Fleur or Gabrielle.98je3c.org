Literally any of the students would be fine, even fem!Viktor.

Obviously, no slash, preferably no positive depictions of Snape or Malfoy and a lack of Ron/Hermione would be greatly appreciated.


** Hmm..if you are okay with him not being the bwl and also not going to Hogwarts then: * harry potter and the boy who lived by santi.

Ps: snape is depicted in an indifferent light, dude is just chill and it makes sense when you understand the changes the author made.

**** Yeah, there are a few extra chapters on DLP right up to the yule ball, then as every good story out there ,we get left hanging, which is a shame as the dude was really on to something there and calypso is a cool OC , the only thing that would have hooked me more is if harry started using runes to bridge magic and tech, magineers are freaking cool when done right.

** I've just started on a story like this. The thing is, I've really only just started (10k words in) and I want to make it an AU story. The plot is basically like this: Harry is 2 years younger than the girl (Cassiopeia Black). Both their parents got killed. She is forced to attend Durmstrang. Story follows the girl at Durmstrang.

Therefore I'm not sure how it complies with you; I really want her to get together with someone, but it's going to take ages before she'll be at Hogwarts (seeing as it's Harry's 4th year, meaning i'll have to write roughly 6 years of Durmstrang before she goes there). So yeh. It's only a long term thing for my personal story, no clue when that's going to be done.

Sorry for not giving any useful recommendations, just wanted to tell you that I'm working on something but it may take a prolonged period of time.

Not what I was looking for. I was thinking more along the lines of romance with a foreign exchange student, not someone part of a British family. Preferably with some interesting world building for the rest of Europe, but at the very least some minor cultural differences (which are not summed up with "America, Fuck Yeah!", "Hot Asian girl" or "Native inhabitant wank").

As someone who played around with similar concepts, I'd recommend skipping most of that arc and use the in-media-res approach and flashbacks if necessary. Start with her chatting up Harry at Hogwarts or something like that, otherwise, you'll get bogged down in side-plots and never make it to Hogwarts because you get bored halfway through year 5 at Durmstrang. Because let's be honest, without all the shit Voldemort was doing, Hogwarts isn't all that interesting unless you write slice of life.

**** Yeah, but the older you are, the less creepy the age difference. For example, a 70 year old with a 60 year old is far less creepy than a 15 year old with a 5 year old. However, as you may have noticed, the age difference between the two is the same.

*** The most popular approaches are to age her up and explain her appearance with some Veela pseudo-science or to have them get together once she is above a certain age (15 is the age of consent in France, 16 in Britain).

There's actually a decent one around where they are in something akin to a platonic long-term relationship during the Horcrux hunt and get together at the end (and even that one ages her up).

Edit: Honestly, I'd rather take Harry/Gabrielle than any story that ships him (or Hermione) with Death Eaters. I mean, the French president was "cradle robbed" by his teacher and ended up marrying her. It's more believable for Harry to fall for a 13 or 14-year-old girl than it is for him to have the hots for Snape or Voldemort. Then again, the age of consent is 14 here in Germany, so maybe it's just not something on my mind all the time (like in American Media where they celebrate a girls 18th birthday because that makes her officially bangable).
