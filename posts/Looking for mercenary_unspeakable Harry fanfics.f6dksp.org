Hello, I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry is a mercenary, or an unspeakable with high skills. Off the top of my head, I can name Triton, Charon, Whiskey Time Travel.(Yeah, any fics with time traveling powerful harry is also good). There is another (I don't remember the name) where Aberforth sends him back and Harry raises Tom Riddle. Any similar fanfics will be appreciated.


** FYI but the author of Whiskey Time Travel is rewriting that story. He just started it a month or two ago.
