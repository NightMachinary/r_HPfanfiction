Hey, I recall reading a Harry Potter FanFiction story a couple of months ago, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Unfortunately, I want to read it again, but can't find it. I was hoping that somebody could help me find the fic.

As I recall, the story took place after the deathly hallows, and was a Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass FanFiction. The story was about a secretly manipulative Harry who tricked daphne (who's also manipulative) into going on 5 dates with him (I think it was 5). He says that he'll leave her alone after the 5 dates. I also remember that Harry makes multiple power plays to try to become the minister of magic in the story. I also remember that the story had only about 5-7 chapters, but was still of a healthy length and well written.

I know that I haven't been able to provide much detail, but if somebody could find this FanFiction, or knows of it, that would be greatly appreciated.
