So, the idea is that having a piece of his soul in direct contact with Harry's blood protections was at the same time taking magic and mental power from Harry to suprime it's influence while /simultaneously/ infecting Voldemort with a curse that makes him magically and mentally weaker.

As a result the order and the Ministry thought they were dealing with the earliest more cunning and powerful Voldemort instead of the white-washed version they actually were. The order spent so many resources to try figuring out what were the true plans and were so afraid of falling in a trap that they were virtually ineffective in the war while the ministry was afraid of what previous Voldemort was able to do if they tried fighting back that they capitulated almost completely.

Only during the Battle of Hogwarts, when both actually /did/ face Voldemort in battle, did they realize how far he was from his true power and promptly crouched his ‘army'. However, when the Horcrux was removed and Harry started experimenting the true depths of his power the same happened with Voldemort, bringing him back to his former glory (shown by him killing alone many of the defenders in the following battle before running away).

End result is that while Harry /does/ get a serious power-boost Voldemort also has one and actually knows how to use it. And so the war continues, now with Voldemort without Horcruxes and his forces heavily diminished while Harry is struggling to get a hold of his new power-level, deal with a much smarter and saner Voldemort and trying to be seen as an actual combatant and potential leader among those who usually look at him condescendingly and only see him as a symbol.


** This is... really well thought-out.
