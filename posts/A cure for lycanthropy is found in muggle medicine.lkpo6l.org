Perhaps, in a world where Remus survives, Hermione goes on to get a Potions mastery as well as a muggle PhD in pharmaceuticals, and she discovers that a muggle mood stabilizer might work similarly to wolfsbane, but without having to brew such a complex potion. When Lupin gives it a trial run, to his amazement, he doesn't transform at all.


** A brief excerpt from one of my fics. (Time traveling George is going by the fake name of Gil here.)

Gil rummaged through an inner pocket of his jacket. “Oh, and before I forget, I brought you the cure for lycanthropy,” he said.

“What?” said Remus. He grabbed the little plastic bottle of pills Gil was offering him. He read the label. “This says Amoxicillin.”

“Yeah, it took a muggleborn healer to think of testing muggle antibiotics on magical diseases,” said Gil. “Take three a day for a week, you'll be all set.”

**** Sometimes unfortunately so.

Though it's all preference in the end. In a world where people willingly, knowingly and under no duress read Muggle!AU HP fics, I'm sure you'll find your audience as well.
