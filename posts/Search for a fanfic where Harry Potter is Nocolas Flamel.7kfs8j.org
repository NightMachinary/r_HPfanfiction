Hello,

I search a fanfic where Harry Potter os Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas was a Muggleborn Student some 600 years ago, and created the fictional character Nicolas Flamel, he gave this Secret near his Death to another Wizard so he could continue the character. In this Story Harry appears from Time to time, and all the time the Teacher and Students search for him while Harry (disguised as Professor Flamel) watches the whole thing and pranks them all.

I seem to remember that this Story is on fanficauthors.net but I'm not sure.

Regards Mac_cy

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
