It can be one or multiple next gen kids (such as Lily Luna, James Sirius, or any of the other kids). I would like fics about them meeting James Potter/Lily Potter/Sirius Black/Remus/etc. or the the original Order of the Phoenix. It can take place in a Hogwarts setting or outside of it (such as when they're older - I would like this). It can be AU or time travel or whatever.


** I read one fic where Harry, Albus, Rose, and Hugo end up sent diagonally through time to the Marauders era, where Harry almost immediately kills Bellatrix. (It is explicitly stated that they are in a divergent timeline that will not affect their own, and they're stuck there for a year because that's how long it will take to create another of the time-travel devices to get them home.)

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.
