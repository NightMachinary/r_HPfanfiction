  Would Harry even be a Slytherinny Gryffindor, or would he be more of a Gryffindory Slytherin?
#+end_quote

He would be a Ravenclaw, of course. They're all about obscure knowledge, right?

Well, that, or he might try to persuade the Hat to put him into Hufflepuff, because nobody ever suspects them of anything.

*** Hmm I had never quite looked at Ravenclaws like that! I always feel that they're more like Hermione, very book smart, but not very bothered about the social going-ons. Ravenclaws are quite neutral though, which obviously would enable Harry's agenda. They can be friends with Gryffindors, solely because they're not Slytherins; they're friends with Slytherins, because they're the only House that's not filled with idiots from their POV; they'd be friends with Hufflepuffs, because Hufflepuffs would be friends with everyone but Slytherins.

On the one hand I can see Hufflepuffs being gossips, on the other hand they'd be so loyal that they wouldn't tell secrets. As for being in Hufflepuff because no one will suspect a thing, I don't think that is quite within the planning capabilities of an eleven year old. Might be Rita's idea, but I like to think she lets him do his things. I also have a bit more faith in the Hat's ability to see through such schemes and just put the kid directly into Slytherin.

**** Ravenclaws are driven by a desire for more knowledge. Hence Luna. I feel like your harry would most likely be a Ravenclaw. Unless, for example, his desire for more knowledge stems from something else, such as more power/prestige/fame/desire to help family.

In which case he wouldn't be a Ravenclaw at all, and would be a Slytherin.

However, ultimately everyone has some trait of all four houses. It just depends on which traits define you. Everyone is loyal to their friends. But do you believe in hard work, and does that work, passion, and determination define you? Then you are a Hufflepuff. Do you desire knowledge for knowledge's sake? Ravenclaw. Are you driven by ambition, and are you cunning and ruthless enough to do what it takes for your ambition? Slytherin. Courage is knowing your fears, and being able to overcome them. Bravery is being able to deal with ambiguity. Are either of these your strongest suit? Griffindor.

A reporter/investigator! Harry would have to exemplify all of these. Not being afraid to dig up facts. Having the work ethic to find necessary information, sometimes looking through dusty age-old records. Wanting to seek information for the sake of having that information. Having the ambition and resourcefulness to find that information in the first place. It is easy to justify every house; difficult to justify one single house.

I really love the idea though, let me know if you find one/feel like writing it.

***** True that, thank you! I think I'm just so caught up in the whole Slytherin vs. Gryffindor thing sometimes that I just skip the other houses completely.

[[/u/BabyBringMeToast][u/BabyBringMeToast]] pointed out linkffn(When In Doubt, Obligate!) down the thread, which has Lockhart adopting Harry. I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, but it might be something to your taste as well. I'm definitely planning on writing it, but I'll try to figure out the general lines first so I have a solid foundation on which to build.

**** I also thought Ravenclaw right away, just because reporters do so much research and it's from the desire for knowledge. However, I feel Rita is extremely ambitious, and so might Harry be after being raised by her. I also feel that Rita might care enough about manipulating public opinion that she'd tell Harry to avoid Slytherin, leading to another Sorting Hat scene where Harry is going "not Slytherin, anywhere but Slytherin!" to the Hat.

But then. There's Harry speaking Parceltongue to deal with. If Rita has had him since he was seven, she will find this out. And it will be a huge dilemma for her. What a news story, Harry Potter is a Parcelmouth! But he's also her son and she doesn't want people to think of him as a dark wizard, and she ultimately decides not to write it and not to tell anyone. But she'll know that if Harry goes into Slytherin there might be things he could learn there as a Parcelmouth that no one else could learn. So should she advise him to try to get into Slytherin?

Maybe she advises him not to get into Slytherin, but later helps him sneak in to their dungeons. She could hear the password in her beetle form. Oh! Would she help him become an animagus? She'd have no moral problem with doing it early and keeping it from the Ministry, I think, and she knows how useful it is.

Okay, so Rita knows the importance of public opinion, so she advises Harry to avoid Slytherin (unless /she/ was a Slytherin and she has a fondness for her old house and wants Harry to be in it for that reason, hmmm... but anyway) But she also knows how influential Slytherins can be in later life, and knows of the Slytherin-Gryffindor feud. So maybe she counsels Harry to avoid Gryffindor also, so as not to piss off anyone important? Actually I'm betting she tells Harry all the people in his year (and outside his year!) to make friends with right away, like Draco Malfoy and Susan Bones, people with important parents.

That's why I see him in Ravenclaw, but he'd be much more outgoing and... networking, involved with people, than the average Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw can take the oddies, though. It's like Luna Lovegood, she's into knowledge, but not the same knowledge as her housemates, she is into all those imaginary creatures and conspiracy theories, so even though she belongs in RC for her thirst for knowledge, she suffers for it. Maybe Harry's housemates would also hide his things to torment him when he pissed them off by not acting like a proper Ravenclaw. For instance, maybe his grades aren't the best because he cares more about gossip, and he's bringing the house average or reputation down.

***** Although Rita seems quite ambitious, I think that she seems to thrive on the uncovering of secrets rather than getting higher up. Now I've thought about it, it wouldn't surprise me if she has been a Ravenclaw.

I hadn't given much thought about Rita finding out him being a Parselmouth, but I would think she'd be 1) scared 2)excited because of the snoop 3)reluctant to release the information anyway and lastly, 4) interested in the possibilities of using snakes as sources. However, she'd probably find out that snakes are still snakes, and do not care for much for humans and their petty squabbles.

She'd definitely want him to be in a house where he could get information for her, but he's still an eleven year old kid, and his own person. Also, I believe the Hat is smart enough to see through that within a few seconds. So she might push for a certain house, but in the end Harry is going to be where he needs to be, which might very well be Ravenclaw indeed.

** Given how unscrupulous Rita Skeeter could be when it comes to obtaining gossip, she strikes me as someone who's not too worried about morality or "looking good". That attitude would probably rub off on Harry, too.

The only reason Harry rejected Slytherin in canon was because he didn't like the whole "only dark wizards go to Slytherin" image that came with the house. But with Skeeter raising him, Harry would probably be just as unscrupulous as she is and not care that much about good vs bad, especially if Skeeter taught him to snoop and stuff for her.

So, my guess is Harry would've chosen Slytherin. Besides, a cunning journalist gets far more juicy gossip than a straight-laced, blundering Gryffindor.

I think it might also be possible that he's more image-aware, and therefore even /more/ biased against tainting his reputation as anti-Voldemort. Either way could work well, if it's written properly

*** I agree, I feel like Rita Skeeter is very much in the "it's not bad if you don't get caught" category. However, I feel that Harry's saviour syndrome at least was already in him, and I feel the need to give that its place. I'm not sure how that is going to tie into him being a Slytherin.

***** I meant him feeling personally responsible for people, but yes, he is very impulsive too. As for Snape, I think it's also that he's an adult now, since he didn't seem very into saving people when he was young, at least not in the small tads we know about his teenage years. Very impulsive as well though, I feel like there's a pattern there...

** A similar thing is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obligate!]] which has Harry adopted by Lockhart.

I think he'd probably be Slytherin, largely because Rita Skeeter seems to very much shill for the pureblood/high ranking establishment types, and is very anti-Dumbledore. The hat wanted him there, and without Hagrid telling him it's a house for dark wizards, and Malfoy annoying him, he might have been there.

Here's my question:

How do you get around the fact that Harry has no value to Rita if he's not Harry Potter, that continued access lowers his value as an asset, and that Dumbledore, the Ministry, Sirius Black and pretty much everyone will want her not to have Harry?

So if she hides his identity, fine, they won't take him away, but she also can't write about him. If she writes about him, they know she has access to him. All they need to do then is get her and interrogate her until she returns Harry, because it's kidnapping. Also, if she doesn't let him out, he's not doing anything she can write about, she can't use him to get high level access.

*** Thank you, those are great questions! Some of these I've actually thought about, but definitely not as in depth. I hope these answers help. I will read the fic, thanks for the recommendation!

I was thinking along the lines of her not taking Harry because Harry Potter, but because she has a heart under those golden teeth. Maybe taking him along on her field trips under glamours/compelling spells, because people are quicker to trust her when she's nice to a kid, and they're not careful around Harry, because what would the kid do? Because of her weakness, and her ending up liking him, I imagine she'd try and not write about him unless she absolutely has too (in case of the Triwizarding Tournament) to not lose her credibility as a journalist. Even then, she'd only make up rumours that would not alienate him from his peers. As for Sirius, I think Rita would be an extraordinarily good help raising questions about his non-existing trial. Dumbledore, maybe because Rita bought Arabella Figg, does not realise Harry is in Rita's custody for a long while, and when he finally realises who is responsible for the columns in WitchWeekly and the annoyingly accurate articles she has written, he realises that a) the blood wards are already done for and b) Harry is happy at Rita's. I think Dumbledore would hope that Harry would temper her vitriol and Rita would make a good home, even though unconventional, for Harry.

**** I suspect that you're starting to have to take her very out of character to make this happen. Okay, so she has a heart? Great. But it's not on her sleeve. She doesn't care about upsetting Harry when he's 14, which is still a child. She doesn't care about unleashing horrific misogynistic/slut shaming attacks on Hermione. If she cares, it will be eventually, not immediately.

I appreciate that at this point, it's just incompatible head canons, but it strikes me that you're going out of your way to avoid putting conflict in your story, which will make it less interesting.

Intrepid investigator, Rita Skeeter, on the hunt for a story: Harry with the Dursleys is a story. He's with MUGGLES. They're mistreating him. BOOM. I can see literally NO way that she wouldn't write that story. It's juicy, it incriminates Dumbledore, and she can morally justify it because by calling attention to it, it can be fixed. Headlines. Dumbledore doesn't remove him? Boom. More story. Dumbledore does move him to live with wizards? That's a story too. Dig up dirt on them.

I don't see the point that it goes from "This is a terrible thing to do to a child, and consequently, a great story!" to "I must raise him myself, it is the only way!". I did not see anything in her that indicated that she would keep him rather than leveraging him with say, the Malfoys or Fudge.

I definitely could see the things you describe happening if it was just a kid, but not The Boy Who Lived. Harry is just too valuable a scoop for that. (Although I suppose the way around that is for Dumbledore to disguise him and his scar, and her to notice he's a magical child and nothing more. If you manage to keep his name hidden from her, and they both learn who he is when he starts Hogwarts, she'd have the requisite affection in place.)

***** This gave a lot for me to think about, and I definitely need to think it over more. I really liked Skeeter as an intriguing character, which is why the idea popped in my head. Needing her to be out of character does seem unavoidable at this point, which is painful to admit. Was Rita Skeeter always this awful? Evidence does seem to point in this direction, she wrote /Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?/ quite early on. However, JK Rowling did make her an incredibly flat character, as she is basically the personification of the Daily Mail.

Keep in mind, though, that at this point (post-bellum), she has little to gain from discrediting Dumbledore, and would risk losing her fan base by going against the grain so much. She'd arrive at the office with this story, her boss would probably get a heart attack, if he even believed her. /Now don't be ridiculous, Rita, my girl. First you try to print th--that awfullly RUBBISH article about Henrietta, now you are trying to spread these lies about Dumbledore! If he really was not capable of caring for children, he wouldn't be headmaster, now would he? I think I've been giving you too much liberties, but enough is enough. This was your second chance, but the next will be your last. If I hear you even whispering all this nonsense about the Potter boy in the next CENTURY you'll be writing garden articles until the end of time!/

You are right though, Skeeter would never take Harry in without a thought. She has proven that she's not above kidnapping him for a while though. What if she lured him by promising him an ice cream, hoping to obliviate his aunt and uncle, if they even missed him, afterwards, only to discover that the Dursleys decided to celebrate his running away by taking a spontaneous holiday?

Now she's stuck with the brat, because he doesn't want to leave her side, without a story, because her publisher doesn't believe her, and on her last warning.

She has no choice but to take him in, and his willingness to help out in the household and his interest in drama (both a product of Petunia's upbringing) endear him to her.

And I agree with the other posters, obviously Ravenclaw. Rita wouldn't want the darling of the wizarding world where he would belong after being raised by her (Slytherin) and Ravenclaw would be where he could hide out the best I believe. Hufflepuff!Harry always makes a big stir because ZOMGAPOTTERINTHEDUFFERHOUSE or whatever.
