** Setting aside the manipulative Weasleys and every other H/Hr trait I'm embarrassed about sharing a ship with, I've never understood the appeal of the X-Goes-Back genre. Not only are you totally spiking the suspense by giving a character total foreknowledge of your plot, you're forcing me to imagine a fully grown adult with adult feelings and desires /in the body of an 8-year-old./

It's a David Lynch psychological horror plot masquerading as a wish-fulfillment plot.

*** I think it can work - I've heard other people talk about how it could be used to really expand on the idea of the butterfly effect as well as the ethical and moral ramifications that occur - how do you handle your sex drive now, are you grooming people that you're interested in, can you really hold people accountable for their actions in what is technically a future alternate universe? There are some good issues to tackle here.

**** I agree, if done well it's something I love to read about :) (partially because while I would love to go back myself (I'd be rich...because I'd know what the internet becomes (it was looked as nerdy back in the 90's after all!) and found companies like Amazon and Ebay myself!), but on the other hand: Putting me into a younger body, with the sexual urges of a grown up? - Damned, that sounds like quite a harsh punishment)

*** Yeah.

Good I think the story is lame. And then Harry keeps insisting:

** I once clicked on a random series on an anime website on their list of all anime ever made. It was Detective Conan, a 700 episode, 15 movies, spanning 'bout 400 hours show at the time. I ended up watching all of it. So some good things comes from random picking.

*** One thing: Well, congratulation on spending over 400 hours on a completely episodic anime.

Yes, but anime rely on their economic success so their are more likely to cater their respective target group. In fanfiction the relationship is completely different, mostly dependent on the author and --- as other people on reddit pointed out --- more personal about their stories and not accepting critic about the work.

As such one can assume animes to be at least a little bit entertaining while fanfiction is not dependent on the actual entertainment value of the work.
