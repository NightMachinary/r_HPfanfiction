** [*Cedric* makes it to The Cup before *Harry* does, and is portkeyed to the Graveyard.]

*Cedric:* Where am I?

*Petigrew:* Incarcerous! [Ties *Cedric* up.]

*Voldemort:* Not the Boy-Who-Lived? Unfortunate, but we shall proceed nonetheless. I must congratulate you, wizard, for your blood shall facilitate the return of Lord Voldemort himself!

*Cedric:* You are Lord Voldemort?

*Voldemort:* I am.

*Cedric:* My Lord, I have always felt bad that you didn't get to finish what you had started, but then I got sorted into Hufflepuff, and you just /have/ to be /nice/ to /everyone/, including the #%$^@# Boy-Who-Lived and his mudlbood girlfriend! So, how can I help? Do you require anything from me?

*Voldemort:* ... Not from you, no.

***** Oh, dammit. You didn't know?

In /Cursed Child,/ Harry's whiny, bratty, brainless, lazy, spiteful, useless, moronic, slimy imbecile of a son Albus decides to go back in time to save Cedric Diggory in order to show up his father. Albus takes kind-hearted, noble, gentle Scorpius Malfoy with him.

They save Cedric by making sure he does so poorly in the first two Tasks that he won't be able to get the Cup and get to the Graveyard. Not once does Albus the Arse decide to stop the entire War from ever happening at all by going to Dumbledore.

It goes pear-shaped because time travel is a stupid, stupid, stupid idea that mystery writers should never use, and poor Scorpius winds up in a horrible future where Cedric, humiliated by his losses in the Triwizard, joins up with Voldemort and becomes his right-hand man and kills Neville Longbottom, who doesn't kill Nagini, and therefore Voldemort still has a Horcrux and wins.

Poor Scorpius, who doesn't get treated right by anyone, is forced to go back and fix everything.
