We all know that Hermione's social awkwardness is often erased in fan fiction thanks to the glamorized version of her character in the films. I want to read about the real Hermione who struggles with making friends, gets picked on for being a bookworm and who says the wrong thing at times. I'd prefer a non-romance focused story, but I'd be willing to read (almost) anything if it's well-written enough. I'd like to see some of Hermione in her first year but I don't mind if the story takes place during another school year. I'd prefer an actual Hogwarts based fic as opposed to an adult Hermione, though I wouldn't mind reading about a socially awkward Hermione's life as a 11-17 year old in the muggle world.


** Hermione in linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) fits most of what you have listed. Her characterization in that fic is rather unique, one that I very much enjoy. She is not the main character but is rather prominent regardless.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
