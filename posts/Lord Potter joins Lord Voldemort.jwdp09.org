I want recommendations for stories where Harry joins Voldemort. It can be the evil wrath like version, Sane/Good/young (time travel) Tom Riddle, Diary/Locket or whichever Horcrux, or even those were he is professor or Minister. Don't really care.

What I do care about his a smart Harry who actually wants to learn about the magical world and its people/Creatures. I admit I like Lord Potter/Black/... stories where Harry learns Dumbledore is manipulating or hiding shit from him and he gets mad or even, (cliché yes, but entertaining). I'd like to read ones were he uses his own pollical power or fame to his advantage. I don't mind if the Weasleys are in on it or his friends. I'd like Harry having more/other friends.

I prefer Slash pairings. Draco/Harry, Blaise, Theo, even Snape or Tom. Please no super evil Harry that enjoys killing and torture just for fun. I have no issues with him killing if its necessary but I read one once where him and his friends killed for fun and were laughing and nope not my thing.


** Hey, there's a pretty good collection on AO3 called 'Fucking BOPS' by ForgetfulHufflefuck. I think you'd like most of the stuff on there. :]

** linkffn(Embracing His True Self by Debstheslytherinsnapefan; Lord of Time by Debstheslytherinsnapefan; Individual by MidnightEmber; Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas by Jessiikaa15)

Individual is sadly unfinished but is a really unique story that I would like to see more of. The ones by Debs aren't finished but the author updates her stories pretty often (she has a bunch of ongoing stories) and Hidden Personas is really good, but Jess seems to disappear for awhile and then post a chapter out of the blue.

  Tom Riddle/Harry Potter Slash. What if Harry didn't want to fight Voldemort? What if he was fed up with the light side judging him constantly and wants to be his true self? The Slytherin side that he had squashed in a bid to fit in and be accepted? Realizing he never would...what of the prophecy? Could they overcome it? Will Voldemort even give him a chance?

  Harry is tired of everything but most of all he's tired of hearing about his likeness to James Potter. All he wants to do is forget, all he wants to do is sleep, so he slips into darkness.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is murdered, crucified for the last-ditch effort at the greater good. But death is not as black and white as one would want it, not when Death claims you as his master. Harry has a do-over, reincarnated back into his past life, with all the knowledge he needs to piece back together with an old enemy that might just be the only one that can save him from his grizzly fate in 1999.

  Thinking back on it there really should have been a rule. Don't travel back in time if you are just going to fall in love with the person that you are destined to kill. And as an add on if you are going to fall in love with them make sure that they stay focused on the task at hand and do not overindulge in dark magic and madness along the way.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.

  Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move /on/ or go /back/ he does something else entirely.

  And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.

  Because that makes sense.

  (No. No it doesn't.)

  But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.

  “I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”

  “You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to /help/ you?”

  Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

  At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.

  Harry is betrayed. Harry gets a second chance to do it all over again.

  There is just one catch. If Harry gets to keep his memories from his previous life, so does Voldemort.

  What if a saner Voldemort, wary of a plot by Dumbledore, heard the prophecy and decided to assume a wait and see approach instead of leaping to action? Growing up as the son of two dedicated Order members who seem to care more about their war than their children, Harry becomes his sister's protector and nothing will ever stand between them. Not their parents' blind devotion to a vigilante with an overinflated sense of self importance and not a Dark Lord bent on slaughtering his way to complete dominance of Britain.  This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
