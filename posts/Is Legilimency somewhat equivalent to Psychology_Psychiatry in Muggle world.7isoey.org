** No. I daresay it could be used therapeutically but there's no suggestion of that in canon. Let's face it, in canon there's no suggestion of any therapy for any form of psychological distress and any hint of mental illness is ignored, dismissed or mocked. It's not one of the better facets of the books.

** No, it's referred to as an obscure branch of magic. (One of my pet peeves is when every pure-blood and their toad has perfect 'occlumency shields'.)

Psychiatry is a branch of medicine IRL, so its closest magical analogue would be mind-healing.

** I don't think so. From what we saw in canon Snape would bring Harrys worst memories. Maybe if he had been doing it differently it might not have been so bad.

** No, Legilimency was mostly an interrogation and intelligence gathering tool.

** I can see why someone would try to relate legilimency to Psychology/Psychiatry. From the way I see it, it's like a mental fight of the minds. Occlumency is the defense. Legilimency is the offense, so to speak.
