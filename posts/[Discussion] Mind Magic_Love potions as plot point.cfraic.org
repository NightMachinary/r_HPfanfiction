It's often done poorly, but what are the best uses of them you've seen in fics?

Dark Discoveries, for all it's faults (No Plot, extremely out of character Harry), has a Harry that uses conditioning via legilimency.

Faery Heroes uses it to cause internal strife in fights.

I've read a couple of fanfics where it's used in duels to read the Opponent's next move.

The mind arts has a Harry that specializes in it, but hasn't reached deep enough levels to classify as new material.

Love potions make the victim susceptible in canon.

There was a fic I read once where it was used to make victims kill themselves and commit crimes.

An idea I've had is for a character to dose two people to each other, then have them keep dosing each other, but I can't figure out how to use it in a scene without it being excessively creepy.
