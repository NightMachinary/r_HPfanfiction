Looking for stories where parselmouth abilities are for healing and protection/warding only. There are a lots where parselmagic is about a few hisses and all your enemies are dead.

I want some where Harry is told about how parselmouths are great healers/warders and so Harry dabs a bit on that or becomes a full fledged battle healer (I don't want him to be weak too).

I think that for young Harry, having the ability to heal others will give him enough confidence and curiosity to excel in other fields of magic.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

**** I tried to read it a couple of days ago but I just couldn't get past Harry being a Hufflepuff. I know it is a stupid reason but I just don't like the badgers, also I was told Harry gets stupidly OP.

*** Not purely based on Parselmagic, but it does contain it.

*** Ugh, I started reading one and the fact that Harry and Hermione declared their undying love for each other at 13 puts me off. It's too corny seeing those letters the authors writes, I am skipping them hoping nothing too important is being revealed on them.

I like the approach he is taking with parselmagic, thanks for your recommendation!
