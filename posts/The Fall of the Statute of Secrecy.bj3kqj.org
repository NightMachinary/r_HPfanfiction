Hello! I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]] by InquisitorCOC and got intrigued by the idea of the eventual fallout of the Statute of Secrecy. If you were a witch/wizard with enough power/influence/wealth/manpower, etc., what would you do or what solution would you suggest to ensure that the Statute isn't destroyed? It could range from downright evil to amoral or morally questionable to good (I was trying to find a motive for a villain I was crafting when I saw the story, so yeah... Just want to hear what you think though).

Personally, I would suggest planting agents/infiltrating/befriending/manipulating the most influential Muggle networks, organizations, etc. and sabotaging Muggle inventions that could possibly reveal the Wizarding World. (Which is what was in the story, so perhaps don't read it first thing so it doesn't influence your thought process? It's up to you.)


** Wizards have already infiltrated the world governments to an absurd degree. They were able to alter the memories of the American President without even blinking, and are able to hide such wide-spread destruction that is described as a hurricane passing through, without anyone realizing its fucking giants rampaging through the country-side.

​

I don't think that sabotaging Muggle technology would be useful, but adapting to it would be. Clearly, in the HP future we see in canon, the Statute of Secrecy is maintained. Sophisticated satellite imaging has not revealed giant swathes of land that wizards have hidden away. Muggle London has not discovered the Ministry. Either the existed spells are able to affect technology, or they were able to adapt to advances in technology.

*** Here's a thought: You know all that domestic spying stuff that they say is to catch terroists? That's actually the government tracking down digital breaches of the Statute of Secrecy and squashing them before they go viral.

**** And that department also includes muggle-borns and squibs besides the trained muggles, providing both magical and technological resources for use? Just an idea, because what other jobs do squibs in the magical world do? If they're always placed in low positions and some of them had the potential to be better than that, it's wasted resources.

**** Only the leaders of muggle countries are meant to know about magic. I dunno if there'd be an entire government department in the know. Some kind of spell placed on the internet seems more practical to me.

***** Then perhaps just masquerading as a secret government department, when in fact they're under the Ministry or the ICW. Muggle tech would be a great addition to the resources at their disposal. A spell on the internet would be helpful, yes, but every spell seems to be fallible, one way or another. And it's not as if the internet's the only thing Muggles have that can spread information. A department that monitors those and works in conjunction with the Department of Mysteries (or something) to create and cast the spells seems reasonable.

...Alter the memories of the American President? When did that happen? (Been a while since I read the books if it's there).

I suppose what I meant by sabotaging Muggle tech is that they created spells that interfered with the function of the devices, so as to avoid discovery. Maybe sabotaging wasn't the best word for it...my bad.

  “Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. . . . It's not a very good time for me. . . . I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see . . . from the President of ---”

  “That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.

  “But I really was rather hoping to speak ---”

  “We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.”

***** They were referring to the American President during that scene? Huh.

​

Thanks for finding that. I remember the gist of that scene, though not that particular bit of info.

****** We don't know it was the American president I suppose. But I feel like that's a reasonable assumption. MACUSA does not seem to care about the Muggles in their country very much. I don't think they would care what happens to the Muggle president.

******* Considering Wizarding America seemed to be under the threat of being hunted down by Muggles more than Wizarding Britain (the Salem Witch trials having occurred in their country), that would be understandable.

** The Mischief's Heir series introduced a novel solution to the eventual failure of the Statute of Secrecy due to technology. Harry founded a space program and they searched for a new planet to terraform and emigrate to. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

The Ninja Wizard series by the same author implemented a magical ritual to transplant the entire Wizarding World and all magical things and beings into the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, after Harry makes a trip there and uses the same ritual to help end the war peacefully and more effectively than in the show's canon.

**** Mischief's Heir is interesting. Loki from MCU takes Harry under his wing and inspires him to live up to his potential. Slowly, Harry recruits others to help with his dream of space travel, and they realize the urgency of it, too. Literally every canonical event goes differently after the first book, and often in ways I've not seen in another fic.

Ninja Wizard... is interesting, but meanders a bit more. It starts with Harry dreaming of the world of Naruto and picking up some skills there, but then he rarely uses them again once he learns magic. It also features unique solutions to canonical problems, though, and different ones than the Mischief's series. Eventually, Harry takes a solo field trip to the world of Avatar, interferes with their canon, returns, and comes up with a way to save the Wizarding World from the ever-present threat of reveal to the Muggle world. There is slash later on without much warning, but it does fit and gets developed realistically. No instant soulbond and forever perfect happiness.

The nice thing about both series is that they really immerse everyone in magic. There are spells to do things, and they use them often. Muggles are different, and the Muggle world is different, and that's just how things are. The Wizarding World isn't some Dark Age society that needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into modernity and Muggle technology is the more powerful way of the future, as many fics often move towards. Their ideas can be used, but nobody is suddenly winning duels with the guns and artillery that purebloods are baffled by and defenseless against. Muggles aren't inherently inferior and deserve to be destroyed, as many fics campaign. Nobody places the entire world under Fidelius or conquers all the Muggles with Fiendfyre. The two worlds cannot coexist, secrecy is straining, integration won't work, but both series show ways to separate them safely without utter destruction of one or the other. Nearly every named character is used and developed, and when flaws are amplified and bashed there's at least a reason for it and eventual growth past those flaws.

I strongly recommend the first. Then, if you like it, try the second, see if you can get past the first few chapters that are heavily Naruto influenced, and go into it with an open mind. I don't think it's for everyone, but it's not often that you find a really unique fic, right?

** I have a story on my to-read list that's about the fall of the statute - no idea what the quality etc is like though. It's /long/ and doesn't have that many reviews.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
