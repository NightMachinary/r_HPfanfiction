I'm looking for any fanfics where Harry dates a muggle. There very few and rare and the ones I've read are pretty damn good. It's a little disappointing to find so few of them. If you can help me, I would greatly appreciate it.


** The classic is linkffn(11111990). Post-war.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
