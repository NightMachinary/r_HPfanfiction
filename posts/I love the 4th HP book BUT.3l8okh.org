... Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire is the dumbest shit I've ever read.

You must compete Harry because someone else entered your name! We are sure you didn't entire and can verify it by potions or mind arts if needed to be but still you MUST compete.

Like what the hell man....


** I think that scene would have been completely different if Harry had a parent or some kind of advocate. If that happened to Ron, Mrs. Weasley would /shut that shit down./ Harry was 14.

But the adults in the room are: Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor Dumbledore, Barty Crouch, Professor McGonagall, Bagman, and Professor Snape.

Dumbledore, apart from anything else, has a vested interest in giving Harry as much experience as possible. So he's not going to fall all over himself sheltering Harry.

Dumbledore's first instinct is to ask (an imperiused) Crouch, who states that it's in the rulebook that Harry must compete. Bagman affirms Crouch's statement by saying that if Crouch says they're no loophole, then there's no loophole. Then Moody (Barty Crouch Jr.) arrives, and he skillfully transitions the conversation by treating Harry's participation like it's a foregone conclusion.

Dumbledore, operating on the wisdom of both Moody and Crouch and not really in any rush to disqualify Harry in the first place, decides that Harry should compete. McGonagall is the closest thing Harry has to an advocate, but she's not inclined to overrule Dumbledore. Karkaroff and Maxime obviously aren't happy, but at this point the host school's headmaster and the host country's ministry representives have decided that Harry should compete. So they're irritated and Karkaroff suggests that they will be boycotting in future, but neither of them think they can overrule the others.

*** Well, to be honest, I always felt that nobody in the story thought about the implications of Harry getting entered against his will.

If it really was a magically binding contract, then why not use it to hunt down fugitives? Either they show up for some pretty rigged tasks in the Biannual Fugitive Games or they suffer whatever magical consequences come from breaking a contract. Either way, it's a win/win for the good guys.

If it wasn't a magically binding contract, then Harry got turbo screwed and it would make quite a bit of sense that no one really believed he didn't enter himself. Everyone would wonder why he's actually still competing if he doesn't want anything to do with it like he keeps saying.

Also when I was reading The Goblet of Fire, I kept thinking that Harry really needed a publicist. Even if Rita is an irritating rumor-monger, she obviously has a lot of loyal readers so when Harry starts off antagonizing her, I got pretty frustrated. Although it does also set up the fifth book since Harry burned his bridges with the press in this book so they'd be a lot less hesitant to smear him when Fudge asked them to.

**** I've always felt that where that falls down is in the intent of the person entering them. Barty Crouch Jnr - whatever else you say about him - definitely did intend Harry to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Yes, he had ulterior motives in doing so, but they still entirely rested on his competing.

With "contracts catch criminals" that same underlying intent would not exist. It's not something that can be tricked or contrived into working - it's magic, after all - and so any of those setups wouldn't apply.

(Besides which, the Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. There's no reason to suspect that this is something that can be done at the flip of a dime.)

***** I'd say that the theory is sound but it's Harry's intent that got him into the fix. Barty Jnr. tore off his signature and put a Confundus on the Goblet but Harry was dreaming of glory just like half the kids in the school were that week. If that didn't work, I have no doubt that Barty would have come up with some other nifty schemes to get Harry in the graveyard at the right day and time. If I was Barty, I'd probably be hoping the Confundus didn't work, because the back-up plan might not require him to spend the whole year in disguise, surrounded by enemies.

***** I like to pretend that (1) Hogwarts students write their names on their homework, same as anywhere else, and (2) Impostor Moody tore one off of Harry's homework, so the thing submitted to the cup at least had Harry's name written by his own hand. The confounding forced the cup to think there was a School #4 with just this one entrant.

He could put a fake copy of the ink back if the item was to be returned. (Do students usually get papers back? I don't know.) Harry probably wouldn't notice that some magical property of part of his homework was different.

Otherwise, I have to accept that the cup is just a powerful magical artifact that can extract punishment against anyone, but just happens to usually be this very lawful, rule-based thing.

You know, books > movies any day, but just for this case, I am going make use of the latter. The movie scene in Dumbledore's office, where Snape suggests they let the events of the tournament unfold to find out who is behind this setup explains it the best. Plus, it doesn't contradict canon; it /is/ something that could have occurred behind the scenes. Maybe Dumbledore could have found a way to break the contract eventually, but why do so when he can use Harry as bait while keeping him 'relatively safe'?

** I think one of the interesting aspects is in fanfics and how they have no way of dealing with it.

If there's time travel, or just sufficient genre savviness, Harry & co. anticipate something like this but are unable to block it. Worse, when they manage it, it's very much at odds with the original story. Magical oaths or something.

I imagine a situation where Harry is sure this will happen. He and friends create a duplicate Goblet with the same appearance and none of the complex magic. It just accepts names. There's a reverse heist where they have to conceal the real goblet from beyond the age line. Let's say they just make it invisible somehow (cloak?) but leave it right where it is, and put the decoy in front, still mostly within the age area. Then before the drawing they dump out all of the names entered into the decoy, find Harry's, and forward the rest into the real goblet all at once. The fake goblet is confounded, but it doesn't have any agency, so they just get rid of it. For extra cheek, time travel is involved so Harry only bothers to put in Viktor's, Fleur's, and Cedric's names.

Still needs a twist, or something to make it interesting.
