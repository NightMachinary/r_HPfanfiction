Hi, I am trying to find that fic for a few days but came up nothing. I really hope you can help me find it!

It's a post-war fic. After Harry defeats Voldemort he went missing. No one in the magical world can find him. Also every one who was killed in the war is back to life. Including Lily, James and Dombledore. The only one who thought it was strange is Snape and he went to find Harry. He found Harry in America. Harry is raising a child. I forgot its name though. They live behind a bar. I don't remember whether Harry uses a fake name or not.

And the reason why the deads are alive is that Harry signs a contract with death. He needs to kill the same amount of people every year to keep the ones once were dead alive.

I've tried so many different keywords on google and had looked on snarryficfind. I can't find it on my kindle or calibre either.

I am pretty sure I'm not making this fic up. I just can't seem to find it. Does anyone know which fic I am trying to find?


** That is like WAAAAAY OOC Harry. In my opinion there is no way canon Harry would do it. He wouldn't consider even killing one single person.

*** That doesn't really matter. You're in a subreddit where being OOC is perfectly welcome. I mean, this specific thread is asking for a HPSS fic, isn't that in itself a big flashing warning that they're *most likely* going to be OOC?
