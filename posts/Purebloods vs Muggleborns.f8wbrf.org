So, I've read a lot of fics in the past year, and one thing that stood out was that many authors make the purebloods (the bad ones of course, not the ones they like, even short-lived OCs) really dumb, bigots etc and the Muggleborns are the smartest mfs alive. And they obviously are worse at everything and they get hired by the ministry because of their family's connections, even though they aren't as good as Muggle/half bloods.

The thing is that if the ministry hired and promoted people in the high-end positions that are incompetent, then the English Wizarding World wouldn't have made it to Grindelwald, let alone Voldemort.

Am I the only one that gets annoyed by this "trope"?


** The Ministry in canon /is/ pretty incompetent - it has to be for the sake of the story, but Fudge is not an anomaly there.

The Ministry in canon /is/ controlled and headed by bigots - like Umbridge. The Minister is financed by the Malfoys.

Is competence important to rising in the ranks of the Ministry? We don't know. Are muggleborns able to rise up, at the start of canon? It doesn't really look that way, I can't think of any high ranking official that's a muggleborn (and pure-bloods seem to be the norm - with a smattering of half-bloods).

In addition, many fics play up the aristocratic nature of the WW - and in aristocratic systems, competence is not usually what's rewarded. Think of noble dominated militaries in history - usually you get the scions of noble families joining up for a few years, getting promoted based on name or bloodline instead of skill, etc. Apply that to the already fairly incompetent ministry from canon? And it's a pretty perfect fic.

Not all purebloods should be idiots, of course - and it's not particularly interesting to read that. But many of them are portrayed by canon as not particularly smart, and their discrimination against muggle-born is also not particularly appealing, so...

*** I agree.

Whether it was aristocratic or not, nepotism is a common practice even in muggle world. All purebloods are related to each other atleast two generations apart. Now think about who gets preferential treatment in jobs at ministry? Outsiders like muggleborns or second cousin of a department head? I think only muggleborns who can get a respectable job in ministry are close friends of purebloods.

Like Hermione, she was clearly capable of reaching the Minister or Head of a department in the ministry, but I don't think she could have achieved them without her relationship with Harry and her role in the war.

I've always found it so strange when the fics take the idea that the purebloods control the ministry and kick out all the muggleborns. If that was the case then why would then feel the need for a secret murder club? It would be the muggleborns doing the vigilante murders trying to fix society. Voldemort wouldn't have nearly the support if the purebloods thought everything was fine and dandy. Why risk their lives, why kneel before some random man with a fake name if you didn't feel you had to?

*** The KKK was active at the time of the Jim Crow laws, when African-Americans were pretty much kicked out and kept out of any position of authority, and it was still the KKK murdering African-Americans, not the other way around. So, I don't think it's illogical that the pureblood bigots would act in a similar way - they feared the mugglebons growing in power.

I usually assume that Dumbledore forced Britain to grant the muggleborns equal rights, and the bigots had to nod and agree after Grindelwald's defeat - and the Death Eaters got the same support as the KKK in the USA after the ACW.

Makes sense. Nobby Leach was Minister from 1962-'68, and two years later Voldemort came onto the scene.

*** Remember that there are gradients of racism. Most "pure"bloods probably don't think muggleborns should be exterminated, but they're still racist and don't want to be near them. Narcissa Malfoy is one such person in canon actually.

I can totally see the ministry being staffed by these people, while there is also an extremely violent group of extremists of the same political wing. Those extremists see the casual racists as too weak or lacking ambition, and hate them for that.

See also "blood-traitors", or 'purebloods' who speak out against the norm.

**** Harry Potter deals with classism, not racism.\\
[[https://classism.org/about-class/what-is-classism/]]\\
/Classism is differential treatment based on social class or perceived social class. Classism is the systematic oppression of subordinated class groups to advantage and strengthen the dominant class groups. It's the systematic assignment of characteristics of worth and ability based on social class./\\
 

Term classism was coined in Britain ~1840. It had nothing to do with race, religion etc. And everything to do with social standing. Upper class viewed lower classes as animals to used and exploited, a view that some of them still hold.  

Edited to add:\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class_in_the_United_Kingdom]]\\
The social structure of the United Kingdom has historically been highly influenced by the concept of social class, which continues to affect British society today.\\
...

Harry potter was written by british author who wrote about british society. When HP books were written, everything was not racism.

***** Lol.

If you can read the series and /not/ recognize the ways that Voldemort and the Death Eaters have clear inspiration from the Nazis, I don't know how you can manage it. Blood purity is definitely racism and not classism in Harry Potter, and racism existed at the time.

In a stunning turn of events, you can also have a story that involves /both/ classism /and/ racism. HP fails to a large degree in resolving that satisfactorily, but it does involve both of those sorts of discrimination in the world.

******* Indeed - in the view of the purebloods that align with blood purity, they are different races. Just like in the view of 19th century americans, the 'white race' didn't include irish or italians.

To bring it more to HP, here's what JKR's old FAQ used to have:

#+begin_quote
  The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents.

  If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.
#+end_quote

That squarely falls under racism.

*** Well, controlling the ministry is one thing - but just keeping Muggleborn out isn't exactly everything the Purebloods would want, is it? They want the muggleborn out of the magical world entirely - and with a faction like Dumbledore's pushing for more muggle-born rights, well... they're obviously a threat.

Think of it like this - the status quo there is that muggle-borns are citizens, but without familial connections, inherited wealth, and general power, they struggle to get anything done. Most purebloods are content with that. The extremists, egged on by Voldemort, aren't - they want to reduce the presence of the muggleborns further, kick them out of Hogwarts, make it so that they aren't on part with purebloods legally, probably restrict them to the most menial jobs and limits on their education/magic, to have the muggleborn bow and scrape before their superiors, etc.

I don't really see how that's illogical - and Starfox gives an excellent RL example as well.
