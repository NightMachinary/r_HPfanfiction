I've been reading a lot of fanfics over the years, and one thing remained constant in almost all of the fics - Harry and Draco were portrayed as enemies.

I wanted to read a few where they were friends (not lovers; just friends), and I came across one - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]] by EmySabath. That was the best fiction I had ever read back then, and I /loved/ it!

I've been looking for fictions since then with this kind of a dynamic. Please do let me know if you know of any such fics...

It need not necessarily be 100,000+ words; I'd be happy with even a 60,000+. Basically, something where the author has had a chance to build the characters and actually /finish/ the story.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection]]) this is really good, somebody recommend it here a week ago, and I really enjoyed it. Author already wrote 5 parts and is currently writing the 6th.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

**** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, I wouldn't recommend it, though. The writing is honestly not bad, but the characterization is the worst I've ever seen and it uses a lot of common tropes. Have you ever heard of the They Shook Hands series, it's one of the best Slytherin!Harry stories I've ever read, second only to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). Here's the first book.

***** It's funny you should mention this, because I've tried getting into reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality multiple times before this, and have always failed.

Yes, I've heard of They Shook Hands, but when I read fanfiction, I prefer the author to use his imagination to create a new story and go a little OOC in AU. Hasn't the author based the series on canon? As in all the events from all the years are same, but with Harry in Slytherin?

** So this isn't what you want, but it's close and it's far and away my favorite subplot in this series. Linkffn(innocent) is the first book of a series where Sirius rescues Sirius black from the dursleys early (harry is 8 or 9). Draco has an Irish twin named Hydrus (cannon draco) and Draco's parents decide they want Draco to be in gryffindor so he can spy on the BWL. It's really long, and this makes up 10% of the fic, but I'm more than a million words into it and I love gryffindor draco.

  [ABANDONADA] TRADUÇÃO: Sr. e Sra. Dursley de Privet Drive, Número Quatro, eram muito felizes em dizer que eram perfeitamente normais, muito obrigada. O mesmo não podia ser dito de seu sobrinho de oito anos, porém seu padrinho o queria mesmo assim.

  Jack thinks Hiccup is entirely too innocent, a thought he shares with Astrid. Rated M for chapters 3, 5, and 6. Chapter five features human!Toothless, and chapter six was inspired by a '50 Shades' Tumblr post.
