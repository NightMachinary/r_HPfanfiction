** My immortal isn't even close to being the worst. It wasn't even the worst when it was first published. It's pretty much just a meme at this point, just a punchline in a joke.

** When I first starting reading fan fiction, Robst works were the first I read. I thought his fan fiction was awesome. I mean Harry being raised by goblins, who would not want to see how that turns out? Now that I look back at those fics I realise how bad/ridiculous they actually are.

*** They are readable and complete though, which is more than can be said for many of the (rightfully) ignored fanfiction out there. There are a huge number of fics out there that have terrible summaries, less than a thousand words per chapter, and were dropped after a handful of chapters. Sort by follows or favorites and go to the last page and you find loads of unreadable, incomplete trash that is so much worse than Robst that it isn't worth naming.

**** It's quite weird how so many requests are for "completed stories only", yet the ability to finish a story is so undervalued here.

***** As you can tell from my requests a complete or actively updated fic is my main requirement for a fic. I'm so sick of wasting my time reading a great fic to find it dead.

**** Point.

There are some really bad fics out there, Robst was just the first person that came to mind when I thought bad writing. To be honest his fics would probably be 1000 times better if there was actually conflict in them. They read more like slice of lift fics.

****** Right!

He has a story about all of Voldemorts horcruxes awakening and possessing people which could have made for an awesome story except it ended up turning into nothing more than slice of life.

**** I'm pretty sure he knows, and probably waited just long enough to be off the sub's front page. The near identical phrasing is... suspicious.

It's one thing if it has been several months. But this is just shameful.

Geeze, how about identical wording, in a slightly different order. I've worked as a TA and grader when I was still in school (both undergraduate and graduate), and this is the exact kind of thing I was taught to look for/notice as a sign of plagiarism. This is the kind of thing I've turned in reports for, and led to course failures for the perpetrators.

*** Its overly edgy, and the author is a sociopath with blatant disregard for canon, but its at least readable, and its fanfics are decent. Its also one of the last fanfic that generated a 'verse of its own that has people writing about it, that kind of livejournal/dreamwidth community doesn't exist anymore these days

** Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The fact that they charge people $20 to read it just makes it all the more painful.

Okay unfunny jokes which are sadly not jokes aside:

Anything by StarPolaris on FFN [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/163177/Star-Polaris]]

He has all these really interesting, exciting sounding story ideas.

Which he promptly ruins by giving his characters sudden powers with no explanation, (Such as Harry suddenly knowing how to throw knives ((because we all know the Dursleys are gonna let that kid around weapons.)) and being a "natural born animagus.") ((no training required he just suddenly finds himself able to change into a magical flying panther one day cause faq it deus ex machina.)

And lets not forget the tear jerkingly bland generic dialogue that will make you wanna claw your eyes out after a few minutes~

Its not that he's a atrocious writer. And thats the worst part. The story are GOOD, the PLOTS ARE GOOD. But then things just get so unbelievable with everyone suddenly having all these hidden powers that I personally just threw my hands up and closed out. Its more of a peeve probably but I for one have never been able to finish any of his HP fics. If you all find one that isn't an annoying god-mod lemme know please.
