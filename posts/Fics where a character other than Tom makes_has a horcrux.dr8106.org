I would really like to see just what people have come up with. I don't really care about whether its compliant with what we know about horcruxes or not, as long as its interesting and well-written. Please no massive age-gap relationships unless its portrayed as horrifyingly abusive as it would be in real life. Also, this is probably irrelevant, but please no homo bashing or trans bashing.


** It happens later in the story but Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li hints at it.

#+begin_quote
  When all hope is lost, what would you do to survive? Neville Longbottom becomes a Death Eater. Hermione Granger accepts Draco Malfoy's protection and he accepts her help. Theo Nott joins the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix. Ginny Weasley fills Bellatrix's shoes, while her brother Percy toils as a bureaucrat. And all of them have a role to play in overthrowing Voldemort.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
