Is it just me or are there entirely too many HPFFs where it's one extreme or the other? There seem to be a large number of authors who manage to make Harry a doormat for the women in his life (especially Ginny it Hermione) or they go the other way and create a Harry who always has the answers. Slash fics are often worse, creating a weak, weepy wizard who can't button his own robes without either guidance or permission.

Don't mind me...just ranting after investing time I can't get back in yet another “Harry must be told what to think but we're pretending he's growing more independent” story.


** The answer is easy:

The over passive canon Harry, who willingly went to his own execution (instead going out in a blaze of glory like the 300), certainly gave enough people the impression that he had a doormat type personality. Those who hate this passive canon Harry often overcompensate in the other extreme.

*** I can see that. We're expected to believe Harry is self-reliant because he learned early to not count on adults, but at the same time that he would just roll over and play dead because Dumbledore said so.

*** Not to mention that he often didn't have the answers at all. He was very good at pulling through in a pinch, but he wasn't the guy you wanted to listen to when planning something.

**** Lol. Very true. This is where yet another pet peeve of mine is born... the “Harry is an utter imbecile” story. For a supposedly educated 17 year old, canon Harry isn't terribly good with critical thinking or deductive reasoning. On the other hand....neither are a number of survivors of public education. But that's another post...

** Canon Harry is fairly passive. He is there to step in when duty calls, but he does rarely take the initiative (eg he could have simply stunned Malfoy to check his arm for the Dark Mark). He is shown to have a high tolerance for BS (whenever the public opinion is against him and with Umbridge as well).

So even if you have a canon divergence, it will take time for Harry to get rid of that. And most personality changes are gradual, so unless Umbridge pushes him over the edge, he won't be whipping out Crucios as if her name was Carrow. But if you are trying to write that gradual change, it will not be fast enough for most readers' liking.

Yet at the same time, he is functional almost the whole series. He might need the occasional shove from Hermione to get his arse up, but Harry is fairly independent and is tenacious once invested into something (look at the DA or the Horcrux Hunt).

If you are talking about the bedroom, I definitely see Harry as submissive. To me, it looks like Harry would have the weight of the world on his shoulders even after Hogwarts and he would need someone who would just take charge for once in a while, make him temporarily forget about all the shitty parts of the magical world.

We are NOT talking about chastity cages and floggings here, but the kind of power dynamic you rarely see in fanfics because it is too "vanilla" for most authors into D/s.
