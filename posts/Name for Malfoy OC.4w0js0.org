I've had a bit of trouble coming up with a name for a Malfoy OC. It's going to be a girl, and I've got a few names from constellations and stars, like the Blacks and Draco have. If you guys could tell me what you think of the names, and whether you have others to suggest, I'd be grateful. These are the names I've got so far.

Ara Alya Aquila Lyra


** I would actually give her an old Roman or Greek names to make it seem like Lucious picks out names too.

You could choose a goddesses name and depending upon your oc's personality make it match that goddess. JKR always gave names that meant something, so make it more than just a name.

** I like Aquila and Lyra, although perhaps the second will always be reminiscent of the His Dark Materials trilogy? A lot of people won't mind, but it might throw off some people.

I'd also consider looking at some Ancient Greek / Roman names, as a majority of the Malfoys had names in this vein (Lucius, Abraxas, Septimus, etc).

*** I agree! Narcissa obviously named Draco, if this Malfoy is a cousin she would not have a Black themed name. Even if this Malfoy is Draco's little sister, I would think that Lucius would want one of the children to follow his family's naming traditions.

** Take a look at her backstory. Was she raped? Lucretia. Was she kidnapped? Persephone. Does she betray a hero? Delilah. And so on.

** Saw a Vega Malfoy once. Funny bc Vega is the principal star in the Lyra constellation.

Some good names IMO: Regina, Agape, Agatha, Damaris, Astrid, Rhea and Seren.

** Well, you could have it from the Malfoy naming pool instead of constellations like naming her after after famous roman or greek women like Porcia or Livia. Or you could name her after a god, such as Enyo or Circe

** thanks everybody for your responses. I've been looking for a few mythological names, but I haven't yet decided. If I ever write my fic, I'll be sure to post a link on this subreddit.

** I've had it in my head for a while now that there should be twin daughters born in the next generation of the Black family named Atria and Talitha.

**** It's fan fiction. They could be daughters to Sirius or Regulus if you kept them alive or Harry if you wanted to make him Lord Black as is commonly done.
