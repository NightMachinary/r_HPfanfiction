** You've probably already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] but if you haven't it's Harry becoming obsessed with resurrecting his younger sister and addicted to dark magic (in this AU it functions like a drug). No real romance.

It's nowhere near the number of words you're requesting but I'm gonna suggest it anyway given how unusual it is and how perfectly it fits the whole fuck the consequences, /I want power/ part of your request. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118965/1/][Always Read the Fine Print]].

This Harry is desperate for power, but not in a selfish sense. He's more about self-sacrifice rather than sacrificing others.

** linkffn(7718942) he was trained in the ways of the Sith, even when he's trying to be "good" power is something he always craves since that is the Nature of the Sith

Edit: Shit sorry man it's late didn't see that you didn't want Romance...this has a weird romantic relationship between Hermione and Luna with all of them eventually turning to the Dark Side

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
