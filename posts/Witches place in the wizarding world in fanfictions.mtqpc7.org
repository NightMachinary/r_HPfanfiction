So i read my fair share of Harry Potter fanfictions in the last 2 years, and it always annoyed me how some authors chose to make the wizarding world more patriarchal than it seemed in Canon.

I mean, in Canon women seem to be well respected in my opinion. From Madam Bones the head of the DMLE, Minerva who was deputy head mistress and then became head mistress, the Hogwarts staff had a lot of capable witches, Tonks was an auror, Bathelda Bagshots was a well known author, Rita skeeter a journalist, Umbridge although I hate her had a good job. And then in Fantastic beasts (part of the HP universe) Leta Lestrange from a pureblood family (we see the Lestranges in HP) was working in the DMLE. I also looked on wiki and found that the first female minister of magic was in 1798 !!! I MEAN WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT ( and a lot of witches came after her, some from pureblood families like the flints )

So I'm curious to know why in fanfictions authors be like : Pureblood witches are raised to marry well and manage the household.

The wizarding world has a lot of flaws in my opinion but never once in Canon I remembered that it viewed women like that, so why do it in fanfictions ?

Edit : I can't believe I forgot about Helga hufflepuff and Rowena Ravenclaw.

Edit 2 : Even Voldemort seemed not to care since his most loyal follower was a woman : Bellatrix Lestrange.

Because instead of viewing the magical world as it's own with different customs, laws, bigotries, and prejudices, many see it as something stuck in the regency era. So Daphne Greengrass must always be in want of a husband in possession of a great fortune.

*** I always had a problem with the so called "pureblood customs" and "nobility" in fanfictions. It makes no sense in my opinion since most of them are just like in normal books from past centuries. The whole HP kept emphasising on how the wizarding world was so much different than the muggle world. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. So copy pasting customs just makes it boring in my opinion.

This fucking shit. I'm so tired of people saying things like "The Magical world is like the Victorian Era so . . .". That is not the case, the Magical world has its own culture which, despite some similarities with the Muggle world, is different.

They may seem behind on some issues (House Elves count as slavery I guess), but they are miles ahead on others, as an example racism seem to be inexistant in the magical world, and they seem to either have reached gender equality or are very close to it.

**** I mean, the magical world is quite bigoted though. Blood purity is the obvious one, as is the overt discrimination towards people like half-giants or werewolves.

I would classify those as racism - it's not based on color like we currently view racism today, but the discrimination towards those groups definitely seems to fit in the definition of racism.

Gender equality is not really certain in the WW either - there's indications towards it being the case, and other indications against it. Traditional gender norms seem to be quite alive and kicking in the WW, for instance - which is hard to square with the argument that they've been fully equal for centuries, as some indicate. I think a good chunk of that is how JKR wrote up the world (basing it off of contemporary british society before applying her changes), but it's got some major issues.

***** It is a fact that the Magical World (or at least a part of it) is bigoted, and the descrimination against "beings" and "part-human" probably fit more the terme racism that what we use it for.

But my point was that the Magical World ist not some cheap copie of the Victorian Era, with exactly the same societal problem, but a different society with its own problems.

We see absolutely no indication that people in the Magical World are judged by their races (or rather skin colour). The "worst" thing in Canon is Pansy Parkinsons mocking Angelina Johnson dreadlocks before a Quidditch match (that I would personally not count as racism, mainly because I don't think dreadlocks is a "black only" hairstyle but whatever).

Concerning the "traditional gender norms being alive and kicking in the Magical world", can I ask where you see it? I mean, Molly Weasley does fit the role of the "stay at home housewife", but even if you ignore her BAMF moment in DH, she is pretty much the only character that really fit it. We see loads of powerfull women in Canon, and all of them seem to be the equals of men:

- Nymphadora Tonks is an Auror (highly respected position), which even managed to get a relation on the side. And most of the problems she had seemed to be due to Remus Lycantropie rather than the fact she is a woman.
- Mc Gonnagall is the Deputy Headmaster (and later Headmistress) of Hogwarts. It is true that she has no family life, but Pottermore tell us that she is widowed, not to mention I don't think any Hogwarts teacher really have a home life (they do live in the castle most of the year after all).
- Umbridge is the Undersecretary of the Minister, but the fact she is single is because no man is desesparate enough to marry her (especially considering her selection criterias) rather than her being forced to sacrifice her family life for her career.
- We don't know anything about Amelia Bones oustide of the fact she lost of lot of family members during the war, and is the aunt of Susan. For all we know, she could habe been married, divorced or widowed.
- Narcissa Malfoy doesn't work, but I don't think Lucius does either (unless bribing the Minister count as a job?).

In the end, the closest thing to classic Misogyny I can remember in Canon is Ron making some remarks about Ginny having several boyfriends, and she shutted him down really quickly.

​

I'm not saying the Magical World has no issues, or even that he completely dealt with the one mentioned. It's just that, as some other people said before, I'm really tired of some fanfics making it a magical copie of Pride and Prejudice where woman are just some doll supposed to smile and be pretty in front of the men, and where, starting 13, they only dream about finding a rich and powerfull husband.

****** I don't think we fully disagree, by any means.

For racism, I'd say that we don't really know how the WW fares for the 'muggle' racial divisions - we're fairly limited to only western Europe, and just a few token characters of other ethnicities that pop up in the narrative. Which makes it hard to know how tolerant they are of skin color or other parts of the globe on the whole, since it just doesn't appear (which I think we can read into it whichever direction we want, when worldbuilding.)

However, the discrimination towards muggleborn and other magical beings does fall into racism as well - the muggleborn one most closely resembling modern (common) views on racism.

For gender roles, Molly Weasley is an obvious example like you mention - she's clearly a competent witch (as she shows off in her duel with Bellatrix), but she ends up a stay at home mom and very much in a traditional gender role. Fleur is another easy example - she's also a very competent witch (had to be, to be a champion), ambitious (again - clearly from the tournament, as well as her deciding to move to another country to learn more. And then, again, seems to just end up as a housewife. This is also the way it seems to fit for the Death Eater wives, outside of Bellatrix - all the major actors there are men, and there's the implication (at least, from what I see) that the women tend to be more like Narcissa in those areas, following the lead of the husbands.

In terms of positions of authority, the women in the series who hold them are always in secondary positions of authority - eg McGonagall is deputy headmistress, not headmistress - Bones is head of the DMLE, not minister of magic. Etc, etc. That could be argued that it's just when we popped in, that men just happened to be in charge more, but it is notable.

In the end, I think that the gender relations in the WW - in canon - are just basically the same as what we have in real life. And that JKR didn't really think too much about how it'd be different in the WW, and that if we're worldbuilding a more complex version of the WW/diverging it more from our own culture, then we can take it either way with justification.

** I suspect it might also be partly because how Molly Weasley is a stay-at-home mother despite the family struggling financially, but honestly that can be explained away rather easily.

The Weasley family has a LOT of children and someone needs to stay at home and raise them. I certainly wouldn't trust Fred and George to help raise two kids while they were young.

*** I like the idea that "poverty" is something remarkably different in wizard society than in ours. They clearly feed their children, they have a giant house and a lot of land. What they lack are luxury goods - designer clothes, wands, new books, etc, which can't simply be conjured or made yourself.

And perhaps the Weasleys simply decided that they'd prefer one parent always be at home with the children, even if they would need to be frugal with their cash. Could even be that Molly became that parent simply because her prior job was the less well-paying one - Arthur is a high-ranking government official.

** Only general behavior of pure blood witches in my series is that they wear hats when they leave their houses as a status thing. “No self respecting Witch leaves the house without a hat in traveling to places she's known,” which might seem ridiculous to some people but I just love hats and Miss how they were a style thing till about the 50's/60's I love that the Wizarding world could hang onto that. Plus I love writing more about witches as we don't get that many fleshed out ones in the series that aren't props for the males around them.

** A lot of it stems from trying to reason out how the Wizarding World could be fleshed out. In our world, there's been a /lot/ of social changes over the centuries (that's something that's always changing, of course) - but a markedly large amount of it in, say, the last 250-300 years (to use the Enlightenment/French Revolution time period as a convenient marker). That sits notably /after/ the Statute of Secrecy - when the Wizarding World is most obviously diverging from the muggle world.

Adding to that, wizards live a long time - which could be thought of as slowing down social change, since the generations are going to be more spread out over time, and old timey social mores will be around for longer.

This thought process leads to a very different place than canon, obviously (even if part of it ends up operating off of nuggets of information from canon - eg, noble houses drawing from the Blacks and the Malfoys, even if the extent of them in society obviously seems small in canon) - but I think canon didn't particularly care about that. Instead, it operated by taking current day society and adding that layer of imagination/magic/silliness on top, and that was the magical world. Not something that was worldbuilt by thinking about how it evolved/changed, and not something that was conceptualized as one big united thing (instead of pieced together as needed).

For the status of women, it then draws from that. If the WW is going to diverge from the muggle society at the time it does, well - that seems like an obvious shift in how gender relations would be than how we'd see them in the modern day. If noble houses are important in the worldbuilding of the WW, that also makes it more patriarchal - the way it seems to work in canon (eg, the Blacks) is that it's going through the male line, with women marrying and joining other families.

We could also argue the opposite, obviously, for why women should be equal in the WW (eg, magic not needing physical strength).

Also, I think it's important to note that canon is not completely equal. Women are in positions of power, of course - but they're basically always subordinates to men (eg - McGonagall is /deputy/ headmistress, Amelia Bones is not the minister, Helga Hufflepuff and Rowena Ravenclaw take 2nd stage to Griffyndor and Slytherin in the narrative, etc). The history of the world doesn't always fit that - but what we directly see in canon does. There's also very traditional gender roles that exist - Molly Weasley being a prominent example, as a stay at home housewife (despite being, as we see when she duels Bellatrix, quite skilled magically herself). Or Fleur, who's initially presented as a capable, ambitious witch (she has to be, to even be in the Tournament) - but seems to end up as just a housewife.

So it's a mix of things in my view, that leads to how fanfiction treats it. Huh, that got a lot longer than I thought it would be...

** I think its absolutely nuts to think the wizarding world wouldn't be incredibly equal opportunity. If everyone is always carrying around a potentially lethal weapon, physical strength has very little use.

That said, there would definitely be social expectations different between men and women, and bearing lots of children is definitely not one in cannon.(Malfoys, Greengrass, Boyle, Crabbe all only have 1 or 2 children) Acting proper and lady like might definitely be a thing though.

*** Yes, I think this is the better argument for an equalitarian society. Wands imply no work division which means witches are equally valuable in wizarding society.

Another one is that women liberation had a lot to do with contraception and I find hard to believe there is no magical contraceptive.

On the other hand while a lot of children doesn't seem to be truly important the continuation of the blood line for pureblood families definitely is.

*** And even this "catching up" is likely still /really/ backwards - if women have been liberated since the 16th century or more, then equality has been established for hundreds and hundreds of years. Our current society still has lots of discriminatory aspects, from doctors not taking women seriously, female politicians being derided for their bodies and called by their first name, academic titles being ignored in favor of marital ones, etc etc.

If wizard society has been equalized for centuries, these things would not exist there. Hell, gender roles as a whole would be a LOT less prevalent - you'd definitely see men taking an equal role in childrearing (Lucius Malfoy could maybe be used as an example here, based on how much Draco idolizes him), and there'd be a lot less toxic masculinity.

A muggleborn coming into this society would be like an 18th century chauvinist coming into ours. Incredibly sexist, racist and bigoted - if not outright, then subconsciously.

  You're right, and I always thought that there's a huge missed opportunity here to portray a culture clash between purebloods and muggleborns. Wizarding society has clearly been relatively egalitarian for hundreds of years, even at times when among muggles, wives would have been the legal property of their husbands.
#+end_quote

I don't know about that - discrimination and racism in the setting is apparent (blood purity and racism towards muggleborn is a huge factor in the main series, and racism/discrimination towards other magical beings - eg, half-giants and werewolves - is also rampant).

If we're restricting it to gender equality, I also don't see the WW looking like there's certainty of being enlightened for centuries - the gender roles we see in the series appear quite close to contemporary western society, and that doesn't strike me as reasonable if we assume that they've been egalitarian for centuries. Women also seem to take a backseat in the death eaters on the whole (with the obvious exception of Bellatrix) - and with how the series characterizes it, I would expect their ideology to have been more prevalent/rampant in the past.

I think your view of the WW would be an interesting one to examine/have in place, certainly.

*** This has been my view of it. While it may not be the same level as the Muggle World, I still believe sexism exists in the magical world.

Additionally, I believe that it's MORE likely that homophobia exists, purely due to Pureblood tradition. It depends on when the story is set on how rampant homophobia is.\\
Also, I'd expect Wizarding America to be more homophobic, purely because the USA has a ton of religious folk. Not sure how that crosses into the magical world (religion) but if you're writing a fic set in America, it's something you'll eventually have to deal with.

*** “In CoS, it's stated that the Slytherin team has no girls on it”

This really is not sexism. I attended an all-boys school, but my nephew has a mostly male sports team. That is one team out of three without a girl on it. There was no information stating that girls were banned from it, simply that none were on it.

“In GoF, after Ron is embarrassed for asking out Fleur, Harry talks about how she must have been turning up her veela charms for Cedric and Ron just got a blast of it”

I mean, she was a Veela, a creature that made most men drool over them due to their beauty. Ties into your next point, seeing as it took Ron supposedly four years to realise that Hermione is a girl. Harry was just giving him a confidence boost, not downplaying gender.

“In GoF, once Ron discovers Hermione is a girl, he immediately starts treating her like she's his and Harry's property”

What!? Did we read the same book?

“In GoF, Rita Skeeter's first line of attack against Hermione after she insults her is to imply that she is a clout chaser who is possibly love potioning Harry and Viktor”

How is this a sexism claim when it was a woman who accused another woman? You pretty much said it yourself, honestly. It was an attack. It was meant to discredit Hermione as a whole. It was petty journalism that sells well.

“It's also stated that lots of housewives believed the article, which implies that it's commen for women to stay at home while their husband works”

Does not make it true. Half of the articles were lies, why would you believe this part? Either way, ‘lots' could be an exaggeration or it could be true. In journalism, lots could mean two people.

“In GoF, Ron states that Molly calls girls who go from boyfriend to boyfriend scarlet women”

And while I do not want to get in a heated debate, this was pretty much said commonly. Could be a generation thing, in fact, I expect it is, but I still hear it said in this day and age. Not scarlet women, simply whore. Whore is a term that applies to both genders, though. “In OotP, it's stated that Ginny was not allowed to play with her brothers”

Again, not sexism. Boys are known to be rough. Add in six of them with two of them being rowdy twins and you get your answer. Yes, it is a shame, but it is far from sexism. Whenever my nephews play with a girl, we tell them to tone it down as they may get a bit rough without meaning to.

“In OotP, Ron and the twins are worried about Molly for crying every time Percy is mentioned, but nobody was worried about Arthur”

Because men must be emotionless and perfectly stoic without any display of emotion. This is drilled into our heads during childhood, teenage, and young adult. If we cry, we are a disgrace to men. I agree that this is sexism, but it is not to females, it is to men.

“In HBP, Ron almost calls Ginny a whore and attacks her just because he caught her kissing someone in private. Funnily enough, nobody calls him a whore for kissing someone in public”

Big brother, even if it is by a year, defending little sister. A common trope and I am sure Ron even says something similar.

“In HBP, Harry never really considers Ginny's feelings and only angsts about how Ron would react if they got together. It was almost as if Harry never even entertained the idea that Ginny might have gotten over her crush by then”

Harry is a teenager, not some guru on love. Before Ginny, he had never really dated someone, no? You cannot expect him for being clueless. Not sexism. It is inexperience.

“In HBP, Harry feels extremely sorry for Ron when he's trying to escape Lavender, the girl he used for months, but when Hermione's trying to escape Cormac, the boy she "used" for a few hours, he severely tells her that it servers her right”

Not sure how I feel about this one, really. That entire situation was both realistic and cringe. I removed it from my mind.

“In DH, Hermione's the one who is expected to do the cooking”

How is this sexism? Hermione is probably the best cook there due to her Muggle upbringing. Ron had Molly to cook. Harry probably hates cooking due to his childhood. How is cooking sexism?

“There are more than triple men with good jobs than women with good jobs”

That we see. The story is from the point of view of Harry, an extremely biased character.

“Basically all of the major players in the series (the Ministers, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Harry, etc.) are men, and almost all of the respected women in the series, including the ones you listed, are their subordinates”

Above, but you are wrong. There were an insane amount of female Ministers, Hogwarts faculty (McGonagall, Sprout, Poppy, Pince, Hooch, Trelawney, Vector, and probably more I missed.

“Less than a third of the Order is female”

Again, not sexism. Look at military and army statistics. Even when asked to fight, a lot of women turned it down.

“There are only two female Death Eaters, one being part of a package deal, and the other being the literal best of the best”

Read above.

“It was stated that Bellatrix Lestrange only married Rodolphus because a good pureblood marriage was what was "expected for her"”

This could be taken in many ways. It was expected the same way a man had to find a wife to marry for children. He had money, a good strong family, and all that other jazz they look for when finding spouses and connections.

“There are almost no married women who work, while there are married men who work”

That we see. Fleur worked. Tonks worked. Female professors worked. Minister for Magic worked. We see so little that the thing we do see are all skedded by the fact all the women are mainly rich or have children.

The bigger point is that the story was written and set in the nineties. Expecting current day levels of acceptance and standards is awful practice. I am honestly surprised there is not more homophobia in fics. Instead, it is widely accepted (for some odd reason) despite the fact society as a whole would be against it due to time period and a small society focused on lineage.

** There's at least some sexism in canon. Hogwarts lets girls into boys' dorms, but not boys into girls' dorms. I interpret this to mean that they have at least some concern about protecting girls' chastity from being spoiled by boys. This ties into their blood purity obsession, that purebloods wouldn't want muggleborns contaminating “their” women.

The insults directed at women support this. Girls and women are called some variant of “slut” as an insult, while boys aren't. There seems to be the general idea in the magical world (as well as ours) that women's sexuality is the property of others, not their own personal property. Hogwarts guards parents' property (i.e. their daughters' sexuality) for them while they're school, presumably like the parents guard it while they're at home. Boys are in charge of their own sexuality so they don't need Hogwarts to guard it for them.
