Anyone know of any stories where the four House champions become close during the prep for the TriWizard? Maybe the schools offer special study time in the library just for them, and they begin to study together. So Harry, Fleur, Cedric and Viktor become friends. Maybe Hermione/Ron also join, maybe new students from BB or DS too.

Harry is so isolated during GoF - having this group of diverse friends might change things.


** Well, technically, in “Oh God Not Again” which I believe is by Sarah1281, this does happen when you get to fourth year, but it's not the focus of the story. As far as I know bot is still down and I'm on mobile but if you search that title on ffn it should pop up. Time travel humour story, not quite a crack!fic.

I think this story features a friendship between Fleur and Viktor. I cannot really remember how big of a part it plays though to be honest. Hopefully it is similar to what you are looking for.

The story is honest about what it is, and is fairly enjoyable.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
