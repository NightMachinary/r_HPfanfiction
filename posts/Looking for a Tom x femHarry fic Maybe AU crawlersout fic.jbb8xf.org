:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys, So I am actually looking for two fics, I would be really grateful if anyone can help me with this or point me in a general direction to look for them. It has been driving me up the wall trying to remember the names and other details. I'm pretty sure these are both au fics of crawlersout but I could be mixing up stories.

Fic 1: Tom confessed his feelings for Harry but she rejectshim so he leaves to go travel and he sends letters but doesnt come home then shows up at her house one day and Harry and Spot greet him at the door and he asks Harry to give him a chance to prove he can love her.

Fic 2: Tom follows Harry to the canon dimension and confronts Harry on the time travel. Tom is older in this fic; I read one where he is younger and goes through, but hey anything at all might help tigger something.

Thank you!!


** this fic isn't either of those but its a good tomxfem!harry fic
