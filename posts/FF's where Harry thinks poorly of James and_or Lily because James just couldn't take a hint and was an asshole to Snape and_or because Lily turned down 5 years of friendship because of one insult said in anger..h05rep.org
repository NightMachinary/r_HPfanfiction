With James, it could even be the case of Harry so disgusted by him changes his name into Harry Evans. Harry could also call out Sirius and Remus and say he would not talk to them till they apologised to Snape.

So, I want some James bashing. And a bit Sirius and Remus bashing

Edit: took out Lily because I got new information about why she broke up her friendship with Snape. But James still stands.
