**** Thanks, sometimes it's hard to find a fic with just the title and not the author.

To use the bot, you can't have a space between the title and the bracket.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off.
