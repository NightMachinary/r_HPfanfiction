There's the time that he blew up a street and cut off a finger, and the time that he scattered some blood and fur around to imply he was eaten as Scabbers, but what about, say, the time he took a curse and used a Blinding Bloodbath Bomb to make it look like he was exploded into a million pieces? Or the time he creatively used a Jellification Charm and his animagus form to pull a Wicked Witch of the West? Or the time he actually left a body, except it was an Imperiused & Polyjuiced doppelganger? Or the time with the animated skeleton on fire?\\
 \\
Whatever the method may be, Peter Pettigrew aka Wormtail is very very good at faking his death. He might even have convincingly 'strangled' himself with that silver hand.\\
So, prompt! Come up with a scene, maybe Sirius kills Peter for his betrayal, or Harry kills him in battle, or maybe it's during the first war and Peter's fighting Death Eaters, or he's caught and is killed trying to escape, but in any case, Peter dies...except not. Possibly returning for revenge.\\
 \\
Or you could have fun coming up with more ways for Pettigrew to fake his death. A portable hole, a ten ton weight and a bucket of pigs blood, anyone?


** Everyone knows about the line, circle, and the triangle. But what they don't think about is the shape of the gravestone they're carved on. The gravestone is the fourth hollow. Passed down the Pettigrew line for generations.

After visiting the first and second brothers, Death visited the fourth brother. And the fourth brother swiftly died, and Death went in search of the third brother. And the fourth brother was seen at a cafe in in the New World, but when Death showed up to claim him, the fourth brother died. And the fourth brother was painted in the background of a street sketch, but when Death made it to the fair, the fourth brother had already been killed by a rogue horse.

*** Plot twist: the gravestone never had to be passed down because Peter is actually still the very same fourth brother, still faking his death centuries later.

*** The gravestone sounds like an artifact in the Ghostbusters Video Game;

"The Reappearing Gravestone" c. 1487

'This seemingly unassuming chunk of rock, repurposed as a gravestone, holds a not so much malevolent spirit, but an annoying spectre; Horatio Pettigrew, the Ghost Who Just Won't Die. Spotted many a time over the years, any attempt to exorcise, or otherwise capture this particular spook leaves only this gravestone behind, and even then, it too disappears after a period of time, coinciding with Mr. Pettigrew's appearance somewhere else. It has been noted that his reappearances occur from as little to a few hours after, to as long as a month.'

*** Huh, that's an interesting take. A more dramatic one than I was expecting too.\\
 \\
I'm imagining now, four Deathly Hallows (Four is Death is a trope, after all), the scepter, orb, mantle and crown, with the Elder Wand, Resurrection Stone and Invisibility Cloak being the first three of those respectively.\\
The Elder Wand has the power to impose death on others, the Stone has the power to recall others from death, the Cloak allows its wearer to keep away from death, so perhaps the whatever the crown is forces death to keep away in turn.\\
...Or, I dunno, something to give free passage between the realms of life and death. The paddle belonging to the ferryman of the Styx or something.

** Rorschach's Blot wrote something where Peter extends his prowess to other people. Peter fakes the deaths of James, Lily, and Harry but the Harry simulacrum takes on a life of it's own. Sirius tracks down Peter and finds out all of this.
