I'm toying with a story idea, and part of the worldbuilding behind it is that outside of Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic ownership of House Elves is extremely rare; due to the prohibitave costs of purchasing one, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of House Elves had been bequeethed to either Hogwarts or the Ministry upon the death of their masters throughout the centuries. So the idea is that, outside of the Malfoys (who flaunt their wealth through spending obnoxious amounts of it), the Blacks (who never gave up their Elves because of long-held attitudes of bigotry and racial superiority), and the Crouches (I'm undecided on why they kept their elf, but I'm leaning towards a less extreme version of the Black's reason); pretty much the rest of the upper crust of British Wizarding society hires humans (almost exclusively Muggleborns) to work as maids, butlers, and other such jobs. Thoughts?


** Could definitely work, but I feel like a lot of pure blood families consider Mudbloods to be ‘dirty' so they wouldn't want them contaminating their house. Perhaps it could be an ‘old money vs new money' difference?

*** Old money vs new money wouldn't really work for me, because I'm going with the interpretation that the Malfoys are new money of the worst sort. Also, I'm going with the idea that the fortunes of most of the openly bigoted pureblood families have waned to greater or lesser degrees, and they blame their misfortunes (no matter the truth of the matter) on the Muggleborns.

**** I can't see any Muggleborns working for really racist families who treat them badly though- even if that's the only job available to them, you'd have to come up with a really good reason as to why they wouldn't just return to the Muggle world rather than put up with serving a family that hates them.

The way I see it, the only people who would employ Muggleborns are relatively progressive yet rich families, which we don't see a lot of in canon but you could make them up I guess.

Magic :P

There are many, many hoops through which I'd jump if only it meant I wouldn't have to give up magic. I suppose there would be some Muggleborns who return the Muggle world. I can't see that being the case for most of them, regardless of how they are treated. They are magical. This is /their/ world. Can you easily give up a part of who you are?

Anyway, there isn't much of a difference between working a shitty job as a waiter getting ordered around by snobby purebloods, or working for the snobby purebloods to begin with, I'd think. Presumably, they'd be live-in servants too, so they'd get a place to stay on top of it. Perhaps that's a great perk in this AU, because magical living space is rare i.e. expensive (and the Ministry doesn't allow buying new houses in Muggle areas).

****** Why would you give up magic if you moved to the muggle world? You can get a muggle job - magic can help a lot there - and live in your flat with magic just fine. You wouldn't have to abandon the wizarding world, either, just for living and working in the muggle world.

... this is the definition of breaking the statute. Since this is the raison d'être for the Ministry, they will have ways to prevent that. And since OP asked for "reasons", it's also perfectly possible to make e.g. being forced to hand in your wand up.

 

At any rate, "magic" is more than just waving a wand and making things happen. The Muggle world must feel dull and uninteresting once you've lived on the other side for seven years, a pale shadow of what you know is real. How could you go through a day in an office, sitting in an utterly sterile room, listening to utterly ignorant people, being utterly unable to be who you really are?

The thought alone is less appealing than bashing your head in (or conversely, getting insulted by purebloods). Before it got /that/ far, I'd construct a hut somewhere in the middle of nowhere and learned how to magically grow my own food if that was what it took.

******** No, magic in public is breaking the statute. What you do without muggle witnesses is completely OK.

Also, most of the jobs we actually see in canon are pretty much muggle jobs. Clerks, sales people, bureaucrats... Not to mention that as a maid or butler, you can't be yourself either. For some, that's OK, for others, the job and the hours would be far worse than going without casting a spell for nine hours a day, but otherwise be free to do what you want and live how you want.

They don't, as point of fact. The really racist families are either one of the few that have kept their House Elves, or they're too poor and/or too proud to have Muggleborn servents.

It is not supported by canon. Malfoys descend from court mages of Norman dynasty, arriving to Britain with William the Conqueror. They resented loss of elevated special status that was caused by establishment of Status of Secrecy and thus heavily invested in early anti-muggle sentiment.

My thoughts are that I'm honestly shocked people like Malfoy own elves at all. I wouldn't think anyone with that sort of attitude would want dirty half-naked nonhumans skittering around the house touching all the food and clothes.

Human servants, muggle servants even, make far more sense.

Then again, Rowling clearly does not understand racism or prejudice, and you cannot write well what you do not understand. I feel as though this is why she never really bothered to explain the pureblood political agenda, beyond clownish nonsense like "muggles steal magic gotta stop 'em" and other double-plus-ungood nonsense.

We never saw Voldemort be persuasive and charismatic, because Rowling couldn't actually imagine how he could ever persuade anyone to believe in those things. So we just got a Scooby Doo villain. All the clever persuading and political debates happened off-screen and in the past.

Other than the half-naked part, I'm pretty sure that's basically how slave owners in the real world saw their slaves, and they still had them making food and everything else.

**** Then you know about as much about it as Rowling does, which is not much.

Slave ownership was rare, and a slave was property. What kind of person takes a saw to their bed, or beats their horse? Slaves were rarely abused, not in the sensationalized way you're attempting to imply.

It's a stupid farmer that injures his own horse, steer, or cow. They're an investment, they preform work. Malfoy kicking Dobby is as hilarious and unrealistic in the books as slave owners doing it to their slaves in Hollywood movies is. That's not history. That's sensationalism and politicization.

Furthermore, there was a vast and immense difference between a house slave and a field slave. Which is something else you don't really seem to understand. There's a difference between a slave that exists to perform heavy labor, and a slave that exists to serve complex personal services. A house slave would have been given an education, they would be able to read and write, they would be taught enough about business and finance that they could stand as a proxy for their master if they needed to attend to a business transaction for them. They would have been taught manners. House slaves were also often indentured by contract. Most of them became slaves voluntarily in order to pay off a debt, which the household that takes them on would then assume. Skilled slaves have been doing that since the days of Classical Greece, and even before. It's mentioned in the Old Testament of the bible: masters be kind to your slaves, and slaves be loyal to your masters.

Additionally, no wealthy colonial-era household would ever employ a slave to do the cooking. They would hire someone to do it.

So no, I disagree. Malfoy's evil is as cartoonish and unrealistic as Voldemort's is. Unless a slave had committed some truly serious crime, such as rape, assault, or murder, you would never beat the people who do the work around the house, if for no other reason than because you're losing money and damaging your own investment when you do it.

Likewise, even if wizarding culture accepted the usage of house elves in a wealthy wizarding family, they would be prim and clean little butlers with proper manners and no speech impediment. They would be house slaves, in other words.

Malfoy sensationally beats and abuses a house servant that acts like a field slave, because you're supposed to hate him and deeply pity Dobby. It's not a master-servant relationship that would actually exist, because anyone clever enough to talk his way out of Azkaban after being caught red-handed with a Dark Mark on his arm wouldn't be stupid enough to grievously injure the same creatures that prepare all of his food.

Lucius Malfoy hasn't squandered his fortune, which means he understands how to run a proper household in upper class society. Lucius Malfoy also isn't in Azkaban, which means he's clever and motivated by deep and intense self-interest. That means, by definition, his treatment of Dobby (and presumably all other house elves) is absurd. It's Snidely Whiplash tying random girls to train tracks levels of villainy.

So you agree that slave owners saw their slaves as subhuman, which is all I said in my comment.

#+end_quote

I implied no such thing. You're the one who brought all this extra irrelevant talk of slavery and abuse into the mix.

But against my better judgement, I'll bite. Regardless of what did or didn't happen to real slaves, house elves have magic, and abusing them does not appear to have any affect on their ability to use that magic to serve. Plus, they could probably use that magic to heal themselves to some extent.

So while beating a house elf is definitely evil, perhaps even to a cartoonish extent, it's not unrealistic or particularly stupid.

****** Bold of you claim I fail basic reading comprehension, when you've forgotten what the entire discussion was even about. Maybe you should reread my post again.

You claimed that Lucius Malfoy having elves work indoors and mistreating them is "basically real life." I proved otherwise. Additionally, you're even more wrong, because most house servants would have been indentured Irish, an entirely different race from African, or free hired men and women who were paid a wage, for exactly the same reasoning I used for Lucius: he wouldn't want dirty nonhuman elves skittering around touching all the food and clothes if he was actually racist (or speciest, whatever), so logically he would have other servants or slaves deal with that instead. Maybe a squib or a wizard, or perhaps even an enchanted suit of armor. But not an elf.

And then you went off on this tangent of trying to insist that it makes sense for Malfoy to grievously injure and torture the people who make his food because magic can heal injures. Which isn't a discussion anybody was even trying to have.

Malfoy wouldn't logically have house elves working indoors, and they wouldn't be touching the food or clothes even if they did. You're so obsessed with trying to prove that it's rational to beat them that you don't even remember what's being talked about.

Don't blame me if you forget your own points.

Humans have some weaknesses as servants that House Elves don't (mainly that, given the Imperius is Unforgivable, I can't imagine you'd legally be able to have as much control over a human servant), and a sort of magical android wouldn't need breaks or anything, plus could be more easily customized and such.

Like obviously if you have plans that require maids, butlers, and other such, and this is a Downton Abbey type fic I get it, just that when I read the title my first thought was 'magical robots'
