  Dudley smirked, "See? Only I'm allowed to bully you, Freak."
#+end_quote

Harry paused for a long moment. He took a breath in and looked Dudley square in the eyes. Where before he'd seen a small-minded piggy ignorance, he now saw something... else. Something bigger. Stronger.

He saw... possessiveness. He saw the anger of the alpha dog, defending his /sole/ right to abuse the omega. He saw a sick, twisted version of the possessiveness that marked his godfather. He saw, in a perverted, jealous way... he saw...

... love.

He opened his mouth, not sure at first what would come out, and found himself starting at the end. Starting at a story of horror and betrayal and linked wands, and the death of a young wizard far better than Harry himself. He told the story backwards, in an unconscious emulation of T. H. White's Merlin, working back from the final task of the Triwizard tournament and ending on a mad dash for the Philosopher's stone. A dash that made no sense, in retrospect.

Dudley leaned against the wall, arms crossed.

He nodded at all the right points.

His piggy eyes narrowed at mentions of hippogryphs and basilisks and stones Philosopher. He asked questions, seemingly simple, superficially insulting: "why were the traps so simple /you/ could get through them?" and "how come your swotty little /girlfriend/ could figure out the snake thing but not full grown professors?" and "if this Black bloke was so rich and powerful, how come the politician didn't just lie his way into the simple solution?"

Harry couldn't answer. Of course.

Then came questions he could answer. "What all are the favorite spells of these Death folks? Howzat any diffrent than a gun? If'n we make up passwords and check-questions, why can't we beat that shape-shifting potion stuff? If you're tougher 'n heal faster 'n all, what happens if I put you in your place wi' a cricket bat? Are all freaks like that? If Piers's uncle from the hunting club sets us up with rifles, can we just pop 'em in the melon and be done with it?"

Two hours into the conversation, Harry was so wrong-footed, he couldn't even begin to plan out lies or misdirections. The words spilled forth. Angry, honest words. Words of confusion and contempt and years worth of stoppered emotion.

And Dudley kept right on nodding. After a time, the nods were accompanied by a smile. The smile grew from a mere lip-twitch to a full, feral grin that spoke of imminent violence.

"Alright, freak, here's what you're gonna do. We're gonna take a little walk down to that freak alley you mentioned. We're gonna go buy a bunch of the dresses that your kind wears, and me an' the boys are gonna go incoggy neeto. We're gonna keep an eye on the freak alley, and sooner or later the blonde ponce is gonna show up. And we're gonna see, aren't we, whether money and power protects freak poofters from a little five-five-six justice."

Harry's mouth dropped open. He nodded, not in agreement, but in unthinking reflexive response to the incomprehensible words he was hearing.

"Alright, freak, let's head downstairs. I filched Mum's keys years ago and had copies made. Let's open up your old bedroom and get that fancy invisible cloak you mentioned. That'll do us right good, it will..."

***** And it has to end (/has to end/) with Dudley accidentally becoming the Master of Death. Like instead of Harry getting into a fistfight with Draco in book 6, it's Dudley just cold-cocking the little fucker right in the temple, bouncing his head off the stone wall and killing him. And when he's playing around with the snitch that Dumbledore left Harry, he mutters something to the effect of, "well, if this is all that old poof left you, then this really is the end of it all, ain't it," and then the snitch pops open and Dudley becomes the owner of the final Hallow.

****** I want to read the story where Harry is white trash and does white trashy things. Like, mug-murdering Lucius is probably the most interesting bit I'll read tonight.

I wanna read a story that makes Harry the hot couch guy, and he never escapes it. He deals with Voldemort and he's still hot couch guy.

** Dudley slowly straightened up and stretched his back - it was rather sore after such a long day. He glanced around for a rag or a towel, but finding none, he eventually settled for wiping his bloody hands on his dirty and ruined shirt.

Only then did he look down at the broken and bleeding body at his feet.

But then again, 'body' was the wrong word. It was a corpse.

The corpse of the Dark Lord Voldemort.

Who had just been beaten to death by the bare fists of one Dudley Dursley.

He glanced to his left and took in his freaky cousin, standing there as dirty and as exhausted as he was, still holding his wand in a tightly clenched fist, his mouth hanging open in surprise.

"I don't believe it..." Harry eventually said.

"Don' believe what?" Dudley asked.

"He's really dead."

"'Course he is. I put him down meself! I /am/ the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast."

Harry just stared at him for a moment before extending his hand.

"Thanks, Dud."

Dudley reached out and grasped his cousin's hand in his own.

And then he squeezed. Hard.

"Ahhhh!" Harry cried as he tried to pry his hand loose.

"Ha! Lookit the freak!" Dudley jeered.

Harry finally freed himself from crushing grip and glared at his cousin.

"What the bloody hell was that for?!"

"Now that the Dark Wanker is gone, we can get back to business."

"What're you talking about?"

"Piers!"

"Yeah, Big D?" Piers Polkiss asked as his head popped up from behind some bushes.

"Time for some Harry Hunting!"

Harry's eyes widened in fear for a split second before he turned around and ran.

"Get the freak!"

**** Dumbledore was startled when he came across Harry hiding in a secret corridor of the castle.

"Why Harry," he said, "whatever are you doing in here? Why aren't you at the celebrations having fun, as young people are wont to do?"

"I'm hiding."

"Now Harry, I know you don't like the spotlight, but surely you can see past that and enter into the joy of Voldemort's defeat...?"

"No, I'm fine with the fame, really. I'm hiding from my cousin."

"Your cousin...?"

"He's decided to play 'Harry Hunting' again."

"Ah."

"Is there anything you can do about him, sir?" Harry asked with newfound hope shining in his eyes.

"I'm sorry, Harry," Dumbledore replied, "but I'm afraid that your cousin is simply too powerful even for me to confront. I mean, did you /see/ what he did to Tom? I didn't even know a man's jaw could bend like that..."

Harry sighed in disappointment.

"Although," Dumbledore continued, "this turn of events does have me wondering..."

"About what, sir?"

"Well... it's just... I'd always thought that 'The Power He Knows Not' was love. But now... I'm not so sure. What do you think?"

"Apparently it's the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Championship of the Southeast."
