I just read "Of Ancestry and Honor" by Ellory and was wondering if you knew of any other stories in the same vein, where James just says "fuck it" and pursues someone else.


** I've always thought James wasn't actually hitting on her (in canon) since Lily didn't even know James liked her as we see in Snape's memories. Snape was probably paying close attention to James AND Lily, that's why he figured it out.

*** We don't have any indication that James asked Lily before or after the lake incident out.

We know that at the time of the werewolf prank Lily blushed at the idea of James liking her but sees no reason to believe it.

So what we have is one really idiotic moment of asking her out and then over a year later they get together

*** Right??? It's not "cute" when someone continues to pursue you after you've said "no"; /it's a red flag./ Not to mention the emotional manipulation regarding Snape, and the inclination for violence.

James Potter is the poster child of risk-factors/warning signs for intimate partner violence.

**** Admittedly Severus has even more red flags, the greatest being his association with the Death Eaters. And using a horrible racial slur against her - wait. /Among his red flags/ are his association with the Death Eaters, calling her a horrible slur, his broken and abusive home life, and his single-minded devotion to her and only her.

I quite like linkffn(The Peace Not Promised), though, which addresses the above by sending him back at the end of canon to try again, so he's very much aware of all of his failings, and has proved his commitment and loyalty to her through long hard experience.

****** While I'm a shameless Snily fan, I'm not deluded into thinking that canon Snape (at least after 5th year where he's firmly with DE crowd) is good for her -- for it to work at all, his fate must be diverted before he's firmly in that crowd, or something else drastic -- both very unlikely events in the grand scheme of things. I love myself a good "Young Severus turns his life around and makes something good out of himself in spite of his miserable upbringing", but realistically that is not happening.

I think the objectively best partner for her, excluding OCs that is customizeable to your hearts content, is Remus, if she can get past his "I'm a werewolf and don't deserve anything good".

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

******* I didn't feel the same way. His possessiveness depends on the context, and I never found it to be /horrible/.

Specifically in relation to James Potter, yes, he's very sensitive - that's not surprising when he knows that she married James the first time around. He does actually let go of a lot of the ill feeling over time.

In dealing with Lily, I don't think possessiveness is the right word. If she told him to go away, or declared that she was leaving, his heart would break but he would absolutely let her. He is /protective/, perhaps overprotective, but even at his worst he never punishes her for breaking a promise and putting herself at risk, upset and fearful though he is. He doesn't keep her locked up in a cage, he just tries to keep her off the front lines of the war (and it isn't as though the two of them have nothing to contribute, in a more sheltered role).

He respects her agency a good deal more than Molly Weasley canonically respected Harry's, and though we may find fault with Molly's decisions, most people wouldn't go so far as to call them horrible.

********* He really doesn't restrict her that much. He tries to keep track of where she is, which in other circumstances could be misused by sometime who just wants power and control, but as they're in a war, there is a legitimate reason for concern and she does in fact get kidnapped by Death Eaters and used as bait to lure him out; he wasn't just paranoid. And he won't let her join the Order of the Phoenix, but they both contribute quite a lot to the war effort in roles other than frontline combat.

It's true that her movements and activities are somewhat restricted for security reasons later in the story, but that's not by his doing, it's because he was quite right about her danger, and after barely escaping with their lives, Dumbledore feels they'd be safer at Hogwarts, and Lily, badly shaken, is very willing to comply.

And he could definitely stand to explain himself better at times. But poor communication doesn't make his reasons invalid. Lily herself comes to realise that his fears for her are well founded.

****** James rejected Lily because she said she wouldn't consider him if he were the last wizard alive... which is some great offense apparently, even worse than everything the marauders did to Snape (but it's okay because Snape is the one who started it and James was only defending his honor). The story then goes on to describe how James' mother is disgusted with Lily's ‚Äúlack of manners‚Äù, which is somehow linked to her muggle-born status (but careful, they're not bigots! James says so)... What Lily said is apparently the worst insult ever?? And when James' parents start looking for a suitable match for their son, James only asks this girl not be older and taller...because of course.

And this is only in the first 15 lines or so. I'm baffled someone actually wrote that. I'm not even James' or Jily's biggest fan but even I think it's going too far.
