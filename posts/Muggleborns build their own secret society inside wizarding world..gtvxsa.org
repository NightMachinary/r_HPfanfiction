After being shunned by purebloods for decades, and Brushed aside even after voldemorts fall, muggleborns decide to do what all wizards did in 1692, and create their own secret society inside wizarding britain. They create their own Diagon Alley, Ministry and have scouts in Hogwarts that reach out to other muggleborns and halfbloods to invite them to their own school.

(I got inspired after reading Hermione Granger and Marriage Law Revolution by Starfox5)


** I am especially fond of the school idea. I like to think it includes some non-magical curriculum as well as magical.

And there's this one stuck-up girl at the school who's giving Elaine Creevey a hard time. "You're not really even a muggleborn are you, Creevey? Do you even know about One Direction? You're only here because your father is the Headmaster."

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12327848/1/A-Wizard-s-Guide-to-Banking][/A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking'/]] is the closest you're going to get.

Though I will admit to having an outline to a fic with such a premise, where muggle-borns have their own secret society, in my possession. I call it /the Divide/ .

** I originally planned that for my story "Divided and Entwined", but dropped the idea in the planning phase - it didn't fit, and the numbers I envisioned didn't match the needed infrastructure.
