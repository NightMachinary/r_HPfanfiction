What are your favourite short(ish) fics?

My favourite is I'll Shoot the Shot, Bang linkffn(7250343) It is very well written, focuses on Harry and Snape, very much in character, and the ending is stunning.

Another good one - I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love linkffn(11923164)

Are there any more stories this good? Especially about Snape, or Luna, but tbh anything goes. It seems much easier to find good long stories than shorter ones...


** White Squirrel has written a few short fics. linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) is one of my favourites.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks) was quite riveting. linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other by Stargon1) was humorous, and linkao3(A History of Magic by PrinceEdwin) is possibly one of the only truly good Snarry fics (even if you don't like Snarry, give it a chance -- it's not like anything else I've read)

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.
