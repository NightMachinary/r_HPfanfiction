Hi, saw there was some definite Ciri love out there in the crossover thread. This isn't much (edit- some writing I did a couple months ago), and it's fragmented, but the thought was a little piece might be better than nothing. Also forcing myself to put something out there, such as it is.

All feedback welcome. I have strong doubts I will ever finish (I have a very very hard time sorting and managing things, often breaking other scenes/pieces or simply overwhelming and paralyzing me), but I do try. I do try.


** Its not much to judge yet. I think it all really hinges on Harry's reaction to Ginny's death, which I find... rushed. Its such a whirlwind.

The next two scenes are just some scenes without context. I like the writing style, and only if I'd be nitpicky I'd say to check the speed of your writing. Its incredibly fast and jumpy. Not too bad in a fight scene - and Ciri is greatly characterised by it - but for other more descriptive scenes you may wanna slow down.

*** I think your critique is spot on. In fact in the post itself I realized I had rushed it and not made it clear that this was old writing and just the few scattered pieces I didn't think were total trash.

I didn't want to wallow in the Harry-verse, but rather get as fast to Witcher world as I could. So I guess I accomplished that much but at a cost. Thinking on it I expect the fast and jumpy might be partly my inexperience as I want everything to mean something so the natural flow is interrupted. re Ginny and the rest I will look at it again.

Thanks, and if there is anything more it is certainly welcome.

** Oh god, not another one. Why is it Witcher fics always deals with younger harry with little to no training? And an emotional one at that? I mean, I've seen this before, and I hated it. What's the point of a crossover, if Harry ends up becoming a witcher and not a wizard?

Here's my idea. What happens if BBC Sherlock Holmes becomes a wizard?

**** ... So he's not a wizard? Why? And what's the point of a crossover to begin with? I mean, if you're going to neglect the magic side of HPverse, to begin with, then what's the point?

Man, I despise these types of crossover.

***** just because you despise them (ant that's your right to despise them) means not, that others don't see the point in such fics or enjoy them.

In */most/* crossovers, you have to neglect one side. If the writer wishes, to make Harry a Witcher, that's fine, maybe that's exactly what I want to read? Maybe make Ciri a witch? (PS: I didn't write this to attack you {or anyone else} I'm sometimes just unable to express my thoughts proper, so sorry if I offended you)
