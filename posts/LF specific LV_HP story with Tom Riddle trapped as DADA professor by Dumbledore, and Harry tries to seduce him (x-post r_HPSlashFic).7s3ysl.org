I'm looking for a specific LV/HP story where Tom Riddle is somehow trapped as DADA professor by Dumbledore. He was stuck at Hogwarts and unable to quit the job, so never became Voldemort. He was also miserable in the job and tries to quit all the time.

Harry meanwhile, is really into Tom and keeps trying to seduce him. They eventually have sex in the chamber of secrets, though I'm not sure how that came about.

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!
