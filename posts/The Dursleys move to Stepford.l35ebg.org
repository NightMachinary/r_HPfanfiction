It occurred to me that, given Vernon and Petunia's rabid obsession with normalcy, they could be ripe for a crossover with The Stepford Wives, with the town of Stepford obviously moved to the UK (and details tweaked accordingly). Shockingly, I couldn't find a single HP/Stepford crossover on either ffnet or AO3.

There are a number of ways such a story could go, depending in part upon which version the author wanted to use:

1. Harry and Dudley could return from school one year to notice Petunia has... /changed/. They soon discover that she's been replaced with a gynoid - perhaps Dudley damages her with a tantrum, or Harry's magic flares and causes a malfunction. With Vernon obviously quite happily complicit, the two boys try to figure out what happened to the real Petunia. Tone-wise, this could land anywhere between a mystery and rescue story (if Petunia has just been locked away somewhere) to full-blown horror (she's been killed and Harry's next on the list, and he and Dudley are up against most or all of the community in their efforts to escape and alert the authorities). As for why Vernon would have Petunia killed and replaced, I can think of a few possible reasons that aren't mutually-exclusive:

   1. He was talked around to the idea by the other husbands at the local men's club.
   2. The gynoids are better-looking versions of their originals, and he wanted a hotter wife.
   3. Even as near-Stepford as she already was, she still occasionally disagreed with him or said/did something he didn't like.
   4. Killing and replacing (or even not replacing) Harry was Vernon's idea, but she baulked, possibly remembering what Dumbledore told her about the blood protection.

2. The Wives aren't being replaced, they're being brainwashed (I think it was a TV adaptation that went this route). Petunia in this version might even be a fully enthusiastic participant in the conspiracy. Regardless, they try to brainwash Harry into being a more "normal" boy, but if Voldemort's Imperius couldn't get him to say he didn't want to be tortured again, their form of mind-control isn't going to hold either. Now he's trying to escape or send for help while having to pretend he's completely put aside everything to do with magic.

Personally, regardless of the details of the "hook", I love the idea of Harry and Dudley teaming up to try to escape, rescue Petunia, and/or bring down the conspiracy. Of course, if Petunia is dead that would beg the question of whether Dudley is a close enough relation to continue anchoring the blood protections. It could be a nice karmic finale for Vernon and his co-conspirators to all be at his house for a poker night or the like when the Death Eaters come a-calling.
