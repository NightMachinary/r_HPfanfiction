Im looking for a comedic fic along the lines of Seventh Horcrux which is superb If you havnt read it. Cant link because my ohone link never work


** Comedic fics eh? Well besides the three great classics ("Oh god not again" and "A Black Comedy" and "Make a wish)) I have a few other recs.

- "The Many Harry Potters of little hangleton"---- Takes on every single trope imaginable and a few you wished you never did imagine
- " Dimension hopping for beginners"---- Along the lines of the first one
- "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Love good"--- Quite funny at parts
- " The Hogwarts Blog "
- "Dear Order"--short but worth it

Edit: title correction

Edit2: Now How the hell did I forgot "Naked Quidditch Match"? (P.S. its not smut)

  Quickly, Lucius darted up and placed a butterfly kiss on Voldemort's dry lips, gulping at the furious glare he received.

***** Chaptor 6 was by far the best. Even if it wasn't the most original, then again some of those chaptors is rather void.

** I just read fic the other day and it had me laughing a lot. It is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2974749/1/Coven-of-The-Rose][Coven of the Rose]] by CRose. It may seem kinda dumb at points but I liked.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]] - I barely ever see it recommended but it's in somewhat the same line as The Naked Quidditch Match, but longer, has a bit of a lengthy plot, and is downright hilarious.
