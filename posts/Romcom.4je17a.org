Part discussion part just looking for fics. Are there any cliche hallmark style romcom fics that are worth reading?

How would one even go about doing it to begin with?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][Pottermum]] likes to write H/G Romcoms.

I find them quite good.

** Fanfiction.net search HP Fanfiction for your favorite ship with Comedy then Romance as the genre tags. Up to you to decide whether to keep it "T" for something more like classic romcom tv shows and movies, or "M" for something more...HBO or Cinemax or more depending if it has been found or reported to ffn yet for exceeding guidelines.

There are LOTS of "T" rated fics that are hilarious couple stories, and with "M" you get sexytime scenes... and possibly lemons. But even if you are body fluid averse in your reading, the M rated fic with its sexual comedy can be crack-fic gold sometimes.

I can't think of examples off the top of my head... maybe... linkffn(Lechery Larceny and Luna Lovegood)

Since linkbot seems to be down at the moment... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087]] I just started re-reading it and I can joyfully recommend it as romantic comedy, rated M but I don't remember it being full of lemons..just sexual humor and situations. Absolute must-read

** Well.... linkffn(Ron El Greco) kinda has elements of this. It has a similar /mood/ to what you're asking, and it does have romance, but it's not a rom-com per se.
