** There's "Battles With Basilisks." It's a one-shot, but it's really good about turning Lockhart into the competent and powerful wizard he presents himself as, and STILL keeping him perfectly in character... he's brave, heroic, efficient and a good deal smarter than he let's on, but he's still callous, full of himself, and more concerned about his own fame and book sales than he is about actually being a good person.

**** To be honest, I don't really care about that. I'm not for it normally, but it's interesting when the fanfic author makes him look like a tool. Like if Harry was put into Slytherin, and Ron abhors anything Slytherin, wouldn't it be a bit different? I know that this fanfic isn't one of those, but it's just a fanfic.

On top of this I actually quit this fanfiction about 10 chapters in. It wasn't my cup of tea. Especially when the romances got a bit weird. Adding on to that:

The only fanfics to really stay far as hell away from, in my honest opinion, and as far as I'm concerned, is slash. I hate it. I wouldn't mind if Harry was just gay and that's all, and the rest of the story is good, but for f++ks sake, when people make it as graphic as possible, that's just disgusting. And no I'm not hating on gay people. Just the unnecessary, sexually graphic nature of some fanfics. Same when they make the straight romances as graphic as possible. That's pretty f++++d up. Just because you can write an awkward, and unnecessary sex scene doesn't make you a 'good author.' It's the rest of the story that counts. Of course, just my opinion.

[Though I should add that I think I dropped this fic because of the romance sections. Those were kind of weird. Just a heads up. But the reason as to why I even added the fic in the first place, to this list, while knowing this, is just because it was the only Lockart fanfic I found where he isn't a "babbling bumbling baffoon."]

****** Yeah I get it. There are some really stupid plot devices in some of these stories that people use to move it forward. But I tend to be like, "hmmm, I'm going to pretend I didn't see that, or try to forget about it entirely." while I move on with the story. But if the story starts to weaken, then I usually lose interest.

The only one I've read all the way through was an elemental story that now seems to be sadly deleted. It had 100+ chapters and was one of the most badass stories I've read. It didn't focus majorly romance and focused more on building the characters. I'm glad I did read it when it was up though. It probably is one of the best ones I've ever read.

Though, "Oh god not again," another time-travel based one is actually pretty good. As for anything else, the only ones I can call to memory is "Delenda Est" (a unique time-travel one) and "The Rune Stone Path" (not a time-travel, but Harry is intelligent and really good at runes... but it's got one of those weird style romances [multi-partners], so I haven't read all of it yet, and will only do so if I find it to not be completely filled with that crap.). In fact, I haven't completed any of these stories yet. And I have yet to even start on Bungle in the Jungle.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
