Just had a thought where if I will ever get sick of fanfics or just not have enough time to the point of never reading them and that thought kind of scares me quite a bit. The reason it scares me is because reading fanfics is my main hobby where I can spend time alone (I'm an introvert) and get away from everything and lose myself in other people's works.

So I'm wondering if you guys ever thought if you would every stop reading fanfics.


** Sometimes I get into a slump after reading too much and for too long...but the feeling will pass after a short break and I find myself picking up a fic again and am still able to enjoy reading just as I used to.

*** Oh yes, I read waaaay to much between 8-17/18. I would write entire chapters the night before an exam because that exhilaration of potential failure gave me an adrenaline kick or whatever. Eventually, towards the end of high school, I disciplined myself a lot. It helped that I attended a Jesuit school. In any case, throughout uni, I forgot about fanfiction, and really never had the time. It wasn't until now, in quarantine, that I rediscovered it.

*** I get like this, but for fandoms. Like I will go all in and read nothing but Harry Potter fanfics for a month, then I'll suddenly find myself peeling away for a week with Stargate, and then a month or two of Naruto, before I suddenly turn on my head and instead of searching by fandom, I'm now on a romance kick for a month before suddenly wanting nothing but pure, crack fueled comedy.

When speaking of a singular fic, though, I've found that I can only binge around 23 chapters before running out of steam, but if I pace myself and have a couple one shots to read every now and then, I can power through 1-2 million words in around 4-5 days.

** I honestly think I have an addiction. I put off anything other than reading and it's caused me huge issues. With work deadlines and even general things like remembering to eat. I cut myself off cold turkey last week because I have deadlines I really need to meet. It's going to be amazing to pick up my phone and actually be able to read again.

*** I've been there! When I was in my undergrad I had to stop reading for a while because I was using reading to procrastinate, and I wasn't getting things done. I took a break for almost 2 years, and it was the right choice to make. After a while, I honestly didn't miss it---it just wasn't part of my routine anymore. Now that I have a job with a regular 9-to-5 schedule, I've picked it back up, and I've been able to limit reading time to my commute/evenings. I never stopped loving it!!

****** One of the things I like most about the younger generation is that people seem far more accepting of these kinds of things.

When I was in school, even amongst a relatively geeky crowd, it would have been social suicide to admit to reading fanfiction!

Which means I can offer no point of comparison to how common it was 10+ years ago. I knew of only 2 other people who read fanfiction. One was my closest friend who I only found out read it by accident. The other was a girl who got publically ridiculed for it.

******* I'm almost 24, and I remember fic being a big thing in my close knit social group, but we kept quiet about it around the rest of our school. It was a little more accepted, but I think that's because it started going mainstream with one direction self insert fanfics during my middle school years. By high school it just wasn't as big a deal as long as you kept kind of quiet about it.

Also, the "ideal" age for someone to be a HP fan is 33 right now; they would have been 11 when PS came out and stayed close to his age. Kinda fun.

In fairness, Harry Potter was fairly unique in that regard - it's popularity was unprecedented even compared to some of the historic greats of children's literature like C. S. Lewis and Enid Blyton.

I imagine a lot of it was to do with timing. The emergence of social media and the shrinking of the world, etc. Would Harry Potter been quite as big if it was released 20 years earlier or 20 years later? We'll never know obviously, but it's interesting to think about.

every other entry has kinda sucked.

whereas a good entry like for example dragon ball super rebirths the fandom and brings it back to life and to greater promience it also introduces a new generation to the franchise.

like how many youtubers make content exclusively about harry potter meanwhile due to fact dragon ball is getting new and interesting content there are a couple of dozen channels making content for dragon ball

** I don't think I'll ever stop reading fanfic.

I go through reading slumps and spikes. Usually I'm in a reading slump when I have lots of school stuff going on. I have to put myself into this slump because I can sometimes get addicted to reading fanfic and literally read something for hours and forget about sleeping.

After the last DH movie came out I was kinda scared that most people would lose interest in the fandom and stop writing fanfics. I'm glad to be proven wrong.

I'll be reading (and re-reading) fanfic as long as it's being written. It's weird that I haven't read an actual book in so long because reading fanfic is so much easier and less effort, even if word counts are higher.

*** I sometimes do that too. I will have a fanfic I was interested in reading and when I get to it after finishing one fanfic I just don't want to. I usually save it and come back to it when I don't have anything else to read hoping that I will find my interest in it again.

** Reading fanfics is my only hobby that I spend my whole day outside of work and three meals on since the beginning of this whole pandemic back in February.

I don't think I'll get sick of it. This is the longest sustained spike I've gone, and when I get a chance to grab book 6 from my fam when travel is a little less risky, I'll finally read the rest of HP.

** Yes. I feel like I'm running out of fics to read. There's a few that I stupidly read, only for them to be incomplete and I'm waiting those those, but because of my ADHD I need to be constantly multitasking and it drives me insane, so I keep downloading fics to my TTS reader, and abandon 70% of them due to me not liking the fic. Sometimes I'll take breaks and just listen to YouTube instead, but these breaks never last long. I've actually been so fed up with most dark!Harry fics and I've begun writing my own which is at 4,000 words at the moment. I have a basic plot already written out, but it's slow and I refuse to post it until it's done. Anyone else start writing their own because they feel like they're out of fics? But no, I don't think I'll ever stop. I will take breaks, but never be done.

** They kind of saved my mind post high school when I couldn't read fiction books anymore for weird psychological reasons. I've tried reading my old favorites but I get nauseous. Sometimes, I can read nonfiction though. I read my way through 5 libraries when I was a kid. Can't even enter one now. I got back a lot of things after that breakdown, but that wasn't one of them.

I'm autistic and mentally ill and started aggressively reading everything in middle school to combat overstimulation and really bad anxiety. I used to bring at least three books to school all the time. I lived in used book stores. Books-A-Million, Barnes and Noble, Walden. Just desperate all the time. I was teachers aid in the school library at the end of middle school and all through high school (which wasn't allowed for freshman-junior) it was literally a requirement in my IEP.

There is a lot of grief stuck in there. I miss it though.

** I do get tired honestly... so I rotate... Harry Potter slash ... Severus, Draco, Lucius, Sirius, Fenrir Greyback, and Voldemort/Tom. If I'm sick of Harry Potter fanfiction well... Dean Winchester and Castiel from “Supernatural” as well as Sam and Gabriel. If I'm sick of Supernatural then there's always Rick and Daryl from “The Walking Dead” to entertain me (ironic since I'm not even a fan of the show anymore!) “Percy Jackson” as a very slight few which is disappointing but interesting to pick through; same with “Gone” by Michael Grant - I swear that series is so underrated. It's fantastic.

And if, heaven forbid, I'm sick of fan fictions entirely... I go to Wattpad and I reread something old but purely amazing; RotxInxPieces has some truly amazing (if not soul crushing) books and there is about 30 of them in one series so that will keep you busy, and that's just /one/ series. She has other series up too. There's also a few others I've read that are just worth going back too.

And if I'm not feeling wattpad either for some truly crazy reason - then I'll just reread the books I read when I was growing up; the books that made me truly cherish reading in the first place.

I hope I never get sick of fan ficton; I love it way way way too much. I don't think I'll ever let it go. I'm far too obsessed with it.

** I've been reading hp fanfics for a little over 20 years now. I occasionally set the fics down for a few months and get into something else but I always come back to it. I've found switching ships and genres between fics helps make even fics with the same premise feel different enough I'm not comparing them so much.

** To be honest? Yes.

I went through the phase everyone went through, in that I read all the very tropey, very cheesy stories out there like flies on rice. And then, over the years, I became and still am sick of them.

Hell, I even had a small Harmonian phase.

These days, unless a story or prompt is unique or has a unique take on things, I tend not to bother reading a story unless it's a guilty-pleasure read/craving, since they're just the same shit over and over again.

** The thought doesn't scare me, but it does make me a bit sad. HP was my first fandom, and when I stumbled into it back in 2005, I had the time of my life and met some fantastic people. Fandom has changed a lot since then, and I enjoy it less. There's nothing appealing about fandom on Twitter, for example.

Now I can go days or weeks without finding an HP fic or a promising new author that excites me or caters to my tastes. But I always have a side-fandom or two to help pick up the slack (Twelve-era Doctor Who, The Magicians, Person of Interest, and so on), and I keep an eye on the fic output there. None of them comes anywhere near the embarrassment of riches that HP produces, but they feed my appetite for stories about other beloved characters and worlds.

Also, I'm pretty sure HP will lure me back for as long as I'm writing in it. Working on stories of my own keeps me connected to the characters and the world and makes it harder to drift away.

So giving up fic would mean the loss of a certain kind of pleasure, but on the other hand I do love books, so it would free up more reading time for published works. I would miss the fanfic community, though.
