So, I'd like to see some good stories about Harry having an actual power that Voldemort doesn't. Unique magic, power system imported from another fandom, etc.

Anyone got links to stories like that?

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.
