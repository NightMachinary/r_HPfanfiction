*Premise idea:*

Snape doesn't arrive to save the day and Harry ends up killing Draco in that fateful bathroom scene. Frantic, shocked and with no idea what else to do, Harry oblivates Myrtle (let's assume it works on ghosts), levitates the body into the basilisk's old nest in the chamber of secrets, vanishes the blood, casts whole bunch of spells in case someone tried to check his wand.

In the aftermath Harry starts practising Occlumency in order to hide the fact that he is the murderer (and is a lot more successful now that he is properly motivated). Pretends to know nothing of Draco's disappearance and manages to get away scot free. Snape murders Dumbledore and Harry still goes on Horcrux hunt as in canon.

However in that cafe scene, instead of oblivating the death eaters, Harry casts Sectumsempra and from here on becomes much more brutal and murderous in his quest. The slashing curse becomes his signature move and every death eater he comes across hereafter gets their chest slashed open. Umbridge, ministry goons, goblins at the bank, Malfoy household, during the battle...

And it is this murderous Harry that faces his end with the resurrection stone and a very disappointed Dumbledore in the King's Cross.

Can go any witch way really. Sad, tragic, happy ending, redemption, or go down dark path, maybe tried for his crimes and sent off to Azkaban, or get away scot free. One shot or long shot, or novel length.


** I don't think he would get in any trouble for killing in the war.

Even before the fall of ministry, Order was killing Death Eaters. This is implied when Lupin chastises Harry for disarming in the Battle of 7 Potters instead of stunning and letting the death eaters plummet to their death.

He would probably keep the book too so as to not attract suspicion. He might actually kill Snape during the escape as Snape cannot read his mind and would be too surprised by Harry using Sceptemseptra to defend himself. That is assuming Snape killing Dumbledore happens close to canon. If death eaters invaded Hogwarts during this Harry would probably kill all of them as in canon he took down 4 out 6 non lethally.

So no ambush during extraction of Harry and they still have Mad Eye with them. The Order might actually be effective with Mad Eye and stop the takeover of Hogwarts and the Ministry with Harry putting down many Death Eaters. Rufus might actually give Harry the sword seeing as how he was such a effective and strong fight or when they realize they need Basilisk venom it would be a lot more accessible. No need for tenting in the middle of no where

Harry would not know he is Horcrux (or he might, he states in the movies that he has known for a while) so when he offs Voldemort everyone sees Voldemort's spirit escaping.

This would lead to a lot harsher treatment of death eaters and Hermione could actually push through some of her changes more easily with Harry's help.

Overall a lot fewer of Voldemort's supporters would be around and a lot more good guys will be there. Teddy would probably not become an orphan, Fred and Collin would probably would still be alive.

Overall it would be a better conclusion of the war.

*** So many possibilities! Many different ways it could go. I think there would be no break in to the school. Snape would probably kill Dumbledore on last day of school, in front of witnesses. Somewhere visible and where he can make his escape.

In my head I'd imagine that major, defining moments would still pan out in a similar fashion.

But it's an idea for a story, I'd be happy to see what someone might come up with!

*** Yes, but killing Malfoy in a school might a bridge too far, even after the war. They have no real proof he was a death eater-Harry disposed of the body, it would have certainly rotted way to much to display any tattoo's- and he murdered him in a school. If that got out, he would likely face trial.

Would he get away with it? Maybe. Depends on a lot of factors that aren't certain any more with the amount of changes this would ripple.

Would he face trial for any of the other killings? Almost certainly not. Depending on how brutal/unnecessary they were, they might be used as circumstantial/character evidence in the trial for him killing Malfoy, but thats about it.

** Interesting premise, with the big questions being how would Snape react and how would Harry react.

Honestly, on rereading the scene, all it would take for Draco to die would be the absence of Myrtle. Her screaming bloody murder was what brought Snape down on them, and Draco would have likely bled out in minutes or less given the sword like slashes all over his chest. Harry was frozen in shock and would have watched him die. Snape's nearly instantaneous arrival indicates that he was nearby, probably trying to watch over Draco according to his unbreakable vow.

Now, one of his vows was to protect Draco to the best of his ability. The question to ask is if the death of Draco would count as breaking the Vow, or if the Vow would consider Snape to have "protected him to the best of his ability" and allowed him to live.

If Snape lives, his vow will force him to kill Dumbledore, as vowed and as planned by Dumbledore. The question is in how much time he has before he is forced to take action, and if he would be able to hold off until the end of the year. Likely, after enough time had passed and/or spells cast to prove that Draco was dead, he would act and kill Dumbledore. There is no need for a break in, Snape could do it himself without issue, and the break in wasn't a requirement of Draco's task as evidenced by his other attempts. Though Snape might need to bring in witnesses to prove his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Most things would follow as you prompted. I'd imagine a rift between Harry and his friends though, as Hermione didn't approve of the Princes book and Harry could never tell that he had killed Draco.

​

More ripple effecting would be if Snape died for failing his vow. Without him to help slow the curse, Dumbledore would start deteriorating rapidly. I doubt that Albus would be able to convince anyone else to kill him. He'd have to rush with Harry to get the locket before he succumbed. I'd even imagine the possibility of him being too weak to survive the encounter, dying to save Harry. It would probably be preferable to the alternative of dying to the withering curse, which if it became public knowledge would clue Voldemort into the fact that Dumbledore had been after his Horcruxes. So either the Horcrux hunt goes far worse with Voldemort clued in, or Dumbledore dies in the cave with Harry, which would be hard to spin. No martyrs death, no symbol of resistance, just either a missing headmaster if he was pulled under by inferi, or another corpse brought back to Hogwarts by Harry Potter. Not good either way.

​

Without Snape, the rescue from Privet Drive would be done without Voldemort knowing before hand the date. Moody surviving as mentioned by others. Hogwarts however would be in the tender care of the Carrows, and that would not go well for the students.

​

All in all, darker futures for all if Harry kills Draco, though interesting to read I'm sure.

*** It is open to interpretation and woulds love to read what someone might imagine.

In my own head I'd see that major, defining events would still pan out in similar enough fashion. But it's just me not having enough imagination to go really wacky.

I think as long as Snape didn't knowingly neglect to protect Draco, he is fine. Timing when he has to kill Dumbledore is probably undefined. So as long as he doesn't actively sabotage that goal, he should be fine as well.

Also for a little while there would be uncertainty as to where Draco is. Is he alive, did he run away, did Voldemort recall him? Since there is no body, no evidence of his murder, it could easily take days, perhaps weeks to be certain of anything.

There would still be the question of the Eldar wand, if Snape does kill Dumbledore as mutually arranged, will he get the wand's loyalty? Harry could, perhaps during the battle, manage to disarm him so he can still face off Voldemort. Considering this Harry would certainly be stronger, more guarded than one in canon - I think he could be capable.

But then again, imaginative writer could take this premise and turn entire situation completely on its head. So many possibilities!

**** The Elder Wand does make for interesting proposal, because assuming canon does proceed with few changes other than dead Draco and vicious Harry, then Snape will win the wand. Snape would then either have to lose to someone else in order to prevent it from falling into Voldemorts hands, or Voldemort would claim mastery when he kills Snape. Not good.

It's possible that Harry does catch Snape off guard with occlumency while Snape flees the castle and defeats and or kills him, making him the master of the wand. Vicious Harry would be more likely to insist on following the Hallows clues rather than the Horcrux clues and would possibly claim the wand before Voldemort.

If Snape dies to his Vow, Dumbledore will probably be panicking. If he dies to the withering curse, Voldemort gains mastery of the wand. If he dies to the potion or the inferi, Voldemort gains mastery of the wand. Honestly in that case if he was weaker ing without Snape, sure to die, and unsure that he could keep the wand from Voldemort he would probably have to tell Harry more. Not everything. But more. Enough to convince Harry to kill him out of mercy to end his suffering from the curse and potion and to keep the wand from Voldemort. Now that sounds like an interesting divergence to me. Harry enters the Hallows hunt having killed twice (not counting Quirrel, the basilisk, or diary tom) and holding all three Hallows.

***** Even with mastery of the Eldar wand, there is no way he could actually defeat Voldemort in a real duel. Not without making Harry unrealistically OP or otherwise crippling Voldemort. Albus won the duel against the Eldar wand, so it is clearly possible.

I think Snapes' fate could be almost exactly the same. Voldemort has his snake kill him, but Snape is still alive long enough for Harry to meet him and get his memories. Perhaps this Harry would mercy kill him rather than let him suffer the wounds. Or perhaps he would already understand the wand ownership and would disarm Snape before he dies.

Or perhaps Harry would be so far gone in his hate he would cast the slashing curse on him too, accidentally killing him before Nagini's venom would ...

But seriously ; The thing about having such vague and undefined "powerful" artifacts like the Elder wand is they are as powerful as necessary for the plot. It would not be against plot for the Wand to be enough. It would also not be against plot for it to not be enough.

** If someone other than Fudge was in office at time this happened Harry might get away without prison time, because Malfoy was casting the Cruciatus curse at him. The way the wizarding world is at the time Harry would end up in Azkaban so I think he did the right thing covering it up. The fact Harry got away with not killing in canon with an actual spell is bs and unrealistic. He killed Quirell at 11 but wouldn't kill at 15. Also there is a difference between murder and killing in a war.

Whats he gonna do? Run a smear campaign against the Chosen One? That's basically letting old Voldy win, even assuming Dumbledore just watches and doesn't help Harry out.

And in any case, he was more than justified to use any curse he wanted to. Draco cast an Unforgivable at another human, Harry was not obligated to settle at non-lethal measures, not even considering the fact that he did not know what the spell actually did

** Amid all the joy at the justice this new Gray!Harry is dispensing, don't forget that the other side has magic too and can adapt.

The Death Eater regime was self-assured, slow, bureaucratic. They would arrest known blood traitors and close associates of Harry Potter and then just let them go after a short interrogation. If a Muggleborn didn't resist, they would (in all evidence) contend themselves with just taking away their wand---and they don't appear to have pursued those who had gone into hiding very hard. They did nothing to secure the Ministry against infiltration. They allowed known close friends and associates of Harry Potter to continue attending Hogwarts, even allowing them to spread anti-Voldemort propaganda. They used someone's family as hostages exactly /once/ that we saw. Snatchers were downright lackadaisical. Voldemort wandered Europe looking for the Elder Wand, rather than hunting down the regime's enemies.

Now, suppose that Harry starts playing for keeps, so to speak. How quickly would these things change?

** This arc would have been an enigmatic fiction story. Taking off and adding on from where you left off, we can be assured that Harry would have been mentally scarred after murdering Draco in cold blood and would have carried that secret with him with a heavy heart. This would have affected the Horcrux inside him, causing it to push Harry towards evil or immorality in his quest during HPATDH.

The whole of the seventh book would be completely different, with Harry taking all challenges head on, instead of a pragmatic approach. For example, Harry blasting his way through Gringotts, killing and maiming all around him, using Unforgivable Curses more openly. An interesting change in the arc would be Ron sticking with him through it all, while this time Hermione abandons them out of sheer disgust and mistrust.

Harry wrecking the Ministry of Magic, killing Umbridge and Yaxley, fighting all the same battles but in a more brutal manner, till he reaches Malfoy Manor, sees Narcissa and Lucius in a broken state: mourning for their missing son, and realizing that everything was his fault, opening up to them for the first time about Draco's death, asking for forgiveness and finally finding peace by owning up.

From here I would like the story to go in a different arc which is not just about defeating Voldemort, but a battle of good and evil within Harry himself (which is not merely the Horcrux). After killing Voldemort at Hogwarts, Harry would take over the Elder Wand as the rightful master and be at a crossroad: being good and vulnerable to emotions, or being evil but immensely powerful. That's where the love part of all his friends and family would play a role and show us that the reason Voldemort became what he was because he lacked pure love, thus engraving Rowling's deep driven message. (of course a lot can be added in between, feel free to add, delete, improve)

The all he had to do was watch over Draco "as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes," protect him from harm to the best of his abilities, plus do the job Draco was supposed to do if he is unable. If Snape didn't decide to heal Draco, he'd be in violation of the vow, but as he had no idea that Harry would use sectumsempra on Draco, Snape would be fine.

Harry dives behind the professor, knowing he was a dueller when he was younger, and Flitwick - completely confused by not going to let Snape murder Harry (he does even begin saying "Avada--") duels Snape to keep Harry and the other students safe.

** Narcissa ain't gonna bail him out at the end. Harry's friends deal the finishing blow to Voldi.

*** Perhaps not, but it would depend wether she knows what really happened to Draco. I also think that she would blame and loathe Voldemort for whatever happened. So possibly out of pure spite she would still save Harry.

** He gets so good at the spell that he can cast it wandlessly and wordlessly.

He kills Voldy and claims his Parseltongue and followers through the Right of Conquest.

(He feels empty then. The Horcrux is gone and he misses it.

So, he goes back in time to join Voldemort and commit genocide. Or maybe he traps Voldemort's Spirit instead, forever keeping him safe and unable to return.)
