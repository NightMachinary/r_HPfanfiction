Since I doubt there is much of this ship out there I'll accept pretty much anything, though obviously some degree of quality would be appreciated.

linkao3(4330836) got me thinking about it, but a Slytherin!Harry is by no means a requirement.

  Slytherins--- this is a group who laughs when Neville falls off a broom and breaks his wrist. And what if we had Harry there, who had always been the one laughed at, who had a nice thirst to prove himself, who had green trim on his robes instead of red? This Harry still stepped out in front of Malfoy's best sneer and demanded Neville's Rememberall back--- though he got a detention from it, not a Seekership.When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. Harry did not ask Millicent to come with him; this was not a boy who asked for things. When he had asked for things, Dudley had laughed, Petunia had scowled, and Vernon had said, “no,” or just kept reading the newspaper like he hadn't heard anything at all. But when Harry went, Millicent bunched up her robes in her hands and followed.

It's more of a Harry/one night stand with everyone, but there is some amusing Harry/Millicent in there.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

  Harry Potter makes a conscious decision to select a wife of his own choice. He was not going to propose to who everyone expected him to. He was not going to let someone ‘older and wiser' push him. He was going to stop and think, use both his mind and his gut feelings.

**** I liked it, for what it was. It was well written and had its roots spread as an intro to a great story.

But nothing actually happened. I didn't even get an awkward wedding night lemon to make up for the lack of things happening.

** linkffn(3719753) Rather weak fic, but I appreciate attempt at having everybody being manipulative. Don't know how far relationship progresses as the fic dies at the beginning of the second year and I've only read few first chapters.
