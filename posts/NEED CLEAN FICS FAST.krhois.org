So I never learned to shut my mouth and I keep mentioning cool things I read in FF to my mom. She decided that she wants to read some herself... problem is, while the stuff I read does have plot, it usually also has /ahem/ RELATIONSHIPS. My mother is VERY CHRISTIAN. IF anyone knows any good clean fics (including language) Maybe the books rewritten from another character's perspective but really anything that you think would be good for a first timer. I have avoided this as long as I could without seeming suspicious since she thinks everything I read is clean... but I have to give her something. I would prefer something on AO3 but fanfiction.net is ok too. THANKS Y'ALL ARE LIFE SAVERS. */EDIT/* Thanks so much for all of your responses. I'm going to preview a few of the suggested fics and browse FFN on the kids filter. I only ever use AO3 so I didn't know that was an option 😅


** harry potter and the lack of lamb sauce is one of my favorite fics. it sounds stupid but it's genuinely amazing. smut free- don't remember about language but it's not too bad. au where gordon ramsey becomes potions master instead of slughorn.

** - *Exile by bennybear*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile Chapter 1: Part 01, a harry potter fanfic | FanFiction]]

It is a story about Draco after the war. He is banned from using magic for 5 years and tries to get by in the muggle world, all while dealing with depression and PTSD.

There are some references to masturbation but there are no relationships at all.

​

- *Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh]]

Wholesome story about Harry, Ginny and their generation as 30-year old adults with small kids.

- *Dudley's Memories and sequels by Paganaidd*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories]]

Harry and Ginny take in a foster kid. Again wholesome story about Harry and Ginny as adults with kids.

- *The Bureacratic Error by Iniga*.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error]]

Still a WIP. When Remus dies he bargains with Fate so that he can fix the errors he made in the last 5 years. Some mentions of adults being sexually attracted to each other and references to Remus and Tonks doing it out of wedlock in one scene, but that is it.

- *Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647]]

Harry in his 60s with grandkids. Harry and his friends and family must figure out a conspiracy and fight a newly risen dark lord in order to secure the future for the next generation. Dark, violent but IIRC free of sex aside from mentioning marriage and having babies.

- *Snape Head of Hufflepuff by Sheankelor*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11062798]]

What the title says. As a young teacher, Snape replaces Sprout for one year as Head of Hufflepuff.

Keep your mom away from the rest of Sheankelor's fics bc she likes to write Snarry.

** What's the one with Dennis Creevy as the photographer that shoots the veterans of the war? It's got a one word title, but I'm blanking on it.

Not super light and easy, but it's a moving piece that shows off one of the powerful ways that people have used fanfiction. I don't think there's anything that she would find particularly anti-Christian in it, though it's definitely emotional and a bit dark.

** I took a look through my FFN favourites and found some fics which I remember being pretty clean.

*Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]]

At some point during second year, Tom Riddle's diary is found by Luna after Ginny misplaces it. Initially it's formatted as a conversation between Luna and Tom via diary entries and Tom slowly begins to care for Luna and through her influence grows out of the darker parts of his personality. Overall I think this is a sweet story, perfect for anyone really.

*Seventh Horcrux*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]]

Voldemort POV starting from the night of October 31st, 1981. After he is killed trying to murder baby Harry, the portion of Voldemort's soul that attached itself to Harry partially overrides Harry's mind. "Harry" grows up into a cartoonish dark wizard wannabe with aspirations to take over the Wizarding World. This is a comedy fic that borders on crack, so it's very absurd and isn't that serious.

*Harry Potter and the Natural 20*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]]

In the summer before first year, Milo, an enterprising Wizard (with a capital W) from a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, is accidentally brought into the Harry Potter universe and must find a way to survive this alternate world and make his way back home. Although it's unfinished, this story is full of comedy gold and I keep coming back to reread every few months.

*Harry the Hufflepuff*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

Harry grows up being called "lazy" rather than "freak", so he leans into this and develops a good skill for avoiding work and effort in extremely creative and humorous ways. After being sorted into Hufflepuff he breezes through school with minimum effort, often going to extremes in order to dodge the actual plot which seems like it actively wants him participating. Very funny lighthearted read, and with sequels going all the way to fourth year.

And here are some very good oneshots!

*Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982933/1/Aunt-Marge-s-Even-Bigger-Mistake]]

Harry and Ginny are grudgingly invited to Dudley's wedding, and chaos ensues soon after.

*His Inspiration*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5556011/1/His-Inspiration]]

An assigned Transfiguration essay makes Harry rethink his friendship with Hermione.

*Play up, play up, and break the game!*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12361240/1/Play-up-play-up-and-break-the-game]]

During his final year at Hogwarts, Oliver Wood goes to comical lengths to ensure that Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup.

*Crookshanks the Matchmaker*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9376485/1/Crookshanks-the-Matchmaker]]

Post-Epilogue, Hermione is in a relationship with Ron, but Crookshanks has a better suitor in mind for his mistress.

*Twins*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13491812/1/Twins]]

Instead of Parvati and Padma Patil, Harry and Ron are accompanied to the Yule Ball by Flora and Hestia Carrow, and eventually both twins try to woo Harry in their own eerie but sweet way.

*Harry Runs Into An Old Muggle Classmate*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate]]

This one I think is pretty self explanatory.

I hope your mum thinks these are alright!

*** Harry the Hufflepuff has mention of porn though:

--------------

"Hey Harry, what's that?"

"It's the new memory-sphere thing Lockhart and I came up with," said Harry, lifting the glass ball out of its container and frowning at it. Hedwig's ungainly crash landing into his breakfast did not break, it luckily, but some egg had seeped through the packaging and was still sticking to it, despite a less than vigorous wiping. "It's meant to be the first one of hopefully a large and profitable range of them."\\
"What's it do?"\\
"Well I just wanted to record somebody reading out our textbooks, so that I didn't have to actually do the reading. Smiley reckons he could get an actual lesson recorded and sell them. The deal was I'd get a free copy and few sickles for each one sold. This is meant to be on Divination, but I can't get it to work."\\
"What's the letter? Does it say how to work it?"\\
"Oh Smiley wrote something about finding a new marketing angle and some specialty suppliers or something, but he still managed to get a lesson recorded. I didn't bother reading it all the way through."\\
"Here let me have a look. Okay, hold it in your hand and push some magic through, saying the words 'Occulus revealeo'."\\
"Ah!" said Harry and the mist started swirling inside the previously clear ball. "I can see it now. Hear it too. That's really annoying music, sounds a bit like those old movies Vernon used to watch late at night-"\\
"Hey, Harry, Lockhart didn't write it's about divination, he wrote it's called Divine Action, and look at the names of these other 'courses': Ass-tronomy, Muggle Studs, Wrist-mancy -- what the hell kind of course is this?"\\
"Um," said Harry, unblinking staring into the ball, his face going bright red.\\
"Oh. Oh! It's not school work, is it?"\\
"Well, it is, sort of, I mean she seems to be talking about that same stuff, but, er, well-."\\
"It's, er, a bit more interesting, isn't it?"\\
"Yep. Oh boy, yeah."\\
"You are going to share it, aren't you, mate? You know, to help us improve our grades."\\
"Maybe," answered Harry absently, his eyes not moving from the sphere. "Once, I've, er, studied it. Yeah, studied it. That's it... Er, I'll be in my bunk."

Although, you could just say to her "I'm not sure it's your sort of thing, mum. They get a bit swear-y." Would that really be so bad? It's okay to know the words, as long as you don't repeat them, right?

** So, do you think your mom would object to people being in relationships period, or are we just looking for absolutely no smut or smut-adjacent things?

In the utterly smut-free category, I'd recommend a few:

Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them: Harry is abandoned by the Dursley's and thinks he's a wood elf. It's a great funny fic.

The Art of Self Fashioning: Neville is the boy who lived (really) and James and Lily are comatose in St Mungos. Harry is driven wholly by the desire to cure his parents, and pretty much is a nutcase who is obsessed with practicing transfiguration. Great story,

Victoria Potter: Slytherin fem!Harry. It's not finished, but it really is one of the best out there.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration.

** Ok so I'm not gonna do the bot bc it'll take roo long to format this list on mobile, but here's a rundown of what I'm pretty sure are clean, straight fics on Ao3 for you. You may want to give them a quick skim for language - I don't know what your mom's tolerance for cursing is and I may have missed a bloody hell or so, or the non-cursing flirting in some may be more than she's good with, but none of these should be super duper long so you should be able to check quickly. Good luck!

** The professor Muggle series

Set after the books it tells the story of a Muggle that is hired as a more studies professor. He gets together with a witch, but it's PG and fade to black, nothing I find in any way problematic. Ok it's implied that they sleep together before they get married, and I don't know how Christian your mother is.

Harry works as an Auror and the story starts before he and Giny have their first child.

On AO3 and FFN, I think the author is Muggle Beene or so?

Another fic, Long Live the Queen by Offsides (44 chapters) [[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/]]] is a fun what if story contemplating the fallout if Harry wrote to the Queen in an attempt to get out of his trial in OoTP.

Azkadent by SilverStarwolfe (2 chapters, ongoing?)[[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11816448/1/]]] has some slightly more mature overtones, but is definitely crackfic and therefore hilarious!

Final rec here, Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting by TendaelUmbra (ongoing) [[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13256350/1/]]] is slightly cracky ‘what if people were sorted right' fic.

Anyways, this was actually the first fanfic I read, and to me it's my favorite. It is a rewrite of the series but from Ginny's perspective.

*** As a huge fan of HPMOR, I have to say HPMOR would be a horrible fic to recommend for a quote unquote "VERY CHRISTIAN" mother to read as a first impression of fanfiction. The same way canon characters casually treat it as a given that there's such a thing as souls and an afterlife, the main character of HPMOR casually treats it as a given that there's no such thing as souls or an afterlife.

Not to mention that /very close to the beginning of the story/, in chapter 7, Draco mentions /raping Luna Lovegood/ as a way to get revenge for an article in the Quibbler. People on this very subreddit can't seem to get past the simple mention of rape and seem to assume it's an endorsement or something, when like a paragraph later Harry is so shaken by Draco's mention of rape that he decides on the spot that if real people in the Wizarding World think like Draco then he needs to overthrow the government of the Wizarding World as quickly as possible, and a few paragraphs later after Draco keeps elaborating on the rape topic Harry thinks to himself "I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms." It's very clear that Harry and the author think what Draco is saying is a Bad Thing, and that this incident, not "science" or "rationality," is what sets him on the path to thinking the Wizarding World needs reformed.

If even that nuanced of an inclusion of a discussion of rape in a story is too off-putting for people on this subreddit, who have seen fanfictions where the Hogwarts castle has a carnal relationship with the giant squid, then it's going to be too off-putting for a quote unquote "VERY CHRISTIAN" mother.

***** I agree with everything you said about it. I think HPMOR is great. But that conversation between Harry and Draco in chapter 7 is just too controversial for OP's purposes, and it can be reached after just 2 hours of reading so it's too close to the beginning of the story. It's possible that OP's mother only plans on reading 30 minutes to an hour worth of fanfiction just to make sure her son isn't reading anything that she disagrees with, but 2 hours just isn't worth that risk.

** If you like Five Nights at Freddy's, the crossover called Five Nights with Harry by Harry Lefarts on FF.N is a good one. There's minimal violence, they complain skip over the first five nights when the murderous animatronics would try to kill Harry. It's unfinished, however it is a great read. Bonus: Umbridge gets driven insane by the Shadow Animatronics.

Harry Potter, Squatter, by Enterprise1701-d is a crossover with Percy Jackson, however, as someone who has never read anything past the 5th chapter of the first Percy book, I can wholeheartedly recommend. It's a very fluffy story with smaller darker elements. Harry is a little OP, but he literally lives on Olympus, so I guess it balances out.

This is my Father's World, by GenkaiFan, is another Percy Jackson crossover, but really not much is needed to be known about Percy Jackson in order to enjoy the story. Harry is the main character, along with Sirius as the secondary main character. Bonus: It's finished, both the previous I mentioned are unfinished as of posting this.

Under The Veil by Poplasia is an UnderTale crossover, however it takes place in the Harry Potter universe. Basically Sans is learning how humans do magic. It's pretty good, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.

Realizations by Wishweaver, is not a crossover. It takes place in the summer before fifth year, where the Dursley's have abandoned Harry and left the house. It's pretty good so far.

In the Hallow of White Hazel by OlegGunnersson is a one-shot, and it's pretty hilarious. I won't spoil since it's so short, but it's really funny.

I'll put the links below so I don't loose this. This took a while to type. All are from Fanfiction.Net

** Linkffn(Prediction, no thank you!) is a wholesome story of friendship and character growth, linkffn(Storybook Hero) is hilarious in its characterization of Harry and his straight-faced acceptance of everything strange into his life and Linkffn(Harry gets motivated) is one of the best training montages I've ever seen in the fandom. The closer any of them comes to sex is a bit of conversation between Harry&Co and some goblins in storybook hero.

House of Potter Rebuilt - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt]]

Off the top of my head.

Edit 1: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11331155/1/Most-Wanted-Peter-Pettigrew]] This is an incomplete / abandoned fic with a few swear words in it but nothing sexual in it. It have a very good Xeno Lovegood comedy scene in it that I absolutely loved.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Serpent-s-Renaissance]] Another really good WIP fic. No relationships in it so far and I'm 90% sure the language is clean.

** Just a Random Tuesday is a good one - with McGonagall as the narrator, it also might be more relatable for your mom. It's Minerva dealing with Umbridge, and I think it just has canon-typical cursing. There's one somewhat suggestive scene between an extremely drunk Trelawny and an extremely uncomfortable Snape that's hilarious, however.

I've added a pair of oneshot suggestions, but Tuesday is probably one of your better options.

** 2nd edit: how Christian is 'VERY CHRISTAIN'. because, like, my family is really religious. the goes to church almost everyday sort of Christian. i read mostly drarry, so if she's that sort of christain, then i cant help.

​

Running On Air is good, but I'm not certain if it exactly fits. It's a drarry fic--so, you know, gay as fuck, but it shouldn't be too, err, damning as it doesn't focus on the relationship--and very philosophical, for lack of a better word.

Even if it doesn't work for you, I really would recommend. I don't remember there being any cursing...

They're 26. Harry works at the missing persons unit. sort of?

The plot twist is brilliant.

I'd recommend reading anything first.

I don't read much--or any, really--'clean' works. but this is the best that fits.

I've often seen it referenced as /THE/ drarry fic, and boy, they weren't wrong.

I can go through my bookmarks, I suppose? I have close to 300 drarry fics tagged, but most of them wouldn't be considered 'clean'.

​

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
