There is a fanfic I've read, pairing Hermione and Remus in the past, and in the end there are a lot of obliviates to keep them together, it's a time travel fic. Can anyone help me out with the name?


** Could this be linkffn(Chemistry and Timing) ?

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. An accident throws Hermione back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now, with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over?
