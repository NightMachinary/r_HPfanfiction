:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have forgotten the name of two Harry Potter fanfiction's

one is where both Harry and Ron time travel, and it was funny I think we're back in their time they were both in positions of power and they didn't know what to do now that they were young again, Dumbledore knew.

The Other fan fiction is where the golden trio time traveled and it was Harry versus Hermione with wisdom versus bravery I think, they were sent back in time so they could fight in some fanfiction war I believe, The thing I remember most about it is that when they went back in time it was the goblet of fire and they did a live show with knights And the black and red knight sacrifice themselves in the little play

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
