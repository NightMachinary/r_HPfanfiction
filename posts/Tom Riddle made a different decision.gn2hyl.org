Tom Riddle Senior looked at Merope Gaunt in her eyes: “You know what, I don't love you, but that's my kid and I'm gonna raise him.”

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

**** I liked this story but not the summary so here is my summary:Hermione travels back in time to raise Tom Riddle and prevent him from becoming Voldemort. Then she decides that Tom should also have a father and visits Riddle manor. That is basically the starting point of the story.

  In which Tom Riddle Senior never could fully put Merope's claims of being pregnant out of his mind and set out to bring his child home, unwittingly changing the fate of both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds and laying waste to the machinations of a certain scheming old man.

** Was it JK that said that babies conceived under Love potions are basically emotionless? Or is it fanon?

Either way I really don't like the idea of an inherently evil Tom Riddle, so a fic with an intact Riddle family should be interesting.

That's Fanon, JK has said Tom came out the way he did because he never knew the love of a parent and he would have been very different if he had.

***** Yes. I despise the idea of just being inherently unable to love at all.

After all we platonically love all our friends and that's love as well. We love our pets/familiars and that's love as well. We love ourselves (though mostly with great difficulty) and that's valid. We can love magic. We can love nature. We can love books. All of that is valid love.

Love doesn't have to be romantic to be valid and everybody can love in a certain way. You don't need romantic love to love validly.

***** Same I really dislike when it's just thrown out as fact, usually by Hermione in a fic, "He can't love Harry he was conceived with Amortentia, I've read several studies on it."\\
Not only does it reduce the character who says it to the insufferable genius trope it's also wrong.

*** Like with most complaints of Rowlings writing, its based on people misinterpreting something she said.

This is what she said about this.

#+begin_quote
  Ravleen: How much does the fact that Voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his non-ability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- *but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him*.

  J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

** What if Merope looked at him and said: "If you don't love me why should you love him?" " He's my son! And no with shall raise him!" Tom shouted "I think it's better if he's raised by me being a witch" Merope said cooly " oh really? " Snarled Tom "Witchcraft can pass through generations Tom" Merope said " bye, if you don't love me then I'm not giving you my son " she turned on her heel and left her husband standing there in the large garden of his parlour.
