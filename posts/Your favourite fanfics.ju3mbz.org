What are some of the best fanfics you've read? I simultaneously feel like I've read so many yet have barely scratched the surface. I know a lot of fics got purged from FF.net a couple of years ago. And I've only started reading HP fics since last year. So that's a significant amount of missing fics from my life.

My personal faves are works by MayMarlow, Cybrid, Maquira, The Fictionist, Strange Soulmates, ChildOTKW, EclipseWing, FalconLux, Lomonaaeren and TreacleTeacups. Those into Tomarry would pretty much share my opinion, I think.


** I've got a couple of favourite at the moment! I don't know if they're your style but the writing is extremely good so you'll probably be hooked even if they don't contain your favourite pairing. I've also included my own since it could right up your alley if you like AUs.

**** Haha, yup, some of the best Harry and Remus I've ever read, honestly. And the fact that Remus is one of my faves and not very popular in the HP fanfic makes me looove how well he is done here! The author is one of my inspiration for the fic in writing!

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning.

  Tom Riddle is a frightening coil of darkness, cruelty, and greatness, and changing him is Harry's only hope for saving people he loves. Going back in time, he takes Tom from the orphanage, but his optimism shatters with every year they spend together.Tom still longs for darkness. Tom stifles him in his possessiveness. Tom is fixated on him to the point of destroying the world just to keep him.But Harry loves him. And the future changes.

  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know. Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. It isn't long before they're tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?
