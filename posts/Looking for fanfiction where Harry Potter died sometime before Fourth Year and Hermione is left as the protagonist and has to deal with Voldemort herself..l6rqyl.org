So, I don't know how many of you will get this, but I recently remembered something I read a while back comparing the protagonist (Taylor Hebert) of a story I like (Worm by Wildbow) to what Hermione likely would've been like without Harry (Assuming she wasn't killed by the Troll). Are there any stories like this, where Harry is out of the picture and Hermione has to make tough choices for the greater good to save Magical Britain without the leadership/friendship of a lucky combat-focused prophecy-child?\\
Harry doesn't have to be dead, just out of the picture and incapable (or unwilling) of taking his place as the child of prophecy. Alternatively, the prophecy could just be bullshit.


** Harry is still alive (and fem!Harry) in this one, but she wasn't in Hogwarts to deal with the regular Shit-of-the-Year and apparently that burden fell to Hermione. She's still a Smart!Hermione and a Loner!Hermione, but she's about as tired, PTSD-ridden, and cranky as you'd expect Hermione to be while being the One-Woman-Army of Hogwarts. It's a cross-over with Hunger Games, but I skip those bits because I don't know anything about Hunger Games and I don't think I've particularly missed much.

Hermione Granger and the Missing Friend is sort-of-but-not-quite what you're asking for - it's just the only other recommendation I have that's even close, so I thought I'd drop it in anyway. Standard Harry-runs-away-in-Fifth-Year fic, but with some slightly different spins and more emphasis on Hermione trying to hold shit together while he's away.

  Rose Potter disappeared at the age of six. In Hermione Granger's sixth year, the Goblet of Fire summons a girl trained to be the champion of a very different kind of game. They wanted a saviour. They got the Snow Queen.

  Isolating Harry over the summer before 5th year didn't work out like Dumbledore had hoped. Now, with her friend having run away, Hermione is left to pick up the pieces, trying to stand strong against the challenges in a school where racism and injustice are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged by some teachers. All she can do is wonder how Harry made it all look so easy!

** If you like worm you might like..

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/121/][A Wand for Skitter]] by ShayneT. Waking in the body of a murdered child, Taylor Hebert, once a super villain and later a super hero must discover who has been killing muggleborns while being forced to go to Hogwarts, among groups who are the most likely suspects. complete. FFNet.

Apparently the characterization of Taylor is a bit off, but if you set that aside I think it's a great read. I have never read Worm and I love it.

*** I read like 1/3-2/3 of it, and while I liked it at first, I realized (though only after it was pointed out to me) that Taylor was COMPLETELY out of character, completely OOC meme exaggeration of her when she was a Warlord. After that, I just couldn't get myself to enjoy it.
