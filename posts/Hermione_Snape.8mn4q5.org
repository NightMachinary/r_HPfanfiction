Hey I was trying to find some fanfics I read back in the day, but I can't remember what they're called. They're both Snape/Herminone, and they may have been deleted, but if anyone else remembers them that would be great. The first one is kind of a reverse roll fic, where Hermione is the mean potions professor, and Snape is the young student, expect he's in love with her. I remember there being a blue rose in it too or something? The second one is a time travel fic where Herimone goes back in time multiple times and changes the future so that Snape never dies. It starts out with her cleaning out his house, and wishing that more people appreciated what he did for the war effort, and then she goes back in time and meets him while he's still a death eater. It goes back and forth and eventually everyone thinks of Snape as a hero. Thanks!

*** Yeah that's the one! and as she goes back and forth it become a better memorial.

Thanks for much for your help! I'm just glad someone else remembers them too
