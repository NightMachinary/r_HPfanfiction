Despite being somewhat fond of the pairing, I haven't read an H/Hr fic and enjoyed it in a really long while. Part of this has to do with the sheer dearth of quality writing, cast aside in favour of the really awful tropes we've come to associate with the H/Hr fandom. So, I'd really like to read a proper fic between Harry and Hermione that doesn't make me want to puke, for a change.

This means no Dumbledore Bashing, no soul bonds, none of that love potion shite (which means no Weasley bashing overall), and no obnoxious neckbeardisms (looking at you, Robst, you human paraquat). I'd prefer it to be post-Hogwarts, but I won't sneeze at one taking place during the trio's school years. And please, if it's humour, make sure it's actually funny, instead of being a poor attempt at it.

As for the explanation, paraquat was supposedly sprayed on Mexican marijuana fields by the U.S. government back in the day, in hopes of killing the marijuana, which makes "human paraquat" literally a human buzzkill. Which, in this case, just means wanker.

** I really like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1798/1][Lucky]] by napalmnacey. Here is my review for DLP (where it was sorted into Almost Recommended):

#+begin_quote
  A five-chapter dimension travel novella written pre-HBP, /Lucky/ is one of those rare stories that gets in, does its thing, and gets out before succumbing to bloat and lack of direction.

  It is, in essence, a sweet and angst-driven Harry/Hermione vehicle . . . but it is also a damn good one, and surprisingly original despite (more likely, because of) its age. While grieving the death of Sirius, a Pensieve-like maguffin allows Harry to visit a world in which Voldemort was never born. To his horror, he quickly realizes that this world may be even darker than the one he left behind.

  Napalmnacey's grip on characterization and character voice is stupendous. Harry's grief over Sirius's death, which we've all read ten hundred times before, is refreshingly human and genuine. So too are the interactions between Harry, Ron (who is favorably portrayed for the only time ever in an H/HR story), and Hermione. The characterization of Albus Dumbledore is pitch-perfect (he at once is compassionate, mysterious, and subtlety arrogant; and he seems to think of Harry in many ways as an equal). The alternate dimension versions of Ron, Draco, and others are at once drastically different and yet recognizably similar to their canon counterparts.

  Otherwise, the alternate version of Wizarding Britain is compelling. The dialogue is organic and hits all the right beats. The prose is tight and the mechanics solid. In the loss column, the premise doesn't hold up to all that much scrutiny, sometimes the author is overly strong on the angst and the H/Hr vibes, and there's at least one discomfiting moment w/r/t institutionalized power dynamics and consent that the author never really addresses.

  To those who would (reasonably) expect that something published in 2004 on Portkey.org couldn't possibly be worth their time, at least consider reconsidering. In full disclosure . . . those allergic to wonky conceptions of determinism, beware. Those wont to think Harry is a "bitch" because he weeps once over the depth of a loved one, or those wont to think on general principal that Hermione should die in a fire, need not apply.

  But those weary of the dread words "a certain bushy-haired witch," rejoice.

**** Stories written before the completion of the books are fascinating---the authors are playing with entirely different assumptions and an entirely different universe. This is one of the first stories I remember from my early forays into fanfiction, and definitely the only one of that group that holds up to any degree of scrutiny.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a great, if very angsty, Harmony fic without any of the usual accompanying Harmonian bullshit (i.e. Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, et cetera). Dimensional travel plays a large part, as does Luna.

** All my HP stories are H/Hr so far, and none of them bash Weasleys - even if it may look like it at the start. All but "Marriage Law Revolution" also have a good, skilled Dumbledore. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]]

*** I'm not at all sure about Thresholds. I can't really tell if I like it or not. I'm halfway through, and it seems like the whole thing is overly verbose. It might just be a bit too late/early to be reading it, but a lot of the writing feels [[/r/iamverysmart]]- ish.

** linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829)

Classic plot-driven dystopian epic focusing on Hermione (seeing as Harry is captured in the first chapter). Lots of characters are churned up in this and Harry seems dis-empowered, but the last third or so is where Harry recovers his awesomeness.

Lorien829 is good when you yearn for H/Hr with some bite.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

** I haven't found any H/Hr stories I like better than [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]. It features rather excellent characterization and avoids horrible tropes generally associated with H/Hr and vampires.

The only real criticism I have of it is that the beginning is probably a bit slower than it could be.
