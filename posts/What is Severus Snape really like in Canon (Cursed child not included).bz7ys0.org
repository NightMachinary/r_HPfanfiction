Thanks to Alan Rickman and the fanfiction of the world, Snape has gone from greasy git to byronic hero. And somewhere along the way I've confused it with Canon!

So I'd love your insights on his character, as he was written in Canon.

- did he actually have a pleasant voice? I only recall it being written as "soft".
- was he described as anything other than ugly, greasy, hooked nosed and sallow of skin?
- was he tall or is this fanfic desire?

What are Snapes....

- likes/dislikes

  • insecurities

  • strengths and weaknesses

  • things he values

  • fears

Other questions...

• do other people like Snape? Why or why not?

• why did he love Lily so much?

• is he vain?

- does he have any friends on staff? I feel like he has a moment with McGonagall wearing a Christmas hat but I don't know of that was from a fic as well!\\
- is Snape capable of love or just obsession?
- was Snape actually a wizard on par with Dumbledore in terms of power before he died? Flight, sectum Sempra, etc.

Any other insights you'd like to share? He's my favorite character so any insights you have are gratefully read!


** He's described as having black eyes and to be bat-like on top of sallow-skinned, greasy and hook-nosed. He might also have a dramatic and fast-paced walk as I think his robes are often described to 'billow' behind him when he walks.

His talents were, according to canon, in three areas: occlumency, potions and the dark arts. Occlumency is supposed to be a rare and very obscure skill in canon and Voldemort is hinted at as being the greatest legilimens around. Snape was better at occlumency than Voldemort was at legilimency. I don't think it's ever suggested that he was better than Voldemort at anything else.

Potions he's clearly excellent at, although teaching maybe wasn't his true calling. He's good enough at potions to be able to be able to tweak the instructions to established potions.

Curses, jinxes and hexes seems to have been a hobby of his even before he got to Hogwarts. Someone (maybe Sirius?) says he knew more as a first year than half the seventh years at Hogwarts. We also see him writing excessively long answers for his DADA OWLs, which suggests he is like Hermione when it comes to that subject.

He's also an inventor of spells. Canon says he invented 'sectumsempra', and it is possible that he either invented or tweaked the spells 'muffliato' and 'leviocorpus'. The latter seems unlikely as someone else (maybe Lupin?) says it's an example of a spell that's gone in and out of fashion amongst young people to trick each other with. It's non-verbal, which makes it unlikely to have been Snape's creation as it couldn't really catch on as something fashionable if nobody could hear the incantation used and it wasn't an established one that could be found in a book.

Dumbledore and later Harry sees him as extrememly courageous. Seemingly the worst insult for Snape is to be called a coward, which happens several times in canon.

He's clearly very insecure about his school days and has not forgiven or forgotten like most adults do. I believe in what Lupin says in canon, which is that Snape got as good as he gave when it came to the bullying between mainly Snape and James Potter, but I think a lot of people interpret that differently. Clearly the two of them had an on-going feud throughout their school years on top of what seems to have been a similar Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry to what is still happening in Hogwarts when Harry goes to school.

Snape was absolutely in love with Lily and I think it's normal for kids to be obsessive when they're 'in love'. He never seems to have grown out of it, though, and it certainly wasn't healthy for him later on. Depending on how he went about it it might have been very unpleasant for her, too, not to mention unfair as it seems she wanted him in her life as a friend but didn't return his romantic feelings. The child and teen-aged Lily we see in the memories seems oblivious of his feelings for her.

He had friends at school if we believe Lily in the memories (Mulciber and Avery I think) but someone else (can't remember who) remembers him as a loner in school. Lily was his best friend until fifth year, after which she cut ties with him. From what she says, she had been building up to it for some time, couldn't stand his other friends and hated how he already then was on the path to becoming a Death Eater. The 'mudblood' slur was the straw that broke the camel's back. He tried to ask for forgiveness after that but she didn't give it.

In his capacity as a Death Eater he later caused the death of Lily and James. He thought he had a deal with Voldemort and that she would be spared, but obviously she wasn't. This leads to him changing sides. In the memory with Dumbledore it's made clear that he doesn't care that James died because of his actions, and that the reason he will work for Dumbledore and work to keep Harry alive is to honour Lily's memory.

As an adult he absolutely detests Sirius, who returns those feelings, and Lupin, who doesn't. Whether or not he knew Sirius was innocent and Pettigrew the traitor and therefore could have saved Sirius from Azkaban is not stated in canon. Some Death Eaters knew Pettigrew was the traitor (Sirius hears them talk about it in their sleep in Azkaban) but it's never clarified if Snape knew. Because of the 'prank' Sirius played on him he is happy for Sirius to become a dementor and he outs Lupin as a werewolf seemingly out of pettiness.

His friends on the staff appear to be few. Filch and Dumbledore might be friends in a way, but I think it seems like he's become very lonely after the first war. Most people seem to either dislike him or be scared of him.

One characteristic of his in canon is his bitterness. Life turned out bad for him and he has not let it go. He takes this out on students he doesn't like, Harry, Hermione and Neville being prime examples of this. Bullying children as an adult makes him seem petty and unreasonable and maybe there's some arrested development going on. It's possible to argue that he shows great strength of character too, as he continues living and starts working for Dumbledore and Hogwarts after he realizes he is responsible for Lily's murder. He seems to have few personal goals after this event, though, suggesting he stays alive and successfully lives his double life as atonement for what he did.

**** Thanks for digging out the quotes! I think we're mostly in agreement.

I don't think what Snape felt for Lily as an adult was any sort of healthy love, that wasn't what I meant at all. My point was rather that children are weird and his obsession with her when he was a boy is somewhat understandable, if not ideal, for that reason. He was a child and he was a bit weird and repressed and he may not have had any other friends before Hogwarts. Once he got older he should have gotten over her and realized he had no right to her or her affections. After school, he should likewise have gotten over his old jealousy of James and in consequence Harry. Snape the adult is very flawed that way. I agree that he never cared about Harry, I think canon makes it clear he only helped Harry (and Dumbledore) because of Lily.

As for the inventions, he definitely wrote all of those spells in the margins of his potions book, so it might be that he invented all of them. I think it's possible that he copied some of them from other books and wrote them there to remember them or to tweak them into something better, but I might be completely wrong in saying that.

***** You're welcome. We are agreement nearly everything you mentioned.

I agree somewhat and not blame Snape for his obsession because of his upbringing he clearly latches (The first word came to my mind) onto Lily and I blame his father when he is a child.

#+begin_quote
  Harry had already attempted a few of the *Prince's self-invented spells*. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity

  “*/Sectum/* --- !”

  Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, */Levi/* ---

  “No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.

  “You dare use my own *spells* against me, Potter? It was I who invented *them* --- I, the Half-Blood Prince! And *you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father*, would you? I don't think so . . . no!”

Snape uses spells and them to refer the two spell Harry tried to use on him. Also, as far as we know James used only Levicorpus on Snape and his response pretty clear I think.

** Before describing the character, I think it's best to remember that the whole story is seen by the reader from the eyes of Harry Potter who is :

- Extremely picky (seriously I don't think he described more than 10 people as "beautiful" or "handsome" in the whole 7 books
- Far from objective (him and Snape hate each other, and he would push his worst trait even in his mind)

But even with this, some of Snape confirmed physical trait (Sallowed skin, greassy hair, hooked noose and crooked teeth) would make him average at best, and more likely a little ugly. I also don't remember him either being described as "tall", (he may seem imposing for children, but around adults I guess he would be of average height).

As for his voice, I don't remember him either being described in one way of the other. So once again I think it's a pretty normal voice (not murder inducing like Umbridge, but not hot enough to make someone come as some fic would say). I would guess that it's a feared voice, but more because of who it belongs rather than how it sounds.

​

For the character in himself :

- I always saw Snape as the "researcher" kind, the type of guy who, if not for the war, would withdraw himself into his research, only emerging once a year to publish his results and buy groceries (and only if he can't find an assistant to do it for him). His 2 main passions seemed to be the Dark Art, and Potions, and I don't think he really liked anything or anyone else.
- For his dislike : James Potter and his spawn. More seriously, because of his talent and lack of social skill, I picture teenage Snape as one of these bright children who never socialize and consider themselves better than anyone else (what Hermione may have ended up if not for the Troll). So Snape probably disliked pretty much anyone not good enough to follow his "standards". Also, these kind of children are extremely pridefull, so I think he would hate anything hurting his pride, so in Snape case mainly the Maraudeurs. Of course, James would have a special place in his hate list for 2 reasons :

  - James managed to get something he could not, Lily Evans
  - James saved his life, he want to hate him, but know that he owe him his life. To know that he is indebted to someone he hate must have teared him inside and ultimately make him hate James even more.

- His strenghts would be his talent, mainly in the Dark Art, Potion and the Mind Art. As for his weakness, it would be his inability to let the past go, and a tendency to blame himself. Unlike most of the other Death Eater, Snape didn't have the blind belief that Muggleborns were trash (though he probably thought so for Muggles), he didn't have the pride that some other Death Eaters had, stopping them from betraying Voldemort or at least to leave the country, and he had the talent to be accepted anywhere. Snape would leave the war at almost any moment, and yet he chose to sacrifice his life because he blamed himself for his mistakes.
- For fear, he didn't seem to have any, and even accepted Death. Maybe werewolves for the pas trauma?

​

I don't think Snape had any "friend", even among the staff. He probably had some "friendly acquaintances", but because of his status of spy (and the fact that deeply down, he is really a really impleasant person) stopped him to really open to anyone. The person he was closest to seemed to be Dumbledore, and even there it was more a Mentor relationship than true friendship.

For his talent, he was good, really good, but not good enough to be on the same level than Dumbledore or Voldemort. He was a good enough Occlumens to food Voldemort (supposed to be the best Legilimens), but if both of them were to fight to their best, Snape would loose. But I'm not sure he would not have been able to reach them, or get closer with more time.

​

In conclusion, I think that Snape was a bad person, who happened to be depressed by his past (and the role he played in the death or Lily). I think he truly loved Lily, but I'm not sure it was "marital love" (he needed her presence in his life, but as a lover? I'm not so sure).\\
And yet, for all his flaws (and how he bullied Harry all these years just because he was the son of an old enemy), Snape did make his best to protect Harry, and played his part in the war against Voldemort. So I would describe him as "a bad person who did the right thing".

** I view him as being under Dumbledore and Voldemort in terms of skill.

In the books he's a deluded sociopath who thinks he loved Lily and pretty much is irredeemable.

In the movies I view him as all the positive things you said above. Alan Rickman played to the spirit of the character better. Snape in the movies put himself in front of a werewolf to save 3 kids he wasn't fond of. Movie Snape is great.

** One major problem when it comes to his personality is that he's portrayed far more positively in the movies. He's still an ass, but not nearly as cruel, and has a more noticeable protective instinct over Harry and his friends (PoA). Since I'm far more attuned to movie canon, this /does/ affect my headcanon of him, which is almost exclusively assimilated from movie canon alone.

I believe his feelings for Lily originated from the fact that she was the only person who truly cared for him for most of his childhood and teenage years, and was his only genuine friend. While I believe there was plenty of people cordial with him in Slytherin, I believe it mostly grew out of mutual benefit more than anything else, and not true affection. People generally like to call it obsession, but I think he genuinely loved her, not simple obsession (I think that had it been obsession alone, it wouldn't affect his Patronus guardian). However, just because the love was genuine doesn't make it healthy -- unresolved issues between him, Lily, and Marauders coupled with an overall emotionally abused life, and the pressure of being a spy, led to him being unable to move on and he ends up mentally stuck in the past maturity-wise, which is why he's as petty as he is in canon. I do believe that had he survived, he'd be able to resolve things and move on in the end.

As for everything else, people have already commented better than I can word things.
