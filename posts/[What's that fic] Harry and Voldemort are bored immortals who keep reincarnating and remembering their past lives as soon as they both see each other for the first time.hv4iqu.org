:END:
Hi all, pretty much what the title says! I remember them both being fairly bored immortals and reincarnating into all sorts of different lives (which I think they numbered?). One time they both reincarnated and went to the same girl's school if I recall as well, I think they were also in a relationship in several lives, although I can't remember if that was the case in the 'current' life. If anyone knows which fic this is that'd be appreciated!


** I believe it is called full circle.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
