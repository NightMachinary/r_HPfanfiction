So this is a real long shot, but on FFn there was this trilogy that I believe was not finished by author Adi Phoenix, starts with 'From Dark to Light Then Back Again' about Snape's daughter coming from America and fighting in the war.

It's awesome, has new magic, new creature species and then the sequel goes back into the founders time. I have the first book in the series saved on my hardrive, but I am hoping that someone may have saved the sequel? Long shot I know, but I just reread it and am itching to continue.


** Never heard of it but I wouldnt mind reading the first book.
