This is a separate side request but I am also looking for fics where Harry has tattoos and a few piercings that aren't yaoi because apparently that's seemingly impossible. I've noticed a trend with males and tattoos in fanfiction, pretty sure most are written by females thus I am not sure how to feel about that but I digress, indulge me.


** linkffn(Blindness) has most of your requests (no tattoos though).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** One because the tatoo's and piercings and smoking is a very very stupid idea for him. but also because Harry is incredibly out of character for no reason. I don't mind him being ooc if theirs a good explanation but jesus christ

****** Soooo the fact that his godfather, the single closest thing he had to family, died a bit before the start of the story and Harry is in such a mental condition that says "fuck it all, new start cause that's what Sirius would want" (which is a logical if not really touching theme)....this whole reason is no reason good enough for Harry to be totaly ooc?

The end of fifth year and the start of the following summer is the best choice a writer has to write a completely differnt, in personality, Harry. The poor lad went through such trauma and stress, and peolpe make bad choices in such situations. In Runic Animagi, they turned out to not be that bad after all, but still...Harry acted like a normal, frustrated teenager that simply lost almost everything in the world.

*** I liked this fic, up until it started being mainly about sex or Harry being a 'I have sex with every woman in canon', along with slow pacing, and the OPness he gets.

Once a character stops development the fic gets stale.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
