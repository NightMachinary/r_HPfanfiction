I don't like it when the pairing is spoiled for me in the summary of a story. I don't want to know that two characters end up together from the get-go. I want to see two characters struggle with romance and maybe even not end up together. I find it more entertaining that way. It's certainly more memorable to me that way.

Of course, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with wanting to know what exactly you're getting into. I just find it a bit disappointing. To each their own, though.


** I agree. Not because of the justification, but because your reasons are fair. If someone doesn't want to know the pairing, maybe the summary isn't the best place.

BUT, as my own personal preference, I like to know what the pairing is. There are some pairings I just simply don't do or ones I'm specifically, and I would like to know that before hand. Perhaps a better place would be at the top of the story itself with a spoiler warning. It still has the chance of not surprising someone, who reads all the author notes, etc., but I think it's the closest an author can get to "best of both worlds" so to speak.

** My personal issue with this is that a pairing isn't interesting in and of itself, for me. Stories where romance is involved but the pairing is to be determined are usually boring for me because of the copious, usually poorly done "will they, won't they". It basically assumes that the reader (me, in this case) is solely interested in the characters hooking up. I prefer seeing how the paired characters interact and grow in their relationship over the "reward" of them ending up to together.

*** Yeah, I prefer a pairing to be established before the story begins, as in the characters got together before the story begins and it's like a character study of the pair. I'm writing a Sci-Fi RWBY story right now and while the pairing isn't particularly hard to write, and the characters have chemistry, I just struggle to write the initial part of the relationship for whatever reason. For this story I realized it didn't add anything special to do that, so it starts in media res now, and I think the story is better for it as a result.

** I think there are plenty of people who would agree with you. That being said, pairings are how we filter and search FFN. I've suggested before that the pairing also reveals the plot. Political stories tend to involve DG and 'pureblood culture', competent ministry stories pair with Susan Bones because they use her for her aunt. I had a bunch more but the point was that the romance facilitated external factors. Its become rather useful as a way of finding stories that fulfil certain requirements but true romance stories have suffered for it as have ones with multiple relationships before someone settles down. Personally I'll take the lack of mystery until FFN gives us a better way to filter. I'm fully aware of Scryer but filters are much easier for me on my surface.

** The thing is, I agree with you in principle, but in practice, there are major pitfalls. First, I do want a "slash" vs. "no slash" warning, and I suspect a lot of other people would too based on their preferences, but that wouldn't have to spoil the pairing. The real problem is that everyone has pairings that they hate. Like I won't touch Hermione/Snape because /Why would they ever get together?!/ And I'll nope out of a fic on the spot if that happens, even as a side pairing (which it rarely is).

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people for whom Harry/Ginny or Harry/Anyone But Hermione or sometimes even Harry/Hermione itself /is/ that Berserk Button, so in practice, it's better to announce your pairing up front than to get a bunch of angry reviews about it when it's revealed.

** Yeah that's a weird opinion. In a romance story the pairing isn't a mystery and it will be fairly obvious early on with or without the summary. [The only exception being love triangle stories, but usually authors of those are smart enough not to spoil their own story]

In an adventure/horror/mystery fic pairings, shipping and relationship angst shouldn't play a major role and it won't matter to have the pairing "spoiled". Would you really care if someone told you before reading HP that Hermione and Ron end up together in the end? JKR understood that she wasn't writing a romance novel, the pairing really doesn't matter that much, playing an extremely minor role.

In fanfiction on the other hand the pairing says a lot about the story and the author's (potentially weird) opinions. If I read a story and you're going to spring a Tomione pairing as a surprise on me and start to explain that the pure-blood agenda isn't all that bad I'm going to leave an angry review and certainly won't think "I was so glad that the pairing was kept a secret!!111"

Edit: Just as an addendum... I think "How I Met Your Mother" tried to do the whole romance&mystery fusion and I think very very few people loved the final season and loved being "surprised" that Ted ends up with some random girl who dies. Most people thought it was stupid.

** You definitely have a point. I do think though, that for readers who do want to know the pairing, it's based on the fact that we know what each pairing is going to look like, or at least some semblance of it. I can always tell that a fic with Snarry is going to be uncomfortable, and not in an intentional and thought-provoking way. Harry/Ginny, while it does have a wide range of possibilities, is still fairly predictable, same with Harry/Hermione. Of course, there's always the slight possibility of a significant twist to the pairing, but it's rare.

Specifically it almost certainly has Snape in a overly sympathetic role. I mean we are already at the point where I won't even touch stories that have Snape or Voldemort tagged in general (as characters) at all, because 99% of those don't just give them a major role (which might be fine), but go way farther than that. If the pairing is Harry/Snape or Harry/Voldemort that percentage goes up to 100% and even if I were interested in slash I wouldn't bother with the story.

And that's IMHO the *best* those stories have to offer. Stories critical of Ron get a lot of flack for flanderizing his character, but at least he's a character.

In the usual Ron/Hermione stories they are just as bland as wallpaper most of the time and worst of all they act as some kind of amalgamation of their characters - literally a Romione instead of two individuals. "Ron&Hermione enter, give some obvious advice, Ron makes a joke, Hermione punches him on the shoulder, end scene" aren't they great?

Yeah that's what bugs me. I'd still want it to work out for them in the end, but have some bumps, difficulties, compromises along the way. I've only seen very few fics that actually handled that right. Only one I can recall was a time travel fic with Belatric Black.

There are also lots of people who would give bad reviews if they were unpleasant surprised by the outcome. Eww not GINNY! And there are people repulsed by slash. And then there are those who want romance vs smut, smut vs filthy, etc. So, spoilers rule.

** I'm starting to be swayed to the OP's opinion on the matter. When I first entered into the FF community, I definitely liked knowing what the pairing of a story was going to be. To some extent, I still like knowing what the pairing is going to be, but not because I'm particularly invested in a certain pairing - it's usually because I'm trying to avoid particular pairings.

But, after posting the first chapter of FF that I've ever wrote, I do find it sorta annoying that 75% of the reviews I've received seem to be solely concerned on what the pairing is going to be. I mean, it's quite the AU story and /that/ is the only thing you wish to comment on??

*** Because people like to know if they should invest time into the story because they like/despise certain pairings or even the characters themselves. Lets say that your first chapter is a fairly generic yet well written "Hermione gets thrown into the past and comes across a mysterious man". That mystery guy could be anyone, from Sirius Black or Snape to Simo Häyha (The white Death).

I am not interested in reading about "Poor Snape/Tom Riddle who only needs a woman's guidance" or Sirius "I'm a womaniser but will fall for Hermione for some odd reason", but I would be down for Hermione ripping apart Soviet Invasion armies in Karelia with Fiendfyre and the resulting alt history.

I don't care about pairings, I'm simply not interested in a lot (any Weasley besides Ginny, the Marauders, any Death Eater, Voldemort, Anyone borm before 1950, anyone from the Next Generation) of characters

** If the story is a romance genre story, then that's the convention anyway. Even in original romantic fiction, the main protagonists are made clear in the blurb. So it's not much different to that.

If the main genre isn't romance, then maybe there's more flexibility. But though I don't look /for/ specific pairings, there are a few that I absolutely loathe. To find one of those rearing its ugly head if I was well into a story would be quite frustrating and I'd definitely stop reading.

On the other hand, there are certain pairings I like to avoid (99% of Draco/Harry, for example), and the pairings help me to avoid this. Similarly, I also have a weakness for certain unusual pairings (Harry/Tonks <3 my OTP) and it would be impossible to find these without such a spoiler. Most of the time, though, I'm looking for themes rather than pairings (time travel, whimsical magic, etc).

It'd be cool if there were certain tag categories (pairings would be most important) which could be kept hidden by default. It would help you and people who think the same way to avoid having their reading spoilt before it begins.

IMHO you can do anything else - make the character smarter, angry (or angrier if the character already is a pretty angry), disciplined, pair him/her with another character etc. but don't tamper with a character's sexuality! If the character is homosexual in canon? Yeah, leave him/her that way!)

b) Not Harry/Ginny (I am burned out on that pairing and I maintain that it doesn't make much sense! Harry hates his fame, so getting together with the fangirl number 1 is kind of counterproductive!)
