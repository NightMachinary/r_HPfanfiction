** Gilderoy Lockhart's personal memoirs (not his novels), written in the style of the Flashman books. Gilderoy finds himself with practically no resources and no skills (save obliviate, money and a ready smile) a) trying to find and locate the people with the stories he steals in situations where he doesn't realise how dangerous it is, or b) the Ministry forces him to work secret cases for them despite his incompetence.

Harry learns to say no, I can't save your community today, Junior's got a game and I'm supposed to go out to dinner, I still have to write my self evaluation, and I haven't seen my mates in over a month. I'm sorry but I just can't deal with whatever uprising it is right now, have you tried someone else?

** The weather was damp and uncomfortable with freezing wind blowing across empty streets of an abandoned city block. A lone man was walking slowly with a huge limp on is left side and, if you focused your hearing, you could make out small metallic clinks as his left leg moved. The wrist on his left hand was unnaturally still with total absence of small twitches and jerks you could usually see even in the most fit of people and the left side of his once handsome face was completely covered in horrendous scar tissue. Where a left eye should've been, there was a metal contraption one could often see in a modern science-fiction movies and video games. Suddenly, there was a scream disturbing a perfectly silent and, some might even say, serene environment. The man's head jerked in the direction of the building the scream was most probably coming from, lenses in his left eye refocusing and adjusting to the distance. His limp sped up in the direction of the sound and suddenly in his right arm there was a wooden stick permeated with cracks and small grooves and in his left appeared a pistol one might recognize as a Glock 17.

Can you make something out of that?

** After losing a bet, Draco Malfoy and a few other students have to get from a small muggle town in Scotland near Hogwarts all the way to London as fast as possible without any magical means. Hitchhiking? A taxi? Or take a train? Direct to London, or to the nearest major city first and then take a plane?

*** Depends what you mean by "fastest". Given a finish line of King's Cross (the one London location they all know) and the general theorized locations of Hogwarts (ie in the highlands in centralish Scotland, south of Inverness) the least amount of time spent traveling would probably be to get to Inverness, take the 80 minute flight to Heathrow, and then (unless you are /really/ blowing money on this) ride the Piccadilly for just under an hour directly to King's Cross. So a little under 2 and a half hours (plus the time to get to Inverness).

 

As to whom would get there /first/? Presuming rules of they can start anywhere that is not further south than the starting town (because having them all start in a group just means people copying each other and because nthey don't /truly/ understand how Muggle travel works), the most clever one would simply say they are renting a room for the night in Inverness as their starting point. The other competitors don't need to know that that room, while tiny, is on a Caledonian sleeper.

 

They enter their room at 8:30 p.m., have a goods night's rest, and wake up on the first day of the race to see that by 7:47 a.m. their room has travelled to King's Cross for them!

** James and Lily were the ones driven to insanity, not Frank and Alice.

Remus ended up sitting with Severus and Lily on the train in their first year.

Spy Percy Weasley. How he's the spy, is up to you.

Ron, after the stories from his dad, and spending time with Hermione, has a fascinating with Muggle things, and wants to try and put them together.

Vernon Dursley died when Dudley was still a baby, and that changes how Harry is raised drastically.

Interesting interactions with the Slytherin students, making them not as dark as some might believe.

Hermione ends up loving Potions, and wanting to become a Potion Master herself.

Harry decides he's had enough killing dark witches and wizards, and decides to do something else, what that is, is up to you.

After a Weasley Wizard Wheezes project goes wrong, Harry and some others end up becoming younger, then they were.

Sirius somehow manages to be brought back from beyond the veil, and is freed of the crimes that they had accused him of.

** Snape and Sirius meet each other when they're really, really young (like five or six) and decide that since they're both in unhappy family situations, they're going to run away together. A few days/a week later they're tracked down and seperated, until they meet again at Hogwarts.

Basically, I wanna see a Sirius who sticks up for Snape without question, and a Snape who becomes fast friends with the Mauraders.

** Idk I've always had this idea of a gryffindor harry that is a powerful student and as seen as intimidating by other(younger and older) students and still manages to be playful with his friends?

I've seen the same trope but the authors make harry stuck up and too serious for a teen. (And they also make him more powerful than dumbledore and Voldemort together)

** What I really wanted to find is something that involves Hermione, Time Travel and the Marauders! I've read tons of these fanfics but I've never really liked them! My idea is that Hermione travels in time, she gets stuff done, becomes friends with the marauders and marries a Slytherin? Maybe, I don't know. Something that I think has to be included is that Hermione needs time to mourn, she has trauma from the war and most times that isn't represented.
