** I would suggest a few of FloreatCastellum's fics, because she and JKR have the same philosophy about what makes a good story: humor and warmth, but also loss and struggle. I think so much of the bulk of HP fanfic is so serious or grim or overly formal that Rowling would just roll her eyes and tell people that they'd missed the point entirely.

Probably “The Aurors,” “The Colour of Everything,” “Tired,” or “Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake.”

i thought Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake was fantastic but i thought the aurors was a naff HP story, loads of ways they could have solved it with a couple spells, even canon spells not just cliche fanfic trope spells. However i thought it was a great little detective story and if the author stripped out the HP characters, pretty much the one spell used in the story and added some world building back story to replace the HP, it could easily be sold on amazon

****** I mean to be honest the common criticism of veritaserum never made sense to me because there's plenty of times in canon where Rowling conveniently hand waves it away too. It's an over powered tool that she never really utilised in canon, and as someone who reads very little fanfic I hadn't realised how prevalent it was in other stories and how much people expected it to be used. But yes in general it becomes more difficult to write a procedural drama when people can vanish into thin air!

That's not the only issue with the fic... but it's rather understandably the one most likely to turn people off.

In a recent controversy, a company mistakenly used a fanart instead of an original to advertise the video game, they eventually had to retract the image and apologize to the creator.

**** There are lots of little details, like the lack of houses at the schools, the stronger presence of extra-curricular clubs like the Wizard Scouts and Junior Regiment Officers, the inclusion of American folklore like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodag][Hodag]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_panther][Underwater Panther]] etc. etc., which helps to sell the idea that Wizarding America has a distinct culture from Wizarding Britain. It also feels much more diverse; we get to see and hear about many different cultures living alongside one another: Old Colonial cultures, which have remained largely unchanged since the early days of European colonisation, Native American cultures, non-European immigrant cultures, etc. all of which have different levels of autonomy and assimilation. The political situation of the so called "American Wizarding Confederation" is quite complicated, and we get to learn a lot about it and its early history.

Perhaps as a natural consequence of trying to govern such a large, diverse, and politically divided collection of territories, the government of AQ's America is much more corrupt and authoritarian than that of Wizarding Britain. The Confederation tries to portray itself as democratic and egalitarian, while almost all power remains vested in the hands of a small number of powerful, aristocratic families. Classism and blood supremacy are much more entrenched than they were in Britain: Alexandra's school of Charmbridge Academy only recently started accepting non-pure blood students. Freedom of speech and the press are heavily restricted, with the threat of dark-wizards used as an excuse to pass increasingly draconian laws which often end up targeted at political opponents, or at anyone who dare threaten the status quo. There are a lot of parallels with the real America, especially the political climate post-9/11.

** Serious suggestion: linkao3(11457669). It offers an original take on the "Snape apologizes" trope with the twist of not much about canon changing. Instead it's an indepth examination of Snape's mind and past and presented and a hint of his future, with the some of the most impactful prose I've ever read. It shows all the minor inconsequential moments in the life of a Snape who apologized, expressing the resulting changes to his relationship with Lily and the Marauderers without any grand plot changes.

Half serious suggestion: linkao3(67766) The only way I can describe this fic is as crack played straight. And yet, the only part of it that feels cracky is the premise, whereas all the characterizations and dialogue come across as consistently grounded, including the variety of OCs. In a world where fics with accurate characterizations of Snape are far and few between, this somehow comes across as surprisingly true to life, especially considering that in this fic he is the bald, raybans wearing owner of a rural American diner that employs ex gangsters. (this is a Canon divergence, not a full on au. Snape was still Harry's teacher in hogwarts as per Canon prior to the story)

I would recommend these specifically to JK because 1) no one else has and 2) they feature interesting alternate universes where Snapes is in a very different position than in Canon, and yet the spirit of his character remains unchanged from canon.

"You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.

** I'd recommend 'Dodging Prison and stealing witches: revenge is best served raw' by LeadVone. Just, besides the HP/Multi element of it, it's brilliant. Rare is a fic with any actual brains applied to it in a creative way /which doesn't let the plot die without the author's direct support/.

There are other good ones too - loads of them.

Another good one to rec is Basilisk-born, a truly nice fic.

A third candidate is Groundhog day. It's silly and stupid at times, but it's brilliant at many other times.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of time]], I think. It's got a few tropes, but it's mild and overall I find it written fairly well.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
