** I actually sort of approached this idea with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][the fic]] that I'm currently writing. it's a crossover where Harry is raised by the Black Widow from the Marvel universe. What that means is that he has a childhood being raised by one of the preeminent spies of the world, and existing around them. It necessarily affects his thought process and how he sees the world.

Apart from the sarcasm, I agree with many (but definitely not all) the criticism hpmor received over the years.

That said, it's still a great piece of fan fiction that for many has represented the entry point to rational literature.

***** It's commendable for sparking the rational literature genre, but I'm pretty sure that it's actually an actively bad piece of fanfiction. Granted, most fanfic is terrible, and at least this one has solid writing and grammar, but it's still not a good work of literature.

**** It has that throughout, and frankly the author is an ass. However it is worth reading until you get sick of it. Definitely violates your "quick moving" though.

So you understand where I'm coming from: I stopped reading it somewhere around 80-90, but I still consider it was interesting enough to recommend checking it out.

**** The Holier than thou attitude is always brought up by those critiquing the fic, but to say it pervades throughout is disengenuous. It's most apparent in the first dozen chapters or so because that's the part where Harry just sort of never loses. Harry in this work has a whole host of flaws, the greatest of which is his exceptional arrogance, and those who don't get too far into the work see little but him going around later unchecked.

The thing is, it attitude isn't a mark of the story but the flaw of its biggest character, and this shows as the story progresses. Harry is wrong about a large amount of what he does, it just takes a while for that to catch up with him. And catch up it does. Ultimately the story is mostly from his perspective, so it's a matter of a really biased narrator, but, on the off chance you ever do give it a try, note that his perceptions of reality and how awesome he is aren't how things actually are, both in and out of narrative.

** What exactly do you mean with "tries to be rational and strong"? I generally don't aim to write a Harry that wants to be irrational and weak in my stories - he usually does work harder on improving himself than in canon.

**** Sure. They can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][here]].

With regards to combat training, that is probably most featured in "Harry Potter and the Spygirl" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy", and to a lesser degree (relatively to the story size) in "Patron" and "Divided and Entwined". "Patron" features both combat training and Harry dealing with social issues, but most of the "stumbling around" stuff happens before the story starts, and he's not going to make many waves while still at school anyway, much less enter politics. "Divided and Entwined" has just entered the stage where social issues are taking center stage, though it featured special training for Harry and Ron and Hermione formed her own guerillia group with combat training.

The other stories feature Harry and co. post Hogwarts, when they are already experienced (and scarred).

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
