Are there any fics that deal with mental health in a time travel fic? I read one where Harry had PTSD and self harmed, but it wasn't at the forefront of the fic.


** If you're okay with self-recs, mental health is a big part of my fic! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28073343/chapters/68778144]]

  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

  "Make no mistake", hot breath against his ear, a whisper resembling a scream in the eerie silence of the mountains, "your pain, your blood, your life are mine. I will be the one to make you beg for death, just as I will be the one to end your pathetic existence. What pleasure will await me, as I watch your worthless lungs draw their final breath, your weak heart struggle to keep you alive, as you succumb to pain and nothingness. Your end is near, Harry."A not so typical Do-Over Fic.
