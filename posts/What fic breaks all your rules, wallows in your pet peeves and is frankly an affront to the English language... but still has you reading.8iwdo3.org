** Probably "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" - though I didn't finish it, I did get very far in (around chapter 25, I think).

linkffn(11574569)

*Harry*

The biggest problem with the fic is Harry himself. Despite being the putative main character, in many ways this fic is not really his story. Daphne, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Alex are the main characters and Harry is a catalyst for their stories. Harry himself does very little, and what he does do is largely underwhelming.

It's striking that while the others are all gaining skills, Harry is static. Everything special about Harry was acquired by shortcut, taking them directly from Voldemort, and he has done absolutely nothing to expand that skill set (or if he has, he has not been shown doing so). The magic system the author has set up is heavily focused on raw power, and it's noted that despite possessing Voldemort's skills, Harry's power falls well short. The logical response is to try to increase his skills beyond Voldemort's. But he's done nothing on that front.

Harry hasn't earned a single thing in the story. Even when useful new skills are staring him in the face - Ginny's "self-switching", for example - he doesn't acquire them himself.

*"Harry's girls"*

Despite the inordinate focus given to "Harry's girls" at the expense of Harry's own character development, what is there really to show for it? Not much.

We know each character's skills in a large amount of detail. But as people, these characters are no more developed than their fanon stereotypes. Hermione is canon Hermione with a bit more respect for "Pureblood tradition". Luna is fairly normal fanon Luna. Daphne is fanon "Ice Queen" Daphne with a bit of competitiveness added. Her single moment of character development was when she realised that all the other girls were receiving superior training to her - a moment which was never followed up on. Alex was described as a "saner Bellatrix Lestrange" in an early chapter and that phrase still completely summarises her character. The only character who has really developed significantly at all is Ginny, largely because of the conflict between her and her family.

*The Magic*

If the fic is going to spend so much time on magical development, you would hope that the magical system displayed would be a good one. Unfortunately this isn't the case.

Curiously, there are certain aspects which are done quite well, especially in the pre-Hogwarts chapters. We had, for example, significant consideration given to symbolic factors in the construction of Harry's wand. When Harry first introduced magic to Hermione, it was by having her consider things that were unmathematical and defied (Muggle) logic. And there are some nice, inventive magical methods here and there - the healing spell we saw, for example, which introduced spell casting with elements beyond just a wand (a kind of hybrid of Charms and Potions), and some interesting divination spells which are very canonical in tone (such as the one with the eyeball).

All of which makes the author's decision to go for a energy/thermodynamics approach to magic all the more disappointing. It's not just uncanonical, it also contradicts the characterisation of magic shown within the fic itself. The author is trying to use both the conceptual/symbolic approach while maintaining the “magic is energy and works through physical mechanisms” approach. The result is a terrible mishmash.

One suspects that the mechanistic approach resulted from the author wanting to depict magical theory as complex (a position I sympathise with) but falling back upon physics analogies/equations etc for this is a failure of imagination.

As always, when authors use “magic is energy”, the aim and result is to nerf magic significantly. The period of time wizards are able to cast magic at “full power” is measured in seconds. Transfiguration is no longer a permanent change in an object's nature, but rather a tactile illusion. Duels are heavily determined by power.

The Transfiguration one particularly stings given that the author later introduces “alchemy spells” which essentially do what Transfiguration does in canon. So all the author has done is take the skill of transfiguration away from most wizards and relegated it to an elite few. The difference between the two is essentially that the author's conception of alchemy as the “bridge between magic and physics” forms another attempt to make magic subordinate to the natural world rather than supernatural in nature.

There are also a number of specific instances of very strange additions to the magic system, not least the existence of deities.

On the plus side, the author is skilled at writing a magical atmosphere, so that for a moment you almost forget that the magic is completely cold, mechanical and non-mystical. An example of this is the dark ritual seen at the Hunt.

*World/politics*

There are a lot of clichés here: Lords and Ladies of a magical nobility where titles carry real political and magical power, rather than being defunct Muggle titles; child politicians; simplistic light/grey/dark factions/feudal betrothal contracts without any other aspect of feudal society being visible.

However, most of this I am willing to forgive because I confess that, when well done (e.g. Out of the Night) these things can be a guilty pleasure. I especially have a weakness for pagan magical festivals, even though they contradict canon entirely. The author even includes nice little nods to the absurdity of it, sometimes - the way the children are all exhausted on arrival at Hogwarts, or the way Kevin calls them all “nobby”, and the way there were many carriages on the train which the political kids ignored, pointing towards a large majority of regular people who aren't involved in these political games.

However, sometimes it just goes too far even for someone inclined towards forgiveness of this trope. The speeches delivered by the three “leaders” on the Hogwarts express were just painful. And the fact that, when aged-up, no one notices that these people are children in adult bodies is just absurd. Children, no matter how intelligent, are not adults trapped in small bodies. Their behaviour is fundamentally different.

One problem with this political set-up which goes beyond “cliché” or “jarring” and into “inconsistency” is the magic system the author has created. We're told that powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort are capable of taking on, say, four Aurors but not much more than that. This is a significant flattening of the magical talent bell curve compared to canon. But the author doesn't seem to have appreciated the political consequences of this: in a magical world where leading individuals are not magical superpowers but merely marginally superior to their closest peers, those leading individuals must inevitably play a less important role. It should create a far more multipolar political scene, because a group of average wizards can defy a smaller group of powerful wizards. It is essentially a democratisation of magical power and therefore politics also: when the masses hold the balance of power (and by power I mean the use of force to enforce your will), the masses have great political significance.

And yet the author is still depicting a magical world in which political power is concentrated in the few, where Voldemort and Dumbledore are still political juggernauts able to essentially defy the Ministry at will, and where the appearance of a single talented wizard like Harry is capable of shifting the entire political landscape. This is made even more worse if, as I suspect, the author is imagining a magical world with a significantly higher population than canon.

*Plot*

This is where the story shines most, and is I suppose what keeps you reading despite the irritations.

The author does a number of things which most fanfic writers do not:

1. Things go wrong.

2. Actions have consequences.

3. Villains and other non-main characters have their own agency and ability to execute plans. (I.e. villains are not bashed cardboard cut-outs but rather genuine threats).

4. The "two time travellers, three timelines" mechanic is original and interesting.

However, the plot is dangerously at risk of being undermined by the pacing.

*Writing*

I actually think the writing is rather good, especially on the description front. The author has a talent for describing things concisely but nonetheless evocatively.

The two greatest weaknesses in the writing are the character voices and the pacing.

Character voice is a problem because most of the main characters speak with essentially the same voice, which I assume is the author's own vernacular. One particularly glaring moment was where a character described an element of their own world as “broken” - a fourth wall shattering moment where a wizard in the 1990s used terminology that is strongly associated with 21st century geek culture. There's also a tendency to use dialogue as authorial exposition.

Not much needs to be said about pacing, because the number of words in the fic compared to the amount of time covered speaks for itself.

*** While you're not wrong about a lot of that, I'd argue that Harry taking the easy path is exactly the point. He's not working to get better, he's putting pieces on the board and maneuvering them. And it very nearly blows up in his face, repeatedly - which will either force him to change course (and grow as a character) or force the girls to save him (and perhaps realize that the partnership needs to be more equal). If done properly, it'll be fascinating to watch.

**** There's a really good rant about the fic on DLP but you mention most of its points.

The other thing mentioned - which js why I no longer read the fic - is how dumb and incompetent a lot of the villains are if you stop and think.

Dumbledore in this story is not smart. We are told he's smart but the moves he does are completely dumb. Similarly Voldemort is smarter than Dumbedore, but not significantly smarter. The the Diary is just plain stupid.

I love Harry kicking ass. And the first story wasn't bad. But after year 1 Dumbledore and Voldiemort got really incompetant and I couldn't read it any longer

1. The superpowers. Need I say more? The mega magic, rare seer abilities etc. But the author does a decent enough job balancing it out.
2. Complete lack of structure that makes it hard to read. The language is a bit...loose as well. But maybe it fits withe the whole "head full of visions" theme.
3. Political children. But OC is an adult, that acknowledges that she is surrounded by children, no matter how manipulative and cunning they seem.

All in all it seems a bit...childish, maybe? I love it anyway.
