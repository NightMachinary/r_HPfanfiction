** That reminds me of a crackfic I read once. In it, Harry gets told something like "may your coffers be ever full" by a goblin and, having no idea how to respond to /that/, comes up with "may your enemies shit their pants when they hear your name".

Surprisingly (or perhaps not), the goblin liked this response.

**** Well, the fanfic is in Russian, but I'll post a link anyway, on the off-chance there are Russian speakers on this sub.

(Now that I think about it, "crackfic" might not be a very accurate description... it's certainly a unique read)

Anyway, here's the link: [[http://samlib.ru/k/kotjara_l/rchtml.shtml][Royal Crisis]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/10/Scribble-Pad][Chapter 10 of White Squirrel's Scribble Pad]] contains almost exactly this, after Harry read one of Ginny's novels which had a very off portrayal of things. It's fun!
