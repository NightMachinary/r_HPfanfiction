As expected, it was Dumbledore who had figured it out.

The Power He Knows Not... It was the power of Love, well and truly the power of Love.

If he had known of it, if he had called upon it... it would have transformed the Horcrux within him, the mark of hatred Voldemort had given him into something called a 'Soul Bond', a mark of love.

Dumbledore had surmised that this 'Soul Bond' would function the same way as his Horcrux connection, allowing him to know of Voldemort's thoughts and memories and vice-versa. The difference was that it would help him, not hurt him. It was the power of love after all...

Looking at Dumbledore's notes, Harry resisted the urge to hurl.

If he had called upon this Power, he would fall in love with his parent's murderer.

The Power He Knows Not would make Voldemort fall in love with him. From what Dumbledore had surmised, it would start off as some sort of obsession, transforming eventually into love and culminating into remorse. Voldemort's soul would thus find salvation.

Dumbledore could have had Harry awaken this power and redeem Voldemort. Instead, he hid every trace of its existence. Not even the portrait had known about it. If Harry hadn't used the Elder Wand's power on some suspicious looking ashes in the Headmaster's office, he could have lived his life in blissful ignorance.

“/You've kept him alive so he can die at the proper moment... You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter/.” Snape's words echoed in his ears.

Albus could have abandoned Harry to his destined fate, of falling in love with a irredeemable madman hellbent on murdering him.

Yet Albus Dumbledore used every cell of his peerless brain to set off a magnificent scheme that culminated in all traces of Voldemort's soul completely excised from Harry's.

So many years had passed. Harry had been unable to think of Albus Dumbledore with any charitable thoughts for a long, long time.

All that had changed at this moment.

--------------

Thought about why Harry would ever name his son Albus Severus. This shit came to my mind.

*** There is nothing bad about redemption. Redeeming Voldemort's soul by having him fall in love with Harry and feel remorse though...

Dumbledore had two choices-

The easy one was to allow fate to come to pass.

The right one would end with the remnants of Voldemort's soul rotting eternally at King's Crossing.

Dumbledore is noted to be a very forgiving person, but I think barring Voldemort from redemption would be in his character as well.

*** "Voldemort falls in love and thus becomes a good guy" is an incredibly stupid trope. This fandom overvalues love's power by a lot. Unless you had the binding completely rewrite his personality or set him to blind love-potion type love (either of which might actually be worse then death, in my opinion anyway), there's no way in hell canon Voldemort would suddenly ditch everything for love. We're talking about a 70 year old man with a shitload of power that's been rooted in his radical views for close to sixty years now, with victory within his reach.

I could see him becoming a little better. Maybe less cruel, maybe a tiny bit more tolerant - like giving Hermione first-class citizen status due to her being Harry's friend. But abandoning his lifelong goal because he fell in love with a teenager? Hell no. You'd need a rather significant AU to make it at all believable.

That's what I was wondering. I don't think that "Voldemort falls in love and is therefore redeemed" to be plausible on its face either.

***** For lack of a better expression, it's a horrible plot device. You basically take canon, replace Voldemort with another guy - let's call him Steve for this, and then have Steve repenting for Voldemort's crimes while lusting after a teenage boy.

People can obviously write whatever they want (as evidenced by a good 20% of the fandom having the exact same will-goblins-trunk-Daphne plot), but it just doesn't make good reading.

Not to mention that "forced love" is a very... iffy subject that really shouldn't be romanticized.

****** Yes, but that's talking about it from the outside perspective.

In-story, if Dumbledore knows that Voldemort is legit going to be redeemed with +love+ magical brain surgery, why is that a bad thing which Dumbledore should try to prevent? It's certainly better than "Voldemort's soul rots eternally in Limbo," in my opinion (I'm not in favor of eternal damnation for everyone, even Hitler).

Magic would create a romance between Voldemort and Harry - a forceful and unnatural love. Harry would be forced to experience love for the person who killed everyone he loved and ruined his life. No matter how you consider it, Harry would have to suffer for Wizard Hitler to be saved.

Dumbledore would prefer Voldemort to eternally suffer Limbo rather than have Harry suffer under Voldemort's love.

And that is perfectly fine when making decisions for yourself.

When making them for someone else, you should (morally speaking) prioritize the wellbeing of that person.

Thus, if you wished to accept such a bond yourself, all the power to you.

However forcing such on Harry, who had done nothing to deserve having his free will and right to self-determination being taken away from him, is morally wrong. It's basically sentencing them both to personality death, so for everyone subscribing to the "I think thus I am" school of thought it would be murder and desecration of the corpses.

If such high a price needs to be paid, paying it yourself is a heroic sacrifice. Making someone pay it is murder, plain and simple.

That's hardly a settled point. Consequentialism rests on a strong foundation and is one of the most viable classes of ethical theories.

Eternal torture is worse than death. Eternal torture is probably even worse than personality death.

(Now, whether and how we can balance these against each other against two separate people is another matter entirely)

At any rate, surely we can agree that, at a bare minimum, Dumbledore should have at least told Harry and given him the choice?

And consequences of such a 'bond' would be what amounts to either (emotional) slavery or personality death. That's pretty bad. The closest analogue I can think of right now is me giving up my education, going on a world tour of violent crime, and then you being expected to provide for me so that I could avoid the direct consequences of my actions.

If it was an Adult!Harry, whose personality is mostly formed and he's capable of making an informed decision? I guess..? I would still be leery, but I'd not be able to call it straight up abhorrent.

However if you are talking canon timeline, it would be a morally wrong choice for at least two separate reasons:

- it would be a person of perhaps highest authority in his eyes and known for being pro-redemption telling him that (low-case duress, as Harry would then feel pressured to take the option even knowing he'd suffer for it)
- it would be paedophilia, with Tom Riddle, amongst his other flaws, being around 50 (?) years older.

Additionally, if consequentialism is the philosophy you subscribe to, it should be noted that the "eternal suffering" option is not something someone forces on the receieving party. It straight up requires them to commit multiple acts classed as 'unforgivable' AND not feel a shred of remorse for them through their entire life.

Adding to that, trying this path of "redeeming" Tom Riddle is basically a textbook example of sunk cost *fallacy*. In fact, consequentialism is very much anti-unearned redemption, because if the hero can be sacrificed to redeem a villain and a villain can put in no work and have their transgressions forgiven, then the optimal action is to be a villain. And if everyone was a villain, there would be no heroes to save them, thus everyone would be damned.

As such, the optimal action from the consenquentialist-utilitarian point of view is to let Tom Riddle suffer and document his situation as a deterrent, being an option that maximizes gain for the society AND minimizes effort.

Redemption isn't bad but the problem with these kinds of fics is that they focus too much and oftentimes get stuck on the obsession part so that the writer could write scenes full of lemon, torture and woe. The remorse and true love parts are tacked on almost as an afterthought. Sure, Voldemort or Tom would get "redeemed" but at what cost? Harry enduring more abuse at his enemy's hands first? He's always the submissive one in these while Voldemort or Tom is the dominant one.

I wish there was a fic like this with Harry actually respecting himself enough to refuse the abuse, where he goes, "I know we're soul mates Tom but you have to clean up your act first before I even think about going on a date with you."
