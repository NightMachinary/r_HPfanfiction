I recently found this awesome fic where Salazar Slytherin was reborn into Harry Potter. Salazar being from a time where Druids and such were the norm tries to find his way through a world that forgot it's roots.

Suffice to say it has sparked my interest in any other Druid Harry fics. If you know of any good ones please post them.


** Here is the fic I that captured my interest: linkffn(13403866)

  Salazar Slytherin woke up in the body of a three year old boy with the most ridiculous head of black hair and a runic scar craved into his forehead. The last thing he recalled was dying. Now it is over 900 years in the future. What is a wizard to do?

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

** It's not a druid Harry story, but I thought linkffn(The Uprising by Captain Cranium) was a very good story that involved druid magic.

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

  Harry Potter has non-human blood. In childhood, he is contacted by his kin and given support and instruction. How will these changes affect his Hogwarts career? He is not the bold Gryffindor saviour people were expecting. He is ready to love the wizarding world, but will it love him back?I expect there to be pairings in later stories, and for the rating to rise.
