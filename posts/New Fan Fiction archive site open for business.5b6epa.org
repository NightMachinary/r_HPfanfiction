The HPFanFicTalk community opened a new fan fiction archive site, which is now accepting new members and new story submissions. The site is mostly composed of authors who came from the harrypotterfanfiction.com community in the wake of that site deciding to close down its discussion forums. The site is located at:

[[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com]]

Authors are required to sign up for membership and submit their stories for review prior to stories being posted to the archive. Site guidelines and links to content and warning tutorials can be found [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewpage.php?page=siteguidelines#contentguidelines][here]].


** That one seems like it's pretty bad, to be honest. They don't have a rule against sex, which is a point over ff.net, but you can't have a character be insulted or feature anything that would find itself in a tumblrina's trigger warning without having a warning and marking the story M. And they seem to have some rules about things that have a blanket ban against them.

***** Based on their rules, it doesn't surprise me. One of their rules on warnings used the example of a character being called a slut. If that were to happen in the story, the site requires that the story have an M rating and a hate speech or slut-shaming warning.

** Interesting guidelines.

#+begin_quote
  Any reference to or depiction of forced marriage may only occur between characters who are at least 18, and must include the â€˜Forced Marriage' advisory.
#+end_quote

Even though they become adults at seventeen? It's not necessarily that I disagree, it's just an interesting cut off given the universe it's in.

Regarding hate speech and slurs, does that include canon hate speech, such as "mudblood"? On one hand it's fictional, on the other it's intended to represent the exact same sentiment and bigotry.

Overall it seems like how MNFF had their stuff set up a good forever ago. I'll keep an eye on it to see what pops up!

*** Does anyone know when MNFF will be back? It's been "any day now" for months, which makes me think it's not coming back at all...

** Can you talk about any of the advantages of your site over competing fanfic sites?

*** Just to clarify, I'm only a member of the site, not an admin or a mod. I also use AO3 and HPFF, so I'm not trying to sell anyone anything.

I think the biggest strength of the HPFT site is the community of authors. If you're looking for detailed feedback that will make you a better writer, it's a good site. If you're looking for a somewhat larger audience and no restrictions on subject matter, AO3 is better, but don't expect much in the way of constructive feedback. If you want the largest possible audience and don't mind getting feedback akin to YouTube comments, FF.net is for you.
