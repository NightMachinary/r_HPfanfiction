Myrtle's one of my favourite minor side characters and I'm sure with the number of stories out there there'll be some that have done interesting or amusing things with her. I'm not imagining there are many Myrtle centric stories out there mind - this is just stories she appears in as more than a one-liner or off-page reference.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
