Either Voldemort's evils, not competing in the Tri Wizard Tournament, some grand sacrifice, whatever. Harry loses his magic and preferably doesn't get it back and preferably this causes everything to go to shit.

Crossovers, dark!characters, bashing and slash are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut-centric plots, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thanks!


** I had a "plotbunny" idea once that Harry was actually a squib and had magic only because of Voldemort's horcrux. So when horcrux is gone so is Harry's ability to use magic.

It would be pretty dark story as I imagine that would be /devastating/. Imagine everything you learned for the last 7 years and fought for is just gone. His only job prospect would probably be sweeping floors somewhere or go to Muggle world where his opportunities would be practically nil due to lack of muggle education...

Anyone wanna write that?

**** you know that's the open question and I guess down the writer.

Would a broom work for someone without magic?

And would running a store without magic in a magical world be an option? Just thinking that he can't do simplest levitation spells, or shrink purchases for customers, or repair, or do math calculation spells (which apparently are a thing)

Would Harry even want to do these things considering how much they would remind what he can no longer do?

***** The simplest solution would be to use House Elves or simply hire a wizard.

To address your concerns:

Self-shrinking bags (pay someone to make them or use the staff)

House Elves/Staff

A Calculator

Also he could write books or practice non-magical crafts like potion making or stuff like Runes (at least partially).

****** Would it? For what I understand House elves aren't something you can easily hire. I think somewhere in the books its mentioned that Weasley's would love to have one, but all they got is a useless ghoul. Dobby is dead, Kreacher too old. And would a house elf accept non-magical master?

To hire workers the shop would need to be profitable. What would Harry sell? What niche could he fit as a squib? Thinking about it I'm sure he could be hired in the joke shop, but would it work? Say some kid eats random candy and gets a bad reaction and Harry is alone in the shop and is just unable to help magically?

Sadly we don't really know enough from canon about squibs. So it's down to the writer to convince readers one way or another. But the way I see it being a squib is a major and horrible disability. He can't do /any/ of the things that magic users take fro granted. Take getting around: he can't aperate, can't summon Knight Bus (presumably), would portkeys / floo / brooms work for non-magical person? Would owls still delivery letters for him?

Also related to this where would he take the funds to start a shop? We know he has some inheritance and fanon just loves to think of it as a vast gazillion galleons worth fortune. Me personally think his inheritance as a nice sum to get through school and get a start in life, but not something he can mooch off of for the rest of his life.

Another issue for Harry - security. Without magic he is defenceless. What would stop some Neo Death Eater wannabe from attacking him? Would the shop earn enough to hire 24/7 body guards? Would ministry assign an auror detail for him for the rest of his life?

But setting aside all these issues for a story like this I think the main plot would be around psychological impact of loosing his magic. Now I'm not like Harry. Don't have his personality or bravery, but I think I would /run away/. I think I wouldn't/couldn't stand to be around magic. At least for a while until I'd learn to accept my loss. But it is something that would forever hunt me.

EDIT: forgot your calculator - we know from canon that technology has a tendency to not work / malfunction around magic. Assuming his shop is located in a magical area of course.

Actually, canon suggests that being at /Hogwarts/ affects the function of radio-based devices and other sensitive electronics. With Diagon Alley, St. Mungo's Hospital, and the Ministry itself tucked right in the middle of London, there would be no way wizards would go undetected if magic did cause such malfunctions.

My theory is that flares of accidental magic from growing children is partly the cause of Hogwarts' interference, the other part being the difficulty of radio waves to find receivers in an Unplottable location.

***** I feel like broomsticks and potions are like being able to see dementors. A squib doesn't have enough magic to cast wanded spells, but they do have enough to do small things like that

****** Correct me if I am wrong, but I think squibs can't see Dementors only feel their effects. Same with Muggles. And in general squibs don't have /any/ magic. They are essentially muggles in all things except having magical ancestry and probably higher chance of having magical offspring themselves.

But since this is a grey area and not well defined / explained in canon and debatable it's down to individual writer and us fans to interpret how we like. So you might be right.

  Although Muggles cannot see Dementors, they are affected in a way similar to wizards and witches, becoming depressed when near them. While at least one Squib, Arabella Figg, has claimed to see a Dementor, the truth is that Squibs cannot see them, but have enough magical knowledge to identify their effects
