On so many posts, it seems as though people use remindme as a way to spam. Just a quick search of "remindme" on this sub will show you what I mean. Here are some of the more egregious ones.

This is just a sampling of what's out there. As you can see, in most of these examples there are more comments using the remindme bot or talking about it than there are comments relevant to the post. I think that if people can't use this feature responsibly, the mods should make a rule against excessive remindme comments and begin removing them. What do you think?

** EDIT: Ignore this whole wall of text I agree with OP now

But what would constitute "responsible" use of the bot? Limiting how many times you can use it? To me that seems like a way to gimp the user experience of the sub by taking away a useful feature, because it is useful, since many people don't browse this site daily it's easy to forget threads you were interested in but did not have the content you were looking for at the time. What if you found two threads next to each other with interesting requests, but they had no posts and you could only use RemindMe for one of them because it's against the rules to use it more? That's just annoying.

I don't use it myself, but one I do use quite frequently is the "Save" feature. If it's use required a post like the RemindMe bot, and you or anyone else suggested to limit it's use because my posts are annoying them for some reason, you'd be making my experience here worse.

The "problem" here is not that people are using the bot a lot---way I see it they're entitled to use it as much as they'd like---but that the reminding feature works the way it does. It should be a button integrated to the site, rather than a bot, and that's not a community problem, but rather a problem with the way the site is designed.

And in any case, why is it a problem in the first place? Just ignore the RemindMe posts and move on. At worst they're causing you a second of inconvenience by having to scroll past them, and they're usually at the bottom of the threads since they almost always have low ratings, so in many cases you won't even see them.

I think the issue is that more people don't take advantage of the bot's features, most notably the ability to be added to its reminder list without adding more "remind me" notices in the thread. One RemindMe is easy to ignore, seven of them is spam.

Since you can click the link provided by the bot to get the remindme someone else made or set up a custom remind me (I was able to do this on desktop and mobile browsers), there should only be one remindme comment per post. Anything more is useless and unnecessary spam.

**** I used to get downvoted for using the remind me bot (Sometimes as the first person sometimes not) and did not know why so I just started saving things instead. But now I understand at least for some of the instances. I don't think the documentation is very clear, perhaps it is in the smaller print of the post that is hard for me to read due to my vision.

Anyway, thank you for explaining. If there is a rule then I think this wording should be included instead of "don't do this"
