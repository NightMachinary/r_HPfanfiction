Hi all,

So I've been writing my first story and am at the end of First Year. As you'd expect, I've gone pretty far from canon. However, I've kind of written myself into a corner, and would genuinely appreciate any help in giving me an idea to bail me out.

Here's the problem: in canon, L. Malfoy slips Ginny the diary as a way to embarrass Arthur as revenge for Muggle Protection Act. In my story, Malfoy uses the press/Wizengamot to make a 'cause' out of Harry living with muggles, and blackmails Dumbledore into preventing Arthur from submitting the bill to the Wizengamot in the first place in order to protect Harry's living situation.

I'd still like Ginny to end up with diary!Mort, but realized I don't have a reason for Malfoy to want to ruin the Weasleys. Help!


** Draco could find it in his manor, not knowing exactly what it is but knowing it's cursed somehow. He slips it to Ron because of some fight they had 1st year, Ron gives it to Ginny because he doesn't want a diary.

*** This is really unique, and I actually like the tweak to canon, but I'm not sure I'm a good enough writer to explain why Lucius would leave one of the Dark Lord's treasures lying around haha.

**** It's plausible that Lucius didn't know how important it was to Voldemort. He certainly wouldn't have given it to Ginny in canon if he knew what it really was. Maybe Voldemort originally gave it to Abraxas Malfoy and he never told Lucius how important it was before dying.

  Inspired by the many great authors on this site. A Death Eater finds Harry two years before he leaves for Hogwarts, and that assassination attempt sets Harry on a course that will shake the Wizarding World to its foundations. Pulled in two directions by opposing sides, Harry must decide which path to walk. Super!Harry (eventually), pairing still undecided, first time author

** Why not just leave that plotline. It's so annoying when authors force the canon plotlines in because they desire to follow it so strongly. Find a better fitting plot and make that what happens

** How about you give the idea that Malfoy hates Arthur above anything else, since he's proud of his pureblood ancestry, and the traditions and customs that come along with it. Such as the Wizarding version of Halloween (Samhain), which, due to the increasing number of muggleborn is slowly being replaced by the muggle version. So, seeing that despite being a pureblood, Arthur is indifferent towards the very ideals he holds dear, makes Lucius harbour a deep festering hatred towards Arthur. Hence, he tries to oppose Arthur at every step, including the prevention of the Bill, as well as handing off the diary to Ginny, because maybe, the Voldemort could've told him sometime that "the diary has the power to change the world in my image" or something. That way, you can cover all the bases.
