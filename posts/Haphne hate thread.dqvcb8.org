Since there's been so many pro Haphne threads, there should also be a thread discussing why it's not that interesting a ship. Let's talk about the worst most cliche aspects of this ship and why it's inexplicably so popular


** I live in India, where the types of social interaction and public behaviour delineated in pro-Pureblood fics, like in most Haphne ones, are still the reality more often than not, and its nowhere near as romantic as is portrayed here.

Also, Ice Queen/Prince type characters are so very, very boring to me; and if I never read one more fic talking about social masks as if they're real, physical things, it would be too soon.

** Oh why not? I'm actually somewhat fond of it, but have my gripes.

1. Ice Queen Daphne. I almost never see her portrayed as anything other than the stereotypical "Ice Queen of Slytherin" who's cold, distant, and aloof from everyone at Hogwarts. She's also either a pureblood who just happens to disagree with Voldemort or a Half-Blood who found her way into Slytherin. This means she's just waiting for Harry to come and melt her poor ice queen heart, and ally with him in his fight against Voldemort, or be saved from the other evil Slytherins who hate her.
2. Daphne is almost always portrayed as a brilliant witch on the level of Hermione or superior if it's a Hermione bashing fic. You never see her written as having a couple of good to great areas, but also weaknesses. She has to be good at /everything/ and super powerful to keep up with Harry.
3. She's almost always portrayed as incredibly beautiful. Rare is the fic where Daphne is anything remotely approaching ordinary.
4. Authors often portray her family accepting Harry instantly and allying with him no matter what the circumstances might be.
5. Harry in Haphne fics is always either Lord!Potter or Indie!Harry which often makes the plot stupidly predictable. He's always super rich and overpowered, and often a "Founders Heir."
6. Marriage contracts need to die in Haphne fics.
7. It's almost always same narrative. Manipulative!Dumbledore, betrayed by Ron and Hermione, and Daphne proving to be superior to both in all ways.
8. Ginny is often bashed and bastardized beyond all in Haphne fics even when it's supposed to be a 'love triangle'

As for why it's popular? Easy. Daphne is just a name on a list, and can be anything the author wants her to be. She has no canon personality or description, and that makes her easy to use for wish fulfillment. Fanon has taken it and run with it, and created a 'standard Daphne' that so many fanfics use as gospel. It's an easy self insert or Mary Sue ship to use, and not a lot of people do it well.

*** Oh How much I hate when they replaced Hermione with Daphne. Daphne was nothing but a Hermione with blonde hair and in slytherin. Not only haphne but in almost all ships except Harmony, lead girl usually more intelligent than Hermione and bashes Hermione for her stupidity and ignorance.

**** If we're being honest, the only reason the lead girl in Harmony isn't more intelligent /and/ beautiful than Hermione is because it's Hermione, but Hermione in Harmony stories is far more intelligent and beautiful than canon Hermione.

Lmfao, I enjoyed writing that.

It's the original god mode ship and those gripes make up the formula for most Harmony (and Indy Harry) stories, particularly during the time that group was feeling extra bitter and scorned.

** Honestly I have no good reason to hate this ship but it's always the same sh*t. Bashing of Ginny, Daphne is beyond perfect. Senseless bashing too! They don't even try for an original plot! There is literally no fic were I have seen depth of character when they are together. So stupid! I'm just gripping now but when I see what authors do with other characters who really have to past or anything involved. I'm always disappointed in Haphne fics!

** I think just like with any pairing, if you use too many cliches and don't have an even remotely original storyline the pairing can be bad. But IMO there are a lot of quite enjoyable Haphne stories (Importance of Intent, The Mind Arts,...). And to be honest, from time to time I can even enjoy a "Ice Queen" and Lord!Potter story.

The point I'm trying to make is, with the baseline of an attractive pure-blooded slytherin girl paired with Harry can come a lot of interesting stories.

** My name is Daphne Greengrass. I'm 15 years old. My house is Slytherin, where all the purebloods are, and I am not dating anyone. I study as a student at Hogwarts, and I leave the library every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a witch who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

*** I live in Greengrass Mansion in the countryside. My name is Daphne Greengrass. I'm 16 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser potion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-Knotgrass facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. Moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective potion.

There is an idea of a Daphne Greengrass. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply /am not there/.

For the most part, fanon!Draco, especially in Drarry fics, is still continuing on from before the books ended when we still held onto hints that Draco might get a proper redemption arc, rather than the cowardly non-actions he took in Canon.

As far as I know, there are no Haphne fics where she rebels from her family or the agenda of her peers in order to do the right thing. It's mostly Harry becoming self - important, because traditions.

Basically, drivel about how human rights and modern western values are all filthy bad things that have no place in Wizarding Britain "because magic and pureblood" or something.

** I like Haphne. But not the common ones.

Currently I'm brainstorming some ideas and one fo them is a Haphne were she is just a shy RAVENCLAW girl with brown/blonde mix of hair.

And she isnt an Ice Queen, she has friends and likes to party, but she values knowledge over everything else. This contrasts to Harry who is quiet and prefers a woman who shows heart.

It's in the early stages but still, the same Haphne is boring soooooooppp

** I think it's popular because a few people did it well in the beginning. But now everyone copies exactly what those first few people did, and they're all so unoriginal that it even makes the originals look bad. The ones that are still interesting to read are the ones where Daphne is just a regular human being, intelligent but not overly so, powerful but not overpowered, and with normal emotions.

I like Daphne as a way of exploring the traditional pureblood society. I like it when aligning herself with Harry is either dangerous and something her entire family has to think about, or her going against her family to do it. But I do not like it when the 'neutral' family immediately jumps onto Harry's side, Harry immediately becomes a political God, and they suddenly have a wizengamot majority to defeat the evil Fumbledork. That's just not interesting, it's stale, and it's overdone.

Harry/Daphne I do like: linkffn(A Champion's New Hope; Ice Cream by Andrius; Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent), and while the rest of the story is a bit dull due to super Harry, the relationship element in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) isn't too bad.
