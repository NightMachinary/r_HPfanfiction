:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As far as I remember, in the story:

- harry was the real boy who live who had been tossed i to azkaban
- his twin screwed up the first time, so fate or something sent him back
- his twin let voldemort kill him cuz he thought he would get a another chance to try again
- fate decided Harry's twin was not useful so sent harry back instead
- fate sends harry that at that point his twin really thinks that he has been chosen by fate cuz he got sent back too
- harry gets ginny on his side, which was a difference from the timeline where only Harry's twin went bk

Can someone help me find this story? Thanks!

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
