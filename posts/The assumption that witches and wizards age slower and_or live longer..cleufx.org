Ignoring the truly shitty casting choices in the movies which have old men playing characters that are in their early thirties, is there any canonical basis for the idea that magic makes people physically resilient, therefore more resistant to illness and other degeneration that leads to aging?

#+begin_quote
  *Question:* How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  *J.K. Rowling responds:* Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/interviews/sch2/][JKR interview from 2000.]]

.

But it's fanon that JKR ever named a date of birth for McG. The "1935" date came from fans who calculated the numbers from Harry's year to the "70 years old" figure from an interview, but was never stated in any of JKR's official writings. The closest is a Pottermore publication on McG's bio page that was edited prior to the release of CoG, which took out one offending line:

#+begin_quote
  "She grew up in the Highlands of Scotland in the early twentieth century..."
#+end_quote

Source: */Pottermore Presents: Short Stories from Hogwarts: of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies./*

The new timeline moves her childhood back to the 19th century now.

It's bullshit, but I just had to clarify that a commonly accepted fact in the fandom is, in fact, fanon.

****** There's also a brief exchange from the primary books. In OotP, during her assessment, Umbridge asks McGonagall how long she's been teaching at Hogwarts. The answer given (in September 1995) is

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúThirty nine years this December‚Äù
#+end_quote

If we go by the seven main books as definitely canon (and I hope we do...if that's not canon, what is?) then Minerva McGonagall cannot possibly have taught Newt Scamander, in 1912 or at any other time. She's been teaching a long time by the time Umbridge annoys her - beginning in 1955 or 1956 depending on whether she means the December to come or the December they had nine months ago - but *not* long enough for the Fantastic Beasts scene to have happened.

If she began teaching in the mid to late 1950s, then a birthday of 1935 (or thereabouts; she may be a few years older, but not much) would be correct. She'd have graduated Hogwarts aged 17, spent a few years doing something else and then applied to teach in her 20s. Consistent with main book canon, with Pottermore...with everything EXCEPT that flashback teaching Newt.

It makes more sense than her being old enough to teach Newt Transfiguration in 1912 and yet not be the Transfiguation professor thirty years later - in the text of CoS, when Harry is using Riddle's diary to get a look at circa 1942, *Dumbledore* is explicitly teaching Transfiguration then - before being there for Harry in the 90s.

******* I think the issue is, and always has been, that JKR sucks at basic math.

And the follow-on issue comes from the dubious value of "canonity", the reliability of the author's word, and how many layers of canon JKR's backtracking has created in the fandom over the last couple of years since social media took off.

McG's age is never explicitly given a number in the books. All we know is that she's an old lady by wizard standards, and to Harry and the gang, all their teachers are relative geezers.

  "She's not here, Potter," said Madam Pomfrey sadly. "She was transferred to St Mungo's this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age? It's a wonder they didn't kill her."
#+end_quote

The "she's around 70" figure comes from a casual interview, not something printed down and part of the official series, similar to other divisive statements JKR has made outside the printed word of the books - like Dumbledore was gay for Grindelwald, who may or may not have been gay himself, but liked taking advantage of Dumbles' feelings, or that the Slytherins who got kicked out of the Battle of Hogwarts came back with reinforcements, even though the books said otherwise.

But this I mean something like [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/1/2/pottercast-131-j-k-rowling-interview-transcript/][one quote fom JKR in a 2008 interview,]] where she says something that is directly contradicted by something she wrote.

Though I'd say that the worst part of McG's CoG appearance is her punishing the girl who tattles on Leta by zapping her mouth off. One of the original series' badass moments was McGonagall telling FakeMoody to stop playing with Ferret Draco with her big moment:

#+begin_quote
  "Teach- Moody, is that a student?" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms.

  "Yep," said Moody.

  "No!" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.

  "Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!"

Keep in mind, aside from actual curses, most injuries can be fixed with a wave of the wand. Harry's arm is regrown overnight. Consider a bottle of Skelegrow and a night's rest vs say a hip replacement surgery with weeks/months recovery time. And while Lockhart's an idiot, this didn't trip up Madamn Pomfrey in any way, implying skeletal regrowth is not all that uncommon. It was just, 'Time for plan B, which I have right here ready to go'. How good a shape would even elderly people be if they didn't have to worry about the accumulated damage over a lifetime.

#+begin_quote
  Question: How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  J.K. Rowling: Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm]]

On top of that word of god we have examples of wizards like Madam Marchbanks, who was old enough to have examined Dumbledore when he was at school.

*Physical Resilience*

Physically, the best sign of greater wizarding resilience is Quidditch. Take the bludgers: we know they are heavy iron balls about the size of a cannonball. We also know they are able to chase down players moving on brooms that travel at over 100mph.

In HBP, Harry gets hit by one in the head and is knocked out. Fire a cannonball at a Muggle head at over 100mph and there's not going to be much head left.

We also have the two lines from FB where Newt says that wizards are physiologically different to Muggles, and where he says Jacob needs a helmet while he does not because Jacob's skull is weaker.

*Illness*

Per [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability][Pottermore]], this fall into three categories:

1. Things which wizards have innate resistance to.

2. Things which wizards do not have innate resistance to, but can cure easily.

3. Things which wizards do not have innate resistance to and cannot cure easily.

Examples are non-magical poisons for 1, the common cold for 2 (we see an example of this in the books), and magical diseases for 3.

It's fairly clear that category 3 is essentially magical problems. It's unclear what the boundary is between 1 and 2.

1 is propably blunt force trauma, as Quidditch clearly shows. So they have stronger bones and maybe are more resistant to high Gs, so that they are less prone to receiving a concussion or having their insides turn into mush from hitting something/being hit by something at high speeds.
