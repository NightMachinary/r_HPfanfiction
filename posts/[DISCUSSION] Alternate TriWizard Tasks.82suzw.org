I'm writing a Harry Potter parody (Harris Porter and the Tides of Oblivion), where he is basically roped into being the thirteenth competitor for the Crown of Wands, which is like the Triwizard but for actual professionals.

I've got the first task as having to place a gemstone (supplied) in the chest of a Dragon Golem, but I can't really think of anything cool for tasks 2 and 3. The finale is a maze race, but three dimensional and much more chaotic.

It would be pretty cool to have each task elementally-themed (fire, earth, air, water), dragon golems can be fire and the 3D maze race is air (floaty platforms and all that jazz), so i'd need Water and Earth? Unless the dragon golems are Earth?

I also need inspiration for mixing up the tournaments in other fics im kinda brainstorming, so if anyone has good suggestions that would be awesome.

EDIT: It takes place in america BTW


** Earth: Greenhouse gaunlet? Make it through hordes of deadly plants either with knowledge of handling them, equipment to bypass them or brute force to smash through them.

Water: Have to place their enemy or business rival in the middle of the Mer-village by a certain time (dead or alive)? (Seeing as how your first task is dragon related.)

*** Im kinda liking the Greenhouse Gauntlet idea but I dunno if the tournament officials would give the OK to basically kidnap whoever you wanted and possibly kill them. Maybe some sort of naval showdown but the competitors don't get boats?

** Water- they could have to retrieve something from a sunken pirate ship. With ghosts and nasty things guarding it.

Granted, that's a pretty American task, not British-themed....

Reenact the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada? Swim to France across the channel? Ooh what about retrieving weaponry from ponds a la Merlin/Deathly Hallows?

**** Oh cool!

You could do tasks set in different parts of the USA- the air task in the desert or prairie, the water task in the Great Lakes (or the Louisiana/Florida wetlands, but the Lakes are better for underwater tasks), the earth task in a mountain range, and the fire task in a forest with controlled forest fires. The USA has enormous ecological diversity compared to Britain and I don't think it's featured in fics much.

The USA is enormous in size and very unpopulated compared to Britain too, so all tasks could be very spread out over large rural areas without tons of concealment spells.

Bonus- It would be hilarious if some of the contestants stumbled on a modern day US â€˜militia' training with assault weapons in the USA heartland and had to obliviate a bunch of armed muggles already prone to conspiracy theories and they accidentally started a new conspiracy featured on the Totally Not Fox News channel.

** Water: The Temple of the Deep. The champions are stunned then taken to underwater temple. They must escape while fighting a terror that can not be defeated, merely driven off temporarily.

** Well if you want to make it a mental and magical test for Water instead of being in water. They could enter a giant room made of ice and magically cold. The center of the room has an indentation for a sapphire, but they have to find the correct blue gem in order to pass the task.

The twist is if water goes through the indentation it seals it and they fail. So spamming fire would fail the task. They need to be creative to find and get to the gem while also being careful not to die themselves since warming charms would melt the ice beneath their feet. The timer would be how long they can stand the cold.

...

For earth? Hmm... You could invert my first idea. A flat field with a topaz floating a good distance above. They now have to get to it using the earth beneath their feet. No flight or Spells allowed. They have to physically get to Gem to properly claim it. Growing plants or controlling earth or something creative. No floating a big rock while standing on it.

Unfortunately the more earth you use there are hidden golems and mines and such. That react when the earth near them is disturbed.

**** May I suggest the A Test of Faith quest from Dragon Age?

... Or maybe not, since it involves walking through fire in the nude... (Well, battle the Guardian instead then?)

** One alternate task I've seen done a few times is a broom race with lots of course hazards. That or something similar is a good choice I think.

Another simple one is a talent competition where champions have to impress the judges with some sort of magical performance routine.

Dueling competitions are commonly used if not all that creative. Though I've seen them done with extra rules added on to make them more challenging and interesting.

A Jeopardy!-type magical trivia challenge is a viable option. Though I'd try to add some sort of extra game-show-style extreme twist to it to spice it up.

Some sort of magical puzzle/obstacle course a la the philosopher's stone protections or a generic dungeon dive would be good.

How about something like in the Fastastic Beasts movie where the champions all have to track and capture a bunch of magical creatures in a fake town while competing against each other and trying to minimize damage.

*** I kinda like the whole Fantastic Beasts idea. I've seen the broom race done a lot but it wouldn't really fit the theme of the competition -its supposed to feel like it blurs the line between adventurer and gladiator, so thing are more of a matter of difficulty than one specific skill needed.

**** Maybe a less structured form and more every mage for themselves? Oh, idea!

A game somewhat similar to Capture the Flag, with 13 flag type items. The one with the most when time is called wins. But they're extremely fragile, and the play area has a bunch of Earth type beasts to mess with the contestants/"flags".

Or if you wanna do it with Water, have them dissolve very easily. That one would probably be better. I think. You decide.

** I've actually designed three before for a writing site I own. I had a replica pyramid, with Indiana Jones style traps. A clue had to be solved to work out which item they had to retrieve ad then get out in one piece with it. The bricks were like one-way glass, so that they could be seen but not see out.

I'm struggling to remember the second. - I'll try to look it up. - The third was a maze of some sort again, but in the forest and they had to find and stick as closely to a randomly chosen route as possible. The further they deviated from it, the more points they lost. I suppose either one could work for Earth. Unless you wanted to put a Pyramid under water and call it Atlantis, I guess.

Otherwise... water in the US... Hm. Everglades? Mutant alligators? Horned Serpents live in rivers, that could be useful?
