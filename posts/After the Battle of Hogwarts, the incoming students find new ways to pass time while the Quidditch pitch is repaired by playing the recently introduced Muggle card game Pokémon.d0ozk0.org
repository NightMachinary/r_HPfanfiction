Introduced by Muggleborn students, the card game is all the rage.


** ...until Hagrid gets the cards and realizes that with some careful crossbreeding, it would be /trivial/ to create certain Pokemon.

** Magic-illustrated cards. Picture a person playing one, and the card 'activates' and the next moment there's a Charmelion and Dugtrio there and ready to do battle. How cool would that be?
