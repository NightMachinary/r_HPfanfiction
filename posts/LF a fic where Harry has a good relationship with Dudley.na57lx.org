I just want a fic with a good cousin-cousin relationship. I have a good relationship with my cousins and I want to see that in a fic.


** The Seasons of Change series is one where they start building a positive relationship during year 1. It's currently in year 3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144457]]

  Ever since Petunia and Vernon Dursley found their nephew suffering from hypothermia on their doorstep, they have been raising young Harry Potter as their own to spite the idiots who left a baby out overnight in late autumn. As such, Harry Potter has grown up loved and supported, changing not only his own life, but the lives of those around him. None of Harry's magical accidents or Petunia and Vernon's previous experience in the magical world could have prepared them for the arrival of a relative that Harry never knew he had - or the discovery that the wizard who left Harry to die has been quietly stealing Harry's inheritance behind the scenes and squandering Harry's chances at a good life.Fortunately for Harry, his family is more than happy to support him, and his newly-arrived second uncle is hell-bent on correcting everything that one Mr Albus Dumbledore has done to screw Harry over.

** - I just have to mention “History Lessons” by Bloodpage-Alchemist linkffn(4030448) just for the awesomeness which Fawkes there.

- In “Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian” by Sursr linkffn(13308768) it is more about good!Petunia, but Dudley is obviously much better as well

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
