The wizard equivalent to the muggle Drunken Monkey fighting style is Slurred Monkey dueling style. In this style the wizard will purposefully mispronounce a spell to cause a different effect, taking advantage of the Wizard Baruffio. One example could be Stupifry which shoots out boiling oil at an opponent which is expecting a magical attack and may magically shield.


** I would love it if someone would take a crack at Insult Wand Fighting, รก la Monkey Island. It would be hilarious!

Perhaps I will do it, myself.
