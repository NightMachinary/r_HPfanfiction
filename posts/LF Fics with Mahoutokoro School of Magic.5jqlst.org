For the first time in his life his future isn't planned out and his destiny and decisions are his own. What does life have in store for the war hero now?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11860415][Gorgoneion]] is one, but it's only where an OC sidecharacter ends up going at one point, still there are a few chapters on it there, first fic I actually saw it mentioned in. Not sure if Harry will eventually end up there or not though.
