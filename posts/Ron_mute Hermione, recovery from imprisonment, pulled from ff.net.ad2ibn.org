Does anyone remember the name or author of a popular fanfic on fanfiction.net (several hundred favs) in which Ron spends a few chapters believing Hermione to be dead, but she remains hostage by Bellatrix?

It was a completed fic of probably 30 chapters, written in third person, no changes in POV. I'm 90% sure it was classified as Angst of fanfiction.net, because I read it during a moody binge. :)

Ron thinks Hermione is dead, but is later imprisoned himself. He notices a mute girl in the dungeons with him and over time realizes it's Hermione. Hermione cant control her magic and will blast things accidentally when given a wand. Hermione is mute for most of the fic, but when she does regain some capacity, the author wrote out her stuttering phonetically. They do spend some time recovering at Shell Cottage, and her recovery is marked by severe headaches. The fic culminates at the Battle of Hogwarts which keeps to canon mostly; Hermione tries to help but is held in the nursing wing. In the sequel (last I checked, 8 chapters, in progress), she continues to recover and I feel there's a line of “but what if I never get better” to Ron. There's also a funeral scene, where the trio catch Draco observing from afar, and Narcissa wanting to see how Hermione was recovering as she felt guilty for imprisoning Hermione in her house. Sorry I can't recall much else! But thank you to all reading for your help!
