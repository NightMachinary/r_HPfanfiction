Having read the multiple variations of "What is your biggest pet peeve" or "What is your headcanon?" which all turn into big circle jerks around the funniest posts bashing major tropes. I have a question.

Why do certain things bug you so much that aren't canon?

Isn't that sort of the wonder of fanfiction? These authors leave behind wonderful worlds that we can play in, why couldn't we play in the sandbox and change things?

I know the whole "Lord Potter" thing has been overdone, but it's still fun.

Anyways, what I'm getting at, it seems like a lot of people get upset over things that don't have a firm foundation in canon, being used in fanfiction, what drives you so batty about it? (aside from having read 100 Lord Potter-Black stories.

(To quote a funny tumblr post, basically any headcanon is permissible because Harry is such an unreliable narrator. Remus and Sirius could be fucking, and Harry wouldn't notice. Seriously the kid is about as perceptive as a pile of bricks)


** Personally, I'm fine with anyone doing whatever they want in the fandom. Of course, I think that some of those things are fucking ridiculous, but that's beside the point.

I don't think that it's /this/ sub in particular that has a problem with things being non-canon, but a very vocal minority that's somewhat lost its prominence in the recent years. I think that here, since some of the concepts like "Lord Potter" are overdone /so much/ in fanfiction and are still extremely popular (in varying degrees), the natural response would be to have a negative reaction to it. The trend of many of them appearing in poorly written stories at a more frequent rate than other tropes would also lend to that perception.

But really, it's just internet culture at work. It's easy to point out some of these things and laugh at them. It is, essentially, a circlejerk. That's not inherently a bad thing, but with a small sub like this, where there are many recurring members, it's natural for many people to have similar thoughts. So, many of those tropes have fallen into the 'bad' category.

And honestly, this sub's community isn't half as bad as those from years ago in the Potter fandom. The level of vitriol and hatred back then was sometimes scary. Now, it seems to have died down mostly, and this sub has seemed to mostly stay clear.

Exactly. Also people only tend to actually hate on them in those threads, in general it doesn't come up too much.

** I actually don't mind many of the things that aren't canon.

The world is so unexplored officially. She's heading to NY in the next book/series and there's Pottermore but honestly there's a desire in me to explore and stretch what works and doesn't in Wizarding Earth.

So when someone does the whole Lord thing I too like it. Not in everything but I do. Or Wards, Runes in a practical application sort, and in certain cases magical cores.

On the flip side I completely see how others wouldn't like those things.

** Well, there must always be some resentment over the perceived wasting of an author's effort... An example of such a mindset:

#+begin_quote
  This artist has skill, yes--but I hate him, because he's /wasting/ that skill on a piece of art that I'm /not/ interested in experiencing! Every Drarry writer /should/ be writing Tomione--every rapper /should/ be composing classical music--every writer of erotic fiction /should/ be typing out the next /Lord of the Rings/ trilogy, instead of /wasting his time/ on what he's doing right now! If a person isn't using his ability in a way that brings pleasure to /me,/ he's worthless.

** To me it's not about whether it is canon or not canon, but whether it makes for an interesting story. A lot of those common tropes that are annoying tend to /reduce/ the conflict in the story, and conflict is what makes a story interesting. Giving Harry too many resources, be they societal, magical, financial, or intellectual, just tends to make for boring stories where he breezes through every challenge. Not /always/, as these things can be used by skilled writers to actually /heighten/ conflict, but that does seem to be the trend. People tend to enjoy a good underdog story.

Of course, it's a matter of taste and I'm glad there is something out there for everyone. I don't enjoy reading slash fics but I think it's awesome they are out there, especially since a lot of mainstream fiction doesn't traditionally have gay relationships and that must be really alienating for gay people.

That said, if someone posts a thread on reddit asking "what elements will stop you from reading a fic?" or if I'm asking for recommendations, I'm going to mention that I won't read slash fics. Not to offend anyone, but that's the truth.

Maybe for you. For any fic I read that uses it these days, it feels dry, unoriginal, and a sign of bad writing - a crutch.

*After all, why show Harry /earning/ power when the writer can just come up with some Lord Potter BS and /give/ Harry power?*

It makes stories feel shallow, and characters feel two-dimensional at best.

*** I don't like this reasoning. Giving characters inherent powerful traits or powers isn't inherently linked to bad writing a and doesn't seem to me like it would lead to it unless you don't buff the opponents as well. It's completely reasonable to want to read a book with political aspects or one where Harry has some inherent or ancestral power, like most fantasy characters.

**** It's pretty common in fanfics to have Harry show up to Gringotts to get some money for school supplies and have the Goblins let him know he actually holds enough titles to have a voting majority in the Wizengamot, hundreds of billions of dollars, and based on blood tests, is a powerful sorcerer and likely natural prodigy in most subjects Hogwarts teaches. Then Harry says 'Thanks' on his way out, and the Goblins (who for some reason act like Dobby here), pissing themselves in awe of how tolerant and amazing a wizard he is, then permanently ally with him, placing unstoppable Goblin armies at his command.

Meanwhile, Voldemort is about as competent as Cobra Commander after a three martini lunch.

****** I would say more that these authors are turning Harry into a Gary Stu and thus the only way to create an enemy worthy of him would ALSO be a Gary Stu and then you get those awful battles where it's so over the top and ridiculous and just... I personally find that boring and hard to read.

** You bring up a good point, but I think there's a good reason for it: it keeps us from tearing the community apart.

It's better for the community to endlessly debate the finer points of Sirius Black's casual reference to, "The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black" than to reignite some other lingering hostilities.

The more headstrong shippers usually have a bone to pick with whomever isn't firmly on their side. I'd rather read a fic that brings up the tired trope of "magical exhaustion" rather than ten thousand words of author tract explaining why the canon `ships are the only real choice.

Could you link that tumblr post? It sounds really funny.

** I don't think there's an overall hatred or vitriol in fanfic readers. I think it's more like some of us dislike certain tropes (for example, I really hate Drarry, since it goes against how the characters were developed in the books so I just don't read those stories). I prefer fanfictions that are well written and could feasibly exist within Rowling's universe. I generally dislike stories that are very OOC and thus are, to me, unbelievable. When the Lord trope or Powerful!Harry stories or other common tropes are written well and show fully developed characters and plot, then I enjoy them. If the writing isn't great and the story is very thin and relies on the tropes to get them through a challenging story, then I dislike them and won't continue reading.

** I think we all love the series so much that we want more, thus we read fan fiction. However the vitriol comes in because We are often unsatisfied with happens in canon. Canon has a bunch of plot holes that have been exploited and become cliche in fan fiction which makes the hate bubble to the top of our emotions. Who cares if anyone writes a lord potter story that's 300k words long, it's their fantasy let me live it. I remember reading GoF and going this is my favorite book because we get something new in it. That book has more holes than the book Holes. However it was the first time jk expanded the world outside of England. I loved reading about veelas and Irish mascots. I was salivating over the thought of new interesting characters that are non English or non human but she didn't deliver. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if there were a cliche Harry potter travels the world learning different cultures and becomes über Mage or not I would eat that shit up. So maybe there are a bunch of fans that were salivating Harry becoming a lord and putting the smack down on the wizen-gamut. So let them keep having their fantasies. Very few authors that are professionals come up with original ideas for stories anyways. Most are combinations of recycled Shakespearean plots mixed with count of monte cristo and a dash of dickens. How can we expect amateur fanfic authors to do better? Yea there are few original stories out there that tug at your heart but not everyone can be mark twain or sir Arthur Conan. So keep critical criticism alive but simmer the hate a little bit. All I'm saying before you leave a scathing comment on a fanfic about crappy writing and unorginality, understand the person is an amateur doing it for fun and you have the privilege of reading their creative output. Respect the output.

** My own occasional intolerance of this kind comes from being constantly reminded that no fic is a proverbial island: that they are all written in a memetic ecosystem, so a fanfic that uses bad tropes or fanoncan and will contaminate future fanfics with that trope and fanon, especially if it becomes popular.

In other words, one can't escape bad fanon by avoiding a given fanfic that makes use of it, because said fanfic will spread said fanon, often contaminating fanfic written by people who wouldn't use it if they realized that it was fanon. And because bad fannon cannot be escaped, it must be actively confronted.

To give two classic examples of fanon and its effects,

- /Harry is Very Powerful (in some inborn, immutable magical capacity differentials sense):/ I've seen fanfic where Harry wasn't even a major character, and his actions didn't particularly affect the plot, but it came up in the dialogue anyway. It's a mere annoyance in those particular fics, but what about that author's next fic, where it /would/ make a difference? (And, it contributes to character bashing indirectly, but I don't want spend thread space on that unless there is interest.)

- /Magical Oaths of the general "I Swear on my Motes" form:/ There are many fanfics where Dumbledore is blamed (bashed, really) for not telling Harry to, or discouraging Harry from, Swearing on his Magic that he didn't enter his name into the Triwizard Tournament (sMiB). Now, I could be wrong, but I think that when authors bash, they generally try to bash characters as they understand them, their options, and their decisions and actions: they do not invent reasons to bash characters out of whole cloth. If this is accurate, then a lot of authors' (and even more readers') view of Dumbledore's character is significantly distorted by popular fanon. (As it happens, I debated someone a few months ago, who as one of the arguments for a malicious Dumbledore, assumed availability of easy Magical Oaths.)

Of course, not all fanon is equally pernicious. For example, if Arithmancy is about spell creation and alteration and Runes are about "warding" (a word that isn't, incidentally, used in canon in that way, but what's the harm?), it tends to be pretty benign.

*** I agree but I think it's hard to escape the Harry is very powerful and has super innate ability. It's cause of the the prophecy and the fact he's a hero. Most heroes in fiction have an innate ability that pushes them beyond the norm. I think jk herself treated ' the power he knows not' like a joke. Love? While voldemort doesn't know the power of love. Harry isn't the only one that knows the power of love. Shit most parents know e.g. Mrs weasley. So that doesn't make Harry any more special than a majority of the world. So once again Harry bumbles and stumbles his way through the story being unheroic. While I like what jk did cause it made me relate to what Harry did and go shit I might be able to fumble my way through a dangerous adventure. So in response to that some fans react extremely because they are unsatisfied so they create or give Harry an ability that pushes him beyond the norm or standard of most wizards and I think it's hard for most escape that trope.

**** Making a character powerful isn't the problem. Making a character powerful without also providing comparable challenges and threats is.

In fanfiction, that means that for every way that a canon character is empowered, there should be accompanying increases in difficulty somewhere along the line. That could mean increased power to existing threats (Voldemort marked Harry as his equal, so maybe the power boost helps them both somehow), or balancing drawbacks (social stigma, comes at the cost of other powers, etc), or even internal struggles (maybe the character doesn't /want/ this power, and finds it repugnant for whatever reason, but it's so useful that there is a lot of temptation to use it, and costs to things they value if they do not).
