I asked about this on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]], but no-one seemed to know what it is. However, I remember it pretty clearly.

It was a fanfic where in the 5th year, Harry woke up one day to find he was the reincarnation of Naruto (I think his appearance had started to change to become like Naruto's too). In it, the most recent chapter I remember had Aunt Petunia turning out to be the reincarnation of Tsunade. Also, a bunch of other characters were reincarnated from the Naruto universe.

Does anyone know of this fanfic?

  Harry Potter knew he was different long before he knew he was a wizard.The fear ebbed away and was replaced by something else as he took in the sight of the setting sun on the far-off horizon, warm-hued colors painting the buildings until they resembled a different city, the village of his dreams. Being up high was of no concern just then, as the wind picked up and it felt like coming home.Or: “Do you think I'd look good with pink hair?” Dudley pauses, thinks on it. “Like your friend Sakura?” “Exactly like my friend Sakura.”

  Draco Malfoy was a strange child, even by wizard standards. Actually, no, scratch that, to say he was strange would be putting it lightly, to be frank, Draco was a insane pyromaniac who had already committed multiple acts of arson by the time he was five. Not that anyone would ever say anything about it of course. And knowing Deidara, for him this was downright tame.(Reincarnation)
