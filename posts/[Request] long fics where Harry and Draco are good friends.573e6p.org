Any fics where they are good friends and share quality banter that doesn't end up slash. Dramione is fine and Harry/whoever is also fine. I just can't stand slash or femslash (and this is coming from a guy who has fucked other guys and been fucked by them as well)


** We didn't have to know the last bit, but nevertheless here are my recommendations: -Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection series linkffn(8666085) -Out of the Night by raining ink, you'll find it easily with google search -HP and the Pendant of Slytherin linkffn(4324404) -They Shook Hands series linkffn(7659033) -Innocent series by MarauderLover7 linkffn(9469064)

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
