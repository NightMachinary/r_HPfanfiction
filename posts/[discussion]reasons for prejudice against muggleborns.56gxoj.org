I was wondering what are the reasons for the pureblood families to be prejudiced against the muggleborns. I know there are no need for actual reasons and a lot of the prejudice that happens in our world derives from biggotry and falsehoods only but tried to put together some realistic reasons (altough none of them justify blatant persecution and hate crimes):

1 - Historical feud with Muggles 2 - Cultural acceptance or lack of it (Some muggleborns might enter this new culture not accepting all of it and still attached Muggle culture, leading to not really blending in.) 3 - Envy and fear(this one is simple, Muggles have a huge population and I imagine that there are more muggleborns than ever, the purebloods might resent this number and fear dying out).

So what do you guys think? How do you portray this matter in your works and what is the best way youÂ´ve seen this subject approached in a fanfic?


** Also, people with power want to hang onto it and pass it down to their children, so they would resent others entering their world and 'taking their jobs'. They want to be big fish in a small pond, and muggleborns are a threat to their power.

** Resentment due to statue of secrecy. These wizards have to hide what they are to the world because muggles used to try and burn them. If that wouldn't lead to some distrust I don't know what would. Also muggleborns are ignorant, as far as we know they get no help settling into the wizarding world and probably cause many social blunders. They probably cost more to monitor than regular wizards meaning they require more tax and as it is unlikely they have sacks of gold to pay then the old families will foot the bill. A case could also be made that wizards children are held back as they learn no magic even runes or astronomy before hogwarts to ensure muggle borns come in at an equal level.

*** The education cost and taxes might be a reason, Muggleborn children just start contributing in terms of taxes when they start working, and Hogwarts is free... So it is up mostly to the purebloods to pay for this cost.

**** That is a good argument, but what does Hogwarts have against tuition fee if it's low enough for everyone to afford, I wonder then. They could also ask a small contribution from Muggleborns as a compensation and have a fund for the ones who have not enough money.

** All reasons are good I think, and also how I had imagined it. I especially like the last one - the Muggle population might not be as powerful but it is larger in number, and could be a potential threat this way, perhaps they are also seen as 'savages' without respect for magical culture. I haven't read a lot of fanfics with this theme, but mostly it's just that Muggles are seen as inferior, and that's it.

** Can I be silly? I'm going to be silly. Here's a quote where Regulus explains his view. It's from one of my stories (not published yet, sorry.)

#+begin_quote
  "Muggle-borns are upstarts that don't know their place in our world," Regulus answered a bit harshly.

  "Did they somehow steal their magic?" Vera asked with stinging sarcasm. As if she'd heard this argument before.

  "No, they didn't steal it," he said, confused by that argument. Who would claim someone stole magic? It was born into people, there's no possible way to steal it. He shook his head once and continued, "But they aren't familiar with our world and then they come into it at the age of eleven and don't try to learn anything they've missed. Our culture.

  "Things like blood magic. Blood magic is just a type of ancient magic, it's not necessarily dark. But Muggle-borns don't understand and just assume it's all dark based on the small amount they're exposed to in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Instead of making an attempt to understand, they just try to change things they see as wrong. Our culture isn't /wrong/, it's just different than theirs."

** Compare the Wizarding World with a developed country that is seeing a large influx of immigrants - Singapore is a good example - and all will become clear:

- The Wizarding World can be seen as a "country" that is a lot smaller but a lot more advanced than the neighbouring "countries" (arguable in the modern world since technology has raised the standard of living, but definitely the case in the past where there was a HUGE disparity in things like sanitation standards and mortality rates between magical and non-magical people)

- It has low birth rate overall (having two or more kids is already rare in the old Pureblood families, the Weasleys are extremely unusual) which means that the population would dwindle and possibly die out without immigrants. The birth rate amongst magicals has most likely always been lower than that of non-magicals, due to several reasons - in the past, this was due to a high mortality rate in non-magical children, thus making it necessary to have many children to ensure at least some would survive. Also, if magicals - especially the old Pureblood families - are considered "upper class" and others middle or lower class, then the trend of developed countries having lower fertility rates than less-developed countries also applies to them. (Studies have shown that after a country becomes sufficiently developed, the birth rate drops.)

- Discrimmination against immigrants despite these immigrants being necessary for the survival of the "country". (This is rather similar to the situation in Singapore, which has a low fertility rate amongst its citizens and a very large number of immigrants to make up for that.)

- Lack of human resources and overall decline in population "quality" - inbreeding and low fertility rates means that the wizarding elite are much less capable than they need to be (see: atrociously incompetent Ministry of Magic). Discrimmination makes it difficult for better qualified people who are looked down on for having "bad blood" or some form of affliction (eg. lycanthropy) to take up positions that would allow them to improve the goverment and society. (Clearly a meritocracy is needed to fix the problem.)

- The top 10% of nonmagical students in Britain, for example, is probably way more intelligent and talented than the top 10% of magical students in Britain, simply because the pools they are selected from have such disparate sizes. (This is also most likely why the rather questionable joke "Roses are red / Violets are blue / There's always an Asian / Who's better than you" exists - eg. if you have freaking 1.4billion people in a country (which is what China has) then the best of the best from these 1.4billion people are, statistically, most likely going to be better than the best of the best from somewhere with only 10% of that population size.)

- Those who have a longer family history within the "country" feel that they and their culture are under threat by the "immigrants", yet also consider the "immigrants" to be somehow inferior. The prejudiced purebloods do not appear to have any problem with non-purebloods holding ordinary jobs, but anything that gives them power or prestige (high positions in the government, mainly) would most likely be met with a lot of opposition.

- Voldemort claims that the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts would encourage purebloods to "breed" with muggles and werewolves, and shows his contempt at the notion. This is because muggles and part-humans are considered "filth" by him and his followers, but it could also be because alliances such as marriage can be a form of social mobility. If a muggle/muggleborn/part-human/etc marries a high-status pureblood, then he/she will have some degree of power within the pureblood society because his/her marriage gives a form of legitimacy to his/her presence. This power or legitimacy can be used for making changes in society, perhaps to try and change the unfairly biased system that is largely perpetuated by the high-status old pureblood families. It is unlikely that an "outsider" who enters this society would not attempt to change it, because changing the system would be highly beneficial to the "outsider".

tl;dr people feel threatened and everything is just an excuse for them to continue being xenophobic.

** I'm not a writer of HP stories, but here's how I see it:

Wizards were being persecuted by non-magicals for a long time before the Statute of Secrecy was first thought of. This appears to go back until the founding of Hogwarts in or around the 10th century. Considering that wizards had wands or other foci /at least/ since the 4th century BC, we are very likely looking at many hundreds of years of a decently if not well-educated portion of the population that had magic living along-side the unwashed and illiterate peasants that had no access to this mystical power. Even without religious fervor being added to the mix, that does not make for the most stable of arrangements. Add in the many small nuggets of supplementary information that were provided on Rowling's official site and the picture we can draw about the creation of the Statute of Secrecy is telling.

Against this backdrop we see the creation of a new magical government that actively encourages and enforces its population to grow increasingly separated from the non-magical world. Any such separation would allow the negative feelings to fester and grow, yet the wizarding world still has to take in the descendants of the very people they have begun hiding from into their own society and even pay for their magical education. Personally, I would liken the behavioral patterns of the wizarding world to the cold-war sentiment in the older generation in the US, where Russians take the place of muggles and muggle-borns. Some of that is alive even today, just as people with Japanese ancestry had their own challenges to overcome in the aftermath of World War II.

This so far has nothing to do with said muggles and muggle-borns as of yet, but I'm sure their intrusion into a foreign society cannot be any help, especially when you consider the widening gap between their cultures. The wizarding world most likely stagnated ever since the separation, if its progress didn't grind to a halt entirely. Muggles on the other hand underwent an industrial revolution and all the social and cultural upheaval that became possible and inevitable because of it. I can imagine only too well how wizards would take the first few muggle-borns entering their society with new ideas and realize how welcome they would be.

In the end it comes down to this: even without the general incompatibility between the wizarding world and the modern-day non-magical society, wizards had many well-deserved reasons for their aversion toward non-magicals. Taking it one small step further and including their descendants is not a big leap. If muggle-borns were given a generation or two to integrate completely into the magical community, the whole resentment would go away on its own, but with a new cadre of children entering their small society every year, that agitation will never go away.

*** Interesting read on the subject... Do you think a lot of the prejudice could end if the kids were introduced to Wizarding society early attending some sort of pre-school? Just to learn basic concepts of said society once every week for a couple of years before attending Hogwarts.

**** It's difficult to say. I think it can be a positive change, but it would be the work of at least one generation if not more. I don't think we 21st century humans would be happy or even content living in the 16th or 17th century, because so much of what we think as progress would suddenly be reversed. If that's the attitude some muggle-born children enter the wizarding world with, then I'm not very surprised at the frosty reception.

Also, imagine a conversation between two children with vastly different ancestries as they both board the Hogwarts Express for the first time. From the muggle-born you'd hear about football (soccer) and about video-games, while the child growing up in the magical world would only be familiar with quidditch, gobstones, exploding snap and whatever else I don't remember right now. Their lack of common knowledge and interests would immediately set them apart from each other and, as we all know, first impressions are a hard thing to combat later on.

In reply to a question like "/do you like quidditch?/", a muggle-born wouldn't answer "/what's that?/" or "/on brooms! really!?!/" but maybe something like "/oh yes, I got to see a match between Puddlemere United and the Arrows, it was great/". Instead of the social awkwardness due to a lack of common ground, these two children from different ends of the spectrum would at least have the chance of using this common denominator to start a friendship down the line.

While I believe that a muggle-born child growing up with one foot in both worlds might create its own kind of issues, some time spent in preparation would help them not stand out so negatively.

** I'd say all of the above, but most of all #2.

In one fic I made the Death Eaters - or rather the people behind the organisation and the Dark Lord, fight against the anti-tradition dogma that has risen after Grindelwalds war. The short summary is that the Ministry has forbidden traditional fests like Beltane, Samhain, Yule, Ostara,... and destroyed shrines of the gods that were praised there in order to clean up the spots where Grindelwald has recruited his powerbase. Feeling slighted by this, the purebloods lash out against those they think are responsible for this extreme prejudice by the Ministry - the Muggles, Muggleborn and the one pushing this legislation onward, Albus Dumbledore. Voldemort decides that to further his own goals, he could ride this wave, and subsequently gives this movement an even worse name.

** I hate the culture argument so much. Wizarding culture is shit, for the most part wizards seem to put themselves above other sentient creatures, enslaved a race of them, took rights away from those with diseases etc. That sounds really dramatic but from a purely canon point why would they respect wizarding culture? The fear of pure blood argument is basically an argument that white extremists use to argue against race mixing is that really the best argument to use?

That being said though I will never understand why when trying to write a book that tries to make muggle haters sympathetic that they don't go towards history. Witches and wizards have the ability to kill people with something they're given age 11, muggles created a bomb capable of killing millions and wiping out the earth. The cold war is such a great reason that could be used in fanfics for people being anti muggle but i never see it touched upon at all, just shitty things like 'not respecting wizarding culture' or 'purebloods dying out'.

That that's shit is your perspective and my perspective and probably the perspective of most muggleborns, but you won't find much sympathy from Lucius Malfoy or Dolores Umbridge. To them, equal rights for werewolves would make as much sense as letting dogs vote or promoting the rights of broccoli.

If one person suggested that, you'd laugh. If fifty people suggested it, independently, in all earnestness, and they were also from the same group, you'd start to develop opinions about that group. It would take a fair amount of awareness, patience, and effort to avoid getting biased.
