I think this is because the difficulty of learning spells seems wrong in canon. The instruction is fully somatic -- aside from the Patronus and a little bit with the Unforgiveables, the way people cast spells seems to be a wand movement and a couple words and nothing else. The somatic components seem moderately but not horribly strict -- you need to get the stress right on the incantation, but wizards didn't invent the IPA, and varying accents from throughout the Atlantic archipelago all work.

There's no obvious place there for spells to be difficult to learn.

If the wand motions were incredibly rigid and the pronunciations exactingly precise... well, then a duel to the death would be lost the moment your wand arm got slightly injured. If there were a lisping curse that bypassed shields, that would be the only spell you'd need. And wizards would use enchanted devices or guns or swords rather than spells, much of the time.

If the somatic components were less important than the feelings, we'd have seen those feelings mentioned during classes.

So letting people learn any spell they want with ease is canon-compliant.

**** Yes and no. I mean that is all that is explained to us, and yet we see it taking a while most of the time. I'm guessing there is fundamental concepts that must be understood before they can be used, or a trick to the way they focus on the spell. Maybe a limit of how much magic they can use, and those spells are too strong.

I mean DA spent how long for each spell? And fourth year, they spent how long on summoning/banishing? If what you are saying is real, Hogwarts could basically be a year long, then have supplemental courses for specialists. There has to be something more to it.

** There is no good reason to criticize Molly Weasley's parenting style. Humiliating Ron at Hogwarts? Totally justified- the kid stole a car and broke the most fundamental law of their world, dragging down Harry's reputation in the process. A Howler was a kindness.

Sending Hermione a small Easter egg? It was an understandable message if you look at the subtext- 'I have reason to think you're being trouble for Harry, but I don't have enough solid info to abjectly shun you- please make my son write and explain'.

Trying to keep Harry away from Order business? Even if they weren't on orders from Dumbledore to keep critical info out of Harry's head, Molly had reason to expect Harry to throw himself into the conflict when he was half-trained and unprepared for the maturity required to work with people you hate. Her own losses made her concerns very real and specific arguments for holding back information.

The fandom likes to vilify or caricaturize Molly Weasley, and I'm having none of it.

**** When I read about it the first time, it seemed cold-hearted, but later I was impressed at the elegance of the message. Molly didn't send a howler, didn't skip her entirely, and yet expressed her feelings on Hermione's 'actions'. It's not like she has the right to send Hermione a letter asking her to justify her behavior.

Also, there was no way for Molly to know how the rest of the world was harassing Hermione. Basically the fault for this one lies with Ron, Ginny and the twins for not updating their mum about was being falsely reported.

I can't imagine what it'd be like to be friends with a teenaged pop star, but if my mother was a fan and known to follow the press on him, I'd probably be ready with damage-control if said pop-star was the center of a scandal.

*** You have some points. But she is over-protective to a fault. The phrase "Molly-coddle" is most likely the source of her name. Bill and Charlie leave the country after graduation, taking what appear to be some of the most dangerous jobs possible. Percy abandons the family.

Howlers are a classless way to express anger, not a proper way to punish your children. In the states, public humiliation is illegal and is considered a cruel and unusual punishment.

Molly used love potions, and encouraged the use of the same.

She had 7 children during the middle of what is supposed be the most terrifying reign of a dark lord.

Molly is a flawed character. She might not deserve all the hate she receives, but some of it is believable. Just like Dumbledore bashing is believable.

**** Bill and Charlie were two very successful students who took lucrative careers that followed their interests. Their bravery and competence is not in question, either. How does that reflect badly on Molly?

Percy was held in contempt for betraying the family by the whole family- it wasn't Molly saying 'he should be banished', if anything she was hopeful that he'd stop distancing himself from the group to serve his political ambitions.

Whether howlers exceed decency depends on what other options are considered valid by society. They were common in HP's world. Also, I wouldn't say the states has the reputation for raising the best-behaved kids, so maybe making humiliation and other punishments a legal sin is going to bite us badly over the next generation.

On love potions, I have a personal observation: when I was in my teens, I was so tongue-tied about approaching girls that having one dose me with a love potion would have been a blessing. It wouldn't have been enslavement- just a way to move past the petrifying anxiety that is fear of rejection.

Molly had seven kids during a war. Most governments consider that patriotic. Given the limited size of the wizarding world, it can also be seen as empire-building, which while surprising isn't actually evil.

I get that she's not a saint, but aside from a bit of presumption, she's a domestic goddess, and I'm stumping for the end of all the fics where she's stealing from Harry and maneuvering to control him by forcing a marriage to Ginny (who incidentally is also maligned and mischaracterized, but that's a different rant).

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

***** It is possible the actions of the eldest three are perfectly benign (with regards to Molly). Or maybe they're trying to exert control over their own lives, over compensating by choosing jobs that let them experience the thrills they were never allowed living under Molly.

Punishments are meant as a deterrent. Don't do X or otherwise Y will happen. Public humiliation is a poor deterrent. It might work as a deterrent against the first offence, but once you've been publicly humiliated, then there is far less deterrent against repeat offences. After all, everyone already knows it, so future humiliation has less of a sting. Besides, humiliation seems more about revenge than about punishment. About hurting the wrong doer.

Seven kids during war. the government being happy/unhappy about seven kids is irrelevant. Would you travel with your children to a country in the midst of a war? To a place where terrorist attacks happen daily? If not, why would giving birth to children be any different? You are endangering children, period. The first couple of years, okay, bad things are happening, but the government will take care of it. But in the late 70's, you ought to know better.

Love potions. Voldemort is a love-potion baby, which ought to be enough to make you stop and think. But using your personal observation: what would you say if one of the girls you didn't like dosed you with a love potion? And then the girl you did like saw? What happens with the love potion wears off? I would suggest that if you dosed yourself with a love potion - no problem. Having a girl dose you - without consent: immoral. Further, I would suggest that maybe another potion - a "calming drought", or a "confidence infusion" would be better solutions to the problem.

So, definitely not a saint. I'm not saying she's evil, I'm just saying that I understand where bashers might think so. For example, Ginny giving Harry a love potion is not in Harry's best interests, period. How do we really know that the motivation was "getting Harry's attention" instead of "getting Harry's money"?

I'm not quite certain I'd even agree with Molly being a domestic goddess. If she was, then I'd imagine that Molly would be making clothing that fits for her children instead of them having thread-bare hand-me downs. And when I say "make", I don't mean conjuring or transfiguring. I mean using charms to control needles, threads and bolts of cloth. Molly made Christmas jumpers, why not more clothing? If Hermione can figure out how to knit socks and hats in 4th year, I can't imagine a "domestic goddess" having problems making regular clothing.

****** 'Domestic goddess' is hyperbole, and I have to admit she falls short in several areas- Ron's robes not being hemmed right and providing him with corned beef sandwiches he doesn't like. Ron even at eleven had a sense that Molly was overworked in trying to keep all five school-aged kids fed, clothed, supplied and yet under enough control to prevent the muggles of Devon from raising the torches and pitchforks.

The Burrow operates as a hobby farm- they have their own vegetable gardens, chickens and such, so while Arthur is gone most of the day doing government work, Molly's managing operations at home. Despite Ron's poorly hemmed robes, I got the sense that Molly did make all their clothes- and I love the imagery of animated needles you provided. When the twins complained that Percy got new robes for being a prefect, it made the point- the Weasleys are 'thematically Catholic Irish' without actually being such.

Also, fair point on the love potions; it always fits better in your head when you imagine the cute girl in Math is the one giving you the potion, and not the ill-bathed mouth-breather that likes to stare at you from her dark corner of the lunchroom, which is much more likely.

/Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly./

The key word here is made, not used. Fred and George make Love Potions. Slughorn might have made the Amortentia.

The rest of the time, Arthur is the calm voice of reason to counter her anxieties, as when he supported keeping the twins in the conversation when Harry met the Order at Grimmauld.

That leaves us with a grand total of one confirmed gay character. You don't like slash fics, fine, don't read them, but I can't agree with this uncomfortably prevalent attitude of "JKR's characters are /straight/, you can't write them in queer relationships!"

** Fluff. A story needs some conflict to be engaging.

Ships. Of course, for any story with some romance the author will need to figure out pairings. But the amount of focus on ships in the fanfiction world constantly irks me. If it's a good story I really don't care who ends up getting with who.

Too much dialogue. A novel isn't a play or a television script; there won't be a set or actors to fill in the details of the scene. You won't have their subtle expressions to convey fleeting emotions. All of this needs to be done with prose in a novel, and a story that focuses too much on dialog comes off as feeling empty, faded, and shallow. I often see people complaining about "too much description, not enough dialog" or something along those lines (not only in fanfiction, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time comes to mind); I don't think I've ever had that complaint in my life.
