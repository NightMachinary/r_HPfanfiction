I'm a whumper and am looking for fics where one of the kids loose control of their magic, whether a one time thing due to emotions or because they have trouble in general. I guess my ideal fic would involve Harry struggling, Sirius being there, someone getting hurt/comfort, and little or no Harry and Snape interactions. Also I know it's uncommon but I'm only a Canon shipper. Thanks to all who reply.
