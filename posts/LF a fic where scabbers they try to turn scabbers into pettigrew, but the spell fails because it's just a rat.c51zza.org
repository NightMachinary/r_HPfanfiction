I'm looking for a fic where the shrieking shack scene turns out differently because scabbers isn't wormtail at all. He's just a rat.

I'm curious how that scene would go and I'm exhausted right now and can't think it through for myself. What's your take on it? Have you read it before? What fic? What would change?
