Outside of a short lemons or as part of a harem fic, I've not really seen this pairing in the fandom. I'm kinda tired of Harry getting involved with a perfect "grey" pureblood princess like Daphne Greengrass tbh. So if you have recs to give im all ears.

As for a prompt:

Tracy Davis has a secret she has kept ever since her ambitions saw her sorted into the house of the cunning; she's a muggleborn. She managed to pass through her first year with her housemates none the wiser but when her parents bring her to a disastrous busness dinner in little whinging The Boy Who Lived finds out the truth.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** linkffn(6200937) has six pairings one of which is Harry/Tracey. The other pairings are Ginny/Blaise, Draco/Hermoine, Theo/Daphne, Ron/Pansy, and Seamus/Lavender. It's VERY smutty. Like, almost all smut.
