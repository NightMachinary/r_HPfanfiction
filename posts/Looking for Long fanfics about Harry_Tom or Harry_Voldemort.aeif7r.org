Hey, I'm looking for novel length fanfics where Harry is in a relationship with either Tom or Voldemort. I would prefer slash but I'm don't mind. I would also like it if Harry is dark or grey. Not Voldemort or Tom becoming light. If anyone has read any please tell me.


** Linkffn(Full Circle) is primarily slash, but has flashback/forwards of het /and/ femslash. There's also a funny scene where Harry decides to mess with Dumbledore by mirroring Tom's first meeting in the orphanage. Think it's still being written? But I could be wrong.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

** are you new to this pairing? Idk whether i should list my favs (which are pretty well known), or a few lesser known ones. Also, how old would you prefer them to be in, and what decade?

*** I am not new to the pairing. For their age, I would prefer harry to not be an adult, like someone who is not in their 30's. I would also prefer them to not be based in the future, like in the 21st century. They can be in the past or present.
