They're described in both canon ands fanon, but the only one that I remember sounding even remotely useful was that handed man's hand Draco was looking at.\\
Is the majority just deadly junk that purebloods use to show off how deadly and edgy they are? Are there any interesting ones mentioned in fanfiction?


** I always thought dark artifacts can pass curses onto people so if you give it to muggles or someone is snooping where they shouldn't or something.... they regret it.

Other than that though, maybe to protect one object or place.

** It's easy to forget that most witches and wizards just.. suck at magic. One of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' best sellers was a hat charmed to shield the wearer IIRC. If you're a dark wizard but can't actually cast any dark magic, dark artifacts are for you!

*** I would disagree with this slightly

I would say the average witch and wizard has not needed to do anything more then the magic related to the professions they are in for decades

so alot of wizards do not keep practicing shield spells because they dont need it in the day to day life they live

** To harm people or keep them out of unwanted hands. The Firebolt was checked for curses, the horcrux's were enchanted with curses. Remember Dumbledore's hand?

** The hand you're referring to is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_of_Glory][Hand of Glory]], a piece of well-known folklore.

It's implied that most of folklore is either true or a corruption of how wizards actually do things. Check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mythological_objects][this list]] for a massive list of various items in folk/myth lore. It's not hard to see how a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_stone][hag stone]], for instance, might be part of a Dark ritual.

** Fanon dark arts/magic seems to have the same issue. Lots of them sound impressive, but they all boil down to “how to kill one individual in 101 painful ways”:

How about inventing spells or magical devices that:

- Improve the accuracy, ease, range and rate of fire of Avada Kedavra. In my version of magical world, American wizards managed to create a semiautomatic gun that fires Avada Kedavra bullets. It has more than double the range of the original killing curse, fires at 6 times the rate, and doesn't require any emotional component in casting.
- Improve the range and radius of area effective spells. Instead of only heat, the explosive effects can be cold, acid, and poison.
- Make more use of transfiguration and conjuration. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), does an excellent job showing the power of animation and transfiguration.
- Involve alchemy, and how does aerosolized basilisk venom sound?
- combine magic and technology. Do you like a machine gun that fires without recoil, has vastly expanded magazine, and is magically cooled? Do you like a flying invisible [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_tracked_armoured_vehicle][Warrior IFV]] with a vastly expanded interior and portkey capability? Do you want to mount super trunks on brooms so they can be turned into [[https://youtu.be/UxgiBJATe9M][strategic bombers]]?
- Track locations of individuals using blood magic; vice versa, block scrying attempts with blood magic. Or enchant items that let wearers communicate each other with their thoughts. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), goes into that.
- Build super wards with sacrificial blood magic. Executing prisoners to strengthen your defenses sounds like a perfectly reasonable dark magic idea.
- Directly destroy the weakened main soul of individuals with Horcruxes, of course involving horrible sacrifices as ritual components.

*** *Warrior tracked armoured vehicle*

The Warrior tracked vehicle family is a series of British armoured vehicles, originally developed to replace the older FV430 series of armoured vehicles. The Warrior started life as the MCV-80, "Mechanised Combat Vehicle for the 1980s". One of the requirements of the new vehicle was a top speed able to keep up with the projected new MBT, the MBT-80 - later cancelled and replaced by what became the Challenger 1 - which the then-current FV432 could not. The project was begun in the 1970s.
