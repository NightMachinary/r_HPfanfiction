what are your favorite classic HP fan fictions!! just finished reading the Debt of Time by ShaylaLonnie and it was so incredible im looking for more great ones :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors][Timely Errors]] is amazing. I read it when I was about 12 and it still holds up:

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected.

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is definitely old enough to be a classic, and is one of my personal favourites, unfortunately incomplete and only very occasionally updated (about once every three years). FFN deleted it for bogus reasons; the only place to get chapter 43 now is the community-maintained PDF/eBook [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest][on Github]].

Adult Harry finishes off Voldemort after thirteen years of war, but every other character is dead and everywhere is destroyed, so he gambles his life on an experimental technique to send his soul back in time. Where he sets out to make things go differently this time around. As well as having a good balance of foreknowledge with unexpected "butterfly of doom" happenings cropping up, I like the way it's very character-focused; instead of wrapping things up with a quick Horcrux hunt, it has Harry rebuilding his relationships with his friends and preparing them. (After all, taking down Tom may be his special mission, but Voldemort was merely a catalyst for existing forces. Even if they can take him out early, there could still be a war.)

** In my mind, the classics are those that actually built a reputation big enough that people were faking them as bootleg copies of the actual books.

For example: "Harry Potter and the Phoenix Order" and its sequel "Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients". The author of those stories was really creative but he was probably also writing for the first time. "Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent" was a bit of a shock for my eleven year old mind because I didn't expect sex scenes in a Harry Potter book when I fell for it in my awaiting of OotP. I believe the original Mary Sue who was transferred from a different school and had magical creature blood was the protagonist from a story called "Veela" which was surprisingly well written given the theme.

In terms of stories that can still be found today on ff:

- LogicalRaven's Harry Potter's years 6 and 7 and their sequel;

- NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series;

- Vekin87's Albus Potter series;

- War is Over was really popular about six-seven years ago but people sort of forgot about it;

- The Red Dragons Order saga.

*** Ah man, Psychic Serpent, that brings me back to FictionAlley and junior high (2005 ish). That's a classic indeed.

If OP hasn't read it, and it's sequels, you probably should. I don't know if it's still on FFN, but Barb actually has some rather nice PDFs somewhere.

** A series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][“Nineteen Years and Beyond”]] by Northumbrian (start with “Tales of the Battle”). There are some other stories by him on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][FFnet]] and [[https://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][SIYE]].

** My favourite fanfiction is probably "A second chance" by Breanie, and that's because Harry and Sirius are my favourite characters and THEY DESERVED so much better so I like reading fanfictions with Sirius raising him and being a father figure. It's still a WIP and I'm like 100 chapters behind but I'm reading it very slowly when I'm in the mood for it.

(I mainly spend time reading fanfictions with this trope)

I don't know if you like reading Dramione, but "The fallout" was probably the fanfiction I was the most emotionally attached to. It's a canon divergent story that focuses on the war against Voldemort and where the OOTP is actually active (not like in canon). It's quite heavy though because it focuses on Hermione's mental health and how she copes with everything (she's NOT like canon but has more realistic troubles). I still need to re-read it but can't get myself to do it because it's an emotional rollercoster and Everythursday's (or sage) writing style needs you to really focus into what you're reading.

My personal favourite (although I don't know if you could consider it a classic? ) is "Blood Binding" by SphinxScribe. It's about James and Lily somehow combing back to life after the graveyard scene. I love Jily and really believe the marauders deserved so much better (aside from Pettigrew). Plus Harry meeting his parents is so wholesome I just wanted to read more, but unfortunately it only talks about 5th year. It has an "open ending" so we never really know what happens next.

Edit : If you like Sirimione and Time travel then maybe try reading "Sands of destiny" by amidtheflowers. It's a WIP though and wasn't updated since 2020.

*** Have you read the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, then? It's a somewhat different take on Sirius raising Harry from age eight, book five is still in progress. No pairing for Harry yet, although there was an interesting fake-dating subplot and the canonical (though earlier) failed relationship with Cho. I quite like it for making everyone just people; no /deus ex machina/ Black family magic, no character bashing, Harry simply gets a flawed-but-caring parental figure.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

Apparently, the author took it down from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10382653/]], but it seems to be mirrored on [[https://fanfiction.ws/s/10382653/1/Blood-Binding]], and if you ask I can send you the link to my EPub via PM.
