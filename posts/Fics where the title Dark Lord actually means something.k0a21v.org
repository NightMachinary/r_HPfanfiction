I've read a couple fics where being a Dark Lord means something magically; in one, it was a title granted by magic to bring balance and in the other it was a recognition of having achieved certain things.

Id love to see more fics with similar world-building. Ideally either 100k+ or completed, but besides that anything goes.


** Well there is linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda) which requires someone to meet certain steps to become a Dark Lord. The story is Harrymort, though it hasn't gotten much to that point by the latest chapter. Unfortunately unfinished.

Not quite Dark Lord story, but would suggest a read anyway. linkao3(The Wizen Kins Redemption by JayneSmith)

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** linkffn(The Odds Were Never in my favor by Antony444) being a Lord or Lady does really mean something here Dark refers more to the alignment of the magic one uses and indulging in dark magic does have real costs in the end.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
