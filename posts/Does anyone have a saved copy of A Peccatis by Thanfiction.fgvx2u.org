Yes I'm aware of the controversies and that he's a scumbag. However, I've found copies of the other two fics in the trilogy so here's hoping.

EDIT: I got a mobi and HTML copy from another forum.

Google Drive Link for the HTML: [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxjNxXymOsJtlkTrw_jmV9F6w5dVdMuG/view?usp=drivesdk]]

PM me if it doesn't work or you want the mobi version.

EDIT 3/12/19: Someone (or someones) with a lot of dedication and time edited the messed up formatting on the HTML link! Just open it with Google Docs and the edited version should be available there in a readable format. Thanks to the person (or people) that worked hard to make it readable!


** Why's he a scumbag? I don't know of this guy, so i'm only asking out of curiosity.

*** Apparently he's a cult leader/scammer. I didn't read too much about it but it's all over the internet and he deleted all his works.

** Ah and what are the fics like? I've never heard of them, pairing? Is it slash? Is it well written

***** First book in the trilogy, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, is (IMO) very well written. Supposedly canon-compliant account of the Hogwarts students during year 7. A little bit of slash, some pairings, but focus is not on any of the pairings.

Sluagh & A Peccatis are more controversial.
