To expend, as an instance. if Ginny calls Fleur Phlegm, even behind her back. Harry (for instance) doesn't laugh at her "joke", he calls out the younger Weasley for being unnecessarily bitchy towards someone who didn't deserve it. Ginny actually reacts with realization and apologizes for her rude behaviour.

This doesn't mean bash-fics though, I don't have any sort of interest in them.


** Although I don't like Ginny much - or, more accurately, I dislike her undeveloped state in canon and the majority of her appearances in fanon - I have to say that I'm leaning towards her side on this one. Fleur has been kind of white-washed in fanfics. She acted the part of a bitch in quite a few cases in canon.

Before the ministry falls, there are quite a few points of friction between Fleur and Bill's family.

There's the looks thing. There's the (presumable) wealth thing. There's the French/English thing. There's the veela blood thing. Now at first glance, it's easy to imagine Fleur taking a look at the Weasley family and immediately declaring herself their /better/ and subtly acting the part of a Princess consenting to interact with the plebs. Perhaps she wouldn't, if she was a humble person. But I don't see Fleur being all that humble.

Of course after the camping trip from hell, all that changes.

Anyway, that tangent aside, it sounds like you're looking for a story where Ginny is /nuanced/. A rare thing, to be sure, as in 99% of stories her character is either elevated to Mary Sue-ish levels, or she is bashed to oblivion.

The only Ginny-centric story I thorougly enjoyed is linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb)

*** I agree. People also need to remember that Ginny's attitude towards Fleur, along with Molly and Hermione's don't come from nowhere or simply jealousy of her looks.

Ginny's #1 pet peeve is being treated as a child. We see this frequently throughout the series (Molly forcing her to go to her room while everyone else gets to hear what the Order has been up to, being the youngest of 7, Harry breaking it off to protect her, her entire family and Harry telling her she is too young to fight in the final battle). Fleur treats her like a child. Thus, while Ginny is a bit out of line and actually reinforces the notion that she is a child with her behavior, I totally understand why she doesn't like Fleur.

*** Until the Astronomy Battle at the end of Book 6, Fleur didn't give up a good impression anyway. We readers of course have the hindsight, but our in-story characters didn't know that at the beginning of Book 6! After that event, they immediately changed their attitudes toward Fleur, like us.

**** I didn't see it as a rbn thing, so much as she believed Fleur didn't actually love Bill. I suspect that Molly was possibly thought Bill was slightly Veela infatuated, and not really in love either. It was a protective thing, in a way. Fleur was quite a bit younger, and fresh out of school. Fleur was French, Veela, and upper class, and though Bill was good-looking, and had a good job, it wasn't really an equal relationship, on the face of it.

** I think this is an interesting request, but my question is who would call Ginny out for her rude behavior?

Harry is pretty mean in his internal dialogue and also still has a lot of growing up to do during year 6.

Hermione doesn't like the fact that Fleur is more knowledgeable and beautiful than her, and doesn't appreciate the way Ron stares at her.

Ron might speak up and tell her to lay off, but everyone would assume he's doing so because of his turgid meatrod and not because excluding Fleur hurts Bill too.

Molly doesn't like Fleur for being another sign that her eldest son is an adult and has to make his own choices in life, no longer needing his mother in the same way as he used to.

Arthur isn't around to see much of the snotty back talk and bickering, and in a way I imagine with 7 children smack talk is just a fact of life.

Luna could try to ask Ginny why she chooses to attack Fleur, but no one listens to Luna except when they're alone and vulnerable.

*** Yes, Harry was still angry at being called â€˜leetle boy' by her two years ago.

Hermione was just as pissed at Fleur as Ginny. She only appeared more subtle in front of Harry, but we don't know what else she had said when she was alone with Ron.

Fleur was most likely used to receive hostile reactions from HETEROSEXUAL females anyway. She even seemed to enjoy playing the role of a snobbish airhead. If we readers didn't have the knowledge of her later behaviors and actions, we also wouldn't appreciate her at that point.
