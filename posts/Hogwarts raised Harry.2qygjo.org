Anything with a Hogwarts raised Harry? Preferably long and powerful Harry.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9200391/1/Home][Home]] features a Hogwarts-raised Harry, though I haven't read far enough to know how good he is in terms of magical ability. Hope this helps?

*** Yes! Thank you! I've been wanting to read something like this for awhile. One of the first fics I've read was something similar to this but Its been so long I don't really remember much other than Harry roaming the halls.

** Do you mean "Raised in Hogwarts by teachers" or "Raised BY Hogwarts itself"?

*** I meant by teachers but by Hogwarts sounds interesting if there's anything like that??

*** I wouldn't mind reading a raised by Hogwarts myself if that even exists.

***** With all the fics out there where Hogwarts has a human form, there's almost certainly one or two. Granted, many of them feature 'Lady Hogwarts' making sweet, sweet magic with Harry, but still...
