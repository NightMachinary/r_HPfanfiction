Hi, im looking for a specific HP fanfic that I read a few years ago:

It's a good Tom/ bad Dumbledore story, Tom is a respected member of society, Harry is friends withe the Malfoy. Draco and Harry want to go to a ministry ball and Draco disguises Harry as a female and gives him/her a new name. Dumbledore & the others recognized him/her as someone from the past, Dumbledore attacks him/her, so he/she gets sent to the past where he/she stays as a woman and side with tom and get one of his most aggressive Death Eaters.

Thats all I remember, maybe someone else members this story too. Thanks in advance.
