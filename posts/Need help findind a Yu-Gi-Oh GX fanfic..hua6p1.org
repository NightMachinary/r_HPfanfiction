:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here's what I remember.

It was Jaden/Alexis.

Jaden was either the apprentice or son of Yugi. (I think it was son).

The timeline was changed, so 5ds took place before GX.

Yusei had given Jaden Stardust Dragon.

The first time Jaden summoned Stardust, his classmates were calling it fake or stolen, before Yusei (who was being projected on a screen, together with the other signers), said that he gave it to Jaden.

I read the fics before Bonds Beyond time came out.

Jaden eventually got a Duel Runner.

It was a long fanfic.

*** Yup, I accidentally posted in HPfanfiction, instead of plain old fanfiction.
