I would like to see a year 4 war fic between multiple races/nations.

- Starts during Year 4
- During second task, Gabrielle Delacour is killed by Merpeople before Harry could reach the hostages. -Delacour family must be related to one of Veela enclaves leaders.
- is either Harry/Fleur or a harry/female Veela OC

As for war, On one side is: Magical UK, Merpeople, Dumbledore/OotP and Voidmorts/DE. On other side is Magical French and Veela nations. Harry Potter and his friends decides to help the French because he had enough of being manipulated by headmaster. Voidmorts only help Britains because it would help kill off merpeople and veelas along with non-purebloods. Multiple birds with one stone so to speak.

** I doubt fics for this premise exist, but here are two in which a significant war is fought against the French:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): After Harry and Hermione fought back very violently against a marriage law, the French decided to intervene. It doesn't end well for the French magical establishment.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and to help Harry. Voldemort takes over the Ministry and asks the French to intervene. It doesn't end well for the French magical establishment.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** While this would be plausible in the 19th century and earlier, there is little to no chance of it realistically happening after the WW1 and WW2.
