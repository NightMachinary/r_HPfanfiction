:FlairText: Prompt
:END:
In pretty much every fic where a first year with something to hide is about to be sorted, they internally panic because they are afraid that it will tell others that they're secretly a time traveler, from a parallel universe, or a self insert. But as it conveniently turns out the Sorting Hat tells them that its prohibited from sharing their secrets.

This Prompt is basically, what if its not, and what happens because of it.

Another possibility is that the Sorting Hat likes to amuse himself by embarrassing certain students with their secrets, like revealing that Draco has wet his bet last month or that Lavender thinks kissing can get you pregnant.


** Sixth year.

Dumbledore: Sorting hat, what can you tell me about Draco Malfoy?

hat: Dumbledore... Remember when I was put on his head and sorted him right to Slytherin?

Dumbledore: Yess...

Hat: Exactly! I didn't want to stay in that freak's head. *shivers

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

*** Wow, that was entertaining. I can't tell if a longer fic along the same lines would be more fun or less, but if certainly like to read one if it exists.

**** As would I, i unfortunately haven't seen any that take this and expand it.

If you want fics where Harry just goes back and becomes DADA prof, there's: linkffn(Wind Shear; Disorder of the Phoenix; Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool), and a bunch more I'm sure.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
