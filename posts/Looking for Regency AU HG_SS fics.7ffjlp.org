So I have this mad, passionate love for Regency fiction. And I've read a couple of Regency fics, mainly HGSS (I'll rec them once I'm done pleading, so you, too, can explore the glory that is Regency AU HPFic) and I /love them so much/ that I would very much like to read more, if anyone could rec some.

The ones I've read are:

linkffn(Of Muggles and Magic by Aurette). Aurette is a genius, and this is her masterpiece. Seriously, this fic is in the Top 5 SSHG fics I've ever read, and in the Top 10 HPFics I've read. Even if you don't like Regency, even if you don't like SSHG, you should still read this because it's fantastic.

Lord Snape's Dilemma by April Grey. This fic is available on FFN, but I would recommend reading it on Ashwinder or the WIKTT Archive instead, since it was severely trimmed to survive the Purges. It's not bad. I mean, it could be worse, but it's a bit meh in my opinion. A fun short read for a lazy morning.

A Bluestocking Thing by JustJeanette. It's on Ashwinder, and it's abandoned, and it's amazing. I cry when I think of the fact that this story, which had really just gotten started, will probably never be completed.

linkffn(His Draught of Delicate Poison by Subversa) is hella long and really fun to read, although there are scenes where I find Hermione absolutely out of character. It's not exactly Regency, but it has that sort of feel to it, with the balls and the parties and everyone having marriage on the brain.

Subversa is, in fact, a good choice if you like Regency, or if you like a Snape that's had some of his rough edges polished away without being boring. A Darcy!Snape, in fact. Not exactly realistic, but still fun to read. Her Hermiones are not as consistent, but they're always at least decent. Linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble) is a very fun read as well, with HPDM as a background ship and past HGRW.

There may be a few more, but they were neither long enough nor good enough to stick in my mind.

So if anyone has any recs for me in this genre, I'd be deeply appreciative.

P.S - Since I'm here, I'm looking for Lulabelle72's work. I believe it was taken offline in 2010, so if anyone has any quite old archives that they've been holding on to, I'd be deeply appreciative.


** I've read all but one on this list and it just got added to my queue. Regency Gamble and ANYTHING by subversa (regardless of setting) are favorites of mine for always.

**** She is! I go back to her stuff time and again. I haven't read Lord Snape's Dilemma. But I normally stick to Ashwinder and Petulant Poetess for five, so I'm sure I have missed a ton.

***** Lord Snape's Dilemma is not awful, but it's definitely not the best.

There was apparently a Regency AU Challenge on WIKTT, but it was apparently not as succesful as the Marriage Law Challenge. which is tragic, because I mean, SSHG is the most Regency ship in the history of shipping.

  A/U. At the end of war, the Wizengamot has passed a Marriage Law. The Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.

  After the war, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is in a financial bind. Special Ministry worker Hermione Granger is on site with a team of helpers, full of fundraising ideas, and it seems that Headmaster Snape objects to her very presence there

** You may have seen this one already, but I enjoyed [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12098][The Language of Flowers]] by LadyStrange on Ashwinder. It's the first regency fic I remember reading, way back in 2005. I seem to recall it having kind of a War of the Roses meets Sense and Sensibility vibe.

*** Ohh I forgot to add that one!

I've read it and it was okay, but I felt like it would have been better if it hadn't been so weighed under by Author's Notes. There is /no need/ to define a term every time it's used, really. And sometimes the notes were longer than the chapter!

Plus some parts were a bit weird and annoying, and by the end I wasn't sure what exactly Sterne and Granger saw in each other, since they were both perfectly obnoxious.

Still, worth a read if you take care to skip the notes.

Her other things are much more enjoyable to be honest.

*** Regency fiction is fiction set within the Regency era, like the works of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer. That's the kind of thing I'm looking for.

Basically I'm looking for SSHG fic that remind people of Austen or Heyer's works. Preferably long, but honestly at this point if someone were to throw me a 10k regency AU that was complete and well-written, I'd be delighted.

** A little late to the party but I would recommend checking out the list from the SS/HG Quiz Regency list. [[http://quiz-sshg.livejournal.com/110616.html]] It's a great place to find older SS/HG stories by genre. I miss the Quiz a lot. Also [[https://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/]] is still alive. Not as active as it used to be but some of us are still around.

*** Ohhh, thank you! I'll go have a look over there, and check out snapeluvshermy also. How does SLH work though? Do you make a post asking for what you want and wait for replies or...? (I never really used LJ a lot except for reading Maya's fic back in the day, so I don't know the protocol)

**** Sure you can just make a post asking for recommendations, for a certain fic, if you can't remember the name of a fic, or need help finding one. And then people will reply with an answer. They are always really helpful and nice even if what you want isn't on the internet anymore. There are a few SS/HG communities still going over there and I have never met anyone mean or who is into fandom drama. Besides a few friends and a couple other communities the SS/HG fandom on LJ is what keeps me around over there.
