I think i might Crosspost this Request to a Non-HP reddit, because i think such a content would be rather rare in this. I got the Idea by watching a Bossfight of Final Fantasy Mobius against FF8 Ultimecia and i thought "what if there is a similar character like her, but more...."misunderstood" (i use this Word because im in lack for better ones). Yes she is evil and its her Nature, she wants to destroy or "form" everything, but at the same time she also is longing for Love. Emotional and Physical Love."

So said "being" can be travelling from World to World or from Dimension to dimension to either destroy anything or form it to her Wishes. If she shows any attractivity to a male that catched her eye and flirts with him, he only thinks that she is crazy and so she is forced to kill him too.

Now, that i think and read about it, it possibly sounds like some kind of lame idea. But the imagine of an Evil enemy that becomes "tamer" with a Servant on her side, that also acts as her lover is appealing to me. He might be her "servant", but he is actually more than that. He fullfill her wishes, but he also supress her anger (dark side) and maybe might even to make her change her mind (not that others wouldnt be able to do that and she thinks, what she wants and thinks is absolute right, but more like he would be able to change her mindset about her wrong believes....if he can make plausible arguments).

I will leave the possibility open for her having a Harem, either they follow her into other Worlds or they stay in their world, so she has a big group of admirers but seperated.
