Hi Everyone,

I've been having trouble finding some AU stories to read. So instead I restarted one I began a few years back. I'm about to break the 40k word count barrier and it seems like it's been well received. I'm hoping some of you guys might want to check it out.

linkffn(The Elusive Prince)

A quick summary:

Harry drains Voldemort of his magic that night instead of rebounding it. Magic is a deeper part of his life and he studies it from an early age. Dumbledore is a grandfather/mentor figure in this story. Single pairing, but I've written in two female main characters to keep the mystery up.

Thanks ahead for anyone willing to check it out, constructive criticism is always appreciated.


** I'll definitely follow this! I love the fics where Harry explores magic a bit more and is powerful.

  Lily alters her spell to drain the magic of voldemort instead of rebounding it. Magic becomes a very deep part of Harry's life from the very beginning. A story where Harry explores the wonders of magic, and everything that comes with it. AU/Non-canon
