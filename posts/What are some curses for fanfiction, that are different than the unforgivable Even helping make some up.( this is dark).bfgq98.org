** Curse that turns a wizard into a muggle. Not reversible because nobody knows how to give magic to a muggle, just this curse that takes it away. This kind of curse would be especially reviled in wizard society.

Curse that causes a woman, or man I suppose, to give birth to themselves. An especially terrible way to transfigure someone into a baby.

Conjoined killing curse. Hits multiple people. Forces them into a mental conference where they decide which one of them dies or they all do. Time passes as normal on the outside.

**** life debts in harry potter don't work like that.

the person who the debt is owed to has no control over it. they can't just call on it or declare it's terms or even cancel it.

it doesn't even need to be repaid in kind, you don't need to save their life to clear a life debt. snape's life debt to james was even cleared after james' own death. it wasn't even cleared all at one, it happened in little pieces every time snape protected harry.

****** alright but it seems like a bad story plot if you don't work the impications into the story.

if you can dictate the terms of a life debt slytherins would go out of their way to save people. then they would use the threat of the life debt to enslave them without ever actually calling on it. the same way a magus in Fate can hold a command seal over the head of a servant without actually using it.

hell, james saving his enemy from one of his own friends plot generated a life debt in james favor. creating an environment where people need saving would then be beneficial for people looking to enslave others.

** A couple I've used in various published or unpublished things, for your inspiration:

Cascade Curse: causes the victim to explode violently, splattering blood everywhere...and then anyone who comes into contact with the cursed blood also explodes, sending out more cursed blood...and repeat. Great for room clearing! And area denial.

The Serpent's Grasp: a curse that progressively constricts around the victim as they struggle to move against it, ultimately resulting in them being crushed into suffocation if if it's not countered. Slow, tortuous death. Incantation "/Manus serpentis/".

Plague Hex/Curse: incantation /"Pustulens"/. Infects the area immediately around the impact site with a custom-tailored disease, as contagious or as lethal as you'd like. Can be /very/ creative with the effects. No specific counter - the healers have to deal with each new plague from it separately, treating them as unknown new diseases rather than a spell.

Curse of Bliss: causes the target to experience all pain as mind-numbing, addictive pleasure. Victims left untreated degenerate into desperately self-destructive behavior in search of a new high, and lose all sense of self-preservation in battle. Accidental suicide in under a week, usually. Disturbing to watch. Obscure enough that the counter isn't widely known or easy to find.

The Sword Curse: very simple curse - it projects a cutting edge from the tip of your wand to as far as you want it to go. Wave your wand, behead a room full of unprepared enemies - or just scratch your name into the far wall. The spell itself doesn't project an actual, physical sword - it's more like an invisible laser - so no swordfighting with it, but it does get paired with Herpo's Mirror almost universally - a nominally Dark shield spell that reflects spells that hit it, including the Sword Curse - as part of a specific "Sword-and-Shield" dueling style.

Bloodline Curses: spells forced onto the entire lineage of a wizarding family, passed down through bloodlines and inheritance. Some ideas: curse guaranteeing all witches bearing it die in childbirth, curse of sterility, cursed to have only one child ever, curse to guarantee death at age 27, curse of immortality without eternal youth, curse to make victims age backwards once they reach 21 until disappearing as a newborn, curse to turn into a mindless animal gradually, curse of enforced illiteracy, curse to ensure all lovers die soon after having sex...

Most of these are banned spells, and grimoires containing them are hunted down and burned, specifically because of their potential to get out of hand. The Plague Hex could spawn a disease that wipes out mankind just as easily as it makes a localized wood-rotting bacteria to eat through a door; the Cascade Curse could be utterly devastating if tainted blood got into a water supply and wasn't too diluted; hit the right bloodline with a blood curse and suddenly half of Britain is sterile; the Sword lets a single wizard wipe out whole squads of Muggles or lesser wizards at a time. They're war spells, for mass destruction, like Fiendfyre. Exactly the kind of thing you might find in an old, untouched Dark pureblood library.

** Fanfic can go Dark very fast :

- Disembowelment Curse : just make the organs explode from the belly, initially created for hunter, turned against wizard very fast.\\
- Blood boiling (or freezing) curse : do exactly what the name says\\
- Flesh roting curse : Same thing than ring Horcruxe, but as a curse for battle\\
- Bone exploding Curse\\
- (More often seen it as a potion but Curse possible) a Madness Curse : either make someone crazy, make him really angry or copy Dementor effects\\
- Voodo : Get an hair or a drop of blood from your victim, link it with a puppet and curse it, whatever you do to the puppet will be felt by the victim.\\
- Some kind of eye rotting or melting : Can't really remember the effect, just that it was long, painfull and Dark Magic, and you had to act really really fast to save the eye (victim in fic lost it, and save thing had happened to Moody)\\
- Bloodline curse : (guess it could exist in canon for the few who consider Cursed Child canon) : do something bad (at worst just a magical AIDS), and transmissible to the children of the victim and its descendant (if you are really vicious, maybe treat it as a full magical AIDS and transmissible with rapports and transfer of fluid).

** Lots of dark spells in fanfics sound impressive, but they all boil down to “how to kill one individual in 101 painful ways”.

What I'm interested are spells or magical devices that:

- Improve the accuracy, ease, range and rate of fire of Avada Kedavra. In my version of magical world, American wizards managed to create a semiautomatic gun that fires Avada Kedavra bullets. It has more than double the range of the original killing curse, fires at 6 times the rate, and doesn't require any emotional component in casting.
- Improve the range and radius of area effective spells. Instead of only heat, the explosive effects can be cold, acid, and poison.
- Make more use of transfiguration and conjuration. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), does an excellent job showing the power of animation and transfiguration.
- Involve alchemy, and how does aerosolized basilisk venom sound?
- combine magic and technology. Do you like a machine gun that fires without recoil, has vastly expanded magazine, and is magically cooled? Do you like a flying invisible [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_tracked_armoured_vehicle][Warrior IFV]] with a vastly expanded interior and portkey capability? Do you want to mount super trunks on brooms so they can be turned into strategic bombers [[https://youtu.be/UxgiBJATe9M][like that]]?
- Track locations of individuals using blood magic; vice versa, block scrying attempts with blood magic. Or enchant items that let wearers communicate each other with their thoughts. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), goes into that.
- Build super wards with sacrificial blood magic. Executing prisoners to strengthen your defenses sounds like a perfectly reasonable dark magic idea.
- Destroy the weakened main soul of individuals with Horcruxes.

*** *Warrior tracked armoured vehicle*

The Warrior tracked vehicle family is a series of British armoured vehicles, originally developed to replace the older FV430 series of armoured vehicles. The Warrior started life as the MCV-80, "Mechanised Combat Vehicle for the 1980s". One of the requirements of the new vehicle was a top speed able to keep up with the projected new MBT, the MBT-80 - later cancelled and replaced by what became the Challenger 1 - which the then-current FV432 could not. The project was begun in the 1970s.

** Blood Gorger curse from Wind Shear linkffn(12511998)

Causes blood to bubble and spray out of any wounds before quickly (minute or less) eating away flesh and exploding. The blood is now infected with the curse and any animal hit with the sprayed blood goes through the same thing causing a chain reaction.

A tactic is to curse a mosquito as a carrier and sit back far away to watch the fun. Harry describes it as an 'army killer' and it's worse than the Unforgivables by the few that know of the spell's existence.

** I read this as curses that are as bad as the Unforgivable's, I've got a few.

Intestines are transformed into snakes. They trying and burrow out of the skin, leading to massive blood loss and no intestines.

Bones transformed into Lead, the metal. As lead is heavy, they would be plummeted towards the ground experiencing something like higher gravity. The lead would give them lead poisoning.

Hung, Drawn, and Quartered. The person is strangled by an invisible rope, their limbs stretched and twisted, and then split into two pieces, cut down through their stomach.

Blood transformation. Blood is transformed/transmuted into acid, some sort of acid that dissolves bones and flesh, not sure which.

Liquid Boiling/Blood Boiling. With Liquid, all liquid is boiled to a extreme temperature, melting the body inside out. The Blood Boiling with boil the blood.

Bone transformed into bamboo plus a advanced growing charm. The bone is transformed/transmuted into bamboo which has been known in Vietnam Torture techniques. The advanced growing charm helps the bamboo grow quickly, leading to death in minutes than days.

Skin Flaying. The skin is flayed off, one piece at a time. Simple.

Teeth are boiled. The teeth are boiled and curse so that teeth cannot grow there again. Derived from the tongue tying curse but made darker and cannot be undone by a counter-spell.

Oxygen transformation into carbon monoxide. Every bit of Oxygen inhaled into the body is transformed into carbon monoxide.

Rather dark so sorry. Hope it helps.

Would tweak the spell so it's not fresh air anymore but water or CO2 (plus maybe something so it's not easily dispeled) count as a curse? Use it either as a combat curse (not convinced since it doesn't seem to be castable long range) or a torture/ execution spell.

** Obliviate is low-key worse than Crucio. Hermione made her parents forget about having raised a daughter for 17 years. If you offered any parent a choice between that and crucio, which do you think they'd pick?

Anything infectious is going to be extremely dangerous. I have a thing in a story I'm working on that doesn't appear to do anything for (x) days, that's gonna be decided as the plot requires, but anyone you touch during that period gets their timer started with the same thing. At the end of the timer, your skin ignites on contact with air. It's very easy to imagine this ending humanity very quickly if no one knows about it.

Inspired by pushing daisies, death-touch curse. Anything the victim touches just instantly dies. Never touch anyone again! No hand holding, no hugging, no entering public areas without taking extreme precautions ever again! Or basilisk-eyes. Do you pluck out your eyes? Do you start carrying around mandrake potion and viewing the world through a periscope? There are a lot of dramatic ways to go in the genre of "make a basic life function extremely dangerous"

Oh hey, it's [[https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-osseous-heteroplasia][Progressive Osseous Heteroplasia!]]

While we are at it, rare diseases could be an excellent source of curses - take its cousin, [[https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fibrodysplasia-ossificans-progressiva][Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva]] (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrodysplasia_ossificans_progressiva][its wikipedia page]] for images, but beware - they are NSFL), which makes it so fibrous tissue gets replaced by bone when damaged. Muscles get damaged every day, and, eventually, a secondary skeleton forms. Remove the growth? It just gets replaced by even more bone.

For faster curses, meant to be used on the battlefield... a flaying curse, bonus points if it's one that was /meant/ to be used for butchering. Sensory deprivation, maybe permanent without a counter-curse - it would be an excellent alternative to the /Cruciatus/. Bone-shattering curse. Tendon-severing curse.
