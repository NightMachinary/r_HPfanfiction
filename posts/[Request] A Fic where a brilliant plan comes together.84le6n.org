** Well, there's linkffn(The Perfect Azkaban Breakout) where Harry's in Azkaban, security's been massively beefed up so it's now impossible to escape, and his friends have to figure out how break him out anyway. Been a while since I read it but I remember it had a very Ocean's 11-type feel.

  A response to all cliched Azkaban!Harry fics. Harry is in Azkaban for a crime he DID commit, leaving Hermione & the Order with a Mission Impossible to get him out. I didn't despise MoRon and Gin when I wrote this, so they get killed, not bashed. Ends HHr.
