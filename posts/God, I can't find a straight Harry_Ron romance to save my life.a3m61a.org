All the Harry/Ron stories have something else going on that distacts from the romanace, Stuff I'm not at all interested in.

I just want straight Harry/Ron romance that starts in sixth year and covers the last two books canonically, but with a focus on the romance.

Nothing else.

*** Sorry, by straight i mean not including anything but romance.

a lot of Harry/Ron fics seem to get other stuff mixed in that I normally skip over.

And before you or anyone else starts calling me a homophobe or something similar i just want to state that i have no problem with people asking for Slash fics on this subreddit. Just want to point out that if you want a fic and there is a subreddit made for the exact thing you're looking for, your best bet would be to look there.

There's a vast sea of difference between "You might also want to ask in [[/r/HPSlashFic]] they might be able to help you as well" and "This is the wrong subreddit!".

Not really. This subreddit has 26k readers, the other one has 1.5k. Seems like a good idea to ask for fanfiction on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] .

******* Well, maybe there is simply nothing which fits that request? OP asks for a pure romance with little to none side plots for a pairing which is not very popular on the fanfiction websites. There might be nothing which fits that, just like you won't find a single decent Harry/Lily story. Or Harry/Demelza Ronbins, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson or Hestia Jones.
