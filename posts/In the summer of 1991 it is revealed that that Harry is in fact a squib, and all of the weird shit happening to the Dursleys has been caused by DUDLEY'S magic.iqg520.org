** "Potter! I demand you to stop this freakiness!" Vernon bellowed furiously, storming to a stop in front of Harry.

"I didn't do anything!" Harry yelled. "I swear I saw Dudley get angry at the teacher and then the next second her hair was blue!"

"Our Dudders wouldn't do such a thing!" Aunt Petunia denied. "It was all you boy!"

Harry, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia stared arguing angrily at each other for a long time until Dudley waddled down the stairs.

"What's all the racket going on down here? I'm trying to watch the television" Dudley shouted, annoyed at being disrupted from watching his favorite TV show.

"Dudley dear, can you tell us about your school day?" Aunt Petunia asked sweetly as if she wasn't just yelling at her nephew a second ago.

Dudley frowned, "Oh, one of my teachers didn't let me talk to Piers so I got really mad at her. I think I even turned her hair blue!" He laughed, oblivious to the matching expressions of horror on his parents face.
