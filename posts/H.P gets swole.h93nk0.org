You figure ol' Dud is probably into some shady stuff, and probably start “juicing” as a way to improve his boing game. Feeling grateful to his puny cousin for saving his bacon(soul) from those Demtenty thingys, he sticks some ‘roids into Harry's trunk with a thank you card. Harry, being a typical insecure teen, tired of feeling so weak decides he may as well, if he is going to die young he may as well improve his odds of taking as many bad guys with him as possible, and look ripped while doing so. Little did he know the impact raging testosterone would have on his magic.


** I don't think steriouds do anything for your muscles unless you actually work out. I could see Dudley doing it not knowing the damage he could cause Harry by giving him access to it, though.

*** This is true; however, I am coming at it from the angle of Harry realizing he needs to put in the effort(Room of Requirement Gym anyone), and unintentionally engaging his “accidental magic” in some way that the steroids stimulate muscle AND magical growth...it's a silly idea, but I am hoping some meathead fan gets an idea. If I had an ounce of talent, I'd do it myself.
