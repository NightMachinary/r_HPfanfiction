Looking for a good Harry Potter romance crossover fic. Preferably finished. No M/M


** linkffn(11027086)

Steelbadger is the master of LOTR crossovers and Harry feels very in character in this story after being dropped into another universe (OP, introspective, compelled to help others). The romance is with Eowyn and though it feels a bit flat at times, it's still decent. Basically adventure with a steady dose of romance.

Your request is a bit tough since most crossovers feature either no pairing or slash. I'd definitely like to see more in this category. It's been mentioned in previous threads that one reason for the scarcity is the lack of leading female characters in other fandoms, which may or may not be valid.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  Some stories start in the most average ways, and this was no exception. How would things change if a certain Devil shared a bench with a certain green-eyed wizard after a hard day of school? Rated M for safety and mature content in second part.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

  Just as he finishes one war to save his world, Harry is literally pulled into another. The trials of living in Zuellni aren't as bad as back in England, but the Contaminoid threat will rear its ugly head. Harry has to fight to protect what he holds dear, but that is nothing new. A certain silver-haired manipulator just has to be put in his place first.

** linkffn(By Courage and Love by najex)

linkffn(7163269) 4-parts story, quite good, but with ghastly, and i mean HORRIBLE, grammar. If you can stomach that, its enjoyable. Bit on the angsty side in some parts tho.
