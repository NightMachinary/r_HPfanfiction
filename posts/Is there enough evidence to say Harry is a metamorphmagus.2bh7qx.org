I don't particularly like fics where Harry suddenly get's a magic block removed that reveals that he has superpowers, but there is significant evidence to support a latent/weak metamorph ability.

The 'Potter' hair: After Petunia tries to cut his Harry's hair against his wishes, it grows back overnight. This may be accidental magic.

No outward signs of malnourishment: Although it is clear from canon that Harry was neglected, if not outright abused, Madam Pomphrey does not notice, even after being in the Hospital Wing a few times every year. The whole school should have noticed at the second task. I think this is because Harry unconsciously maintains a more healthy appearance.

As to why he is still a short, scrawny boy? Since this is a latent ability, Harry has never tried to enforce his ideal body, but his desire to avoid attention leads to him covering up malnutrition and maybe even signs of abuse.

I think JKR messed up on this one. She probably hadn't properly defined Tonks when she wrote about that, so she didn't see the similarities. It's just a random example of accidental magic, just like the shrinking jumper.

#+begin_quote
  Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old jumper of Dudley's (brown with orange bobbles). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a glove puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry.

And I suspect the fans are reading HP more carefully than JKR wrote it. Remember [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mark_Evans][Mark Evans]]?

At that time, Harry had 3.5 years of proper nourishment behind him.

*** There are plenty of short and scrawny boys who eat plenty. I think that it's more the moment that JKR understood that the first book (which was a self-contained story) could go on in a series she started to envision, she decided to scale down the whole "poor orphan with evil stepmother" aspect and keep it more of a fully-rounded storyline... meaning that though he may have been neglected and verbally abused, he probably wasn't starving or beaten.

The fact that he tries to protect the Dursley's at the end shows that Petunia probably (despite herself) couldn't help but care a little that he was Lily's boy.

... and anyways, we're talking 80s-90s, not 50s-60s. Much harder to get away with abuse, especially in suburbia.

Not really, its not until around 2000 - 2002 that child abuse became a more notable issue, and that was only because of the public/media outcry over the murder of Victoria Climbie.

***** Even if you are completely right (and you're not, child abuse started becoming an issue in the 50s, when beating children stopped being seen as the normal educational way due to behavioral psychology becoming a thing in the 20^{th} century), there is still Arabella Figg keeping watch, and if it was extreme it was her job to step in.

Unless of course you subscribe to the notion that Dumbledore wanted Harry as abused as possible. I don't.

****** Just...no. Corporal punishment in schools was made illegal around 1987-8 in the UK, and even then it continued in private schools until well into the 90s. The debate of whether you should be able to hit your /own/ child is still on-going today. However, excessive physical violence has always be frown upon if that's what you mean? as well as the amount of hours and ages of work expected by children in 50s-60s but then you could go back to 1800's for that.

Abuse of children by family members wasn't considered a thing outside the working classes (and largely isnt now), it was the creation of charities such as children in need and then childline in mid 80s that brought the idea to of child abuse into the light. And that was mostly promoted as a 'stranger danger' and child poverty warnings until late 80s - 90s when they realized abuse was more likely to happen in families, and then it was still framed as a working class problem.

I don't think Harry was abused as people seem to /want/ him to be, by todays standards he would be seen as a low-mild case of neglect. Had social services been involved back then the most they would have done is suggest Harry have his own room, and planned a visit in the future (if they even did a home visit). But I honestly think noone would have done anything even if a complaint was made because social services in the UK, particularly in London, and especially for boys, was a complete shambles.

Tldr; abuse in middle class families gets a pass.

** As far as I remember, Harry being unusually short or skinny later in life isn't canon. By 17, he was as tall as his father, who was a tall man. Ron, the usual point of comparison, is merely said to be unusually tall early on. Also, the movie actors' attributes are often mistaken for canon here, I think.

Scars of abuse are another fanon thing, not canon; though it is clear that people who casually attempt to hit children with frying pans (which is canon) are abusive beyond merely the psychological, there was never anything that should have left evidence beyond his first year size.

If being a metamorphamagus is genetic, having Black ancestors would be good support for him having something like that ability. But that seems to be about it.

I think there is no proof, per se, but there is strong support for logical AU extensions of canon facts.

**** I don't have the reference in front of me, but as I recall he ducked and wasn't shocked that she tried. Which says something, in my view. Normal people don't do that sort of thing. JKR backed off fast on the evil aunt character, but her earlier views still were clear. Petunia was physically abusive in a very casual, every-day way.

** short answer: no

Regrowing your hair is considered a normal act of accidental magic and not all the same as Tonk's entire shapeshifting. Remus for instance describes Teddy's abilities as

#+begin_quote
  It looked black when he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blonde by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing colour the day that she was born."
#+end_quote

This is clearly on a whole other level. Being a metamorphmagus is a really big deal and there's no way he couldn't figure it out immediately.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry's abuse was a lot more psychological than physical. The reason he showed no sign (other than being a really small first year) was that he doesn't have scars.

The only outward sign was him being malnourished at first, but as the books moved on the food in Hogwarts changed that and he ended up being rather tall.

Also: Daniel Radcliffe does not accurately portray what Harry Potter is said to look like in the books. So, don't use the movies as a reference point.

** I rather think that growing his hair back is just a bit of accidental magic. It's no more evidence that he's a metamorphagus than blowing up Aunt Marge or lighting his wand without touching it is evidence that he can do wandless magic.

That said, I really like stories that come up with a /plausible/ way for Harry to gain these talents.

JKR wanted a character who lived in an abusive home, not one who had suffered any damage as the result of abuse. No malnourishment, no personality problems, no scars or poorly healed broken bones, no flinching when people raise their voices, just a home that's kind of a drag in a way that people can't point to as Harry being petulant.
