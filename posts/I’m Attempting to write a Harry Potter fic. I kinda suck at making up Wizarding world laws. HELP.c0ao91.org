I'm still in the rough draft stage, the main character is a half blood (mother Muggleborn father pureblood). The character wants to get involved in law, so from an early age was reading some of the older and ignored laws.


** You probably want to start by thinking of the direction you want the story to go, plot points you want to have happen, and what your version of the HP universe is like.

If you want your story to go in a direction of tearing down pureblood prejudices that are enforced by legal systems then you can focus on those laws. If you want to go in a direction of handling creature laws you go that way.

While having some laws in for world building is important, you dont want or need to add a bunch that arent going to be relevant to your plot. Everything the main character and, by extension the reader, learns should have a purpose. The spells Harry learns in canon are either used later in the case of most charms, jinxes, curses, and hexes, or serve to highlight the difference in power and abilities between turning a hedgehog into a pincushion and fighting the way Dumbledore and Voldemort do in the ministry fight. The same should follow for most of the laws you introduce.

Finally, the world you are building colors the laws you want. Is this pure canon? Make up laws that explain the apparent incompetence of the Ministry. Are you bashing the ministry? Make up laws that highlight your reasons for the ministry's incompetence. Are you taking the pureblood/Victorian nobility equivalence route? Make up laws dealing with things like inheritance and marriage contracts.

All of these are important things to think about before writing laws for your fic, and important to have somewhat laid out before asking for help. I could tell you that there was a law created in 1754 that stated it was illegal for a relative of an individual defeated in a duel to challenge the person that defeated their loved one to a duel over the death of their relative, but that law might have nothing to do with your world building and not help at all.

*** The story is going to be Sirius Black has an illegitimate daughter with a Muggleborn. But Is the mother really a Muggleborn if her father”grandpa” was a wizard and her mother”grandma”wasn't?

The law that the daughter is going to be looking at more is the criminal law. She's going to be focusing on some of the old family laws.(example I kind of have it in my head that the mother has a sit down with Arcturus and somehow convinced him to allow his heirs heir to take the family after Sirius) I can only see the second year so far.

+In canon yes, the mother's grandparent's don't come into play until after determining the parent's status.+

Read that wrong. If the grandpa is a wizard and the grandma is a muggle, the mother would be a half-blood (aka Tom Riddle) so it wouldn't make sense to call the mother a Muggleborn in canon.However, you could have her called a Muggleborn if that is how it gets classified by your Wizarding law. In canon the daughter would be a half-blood regardless of the father because the mother would be half-blood.

For you're story, if the daughter is looking to find a way to be Sirius's heir apparent you might look into laws that define the legal status of what is considered "Muggleborn", "Half-Bloods", and "Pure-Bloods" and maybe attack that so she could be in the line of succession.

Why is she attacking criminal law if she wants to be the heir apparent to Sirius who, it sounds like is the heir apparent to Arcturus? Sounds like it should be inheritance laws.

****** True, but then that would generally have nothing to do with the daughter's blood status.

If she's trying to use her blood status to get him out, that would still be inheritance stuff rather than criminal stuff initially so I imagine that should be the main focus. Especially because of the example that OP gave.

The "ye olde pureblood law" is a dead trope. Unless you're writing a parody, it's just going to make people cringe.

** Its alluded to in OotP I believe that Wizarding Law isn't like muggle law, it's much simpler. There's a lot less of lawyers making legal proceedings impossible to follow to justify their own existence.

** just remember, muggles are legally considered objects, pure bloods can get away with anything, and there's some obscure, long forgotten law that permits whatever it is your OC wants to do. /s
