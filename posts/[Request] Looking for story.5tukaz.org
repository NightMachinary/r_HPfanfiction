I looking for a story which was similar to the Emperor by Marquis Black. I think even the author of said story wrote there that it was inspired by stories like the Emperor and Rise of the Wizards. I think Harry got Dementor's kiss in the prologue. It started at the end of the third year.

  Summer before third year Harry has a life changing experience, and a close encounter with a dementor ends with him absorbing the horcrux within him. Features Harry with a backbone.
