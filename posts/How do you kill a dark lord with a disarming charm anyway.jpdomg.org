If the spells don't matter,

and the points are made up.

** The point most people miss is that Harry had basically already won the moment he "returned" to life.

  "You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!"

  Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.

  [...]

  Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart.

Harry's little trip to death and back seems to have rendered him some kind of invulnerable magical superman - not only is Voldemort's magic unable to affect him, but also the Dementors are completely ineffective.

At that point, Harry's victory is a foregone conclusion. Everything after the forest is just going through the motions. Really, the spell Harry used did not matter - the Disarming Charm was not the true cause of Voldemort's defeat. Rather, Harry's death and return to life was the moment of true victory, like the proper Jesus figure he is.

*** Yes, that is an accurate way to describe Harry Potter, canoncally Wizarding Jesus. Which is probably why fan stories where Harry is even one iota less than Jesus after the war are so much more interesting than "Nineteen years later' and the book-that-shall-not-be-named based on the play-that-shall-not-be-named.
