Lori never moved the series to AO3 and every mirror/backup of FictionAlley seems to not have the fics because of the 17+ age prompt. I have a copy of the first book, just not the last two. Thanks!

** Here you go. All three the books:

Please note they are the raw html files, without any styling n such and all the links are dead. You have to manually open each chapter in your browser. Luckily its a reasonably designed site that works fine without any fancy CSS.

Edit: Forgot to add the 3rd book, links updated.

Added here all PoU fics + Penny and Carole's companion fics + other short stories and stuff. I just managed to save them all (I only had the three PoU + A Sirius Affair on my computer) from the Yahoo! group which is being discontinued in a week or so, so thanks for reminding me, I was being careless.
