I just read The Life and Times by Jewels5 and I really loved Lily's character and her perspective in that. I would especially be interested in something that doesn't just focus on how she falls for James in 7th year, but includes her earlier Hogwarts years as well. AU is cool too, I just want something that develops her character well.


** It's unfinished, but I absolutely loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3325624/1/The-Age-of-Inertia][The Age of Inertia]]. The writing style almost makes up for the lack of ending. Wish I had something longer for you.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6019444/1/Before-The-Fawn][Before the Fawn]] is one of my favorite Lily stories. It cycles through multiple years and the writer really showcases how everyone matures through school and the unrest with Voldemort. I just reread it and would definitely recommend, except for the fact that it is unfinished.
