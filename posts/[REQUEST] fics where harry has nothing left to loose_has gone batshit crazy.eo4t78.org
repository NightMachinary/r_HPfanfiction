Obviously, since he got nothing left to loose, there is no shipping/pairing. Maybe he discovers some bizarre self-sacrificial magic that kills Voldemort and all his horocruxes in one go, idk.


** May I put forwards the aptly-named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8662532/1/Nothing-to-Lose][Nothing To Lose]] in which circumstances combine after the Tri-Wizard to make Harry believe that Ron and Hermione have been killed, causing him to go on a self-destructive no-holds-barred rampage of vengeance.

Quite a bit of the story is the Wizengamot trying to find out just what happened to cause their Hero^{TM} to become a merciless killer...

It's complete and good, Harry went insane from wearing the horcrux in my memories but no self sacrificial magic.

** Do you wanna hear another joke, Dumbledorray?

​

No, I think we all had enough of your jokes, Mister Potter.

​

What do you get when you cross an abused orphan with a society that treats him like trash?! You get what you fucking deserve!

​

After surprising Dumbles with a Killing Curse, Harry Apparates in the middle of some UN meeting or such and completely destroys the Statute of Secrecy by killing everyone inside with impressive displays of Magic.
