A horcrux can be very insidious. That said, it's pretty limited - they can mentally influence nearby, and cause local physical effects like getting heavier or hot. Ultimately, a well prepared witch or wizard is much more dangerous. And if you can defend against those effects - it's essentially a locked up and defenseless piece of Voldemort's soul.

Surely it can be useful for something - perhaps you can attack Voldemort though it, or find out his secrets, or maybe even some obscure (probably dark) potion needs a piece of human soul.

** The most useful usage I can think of:

1. Revive a horcrux (the way diary Tom wanted to do)
2. Use a mixture of Obliviations, Confundus and Legilimency to alter the revived Voldemort's personality to the extent that he feels deep remorse for his actions
3. Ask him to remove the horcrux from Harry
4. Profit
5. (Optional) Give Hogwarts the best and most interesting headmaster it probably ever had.

I suppose you could do this to the original Voldemort too, but I imagine there is a short window immediately after revival where the horcrux is extremely disoriented and perhaps even in pain. That window can be used to restrain him.

**** “Harry, wake up! I think we've been found!”

The harsh whisper brought Harry to immediate alertness. This could be bad. With just the two of them, and both inside, they would be hard-pressed to defend themselves from anyone who'd managed to find their tent.

“I'm awake, Hermione. How many of them are there, and did you see where they are?”

“I don't know, Harry. But there's a package sitting just outside the tent that wasn't there last night. It's addressed to you.”

Harry moved to the tent flap and cautiously opened it just enough to see the package. “Oh, I know what this is. I ordered this stuff a couple of weeks ago.”

“WHAT?” Harry winced, knowing that Hermione was about to rant at him. “Harry, we're in a tent in the middle of the Forest of Dean. We're supposed to be hiding from everyone. How can we do that IF YOU DISABLE THE ANTI-OWL WARDS?”

“I didn't. I wouldn't know HOW to disable the owl wards, so I made arrangements for it to be delivered another way.”

“Another way, Harry? What other way IS there? You could only have it delivered by a witch or a wizard or a magical creature, and apart from owls, that requires TELLING THEM WHERE WE ARE!”

“Calm down, Hermione. Yes, it was delivered by a magical creature, and no, I didn't have to tell them where we are. They're also quite unobtrusive, so people don't notice them very often. It just takes longer for delivery, because they can't fly.”

Hermione was obviously stressed, but this piqued her curiosity. “What creatures are these, Harry, how do you know they're safe to use, and how did you find out about them?”

“Well, I found out about them back in second year. They're magical snakes. It's safe to use them because, as I said, most people don't notice them, and also because they're snakes, most people can't use them, so they never find out about them. I was told about them once it became known that I could use their services.”

Hermione's mannerisms fell quickly into the set that indicated furious levels of thought.

“Hermione, I knew Owl Order could be tracked or intercepted, but I figured that Parsel Post would be safe enough.”

** Yeah, I always kind of figured that if the horcrux is a direct link to voldy to keep him in this life, there must be /things/ you can do with it.

Harry has one in his head, which basically allowed Voldy to mentally communicate with him and send him visions. So with magic I figure there's a way for groups of wizards to mentally communicate and do something with it. Like...legilimency is possible.

So what about having a large group of them all connect together and start assaulting Voldy through the mental link. They could go on a raid to steal his secrets and burn his mind down.

Cause no matter how strong Voldy is, if you could get like 20-30 wizards and witches to all combine thier power into one, I'm sure they could overwhelm him.

Despite how much Voldemort goes on about having defeated death, Tom's not actually immortal.

He'd defeated /dying/, but not /death/. He can turn into a wraith if he takes fatal damage, but it takes him 10 years to barely get together enough strength to possess a willing host. He can also recorporate...with unique catalysts or lengthy rituals with unique reagents...into another mortal body that's not as good as the one he started with.

It's very unlikely that he can survive dying more than a few more times, and it's questionable how many times he can actually succeed in a ritual to regain a body, so he'd eventually end up stuck as a wraith struggling to possess people as he gets weaker and weaker.

Also two of his horcruxes will straight die on their own of old age, assuming he stopped trying to off Harry. Why even go to the trouble of making the theoretical maximum number of horcruxes if you're going to pick two of them such that they'll fail on their own?

I just...there are so many bad decisions here for a magic user that's supposedly trying to make himself immortal.

It's like... The difference between making a horcrux out of a skeleton and a living person. The destruction of a living person is death and absence of soul in the Harry Potter world, and because a horcrux is destroyed when its container is irreparably damaged, I imagine that would happen on death of the host regardless.

** This happens in linkffn(magical me) which was pretty good for the first 80%,then it suddenly gets some very weird religious parts and I decided I didn't want to ruin my experience of a discontinued novel by sitting through the author's rambling for another 2 chapters.

Read until the main character starts asking for a priest at St Mungos and you'll have finished all the good parts.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

** Wouldn't it be possible to use the horcrux in a (dark) ritual? No pesky morals that'd get in the way because you already have a soul before you that you want to destroy anyway, may as well get some benefit out of doing so.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel]], by Jeconais brings up the possibility of using the soul piece in a horcrux. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764732/1/Saturday-Potter][Saturday Potter]], by meteoricshipyards, uses it. I've also read a few stories that used one horcrux to find others.

** There is one fic where Harry and Hermione intend to destroy the Locket!Horcrux but they create a new Tom Riddle instead. I can't quite remember the title though. They do use a lot of his knowledge about Tom Riddle's inner circle to infiltrate the Death Eaters and attack Voldemort.

** I think that's canon. Wasn't JK saying in an interview that Umbridge became more powerful and her Patronus could keep all Dementors at bay while she wore the locket? I think she was implying that the horcruxes corrupt those who are nearby but also enhance or weaken the powers of those who are perceived as friends or enemies respectively by it.
