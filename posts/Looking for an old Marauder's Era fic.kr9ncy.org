:END:
I have the strongest memory of reading something on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] more than 10 years ago, probably closer to 15. The parts I remember were:

- Lily and Remus are prefects together. So that she doesn't realize he's a werewolf, James polyjuices himself to be Remus when the full moon overlaps with the nights they have to patrol.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?
