I'm a new fanfic writer and I'm curious as to where your prefer to read fanfiction: ff.net or AO3?

Tbh I'm completely baffled as to how AO3 works. I seems completely counter intuitive. It may just be because I've had three beers tonight, but I've been posting on fanfiction.net for the past few weeks, and it seems to make much more sense.

So, where do you get your fanfiction fix?

*Edit:* thank you all for responding! I think the general impression I'm getting is to just post it to both.


** AO3. The tagging system makes searching for new fics better, and it's much faster to download a fic on it. That said, the selection on ffn is much better, so I follow both.

** I read almost exclusively on AO3. FFN drove me away years ago when they booted out the NC-17 fics; in addition, I've found them to be massively unfriendly to read on my tablet. The lack of tagging is another big dealbreaker; I'm only interested in specific types of fics + characters, and FFN's very limited ability to set main characters often excludes major players and isn't universally used. Neither is AO3's, but AO3 authors seem to be a bit more consistent. Plus, I will not read Major Character Death, which is one of AO3's Warning tags.

I'll only go to FFN if I have a rec from someone I trust of a specific fic and I'm unable to find it anywhere else; I'll spend a good hour or two searching for it elsewhere before reading on FFN.

** I'm shocked at the FFN readership here. Since The Purge I haven't even looked back. The "kudos" system on AO3 helps me feel comfortable supporting authors without leaving a lame review. The filtering system is fabulous. It is large. The original TOS is worth applauding. [[http://olderthannetfic.tumblr.com/post/147307380999/ao3-is-for-all-kinds-of-fanfic][On the writing of ToS]] the work of OTW as an archive and support site for fandom sites that can no longer support themselves is incredible. The legal work they do on copyright is great. I read nothing but AO3 with some occasional livejournal or Tumblr drabble mixed in.

ETA: and that AO3 has a download link at the top of every story so I can read them on iBooks on my iPad no issue basically changed the way I consume fic, along with the fic bot here. I now download any story that seems interesting and then read it on my device - I never read on the website, desktop or mobile.

** FFN is better for me.

I want to filter quickly (and zealously), and then I want to skim. Ao3 gives a slow way to filter (I have to type in a tag and remember whether it's Quirrel or Quirrell and so forth). Its filtering is permissive because authors tend to put tons of tags on their fics. And I can't skim because there are fifty tags on each story as well as the summary blurb, so each story takes up a half page of text.

To take a random example, let's say I'm looking for something to scratch a Neville / Dean itch. On ffn, I select them as characters, hit the 'pairing' button if I'm okay with skipping anything more than a couple years old, and I've got a bunch of fics with them as the primary or secondary pairing. On ao3, I need to wade through a ton of fics that authors tagged Neville / Dean but only have them as a minor pairing mentioned offhand.

** Depends.

As an author I chose AO3 because I almost exclusively write smut, and FF.net doesn't allow sexual content (or something, it was like a year ago when I +was+ /began/ writing and they're really lax with some smut fics and really strict on others for no apparent reason).

As a reader, I like both for different reasons. I like the selection on AO3 more, and the interface for filtering on AO3 is more to my liking. That said, if I'm reading on my phone at night and don't want to be blinded by a crazy bright screen, I use that time to knock out FF.net fics because it allows you to choose between a white and black background.

*** FF.net doesn't allow sexual content? I have a few fics on my giant fic list that have /very/ graphic sex scenes. Two of them are entirely dedicated to them, in fact.

Anyways, I prefer ff.net. It is significantly easier to read on both desktop and mobile. It's also easier to search fics despite the fact I usually look for my next read on reddit.

**** There are a lot of graphic sexual fics on FF.net, as you said. But when I was choosing which site to write on, there was some sort of warning against blatant sexual content and I feared for my future fics getting reported and removed. Just because they're there doesn't mean they're allowed. I did some digging since you got me thinking, and I was able to find where I learned about it in their [[http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][guidelines]]:

#+begin_quote
  Please note FanFiction does not accept explicit content, Fiction Rating: MA, and the rating is only presented for reference.
#+end_quote

So under their definitions of their ratings system, it explains that a Mature rating is "...with non-explicit suggestive adult themes ... Fiction M can contain adult language, themes and suggestions. *Detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature is considered Fiction MA*."

Then, under the Fiction MA description it elaborates further,

#+begin_quote
  Content is only suitable for mature adults. May contain explicit language and adult themes.
#+end_quote

I wanted more clarification back then as well, to make sure I wasn't going crazy and they actually were against descriptive sex scenes, and a few forums and message boards confirmed that they basically function through a trust system with writers and readers to report things that break their guidelines. So you can put up a fic with explicit sexual content on the site but if it gets reported, you're done.

** For HP fanfic, FF.net usually. Unless I'm looking for a very particular kind of fic. Like a Dystopia AU, or something along those lines. Then, AO3 can be better, because if people have been using the tagging system correctly, when I search by that tag, I'll get all Dystopia AU HP fics. While if I were to search for that same thing on FF, I might not find all of them, or none at all, because people don't write it's a Dystopia AU in their summary, just that it's an AU.

** AO3 forever. It's prettier and I can see what a story includes from the tags instead of the author awkwardly having to put it in the summary. It's also far better for the other fandoms I read for (especially homestuck). Very easy to find a story I want to read, or go back and find a story I forgot about. Not to say I won't read from ff.net if I see a fic linked there, but AO3 is where I go to browse. Oh, and being able to view the full story at once is nice too.

Also, for publishing, AO3 seems easier too in that you just paste the text in and that's the chapter instead of ff.net's weird documents that you select, and to edit, you have to go change the document, THEN go and re select it for the chapter? Am I missing something? And it deletes drafts, why? The whole system confuses me.

** Like many other people on this subreddit i prefer FF.net for mobile reading, especially since you can easily use their app offline. On the other hand if you have the library app overdrive you can download AO3 fics, it's just ends up not as organized, especially if you have a large portion of books already downloaded.

I'd also like to point out that the type of fics seen on both sites are very different. AO3 can have more dark, smutty, angsty fics that have a more well written/mature vibe. On FF.net you can find absolutely anything and the interface allows for more narrow searches as well as browsing options that make it easier to find fics to read in bulk. (e.g Sifting through an authors favorite list.)

Since you are just starting out, i would suggest finding some recommended fics and then go from there. Finding a community on FF.net that you're interested in will go a long way to deciding what you like and i guarantee you will come across a recommended AO3 fic, or you could venture there on your own.

In conclusion I would suggest using both once you figure out what type of fic you are looking for.

It was back in high school. Near the end of freshmen year. I knew fanfiction existed--there had been an article about it in a Movie Magic magazine a while back.

So I just googled fanfiction and FF.net was the first link.

Harry Potter wasn't even my first archive. It was Bridge to Terabithia. The first fic I clicked on was "Stars Over Terabithia." I never looked back.

Ao3 is easier on the eyes, and their formatting and ways to publish and edit is so much easier and quicker. I love the tags, and multiple relationships and characters you can put. And hey! You can actually respond to guest comments, and delete any comment that you don't like (Trolls, etc)!

FFN: Private Messages, better review/statistic system. Their formatting sucks sometimes though. The dividers aren't as good as Ao3's. Chapters go bold without meaning to, and you have to change it. However, you can't reply to guest reviews, and you can't delete trollish account reviews -- you can report them, but it doesn't do so much.

I suppose I like both. Both have pros and cons. I've only been on Ao3 for a year maybe, and FFN for the past decade.
