A dark harry, who acts like Voldemort, collecting followers and using them. However, no slash with voldemort/riddle/snape. Nothing cartoonishly evil, but don't mind grisly elements. Completed fics/regularly updated.

Similar fictions:

1. Harry potter and the prince of slytherin
2. Hadrian potter and the daughters of chronos
3. The sum of their parts

Thanks!


** "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" might fit.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** *Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942), is a Starwars crossover after Year 5. It contains tons of sex and violence in the Darth Marrs fashion, but is nevertheless an entertaining read for me. This Harry was powerful, dark, and smart, however, Voldemort also had a few tricks up his sleeve.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

***** I mean it's taking a bit to get into it though, if you want a good sg1 crossover, check out 'gods eye' by todeswind, it's a dresden files fic, which I recommend, and the author might actually be original author Jim butcher using it as a stress relief
