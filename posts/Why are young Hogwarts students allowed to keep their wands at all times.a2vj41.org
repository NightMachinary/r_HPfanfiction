Just imagine for a second that your handing an 11 year old a knife, a gun, and a lighter. Sure they may not know how to use it yet and you're fairly certain you can fix any injury/damage they may cause, but would you really risk it?

In most countries we don't let people drive a car alone by themselves until 16-18 unless it's special circumstances.

Is it crazy to think that maybe for the first three years of Hogwarts that all wand use would have to be supervised and then take away their wands till the next day?


** So they don't get killed by muggles. Just raising their wand will call the knight bus, instant adult wizards with an escape route. Muggles are dangerous, and the law is the Reasonable restriction of underage magic, not the complete ban of it. So you could reasonably use magic to defend yourself, work a part-time job, apprentice under a specialist, or practice your spells between classes so you actually get better at them.

*** Also, theoretically you wouldn't know how to do anything really dangerous with it.

Note that's mostly theoretically. And the books seem to have a certain illogicality to wizardry (10 pits for defeating a troll and saving a classmate!)

*********** Fight? Who needs to learn to fight when taking on the worst dark wizard since Grindelwald? No, you merely need love, my boy, despite the fact you've never really experienced it in your life. You just need to have /love/ and you'll somehow defeat a twisted and corrupt monster who was studying magic for decades before you were even born. And only died because of your mother.

I'm sure you'll be fine.

** We frequently see students get told to practice spells for homework, so requiring all wand use be supervised would probably be a logistical headache. Plus, in the wizarding world all adults effectively walk around with a lethal weapon at all times. In comparison, a bunch of preteens who may or may not be able to do more than shoot sparks doesn't really seem so dangerous.

** At that age, we got knives/daggers to carry as boy scouts. And in Switzerland, in the 90s, you could join a youth marksmanship course as a 15-year-old and get a fully functional assault rifle ("you're not allowed to flip this latch here to switch it from semi-automatic to fully automatic, got it?" "Yes!" "Very good. Now, let's teach you lot how to hit man-sized targets at 300 metres!") to keep at home over the summer. (It was changed since then, so you don't get to take the rifle home with you anymore.)

So, yes, I can easily see kids keeping their wands at all times, weapons or not.

** Idk, consider the kind of magic they can do at that age. And muggle kids do use cardboard cutters at that age. They usually don't have any use for lighters so young, but if they smoke or are in some campsite, they may also have lighters.

The gun, I think, it's not an appropriate analogy, as they don't learn how to effectively kill until they are older (and, let's face it, you can potentially kill someone with a cardboard cutter). The first lethal spell they learn seems to be the cutting hex, which Harry uses in his fourth year and we don't know if it's useful on flesh, whether it cuts deep anyway and it's analogous to a cardboard cutter anyway.

The mild jinxes they use on each other to fight can teach them to respect the more powerful magic they'll learn years later... although the lack of appropriate punishment for students hexing each other is worrisome.

** No, I don't think it's a crazy idea at all, but then again i'm not a wizard. It makes sense to try and limit magical accidents around preteens and cut down on magical brawls between students, by not having them /carry/ those swiss-army-knives-of-doom around all the time.

If you see this from the perspective of a native english wizard, the cultural implications are potientially pretty big. Wands are the most central and iconic symbol, that you are a /wizard/ who does /magic/. If you aren't carrying your wand, you can't do magic, and thus you are just as defenseless as a random muggle. I imagine that many grown magic users would feel /terribly vulnerable/ if physically separated from their wands, and would see it as a massive personal affront to be disarmed against their will.

** Just like fantasy writers don't often have a good handle on numbers (check out tolkien's measurements of how big fortifications were, etc) they don't have a great handle on age a lot of the time either. All the ASOIAF characters are supposed to be teens, the grizzled / physically destroyed old veterans of the last war like Robert Baratheon are in their thirties. Same with the HP franchise, a lot of it works better in your head if everyone's older. This is also a function of the kind of stories JKR was referencing, which were stories about British public schools in the 19th and 18th centuries in which boys in their early teens actually were given what people in the 21st century would regard as an adult level of responsibility.

** Wands aren't weapons, they're basic livelihood tools. Like wearing shoes to help you run and walk better. They just enhance the natural capability of the person's body; magic is innate, it isn't a thing they HAVE, it's WHAT THEY ARE. Trying to take that away would be like trying to cut out an organ. Taking away a wand however, would be like taking away shoes because they kick people with them sometimes. It isn't the same as a car because we can't naturally move 100 miles an hour without them.
