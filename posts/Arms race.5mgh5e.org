The Wizarding world seems content with what they learn at hogwarts. Few seem to continue on to higher education. I'm looking for fics with the magical equivalent of an arms race. Where everyone is obsessed with learning as much as possible and out classing each other based on skill and magical powers instead of blood. Purebloods would have a reason to be stuck up since they would have more years to learn magic than their muggleborn peers.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.
