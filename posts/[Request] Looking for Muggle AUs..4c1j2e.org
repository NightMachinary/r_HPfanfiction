Preferably complete, long and not next gen. Even better if it's marauders era and/or remus/sirius


** "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived". Instead of magic, they are going to a school for spies, agents, and commandos - James Bond style, with super-science. Starts before year 1, currently right before year 7, two updates per week.

** linkao3(text talks) is Sirius/Remus and they're muggles! Very well characterized muggles. :-) and the rest of the marauders and others from their time make an appearance too!

  Sirius is in boarding school, Remus is in hospital, and they don't know each other until Sirius texts the wrong number.
