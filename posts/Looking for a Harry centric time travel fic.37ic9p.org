I've been trying to find this fic where Harry is sent into a different dimension to take over another version of himself that never lost his family, but who was evil and twisted before getting taken over, aka completely cold to his family/secretly wants to hurt/kill them. They're all very reluctant to trust him after his attitude change, especially his father, but they end up trusting him after a while. I cant remember the pairing, but it might be Daphne, who is one of his sisters friends, and seemingly emotionless i think

He has two younger sisters, his mom/dad, and what sends him back is some sort of deity.

If anyone could help me out, I'd appreciate it


** I think you're probably referring to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806627/1/Sacrificial-Second-Chance][Sacrificial Second Chance]] but I don't think it's Harry/Daphne. It's one of the many many reinterpretations of SilverAegis' Harry Potter and the New Life.

Pretty sure it's abandoned but there's some rewrites dotted about like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11237397/1/][The Next Great Adventure]] which is in process and does plan to feature Daphne in the multi pairing, apparently.

Or maybe I'm wrong. Not sure, neither is exactly what you requested.
