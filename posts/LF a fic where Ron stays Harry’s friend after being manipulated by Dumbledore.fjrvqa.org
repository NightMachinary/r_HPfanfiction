One of the common themes in fics with Dumbledore and Weasley bashing is that Dumbledore deliberately set Ron up to be Harry's friend so he can be in Gryffindor, can be dragged into dangerous convenient situations, make Dumbledore seem good, etc etc. Most of the time Ron either knows about it and was never really Harry's friend, or turns against him after finding out. But are there any where Ron didn't know he was being manipulated by Dumbledore and when he finds out he stays completely on Harry's side? And then goes against Dumbledore?

Nope, because when both he and Hermione are set up, he's usually forced into the bad guy role while Hermione is seen as 'misguided', usually to force Harmony to 'work'. Hermione can't be held accountable for her actions, you see. /s
