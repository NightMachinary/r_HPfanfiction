I'd go with Muggle repelling charms. It's a wide area mind-altering charm. That can definitely be modified for other purposes.

** Potions. Besides the ubiquitous and unimaginative use of love potions in certain fics-that-shall-not-be-named I know there are a few fics that have tested the waters here but not many. I distinctly remember reading a fic where a fast-acting sleeping potion was loaded into paintball pellets. That only scratches the surface though. What about using volatile potions like so for explosive rounds, or simply use them as grenades capable of delivering a variety of effects. What about using potions to vastly enhance the user's own combat capabilities. Then there's the more subtle uses traditionally associated with potions. While plenty of fics feature manipulative Albus or Molly using potions behind the scenes as a bad plot device, not many fics feature the protagonists using potions like this (besides polyjuice and sometimes veritaserum) to achieve their ends.

** Transfiguration in general. The restrictions on it are ill-defined and generally unknown, aside from the food thing, so it seems like a license to mass produce almost anything you can think of, thanks to the duplicating spell and all that. It's supposed to be difficult to become very good at it (not sure if canon or misremembered fanon, actually, on if it's meant to be more difficult than, say, potions), but once you get there... aren't you basically living in a different world to other magic users? Your food/water worries are nonexistent, as you can duplicate any food you currently have and conjure water. Turning stuff into other stuff en-mass is basically a plot-breaking power, tbh, and since Potterverse magic isn't tiring, you can totally do that once you know how, so long as your stick-waving arm doesn't get cramps. If you run out of stuff to transfigure into things you need/want, duplicate some more crap and use it as raw materials. Restricting this kind of magic is quite difficult, too, as unless one imposes some very airtight physics on the whole thing, one ends up with vague directives that bring more questions than they answer. A common one I've seen is that objects of value cannot be transfigured... but what constitutes 'value'? Does this make McGonagall's desk-to-pig transfiguration not legit, since pigs are actually worth a decent amount, even in modern society? Would the pig ever revert into a desk, and if not, could I sell it? What happens if I try to make desk-pig bacon rashers, and does that break the 'no non-food-to-food rule'? You see the problem, I'm sure.

TL;DR: A factory is you! (Now with extra bacon, just pick the splinters out)

For the topics the HP series touches on, the feather-light charm has tons of mundane use. Cast it on yourself and you can bounce off the walls, use yourself as a parachute should you fall, run from Hogsmeade to Hogwarts without getting tired. Cast it on your bookbag and you can bring half the library with you to class.

**** This may come from thinking like a D&D munchkin, but I also note that Gamp's Law does not prevent food-to-food transfiguration, and the definitions of 'food' are rather shaky to begin with. In combination with Geminio, one could produce a near-unlimited supply of just about anything that could dubiously be classified as 'food' from a leftover crumb of bread. Yes, the Potterverse is post-scarcity. No, not many fics (if any) acknowledge this fact, because it's usually a sci-fi trope, and not many authors want to think about how just plain /broken/ transfiguration can be. Also, condiments can apparently be conjured directly. I wonder if that includes gold leaf? Some places actually did put that in food seasoning at times, after all...

***** I actually always thought that Gamps law was simply wrong. That it was made to put restrictions on "society". To force wizards to believe that they can't get food quickly. I have no idea why this would be. My explanation was that they must through this have an economy but now that I think about it that sounds really stupid seeing as there are plenty of other things they can have an economy over (If that makes sense).

**** In my headcanon duplicated food maintains the same calorie and nutritional content. So if you take a pie with 1000 calories and duplicate it each pie only has 500 calories. I know nothing in canon suggests this but it would also explain why you can't transfigure a rock into a pig, kill it and have chops. It would still be a useful ability in countries with obesity problems like England and the U.S. You want to eat a rack of ribs for dinner? That's fine, buy a duplicated one that tastes identical to normal but only has 10 calories.

***** We also have little to no indication as to whether transfiguration or conjuration is actually permanent (or at least permanent all the time). If transfiguration and conjurations are temporary this seriously hampers its exploitability. In this case you could conjure food but it would disappear later thus not providing any real nutrition. There is also the question of whether a conjured object is really that object or just a magical construct that has the appearance of that object. Transfiguration would be even more dangerous in this regard if you consider what happens if you transfigure a rock into a steak, eat it, digest it, then the transfiguration wears off and all those nutrients in your body turn back into tiny little rocks. Long story short, temporary transfiguration/conjuration is my headcannon because it closes a bunch of exploits rather elegantly without too much making shit up and satisfies what we do know about the subject if taken from a certain point of view. That is you can make an approximation of food, but its a really bad idea and isn't really food; same goes for valuables since they are only valuable if they stay that way.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** Ive always been curious about the background and potential when it came to Runes. I know its not exactly underused in FF, but it certainly is underused (well almost not at all) in canon, and even in FF its often only covered in a very superficial and surface level fashion.

However I will also throw out another if you think Runes are overused. Summoning/Banishing. Ive read one or two fics that really dive into this, but surprisingly few overall that do.
