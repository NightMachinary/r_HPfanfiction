I'm interested in the Goblin race in general, but the whole good-guy-Goblin thing has been played to death at this point.


** Hogwarts House Divided has the goblins as the bad guys while being sympathetic. It's a great book.

** Jbern has his curse-breaker Harry stories. Rumble in the Jungle - A Harry Potter Adventure and Turn Me Loose - A Harry Potter Adventure. If you haven't read them yet I highly recommend both. I'm on mobile so I can't link, but they should be available at Jbern.fanficauthors.net or fanfiction.net

** There's an amusing one-shot by Seel'vor in A Collection of Harmonious OneShots called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4780695/15/A-Collection-of-Harmonious-OneShots][Open Wide the Gates of Time: Normal Life]] that fits the bill to a degree. It's more of a send-up of time travel fics in general.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/6/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]] has the goblins in an antagonistic role. Although not really in a fighting sense, more conflict between Gringotts and the Wizarding society. Also most of the second half doesn't really include the goblins.

*** God, I forgot about this fic. For its time, it was readable until it jumped the shark in a big way and Harry fled to Japan...
