*** I've read something that someone came up was that they were actually just one kid but had been in an Apparition accident from ancient family wards and the only way to save him was to split him into two people.

** This was a plot point on the second year of Prince of Slytherin, and was continued in to 3rd year.

Obviously it isn't the main thrust of the series - it is just significant enough to be considered a B plot. But the only way you're getting this as the main plot is if it's from the twin's POV, and I've personally never even heard of such a fic (Although I'm sure they exist).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Even before then, there's subtle differences.

George is the more aggressive Quidditch player - there are more mentions of him hitting Bludgers, elbowing other players, and one or two mentions of him "venting" by hitting the Bludger extra hard.

Fred is more of a jokester than George is - usually, Fred is the one who instigates the practical jokes, with George following along. Fred will also crack slightly insensitive jokes, which George is then left to smooth over (see: Ron angsting over Scabbers' supposed death).

George, meanwhile, is more sympathetic - whenever things need to be smoothed over and feelings un-hurt, George is usually the one doing the talking.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
