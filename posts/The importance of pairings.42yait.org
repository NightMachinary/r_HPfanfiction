I wanted to have a discussion about this. I've noticed how important pairings are in the fanfiction universe, HP universe included, and how much of a contrast that is to most regular books. I notice it with myself, too. With normal books, I read them for the story (not much of a romance fan tbh). But in fanfiction, I can only read Harry/Ginny stories. Any others just feel too wrong for me to enjoy them.

But why? Is it because a lot of fanfiction is just wish-fulfillment in story-form? Is it because the story is already told in canon, and we can focus more on the parts that are left out, like an overload of fluff and romance? Are there other reasons? Let's discuss!


** I can't speak for everyone, but here's my reasoning, anyway. I like AUs and the pairings I like /because/ they're impossible in canon. For the AUs, it's fun to explore the what-if's (although I hate it when they go /too/ far out and abandon canon completely, like non-magic AUs - what is the point of that??). Exploring the what-if's is why I read fanfic, after all - when I want straight canon, I cozy up with Chamber of Secrets and a cup of tea. With pairings...it's sort of the same thing, but with a dose of fluff. It's like watching a rom-com. If I've had a long, hard week and I don't want to think too hard and I just want things to turn out fine for once, it's nice to settle down with a 20-chapter epic about two mortal enemies setting aside their differences to have smoochies. Does it make sense? No, but as long as it's reasonably well written and there's a happy ending, I don't care too much.

** I find way more good stories when I don't search by pairing. I feel like they pigeonhole you into a subset of stories that aren't representative of the fandom. I think that more has to do with the fact that stories that are written solely around the pairing, rather than the plot, tend to not be as good.

*** I occasionally search by pairings because that 'pidgeonholing' effect is occasionally useful when scouring a fandom as vast as Harry Potter.

Sure, if you search for Harry/Ginny, or Harry/Hermione, or Harry/Fleur you're going to end up with large numbers of derivative, boring stories; that's just how it goes. However, sometimes there's something interesting to be found by doing a completely off-the-wall search for Harry/Ariana.

** I started out reading only H/G stories, but now I also find other pairings enjoyable, as long as there are no silly bashings going on. My favorites stories now include H/Hr, H/L, H/F, and Harry/Bellatrix Black (not Lestrange!) pairings.

There are situations in which alternative pairings are totally believable and reasonable even for canon characters, and I think it's the point of fanfictions to explore different settings and possibilities.

** Pairings really don't bother me except when it's borders on (or is) pedophilia; the HP/LV pairing comes to mind as an example.

Other than that, if a story is about a pairing then i actually prefer anything but canon so it's more of a fresh story in my mind.

** Many of us read a lot more romance and guilty pleasure type fanfic than we'd ever read of actual novels. I'm not sure why. I actually do read some romance novels, and I definitely wouldn't be able to a read, say, a different version of Venetia by Georgette Heyer where the main characters ended up with other people! The whole point of reading a romance novel is to get very invested in a romantic coupling. So, reading a lot of fics of one pairing is naturally going to make you feel uncomfortable reading the same characters with different people.

Another factor is that, in fandom, various ships have their favored characterizations (or mischaracterizations, as it happens). H/Hr tends to make Harry much more serious, more determined, and less fun and sassy, and is, of course, infamous for bashing Ron. D/H has a nasty habit of making Draco suave and strong, although that does depend on who's "top". SS/HG generally massively tones down how vindictive Snape is. DM/HG often makes Hermione a bit of a damsel in distress. Pairings involving Voldemort have a few different ways to make him a more reasonable romantic choice, including time travel and restoration of sanity, although a lot of them soften him further than just that (the ones that don't are pretty much universally disturbing, although often compelling). I'm not counting the dystopia porn as romance, mind. And that's not even getting into how different ships often have a whole host of different, and differently characterized, minor characters.

That said, as understandable as being tied to a certain pairing is, hardcore shipping makes you miss out on some very excellent fics.

** I find myself trying to stick with canon ships as must as possible, just because I've found the resulting fics to have the characters feel more true to the books. So for 'in universe' fics, I don't want to read things that seem completely out of the possibility or contradict canon.

However, in an Alternate Universe, there /should/ be different pairings. H/G, R/Hr, L/J... it's incredibly unlikely that all the same pairings would happen again. In a world where Harry's a Slytherin, Lily survives, Grindelwald wins, Bellatrix is the Dark Lord, etc... the characters would have grown up differently and situations would have changed.

That being said, I'm interested in pairings as a supplement to the story, rather than being the entire story.

** I'm a big canon shipper as well. I don't like romance novels, but I LOVE romance fanfiction. I think it's because we've already come to know the characters through the story and could finally enjoy a story with romance as the plot. If you like Harry/Ginny, I'd recommend branching out to other canon pairings. There's some good Hermione/Ron stories out there. Also, I love a good Lily/James fic as well.

** I only ever read one pairing and have for the last 16 years. I'm sure there are plenty of good stories in other pairings or non-pairings but I'm simply just not interested in reading those. I know exactly what I want, and even within my pairing I'm very particular about the in character-ness and how quickly or slowly the plot advances. I don't think it's a form of wish fulfillment for me, BUT I am definitely attracted to this same TYPE of pairing in other fandoms so there is definitely a recurring theme. I just happen to have applied that theme to my HP pairing.

** There are some pairings that I feel are just too "wrong" to read. For instance, in the /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ fandom, I absolutely cannot read any Zutara. Even though it's enormously popular as a pairing, and it's not ethically wrong or anything, I still just cannot read it without feeling like I need to take a shower.

Your point about "wish-fulfilment in story form" is actually pretty accurate, I think. Sometimes it's straight-up wish-fulfilment (a la OP!Harry fics), and sometimes it's more a desire on the part of the author to see XYZ situation or scenario happen (to a character).

** I used to be a hardcore H/G shipper. Then, gradually, my tastes shifted to allowing for stories that had no pairings, until I finally started not caring about pairings. If it's written well, I will read it.

For me, I think I was so opposed to anything non H/G in the beginning because it was canon and I was new to fanfiction and AUs as a concept. I liked having some stability, I guess? Some element of the story I knew would be unchanged.

That, or I had a thing for redheads when I was younger.

** Oh, I'm totally here for the pairings. Not that I don't enjoy gen fic, but I doubt I'd be in fandom on the strength of gen alone. I read a fair amount of literary fiction and scifi/fantasy outside my fannish circle, so my appetite for complex storytelling and large canvases is usually satisfied by the work of pro authors. In reading terms, fanfic is the condiment, not the main course. Which is wonderful, and I would miss it if I had to cut it from my fictional diet.

Fic-wise, I prefer character studies and erotic connections of various kinds - not necessarily romance per se, since my favorite characters tend to be dark, damaged, difficult (and sometimes dead) people. (Exhibit A: Snape.) I'm not entirely against romantic narratives, but very few writers can pull them off convincingly for someone like Snape, and I'm not really a fan of fluff. I like emotional intensity, conflict, sarcasm, vivid description, outsider perspectives, loyalty, obsession, moral struggles, hate!sex, wall!sex, devotion, and sometimes tragedy. At other times, redemption arcs. You can get many of these things in plotty epics, too, but for some reason they don't hit the spot for me the way shipfic does.

I'm a multi-shipper, so I read slash, femslash, and het in that order. I love well-written sex scenes, but I love sexual tension even more. Not big on PWPs, though. Sex without context or character development is pretty boring. Also not thrilled by curtain fic.

And isn't all fanfic wish fulfillment? I mean - Slytherin Harry? DAYD Neville? Superpowered anybody? Harems? Ice queen Daphne? Leather pants Draco? Lord Potter-Merlin-Black? Woobie!Snape? Harry the Supreme Smugwump of Constipated Rationality? Harry the Hard-bitten and Ruthless and Politically Savvy Conqueror?

It's all dabbling in fantasy and not something I take seriously - well, except in the sense that I take my enjoyment seriously. I can't give blanket answers to explain why this and not, say, "action" fics, because my inclinations just don't map that neatly or directly from my other interests onto fanfic. But erotic complexity between beloved characters within this capacious, Dickensian magical world is catnip to me.

Romance, love, drama etc. What I don't get is why are they so popular in Harry Potter where the majority of characters are hormonal teenagers. I can't imagine anything more cringy to read.

*** Yeah, I'm not so keen on too much angst either. Thing is, too little angst and the goals of the protagonist are just boring, the reader isn't cheering him on as he tries to 'get the girl', for example.

But too much angst, and it becomes frustrating. I read a fic once that had 4 different pov's: Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron. And you have to read about Harry feeling guilty and constantly wanting to break up with Ginny to keep her safe (please), then you have Ron who's angry at Harry (cue massive internal dialogue, sometimes even in the middle of a conversation) and later he feels just as guilty as Harry (cue the same internal dialogue Harry had just a few chapters back).

Needless to say, I didn't finish reading that. I just got angry instead of immersed.

** When I first started reading fanfic I stuck pretty much exclusively to canon compliant stories including pairings. Nowadays it doesn't need to be canon compliant but I flat out never read any H/Hr stories. It's not that I particularly have any stake in the different ships but I just avoid Harry centric stories and also nearly all H/Hr I try to read massively minimizes my favourite character (Ron). I'll only really read Ron centric stuff now, the pairing in it doesn't really matter to me as long as it's an interesting story with good characterisation.

** I am opposite, for me H/G and especially R/Hr feels just wrong. Its somewhat caused by JKR poor writing of romance part. HHr was natural pairing, main characters usually end up together and its simplest in story flow. But we instead get H/G which isn't developed at all as Ginny so far was minor character until Harry instantly feels into love with her. And as there was lot of foreshadowing of love potions in same book or how Molly used love potion, while not developing actual relationship it looks like Ginny used love potion. And R/Hr is cannon crack pairing, I couldn't imagine how they could date for more than month.

Other than that I could read almost any pairing, some best romances that I read were Hr/RL.

However I filter stories based on pairings unless I get recommendation as they usually indicate type of story that isn't my genre. Like 90% of HP/DM and 80% HG/DM stories are trashy romance without too much of plot going on. For slash stories too many are of type Harry overnight discovers that he is gay that feels forced. I would more believe AD/SS slash.

I read pretty much exclusively AUs, which (if it has a romance portion) will usually have a nonstandard pairing. If I wanted to read canon, I would. I have all the books beside me. Instead I want to read about how things could have been done differently or better, focus on magic theory and all the cool shit you should be able to do but JKR never explored, or any of a 1000 other topics that reside outside of canon.

When I search for new stories, I wish there were more character exclusion options. There are so many slash fics out there, it's quite annoying to search for new stories /without/ looking for specific pairings.
