What a fucking mess. I can't believe I have to type this out on /this subreddit/, of all places - this is probably among the most polite and helpful subs I've been in, and I didn't expect a hidden portion of it to be so ridiculous.

Here is my opinion: /fans of certain controversial ships and other tropes should be criticized/.

I've been seeing a lot of controversy in this sub about certain relationships, which is why I'm using it as the primary example. This isn't the only worrisome trope I'm talking about - you can include rape and torture and other edgy gross shit - but it is also the most relevant to this sub as of now and to talk about every single trope will just take forever.

Now, the Harry Potter series is geared towards children. They also have several attractive adult male characters - Bill Weasley, Sirius, Hagrid, Remus, and some people might perform extraordinary feats of mental gymnastics to romanticize Voldemort and Snape, but whatever. There are also a few attractive adult women, Tonks being the most commonly cited example. That means within the fandom there will be a bunch of prepubescent or pubescent children who have a crush on any of the characters listed or unlisted and a small portion of them will go on to write thinly-veiled wish fulfillment fics pairing the author-insert with any one of these characters.

These children are ignorant, and it's not their fault. They're still children - they haven't gained the experience and insight that comes with age. "If Sirius/Remus/Severus serenaded /me/," they think to themselves, "/I/ would be okay with it." These fics will then gather other teenage readers who enjoy inserting /themselves/ into the place of the main character, being serenaded by some adult character or whatever. That's how these get popular.

Guess what? That doesn't change the fact that these sorts of relationships are /wrong/.

The author has the excuse of being inexperienced and ignorant. A teenage reader also has the same excuses. What do you, an adult reader, have to say for yourself? If you are reading a story that contains a clearly severely unbalanced relationship, written by a teenager whose understanding of relationships is clearly incomplete (or God forbid, an /actual adult writing these things and jerking off to their own masterpiece/) and you feel compelled to /leave a glowing recommendation/, then you are absolutely in the wrong.

If you are one of those adults leaving reviews /begging/ for the return of such relationships, and other disgusting tropes - manipulative and non-consensual relationships, genocide, torture, that sort of stuff - then you are in the wrong. For people like you, others are practically obligated to call you out on it.

'But this is just my opinion!' you might say. 'Everyone has their own opinion!'

Yeah, they do. And this is my opinion: your opinion is disgusting and gross and generally a steaming pile of shit that says a lot about who you are.

When you don't call these people out - the people who advocate for goblin genocide, push for a Hermione-Snape relationship, people who demand Ginny be raped by some Death Eater because 'she deserves it' - they take your silence for assent. And they think they're in good company.

Some of these people are just ignorant. Then you should try to convince them why it's wrong, in a gentle but firm way.

Some of these people are fucking assholes. Then it's your duty to tell them they're fucking assholes.

Like I said. I don't agree with 'blanket hatred' because some people are ignorant. But you get called a pedophile because you're in the 'fucking asshole' category, then boo fucking hoo, I don't give a shit that I hurt your feelings. Maybe there's something more important that you should be focusing on than your hurt feelings, anyway.


** Writing fucked up fanfiction isn't the problem. The problem are the people who enjoy fucked up things and don't realise / acknowledge that this things are problematic. My favourite fanifc has extremely toxic main ship, but it's written in a way that makes it clear that author is aware of that. Having said that I don't see how you can criticise certanin ships or tropes as a whole, since everything can be written in a problematic way.

As a side note: this is the first time I've ever seen anyone describe Hagrid as attractive.

** Now, a lot of stuff shouldn't be allowed because it violates rule 8. Whatever one thinks of the rule, it should be followed (especially since it was created with Admin rules in mind). And of course these relationships are wrong in real life.

But you cannot tell the difference between enjoying a dark type of fiction and what one's ethical boundaries are in real life. I like to play GTA 5. When I play GTA 5, I hijack planes and crash them into the ocean. When I take a plane in real life, I'm so obsessed with safety, I read all the safety manuals, practically take notes during the safety demonstrations, and obey the flight attendants.

I like to read fanfiction where Harry starts killing death eaters off. I don't go around vigilante killing or advocating for that in real life.

Because fiction is different from real life. Yes, some people like to explore dark places through fiction and they enjoy it. But fiction does not mean that you hold the same opinions as what you read. That's just wrong.

*** I should've made my point clearer. What I want to say that I don't care as long as you don't /encourage it/. My own fics feature MCs that murder and torture, but it is made clear that they are a villain due to their own actions. Some fics bend over backwards to make genocidal MCs perfect and incapable of doing wrong. A Mary Sue, essentially.

People can explore dark places all they want. Who or what I criticize are the people who glorify these dark places.

** as much as I agree with all these denunciations of rape/torture/genocide stuff, the strongest opinion contradicting yours is that fiction is, above all, fiction, which means that it doesn't cause, a priori, harm to anyone and allows some people to transfer extreme emotions into fictional stuff so that they get 'rid' of it. If your concern goes to children reading fanfic there are caution ratings, but I agree that it is not enough to avoid that children read gross stuff. You are betting on the ethical side of things here, which does not apply in fanfiction for some people. Here's my advocate-for-the-devil opinion to nuance your post. If you don't like it, I'm sorry. Again, I mostly agree with you, but this argument will be raised and isn't totally wrong either. Truth is never as blatantly obvious as you make it appear here.

Ps: 'you are ignorant, you are wrong': well, that kind of rhetoric never convinced anyone and does nothing but stirring violence and defensive reactions.

While this is one argument, I think the main argument against the OP's position is that, if true, it would completely invalidate some of the greatest works of literature in history.

OP's position is essentially that a fictional work should never depict any morally wrong or morally ambiguous action, and if it does then the author and any reader who enjoys that work of fiction is immoral.

OP's focus is on sexual misconduct but there's no reason in principle why sexual crimes should be unique in this regard, as the OP seems to recognise by reference to genocide etc.

Which means... goodbye any piece of fiction that has ever depicted a character being murdered, or indeed violence of any kind outside of the sporting context. Also no theft shall be permitted in fiction, nor fraud or tax evasion, nor blasphemy, nor making illegal u-turns.

Honestly at this point I'm not sure if OP has anything left to read except for the most innocuous children's literature.

**** I doubt that's what they're arguing lol. They're probably just talking glorification of these things. They have a fic where their character is haunted by demonic killers lol

I think OP is just having a bad day.

** Baffled why you felt the need to make this a new thread rather than post your response within [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jgdv0w/can_we_talk_about_acceptable_language_in_our/][the thread]] it is actually responding to. Perhaps you were concerned that your response within that thread would not gain the visibility you would like it to have. But that kinda makes this feel more like a desire for attention and drama than earnestly wanting to engage in a conversation about the topic.

** I know exactly what post you're referring too, saw it earlier today and couldn't agree more with you, I didnt even know what to think when I saw it. Now I do have to admit that I am guilty of something you described, I first got into fanfiction, particularly Harry potter fanfiction, when I was in my early teens, being the pubescent teenage boy I was I did love the idea of Harry being with an older woman (most commonly Tonks), and supported many fics using that relationship in its most inappropriate form. Thankfully I grew out of that, and avoid any fics that feature similar inappropriate relationships.
