Usually these kinds of Ocs are related to Harry but would be interesting to have one thats related to Sirius or James. This way they can have an impact on the war whether they join voldy (could be a spy) or oppose him. I enjoyed reading that time to put a galleon- cant remember the name and really liked it. And I came across a fic about james twin who joined the DE with Regulus like a year ago.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) has a very different Regulus forming a third side in the war and rescuing people with a lot of porting.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
