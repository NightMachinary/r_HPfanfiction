Hey peeps. I don't really know how to describe this request, but I'm gonna try my best.

Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One]] trilogy by FarrenMaddox? It's terrific, I highly reccommend it.

In book three ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4711743/25/The-Wise-One-Book-Three-Being][link]]), in the Encore (Chapter 25), where after all Harry has experienced, goes to study in America and slowly opens up to three dorm/roommates as they struggle to know/understand who he is and what he has been through.

I really love that. Is there more like that? I'm sorry if that's too vague.

Thanks!
