In the bookshop, Lucius Malfoy slips the diary into Ginny weasley's cauldron. I want to know why he brought the diary in the first place and what he hoped to gain from giving it to her. Did he know that it was Voldemort's hot tux or did he think that it would open the chamber or secrets and get rid of muggleborns? And if he did, why did he decide to implement it at that time? Did he receive some sort of message from Voldemort? I'm curious.


** Personally, I view Lucius giving Ginny the diary as a form of petty revenge against Arthur for the raids the DMLE had been performing during the summer. Partly because he liked the idea of the scandal that would erupt should it be found out that the daughter of someone like Arthur Weasley had a Dark Artifact in her possession; and partly because Lucius was unaware of the diary's true nature, mostly because I find it unimaginable for someone like Voldemort to actually trust anyone with the truth.

*** The canon reason is that Lucius was trying to discredit Arthur so his muggle protection act would fail while getting rid of a dark artifact that he really didn't want to be caught with

*** I think it's a bit odd how Lucius took the diary with him to Diagon alley. If it were for petty revenge, it seems he would have sought to disgrace the weasley family in another manner. Taking the diary with him just to inflict revenge on the weasleys seems out of place. How could he have known that they would have shown up to Diagon alley on that day, even if Lockhart was signing books that day, it might've been a week long occurrence. I don't think all the hogwarts students get their supplies on the same day, even if they all get their letter at the same time.

**** Given the threat of the raids he might have been intending to take a side trip to Knockturn alley after buying Draco's school supplies where one of the less reputable dealers of dark objects would pay nicely to take it off his hands. The encounter with the Weasley family was unexpected and so the plan to plant it on Ginny may have been on the spur of the moment.

** According to Dumbledore (though this is only his assumptions), Lucius didn't know that the Diary was an Horcruxe. In fact, Dumbledore think that even the Death Eaters didn't know about the Horcruxe (he probably gave Bellatrix the Cup by telling her it's an item important for him, and to safekeep it). Since Lucius knew that the Diary could be used to open the Chamber, Voldemort probably told him that it was its main use and to keep it safe until he chose to use it.

Anyways, 11 years after the "death" of his Master and without any hint of his potential return, Lucius thought he could safely use the Diary without feeling his wrath. At that time, Arthur Weasley was trying to sponsor a new law, the "Muggle Protection Act", so he targeted Ginny for several reasons :

- By opening the Chamber of Secrets once again, Lucius could free its monster and "clean" the school of its Mudblood.
- As a school Governor, Lucius could also make use of the attack to remove Dumbledore from its position, and maybe appoint a more . . . like-minded individual as his replacement.
- If Ginny was either caught as the culprit, it could not only hurt Arthur Weasley but also destroy his reputation, taking away any chance for his law to either pass.

** Dumbledore's theory is

#+begin_quote
  ‘And imagine,' Dumbledore went on, ‘what might have happened then ... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns. Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it. Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ...'

  Did he receive some sort of message from Voldemort? I'm curious.
#+end_quote

Hard to imagine Voldemort wanting another copy of himself running around. I've always assumed the diary itself ordered Lucius to give it to a Hogwarts student, perhaps because Harry Potter was attending and it had heard rumours of the confrontation with Quirrell at the end of first year.

  Did he know that it was Voldemort's hot tux or did he think that it would open the chamber or secrets and get rid of muggleborns?
#+end_quote

Apparently.

#+begin_quote
  [Draco] shifted restlessly in his chair and said, ‘Father says to keep my head down and let the heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our Manor last week?'

*** My thinking is that if he received some sort of message from Voldemort then he would have purposefully taken the diary and given it to Ginny, not for petty revenge, but because she was the first hog watts student he saw when he went to Diagon alley and he would want his own son to handle the diary.

*** the way I imagine the dairy horcrux is that after regaining its body it would then merge with the main soul or swap places with the main soul

rowling said Voldemort would have been stronger if diary riddle had succedded.

Maybe he would be stronger in that he would regain a youthful body and he would be more able to use his chrisma again

** Apparently at the end of the second book it explains Malfoy gave the diary to Ginny to frame her for attacking muggleborns. This would hurt Arthur Weasley's muggle protection act which Malfoy didn't want passed. Voldemort must've given the diary to Malfoy some point pre-canon like how he gave the cup to Bellatrix

  because Malfoy never did or said anything to anyone that might make them suspect Ginny was the one opening the Chamber.
#+end_quote

As an "outsider" of the school, Lucius is supposed to be just as clueless as the rest of the population. At best, his postion as a "School Governor" could ensure he has the same information than the teachers.\\
Him having any kind of new information would automatically make him suspect, especially if the "culprit" is the daughter of a man he is known to hate (they just had a fistfight in the middle of Diagon Alley mere months prior after all).

Better let the professionnal do their job and act all surprised when Ginny is finally caught. And it's not like he was really short for time, each new time removing another Muggleborn from the school, and weakening Dumbledore position (he had barely managed to remove him from the school and had not yet found a replacement when Harry destroyed the diary after all).

**** If Malfoy implied to anyone that Ginny Weasley was a suspect then Dumbledore would know easily and he might discover the diary. He wanted to wait till Dumbledore was gone and At least one student was dead, to be more effective.

** I always figured it was like he was trying to get rid of the diary and found it convenient.

But if he knew the diary was the key to unlocking the chamber he may also have hoped that doing this would unlock the chamber and kill the muggle borns?

He didnt first year partly I think because he wasnt at risk of being raided. But also maybe because he wanted to see how Harry turned out. If he was powerful enough to take out the dark lord maybe he could be useful if he alligned with Lucius's own beliefs and Harry could cause the appropriate disruptions ( in Lucius's opinion) on his own. But then he finds out boy who lived against his beliefs so decides to meddle more.

** Based on Dobby's warnings of terrible plots happening at Hogwarts that year, Lucius was very aware that the diary would open the Chamber of Secrets and went as far as discussing it aloud with someone (most likely Narcissa, but possibly a former Death Eater associate such as Nott Sr., who visits the Manor in a "deleted scene" that was never published). Presumably Voldemort shared this information when entrusting it to Lucius in the first place.

Dumbledore might have been correct in assuming Lucius did not know it was a Horcrux, but Voldemort also asks of his followers during the graveyard scene: “but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? ” Which suggests that the inner circle-- Lucius and the Lestranges especially, as guardians of two of them-- might know something of the Horcruxes after all. Even more foolish, then, for Lucius to give it away, but not out of the realm of possibility. He's certainly not the most brilliant strategist in the series.

As for timing, I think it was triggered by the Ministry raids. He's selling other Dark objects earlier that day, it seems clearing out incriminating items was on the immediate agenda. Maybe it was a coincidence that he was in Diagon Alley the same day as the Weasley; perhaps any non-Slytherin student would do and it was a stroke of luck he came across the opportunity to discredit Arthur through his daughter, but I don't think it would be particularly difficult for someone as well-connected as Lucius Malfoy to find out on which day a huge and well-known family was turning up in Diagon Alley. Maybe Arthur mentioned it at work and it somehow worked its way back to him, maybe he even sent Dobby to spy on the Burrow. However it happened, I doubt it was chance, nor that it would have been difficult to orchestrate.
