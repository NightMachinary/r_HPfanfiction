Grown men as animals sleeping with 11 year olds and sleeping in their laps, actually rape potions that are laughed about by main characters, student punishments that's non existent, serious misunderstanding about mental health, etc.

Could just be Harry pointing out the crazy world.


** To be fair, even in the Muggle world we also had serious misunderstanding of mental health back in the nineties so we can't really judge wizards for it either. Peter Pettigrew is also not indicative of the general population as an actual terrorist.

  Points of divergence in the Harry Potter universe. Those moments where someone really ought to have taken a step back and asked, "Wait, what?" An ongoing collection of one-shots. Episode 16: Why I Like You.
