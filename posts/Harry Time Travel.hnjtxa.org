:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I don't remember many details of this fic; but I do know that at some point first year Harry steals the sorting hat. At the end of first year after Dumbledore does his last minute point thing, Harry stands up and asks Prof. M if it's better to do what it is right or what is easy. After she answers he begins listing all the things he did that would cause him to lose points. Ron and Neville also stand up and join him, near the end he pulls out the hat and says (paraphrased) ‚ÄúI believe whoever got caught with the hat will lose 100 points?‚Äù

Please help, this is driving me crazy not knowing üòî

Edit: Now that I think about it, it actually might not be a time travel fic? The details are a little hazy, the only thing I really remember is what I said above.


** This is ringing a lot of bells and I have a feeling it's a time travel fic called His Own Man.

I've run out of time to re-read the story to confirm, cause I really need to get to bed, but I hope that's the one!

**** That had some seriously good bits, and the staff meeting towards the end where they try and piece everything together is brilliant. You don't see that enough in these types of stories. Shame it was abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.
