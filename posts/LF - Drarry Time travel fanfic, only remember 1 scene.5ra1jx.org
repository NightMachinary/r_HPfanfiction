I'm looking for a specific harry/draco story that I have been trying to track down for nearly a year.

It's a time travel story where a harry from post-hogwarts was married to draco, and was sent back to either the Christmas break of his 4th year or summer after fourth year.

Memorable scene -- Harry first reconnects with Draco in the past by getting to Malfoy manner and then when Draco comes downstairs, kisses him because future draco told him he'd been harboring a crush since the dragon task.

Please help!


** Hey, any chance you remember how long this was (don't need exact word count, just if it was a novel or short fic, etc.). Sounds like something I might have read, but I tend to go for longer fics.

*** It was definitely longer, not short story. Full novel length.

I'm not sure if it's completed or not though.

** I have no idea although it sounds like a fic I'd maybe like to read. Did you ask over at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]]?
