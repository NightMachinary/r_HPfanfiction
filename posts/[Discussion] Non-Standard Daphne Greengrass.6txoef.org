Much has been said on this sub about how Daphne Greengrass as we no doubt all know her (you know, the "ice queen of Slytherin", against Voldemort but still maybe a little bigoted, has great shipping potential) is basically a "standard" OC based on a bare name from canon. Now what I'm wondering is... does anyone know of a story that breaks this mold? Or barring this, how /would/ you characterize Daphne, if you were suddenly Obliviated of everything you knew about her fanon self? (For instance, linkffn(Weres Harry?), which, incidentally, is quite a good stories in other regards, Daphne /is/ one of the "good" Slytherins, but she's not an Ice Queen at all --- she's a Quidditch enthusiasts and daughter of a minor Quidditch celebrity, and she ends up befriending Ron.)

** Harry sees this beautiful mysterious Slytherin girl and is so drawn to her he asks her out... only to find out she's the most boring girl in existence who talks about her rock collection the entire time.

** I toyed with the idea, in Nature's Nobility, of taking inspiration from Gossip Girl and having Pansy be based on Blair and Daphne based on Serena.

For those unfamiliar with Gossip Girl, this means:

Pansy: Social climber. Lacks natural charm so has to make up for it by trying twice as hard, planning and scheming and treating popularity as a competition which you win by being ruthless to your rivals. Pretty but not beautiful, always very put-together. Openly disdains those of lower class.

Daphne: Party girl, naturally charming and popular. Lacks airs and graces, and often dresses in a very casual, just-out-of-bed way, but pulls off the look thanks to her beauty. Does not openly disdain lower classes and indeed likes to think of herself as open minded, but in fact lives a life of extreme privilege which she does not fully appreciate.

The two of them are simultaneously best friends and rivals.

** I characterized her as a social butterfly. She's not a queen (because in canon that seems to be Pansy's position), but she's well-respected. She also has the largest network of useful connections out of all the Slytherins because she's friendly to people.

Mainly because I happened to need a Slytherin to fill that sort of role... Ice queen Daphne wouldn't be too useful in my fic

** I like the idea of a Daphne who is friendly but also coy: someone who is good at navigating around back-stabbers and avoids being manipulated by anyone who tries to step on her. One of the few things we know about her from canon is that she is from a wealthy and prominent pureblood family. As a result, I imagine that, somewhat like Fleur, she might seem a bit standoffish at first but then you realize that she would 100% step in to support you if she thought you were a nice person.

"Flower and Serpent" by BrokenWingsHealed is a nice little story that I think subverts the "Ice Queen" trope quite a bit.

  Daphne Greengrass had always been a background figure in Harry's life: someone he didn't know, or ever suspected he would know, that much about. But an unexpected encounter with her one winter's night, and the story she told about herself, turned them into friends. Five years post-DH, EWE, Harry paired w/ Luna.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

**** He's an up and coming fanfiction author who I personally believe could be the next Ruskbyte or Perspicacity. His favoured pairing seems to be Harry/Daphne, and he makes it work. She's basically what you might expect a business tycoon's daughter to be like, but less "spoiled brat" and more "high expectations". I can tell you'll probably have no idea what I mean by that (I'm known in my friend circle for being bad at explaining things to people), so I'd recommend just reading a couple of his stories. Start with this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation]]

and then maybe this: (?)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry]]

and this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12381694/1/Validating-Occurrences-A-Study-in-Emerald]]

You may want to start with the second link, now that I think about it. It's a one-shot so...

Oh, looks like the top reply has already linked it. You should know though, the other two do not have exactly the same characterisation. Uncle Harry was meant to be funny, and he's exaggerated some of the quirks he associates with her in the other stories.

Bitte sehr.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
