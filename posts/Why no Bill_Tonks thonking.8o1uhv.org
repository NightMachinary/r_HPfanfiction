According to the HP Wiki, Tonks is 8 years older than Harry. At the same time, Bill is 10 years older than Harry. Logically speaking, both Charlie/Tonks and Bill/Tonks are viable ships aside from the canon one (because Remus is a fucking irresponsible, cowardly piece of shit in regards to his relationship with Tonks). So why Harry/Tonks, or Charlie/Tonks, but not Bill/Tonks?


** From a pragmatic standpoint, once out of school a LOT of relationships end up getting started with people in the same field of work, often within the same organization. Bill and Charlie would not work, since their jobs were thousands of miles away. When Bill takes a job at Gringotts in Diagon Alley, where Fleur ends up working (I find it hard to believe that is the only reason she went to work there), they end up in a relationship. Tonks works as an auror and with the Order, but the type of work she would be given is probably more in line with the type of work Remus would be given in the Order as well. They were probably assigned to similar jobs, possibly together.

To be more specific about why no Bill/Tonks, its hard to reconcile the personality discrepancies. Everything describing Bill is that he is the cool kid in school, the older brother that everyone likes. In a way, the paragon of Gryffindors "good" characteristics. Tonks is a Hufflepuff, and while she is outgoing, nothing indicates she was the same sort of "popular kid." Despite what YA novels, anime, and some fanfiction may indicate, teenagers don't often date outside of there respective social circles.

One could do a little arm-chair psychology as well: her ability as a metamorphagus is her most remarkable trait, but its something that she was born with. Her ability makes her practically unique, but she would want to be accepted rather than treated as something to be gawked at (she knew immediately why Harry wanted to be a Metamorphagus too). Remember, she got perfect marks for concealment and disguise in her training, she definitely knew how to blend into a crowd. It also doesn't help that Bill was the brother of six siblings, and Tonks was an only child, which creates very different personality types.

Why Remus then? He was the quietest and most introverted of the marauders. But what did he want? To be like everyone else. To not be treated as different because of something he couldn't change. And Charlie is the least canonically characterized Weasley easily, so there is a lot of room to make that work.

Just some thoughts on this.

Hmm. Very good point here. Explains why I can't get any action. ^{^{^{Someonepleasehelpmeimsolonely}}}

Also Charlie never made it past Philosopher's Stone in the movies. Poor Charlie.

**** Thanks.

Don't feel too bad about that. Statistically, only 30-40% of males and 50-60% of females actually have any sort of relationship as teenagers (read into the difference as much as you like...).

You know, when I saw your comment about Charlie, I came up with a hilarious idea that Charlie was the guy from the Dos Equis commercial but with firewhiskey. I even came up with his first commercial:

"He gave his father 'the talk'."

"Dragons are afraid of him."

"He can speak Romanian...in English."

"He once left his wand at home during a duel...to even the odds."

"He is the most interesting man in the world."

(From Charlie) "I don't often drink whiskey, but when I do, I prefer firewhiskey."

I had to discard like thirty lines, this stuff just writes itself.

***** Time for the lightning round:

"His charms were so contagious, Muggles developed a vaccine."

"No less than twenty Romanian folk songs have been written about his hair."

"When his hair gets cut, it grows back overnight."

"When a dragon roars in the woods and no one is around, he hears it."

"He once won a fist fight with no hands."

"He uses dragon blood as cologne." (Hey! I've discovered a fourteenth use for dragon blood!)

"Two countries went to war...to dispute his nationality."

"The Ministry of Magic received the Order of Merlin from HIM."

"Aurors often question him, just because they find him interesting."

He is the most interesting man in the world.

I keep thinking I'll run out of ideas, but it hasn't happened yet.

Ginny /thought/ Molly invited Tonks over because she wanted her to be with Bill. She was wrong. It is revealed at the end of HBP that Molly knew about Tonks' feelings for Remus from the start and encouraged their relationship.

****** I tend to ignore a fic if it's "H/HR" because it usually implies that she's basically Wonder Woman. Even worse if there's a unique pairing, Hermione basically becomes Chuck Testa. "Is that a Harry/Tonks Fic? Nope, Chuck Hermione" Daphne Greengrass is usually the samae. She's the OC with a Canon Name, most of the time.

******* Hermione is the female equivalent to Harry in the story, in that a lot of people (in particular girls and women) imagine themselves as her. Harry is made generic enough in the story so the reader can put themselves in his shoes. Its pretty easy to change his character in fanfiction as a result in order to fit the author's story/wish-fufillment/self-insert/etc.

Hermione by contrast has a much more defined character. If you want to do the same thing with her in fanfiction, you need to make her fairly OC.

As for writers using characters like Daphne or Fleur, you should consider the following: there are more named death eaters in the books than there are named students in the entire House of Slytherin while Harry is at Hogwarts, possibly all the students not in Gryffindor if you disregard the students named outside the books. Doesn't leave you a lot of options for developed female characters does it?

** That reminds me. Not sure if you are looking, but here is a fic that does feature Bill/Tonks as well linkffn(Homecoming by Brennus). Its not the main point of the story, but it does sort of highlight what I can see the problem being in a relationship with a metamorphagus would be.

As a side note, is the nickname for this ship Bonks? Sounds like the name of a drunken clown.

** I write Harry/Tonks, a Harry&Tonks sibling relationship and two Hermione/Tonks one-shots, so I feel like I can answer at least the second half of your question

#+begin_quote
  Remus is a fucking irresponsible, cowardly piece of shit
#+end_quote

I agree

#+begin_quote
  So why Harry/Tonks
#+end_quote

Because Tonks is a unique character in the HP world and Harry is the MC. Besides the obvious shapeshifting, Tonks has a very interesting family background, is the only badass (adult) woman beside Lily we get to know (at least in her OotP characterisation; Hermione is a teenager for most of the series) and considering that Rowling didn't have her dump Lupin after the shit he pulled, it is very easy to write a Harry ship where she is understanding of his shortcomings without turning her OOC.

#+begin_quote
  but not Bill/Tonks
#+end_quote

The Weasleys, at least in my opinion, Bill is a boring character. I mean, he is a grave robber, has a badass earring, used to be head boy and gets wounded during the Hogwarts Raid. Perhaps because I always associated "Curse breaking" with grave robbery, which is both morally disgusting and illegal, but I was never impressed by him. I'd rather write a story about Demelza Robins being Bellatrix daughter than about Bill (or any Weasley for that matter, they are all just uninteresting to me).
