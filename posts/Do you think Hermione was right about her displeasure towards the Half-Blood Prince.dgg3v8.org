I've often wondered this. On one hand, he simply followed different instructions, and followed it to great length otherwise the potion wouldn't have turned as good as expected. Plus, it's not like the original instructions (by Libatius Borage) were Hermione's work either.

However, you look at something like Elixir to Induce Euphoria, where the pretty much the entire potion is heavily altered. He gets credited for the idea of using sprig of peppermint to counterbalance the side-effects, when he wasn't even the one who thought about it.


** If you are talking very specifically about like her reaction to the different approach to Potion making then no. This was clearly information she didn't have access too. So if anything it would be reasonable to read through it and get a new perspective. With her interest in magical knowledge it would have made sense. It seemed like she was kinda just bitter that someone her age was able to do something she hadn't thought of first.

** I have said this before, and I will say it again. The best way to understand is not so much that Hermione is /jealous/ (its possible, maybe even probable, but not the most important factor). Hermione is experiencing what you might call [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance][cognitive dissonance]], though this is only part of it.

As a person she is heavily vested in the value of authority, in this case the author of the potions book (hehe), and since its what was recommended in the class by a credible teacher it must be the correct way to make the potions. On the other hand, some random student in the past wrote all over the book critiquing the authority. What's worse is the results are /better/, and she knows this - Slughorn's praise is only a validation of this.

And so like most people experiencing cognitive dissonance, she rationalizes the problem. The Half-Blood Prince must have been bad or wrong or something like. She ended up being right, but in the end this was an ad hominem style attack to try and nullify the fact in her mind that the Libatius Borage was inferior to the Half Blood Prince at Potioneering.

Frankly, if this sounds like its I am criticizing her its not: I am /defending Hermione/. She is rationalizing and trying to deal with her conflicting perceptions and world views - something everyone goes through and usually respond in similar (or much, much worse) manners.

It even makes sense! Why would someone with better recipes not publish them and get the textbooks changed? Then everyone could have better potions and the guy could have a big pile of gold and go down in history as a brilliant innovator?

You and I know it's because he was a little occupied being a slightly-reluctant terrorist, and probably wanting to keep his head down afterward, to keep teaching at Hogwarts rather than having people beg him to run a lab or whatever. But with what Hermione knows, it doesn't add up.

*** I think you are jumping through mental hoops so you don't have to admit Hermione can be jealous and extremely reluctant to admit she is wrong. It doesn't make her a bad person...it makes her human with flaws. For some reason JK chose to turn her flaws up to 11 in HBP.

It is clear to me at this point Hermione had read many 'authoritative' wizarding books and listened to many authority figures that she immediately discarded based on her own opinions. Never forget...she kept Lupin's secret in POA. Based on the wizarding world's overall opinion of werewolves I guarantee most of the things Hermione came across in doing her research painted them as dark and dangerous. Hermione, at 14, disregarded all of this and trusted Remus based on her own judgement.

Umbridge was a picture of authority. She immediately sussed her out and pushed a movement to learn from an uncertified student. She actively subverted the rules in place to make it happen. From what I remember she never felt conflicted or remorseful about her choice.

She confunds someone simply to help a fellow student make a sports team. Someone who had such a strong personal conflict in defying/not trusting authority would have never done that.

Unless she's jealous of the Half Blood Prince himself, as opposed to just being jealous of Harry. After all, Harry is just following someone else's notes. What does she have to be jealous of?

*** I agree with this. It is an issue of perception.

Harry (and Snape) are interpreting the set task as: Create the specified potion (in the best way possible)

Hermione (and the rest of the class) are interpreting the set task as: /Follow the set instructions in the book/ in order to create the specified potion

Hermione is, in my view, in the right to the best of her knowledge. She /could/ verify with Slughorn what the parameters of the task are, and then would probably be able to adapt her methodology if the paramters (to her) changed, but as is, her perception is that by not following the assumed rules - /and not disclosing to the teacher that he is doing so/ - Harry /is/ cheating in terms of not doing what the task requires. Why would she verify, when Snape's instructions, the only she has had in Potions for five years, have always been explicit?

I feel that if Harry himself felt he was in the right and not 'cheating', /he/ would ask for clarification on the task parameters, instead of using a different method under the radar and passing it off as if he is not.

Moreover, in terms of social weight, I think Hermione is right to be a bit miffed, too. Harry is already a celebrity who will do well through life no matter what. But Hermione is disadvantaged in the magical world. Being The Best through sheef grift and hard work and by following what is asked of her in class to the letter is her way of mitigating that. By outshining her in Potions, Harry is threatening her record - and by extension, her status. And he doesn't show any recognition of /why/ that is so important to her.

But she is definitely right in her displeasure towards Harry using the book like he did, both because it is an extremely bad idea to just trust what some student once wrote into the margins of a book (as we see when he decides to use Sectumsempra without even before testing what it does) and because Harry uses the knowledge from the book to get better grades without understanding the slightest bit about potions which is basically cheating.

*** The potions and the spells are totally different things in my mind.

I agree with Hermione totally about the spells...trying a spell with vague or no explanations is irresponsible and dangerous. But you justifying Hermione being upset about the potions notes by citing the spells isn't fair. There is no possible motivation for the Prince to write worse ways to prepare the potions...and his tips work from the start and get better results. Is Harry supposed to want to make worse potions?

And I think you saying Harry doesn't understand the slightest bit about potions is unfair as well. He received an Exceeds Expectations on his OWL's despite the fact that he was taught by someone who despised him. Hermione received an E on her Defense OWL. Would you say she knows nothing about Defense?

Finally, the Prince's potions notes are an incredible learning tool that actually provide explanations. Take the first instructions Harry uses from the book:

/Crush with fat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting./

The Prince not only describes what to do, he explains /why/. Harry is learning from the instruction.

The second bit of instruction says to add a clockwise stir at the end of the suggested counterclockwise stir. The standard text and the Prince are both giving basic instructions...the same amount of "learning" is being done in both cases.

Ron says it perfectly when Hermione tells Harry he wasn't getting praise for his own work. /He only followed different instructions to yours./ Hermione was doing the same thing as Harry...blindly following a set of rote instructions. The same amount of learning was being done. The only difference was Harry had a better teacher and was learning more useful information. Information he offered to let Hermione use as well.

The point of the class is to make Potions. How is it cheating to follow instructions that make a better potion?

#+end_quote

Agreed, I unfairly conflated the two.

As for the cheating, I still think it is cheating in that Harry clearly abuses his better instructions to present himself as a potion genius. Even though he didn't initially intend that, his neglect to correct Slughorn's belief is academically dishonest. It's certainly not illegal and probably not against school rules but it is morally wrong.

Regarding his understanding of potions I did exaggerate, but I personally believe that before 6th year the potions class did not require any real understanding of potions. During classes all that happens is brewing potions, which merely requires the ability to follow instructions and perhaps some skill in preparing ingredients properly. The practical O.W.L exam is also just brewing a potion with given instructions. We do not know exactly what the written exam encompasses but we do know that one question was regarding polyjuice which Harry believed he got full marks for because he could describe the effects. That does seem more like a knowledge test than actually applying any understanding of potions. The first time students are really asked to show their understanding of potions is when Slughorn wants them to create antidotes for blended poisons, at which Harry fails utterly.

The point of the class was simply to make potions until 5th year. The point of the Advanced Potions class that Harry is in is definitely not just to make potions but to /understand/ potions so that unknown potions can be analyzed, antidotes can be created based on such analysis and perhaps even new potions can be invented. There is a reason that Aurors are required to take that class and it's not that they have to be even better than their peers at mindlessly following brewing instructions.

Regarding the amount of learning being done, I didn't claim that either of them were learning anything from following instructions. Harry just generally learns less and understands less about Potions than Hermione, regardless of which book he uses.

Hermione not wanting to read the book is IMO completely OOC for her but perhaps I just didn't understand her character as well as I thought.

I also think you are understating the amount of critical thinking that happens in the first five years and exaggerating how much more critical thinking is involved in year six. The Bezoar lesson happens in January/February which means they have sat through 4-5 months of instructions with no apparent threat to Harry's image as a potions genius. So either the class has been just as mindless or Harry understands potions better than most.

It makes complete sense that Hermione would get annoyed at Harry for not following instructions in /following instructions class/ when not following instructions properly can result in extremely dangerous accidents. At NEWT level you would think they would know the basics of reactions and be able to start putting together potions for themselves. Hermione of all people should be able to read the notes on better methods, maybe cross reference it with something out of the library and go "OH! I see what that does, that's actually brilliant".

**** That's true, but potions has a lot of other actual reasons in-text why it's an awful class and Snape should have never been allowed to retain his teaching position. I generally have an issue with the way the other classes are shown to be taught as well, but potions particularly seems substandard. There's something to be said for Harry being an unreliable narrator who is resistant to actually applying himself in class, especially when he's not interested in the subject, but it's things like Hermione's reaction to the prince's book in book 6 , (or Neville's goddamn boggart in book 3) that make me think it was actually a pretty trash class from an educational perspective, not just Snape's shitty demeanor.

Saying all this I know it's mostly just because Rowling didn't feel like fleshing out the technical aspects of her magic system and didn't really explore what makes a good educator outside of "good person is good teacher. bad person is bad teacher." I really really enjoy fics where education is a deep focus and you see more of the classes than "an essay on cheering charms due Monday"

Harry used the shortcuts and improvements and got better grades, but he didn't understand why they work, so when, for example, he was asked to create a custom antidote, he failed because he didn't have a ready recipe. He still got praise from Slughorn because he used the bezoar, but it doesn't change the fact that he didn't have nearly enough knowledge to support his grade. Since he needed Potions to become an Auror (and would presumably continue them in Auror training), he was ultimately shooting himself in the foot. So yes, I think Hermione was right.

Rowling did write Hermione with flaws... It's just a shame people rarely call her out on it in the books.

** Bah! It's only her jealousy rearing its ugly head!

Seriously, Hermione works hard for her grades and she can't stand the thought of somebody just using an old book with stuff scribbled into the margins to "cheat" their way to the top!

Hermione would however also have resented people like the Marauders (who were good students, despite not spending a lot of time learning! Hell, their rule-breaking alone would tick the rule-worshipper Hermione (she only breaks them if not doing so leads to worse consequences than obbeying them, while the Marauders break them just because they want to and because they can!), who have good grades without effort!

** The charitable reading of Hermione's actions---and, IMO, the one best supported by her canon speech and most consistent with her character elsewhere---is that:

- Using the HBP book was cheating. Throughout canon, Hermione has a very strong sense of justice and fair play, and Harry getting credit for something he did not earn was something she judged him for. (Notice that when Harry offered to share, she declined.)
- Using the HBP book was reckless. Even throwing around Dark spells aside, Harry did not have the competence to know which of the Prince's suggestions had been tested, nor whether they only worked conditionally (e.g., only during waxing moon), nor whether they required more manual dexterity than he had, nor whether there were omitted steps because the margin was too narrow and HBP had assumed that the rest was obvious. In fact, nowhere did it say that HBP was successful: for all they knew, one of his ideas had severely injured him and those around him and he had to drop out of Hogwarts.
