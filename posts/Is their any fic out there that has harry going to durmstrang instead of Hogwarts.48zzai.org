  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** Do you know anything about Santi's plans for this? Is he still writing, or has it been abandoned? I really liked what's written so far, but it's been over a year since it's been updated.
