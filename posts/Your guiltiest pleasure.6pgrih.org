I have recently found this fic though linkffn(All That Glitters by mangoaddict) I am only part way through and I wouldn't call it a guilty pleasure exactly since the writing and characters are really good and it avoids tropes, but I recommend checking it out!

It's an AU where Snape survives the war, but never tells anyone about him acting in Dumbledore's wishes and goes into hiding. Harry's a bit obsessed about getting revenge, Minerva and others may be in danger due to various individuals trying to stir up their own plans and ideals and Snape is trying to decide if he wants to get involved again. One of the best portrayals of him I have read recently. Isn't afraid to show his flaws, but also shows just how clever, powerful, and stubborn he can be. It's sometimes reads like a mystery with lots of things going on and various people trying to follow the clues to figure out what is the truth.

If he genuinely cared about them he wouldn't be manipulating and grooming them for his own pleasure, no matter what the author says. That's not morally ambiguous, it's straight up wrong. The author also never /portrays/ it as morally ambiguous or questionable even once, so we the audience aren't intended to see it that way.

That's not what he is doing though. He's grooming them to win a war and change a society. He's clearly not averse to them falling in love with him in the process, but that's not his main objective.

This is where hindsight comes into play. He already saw what happens when they have their agency. They make wrong choices and die horrible deaths. He's upfront to them about this (after securing their minds from intrusion) and even shows them their fate if he doesn't intervene. I don't know how far you got into the story, but the main girls know exactly what he is doing.

He's not a golden boy in this story, he's a drug peddler, a cynic and a manipulator, but I think anything he has done in regards to the girls up till now has truly been in their best interest. And again, I acknowledge that it is morally ambiguous to make such decisions for someone else and sort of planning their lives for them, but it is not evil (certainly less evil than what Dumbledore does to Harry in canon).

Right, he's just trying to keep him miserable and lead him to his death/martyrdom. I'd rather be happy and fucked than dead and I'm not even gay or in love with Dumbledore.

All that is beside the point anyway, since Harry hasn't fucked any of them yet and I doubt he will any time soon or without their vigorous consent.

Edit: I've actually had similar concerns as you when I started the fic, but they have been - maybe not entirely eliminated - extremely diminished. It all depends how things play out when/if things should get sexual. We are broaching on difficult issues of consent and statutory rape (which is defined differently depending on society/legislation PLUS all the complications with magic and time travel) in this discussion, which are always harder to debate properly over the internet (everyone has strong opinions, tempers run hot).

********* The quotes I posted show that he's building his relationship with these children with the explicit intent from the start of it eventually becoming sexual. This is entirely unnecessary to achieve his goals, but like he says his personal pleasure matters too. Making friends and building a relationship with children with the clearly stated purpose of eventually wanting to get with them is super wrong. This manipulation removes their consent and agency, because he has been manipulating their relationships since they were 8. He's taking advantage of an extremely unbalanced power dynamic, that's by definition non-consensual. Think of it this way, how would you feel if you turned 18 and it turned out that your personal tutor since you were 8 years old has been manipulating you to want to fuck him?

Removing some of their agency to save their lives? That's fine, I can accept that. Removing it to save their lives /and/ build a harem? That's creepy.

Like you get the underlying reason why this whole thing is super concerning. I def don't mean personal offense towards you, it just gets me heated that such a popular fic has some pretty disturbing concepts that are presented as unproblematic and even positive.

My stupid Dumbledore comparison really makes me think though if people would give Dumbledore at least some of the hate he deserves if he groomed a child to accept a sex ritual orgy with him and a few other grown men as the only chance to remove a Horcrux (just for the thought experiment) instead of having to create a sacrificial lamb.

**** It is one of the disturbing points inherent of the peggy sue trope, yes. However, a pedophile is someone who fucks children, nothing more. I am not dismissing the absolute horror this behavior is in any way, but you need to keep that in mind, a pedophile fucks children.

Harry hasn't fucked any children in this story, he hasn't planned to either.

What has he done exactly? He has manipulated them, yes, he has groomed them to fit his goals, also. Which is indeed very edgy, but if we think about it, he has trained them to be powerful, he has done everything possible to ensure they would be educated, he has sought the consent of their parents whenever possible. He hasn't groomed them specifically so they fall in love with him. He has also done his utmost to protect them. It seems to me that he has done everything he could to make sure they would be fulfilling their potentials. He hasn't tried to isolate them or make them dependant on him, which is something pedophiles do. He has also been honest and upfront with them.

If Harry is a pedophile, he must be the lamest on Earth, because is doing it completely the wrong way. That he hopes to fuck them when they're older is nothing more than a fantasy so far, moreover, he has made sure that they would be educated and well-inserted enough to make their own choices freely, and that they would have trustworthy people around them to support them in the future.\\
I don't think his actions so far have much worth condemning, except for his tendency to manipulate people.

There are the marriage contracts, of course, but it is something that is considered normal in this world, and a marriage contract is a promise to marry someone in the future and nothing more.

I see how all this is disturbing, but objectively, I don't think it's that bad. If you compare with what his brother has done with his second chance, and what he intended to do with his third, Harry seems pretty tame in comparison.\\
Harry's ruthless, manipulative and extremely pragmatic, but he isn't a pedophile, and he genuinely cares for his allies.

Despite, manipulating someone into having sex or into falling in love with you is just another way to say 'seduction'. It's completely acceptable in most cases. We would never have born if one of our parents hadn't done it to the other one.

***** My point was that he uses the same tactics that pedophile use to manipulate children, not that he is actually a pedophile. He's grooming them with gifts and manipulation in order to trust him, an older authority figure, while secretly planning on eventually having sex with them at an indeterminate point. He explicitly says so in the first chapter:

#+begin_quote

He explicitly sees them as a reward for his efforts and is grooming them to want to fuck him.

Normal adults don't manipulate other adults into relationships. That is 100% creepy and wrong, full stop. No healthy or normal relationship is built on that. It's even worse when we're talking about manipulating /children/ who don't have full developed reasoning. It's removing their agency not to save their lives but to fuck them. Hell, imagine that when you turn 18 you find out the tutor you've trusted since you were 8 has been manipulating you to want to have sex with him because he knew you would be hot? That is insanely creepy.

Further, the author at no point presents this behavior as harmful or wrong. Just the opposite, he writes it as normal and even cheeky for Harry to want to manipulate children into desiring him. This leads me to not be willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt in regards to how he plans to handle things in the future.

*** I haven't read it in a while, but basically an intelligent dragon who is magical-adoption-style kin to one of Harry's ancestors decides he doesn't like what's going on post PoA, and spirits him away to another realm. He learns dragon magic, essentially becomes a dragon animagus, and mates with Draco Malfoy. It's terrible. I love it. It's also technically well-written, iirc.

Right? That's all you really ask for. An author can toss in the craziest shit they can think of, and as long as it's actually well written and doesn't throw shit at me from far left field, I'll usually enjoy it.

***** Dragonkin is one of the HP fics I've gone back to read a couple of times. The whole Part with the dragons was pretty cool, and I really would have liked if the world building wasn't original, but a crossover from something so there would be more fic with that concept.

And magical inheritance was also one of my favorite tropes :) Linkffn(Raspberry Jam) was probably my favorite from that category.

** linkffn(11793088)

It is a marriage law + Dramione fic, and the only one of this pairing that I've been able to read and not absolutely hate. It has some pretty huge flaws, making Hermione submissive and whitewashing the Malfoys, but also has humour and nice slice of life scenes, which kept me reading. I really think this could have been much better if it was written with OCs rather than canon characters(Or atleast a more AU HP universe).

Horrible things that don't make me feel guilty are fix fics and OP protagonists.

One is , Harry is healed from the trauma of terrible Dursley abuse by Snape who adopts him and loves him. And then Draco moves in for some reason? And Draco gets super jealous and then Snape adopts him too, and now they are brothers! It's so dumb and cringeworthy , but it's stuck with me more than most.

The other is a sex game between Slytherin and Gryffindor (plus maybe Luna?) where it's kind of truth or dare , but the dares are written by themselves. It's not silly enough to be absurd and it's not the hottest fic I've read, but there was something special about it. Featuring an unusual Ron and Pansy romance which was really rather sweet.
