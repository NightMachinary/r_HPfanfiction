** I assume you mean drafted into wwii, but my immediate reaction to this prompt was 'hm, what position could tom play in the nfl?'

** Well, there's a Captain America crossover, "Come Together", where he doesn't get drafted, but dragged into the war by Hydra.

#+begin_quote
  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.

** Impossible. Conscription started at 18, and besides students were specifically exempt from conscription.

Conscription as practised by the UK isn't just "let's grab everyone we can possibly get our hands on", the government wanted there to still be a functioning country left.

**** Conscription started at 18, and you specified /before 7th year/.

Orphans don't somehow count as being older than they are. You don't get 2 bonus years added on your birth certificate when your parents die.

******* Does it matter? It is a world where magic exists and it is a request for Tom as a conscripted soldier. If it suits you make him not a 7th year. I just wanted him to be under 17 so he doesn't just curse everyone.

******** Oh I fucking hate this attitude of "but if magic exists nothing has to be realistic"

Magic isn't real, so Rowling and then fan authors can say anything about it. There are no rules.

World War 2, the British military, and the British government's conscription efforts /are/ all real so there /are/ rules!

********* Dude I'm not asking for them to draft a 12 year old. Some suspension of disbelief considering lots of under 18 year old fought seems pretty reasonable to me
