wouldn't it be nice if we could travel the multiverse! You betcha! so let's go do that.

whether for pain or pleasure we should go to alternate universes and dimensions and hopefully avoid being a cold dumbass who has the power of a god but won't have a conversation and is willing to walk by a woman getting raped and do nothing for the sake of not showing off.


** It sounds like you are mocking this genre of fics as a whole, I'm not completely sure. On the off chance that you are not, you might like the Lone Traveler series of stories. Most of them are written by one guy, but there are a few by randoms. I've only read one though.

It's mainly what you ask except that Harry is not as neutral as you seem to want. He's pretty much good, but does have a sort of non-interventionist sort of thing going on. Think Gandalf and the Wizards of Middle Earth from LoTR except slightly more hands on than Gandalf was.

*** Yeah, I'm kinda serious about it. The thing about it is that there are a ton of fics where this happens but in almost all of them he's even worse than Gandalf where it's like the author decided to put his name into another fictions canon without changing anything whilst making him utterly devoid of all personality. so while author writes him as some godlike badass who could take out the big bad and prevent the death of thousands with the blink of an eye all he does and shoots Hogwarts level spells and talks while letting everyone die around him, it's like if Gohan would have fought Cell at Hercule stan's level so he didn't offend him or Goku vs Frieza with Goku avoiding super Saiyan because it wouldn't be fair to vegeta which makes no sense and makes you want to pull your hair out.

  Lily uses a dark ritual to protect her son which has long term ramifications for him. Not that he's complaining about the perks of the matter. Harry/Multi, obviously. Very dark and may offend delicate sensibilities. More information inside. Reposted after accidental deletion. Don't ask even though someone end up will doing so.
