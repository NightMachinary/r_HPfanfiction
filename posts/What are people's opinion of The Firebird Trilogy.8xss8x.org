I've seen it getting recommended a lot again lately but I thought most people on here absolutely hated it?


** I like it. It's a bit too edgy/dark at times, but it has some really creative ideas and is definitely unique in many aspects. I didn't really care for the ending, but not as bad as the canon ending by a long shot.

** I would recommend it in a heartbeat.

It's a very engaging and original, if a bit long, series. It's typical Darth Marrs, plenty of angst and sappy moments. All in all not half bad, probably one of the more unique fanfictions out there. Worthy of its own book series. Some of the ideas were very unique and the characterization of all the people was really, really great.

But it's a Darth Marrs's fic and he is known for being a bit different. Not to everyone's taste I mean, but still a solid rec.

** I am a staunch defender of this series, so I'll give you my rundown.

In my opinion its everything an AU should hope for. That is to take a point of divergence and take it to its logical end. Darth Marrs does a great job of using the change in society and changing so many other little things from the way Quidditch is played to anticipating the problems that come along with male/female ratio.

Another strong point is this is the antithesis to the traditional Harem fic. In this the 'hero' gets women, four of them to be precise. However things don't really go so well. Not only does he not want them in the first place, but the author does a good job outlining the trouble that comes along with it.

A lot of the hatred comes from the sheer amount of darkness the story has. However it isn't an edgy sort of darkness and it isn't forced. The darkness is the result of a screwed up society full of flaws.

And lastly? [[/spoiler][Darth Marrs isn't afraid to write an unhappy ending. The ending shocked me the first time, but the more I reread it, the more I find it utterly fitting.]]

In conclusion the Firebird Trilogy has an important place in the fandom. Whether you love it or hate it none can deny the sheer creativity and the uniqueness that no other fic can boast.

*** I liked the dreary tone of the ending, but it was taken a bit too far with the and they never ever heard from Hermione again (or something like that)! I absolutely didn't buy that they'd never talk to each other again after what they went through and thought it was just gloomy for gloominess sake... But Darth Marrs loves these types of endings so I didn't really expect anything else at that time.

*** Well you've saved me the trouble of putting my own feelings into a post as they coincide with yours - right up to the ending. I'm afraid the final couple of pages pretty much destroy the series for me.

It's not just the whole Hermione thing, but also that Harry ends up a boring person in a boring job. It should have been left like the Canon epilogue, where all we really find out is that our heroes all grew up and had families - it was the Cursed Child and other non-book stuff that added details.

I remember being mesmerised by the series but I've never gone back to it, purely because I know how much I hate the ending.

** It's not very good. The author writes the same shit in every single on of his stories, and while their are nuggets of interesting bits, they're buried by shallow edginess.

** Too grimdark for my taste. And when a group supposedly fighting against an evil inhumane system suddenly is all ok with one of them using the methods of said system to punish another for going against the system's norms, it jumped the shark for me. Like if a group of civil rights activists suddenly beat up a coloured member of their group for drinking from the same fountain as them.

*** I think I know what you're speaking about and yeah, that "punishment" scene is the worst part of the fic. I don't think there's anything as bad in the rest of it, but I can totally understand dropping it there. Don't really understand what the point of it was.

**** At least in the end, the punished party tells them that they can't forgive that, and leaves them.

** I read it more than a year ago, so I barely remember it, but I do recall thinking it's really weird. Like it takes the idea of an old-fashioned misogynistic pureblood society and makes it completely misandrist with concepts that just make the whole thing weird. I can't say I cared much for it.

** While the writing was good as was to be expected from the author, I strongly disliked the Plot, the Concept and the Execution.I had to stop reading in the middle of the first part. The world painted in that fanfiction is a strong counterpart to what I would want the world to be.

The ease with which people were stripped of their freedoms, their rights; the seemingly ignorance when it came to using people like cattle and the childish unwillingness of the main characters to take action, the egoism that was botched in here and there to drive home that the MCs are children. That and more made me want to hit my tablet onto the table.

I am strongly in favor or teleological ethics and I cannot find the words to describe how much the story disgusts me.

/edit

Also I do not ship Hermione & Harry / Luna & Harry, so there's that.

** Supposedly very good and a nice twist on the harem trope, but I found it too odd to get through the first or second chapter. The technical side was good.

** The whole concept of "Veils" and the "You'll accept your role and if you want to leave society you'll basically be tortured" (The Veil is supposedly quite painful - It being put on you permanently... Torture) got as far as that and made me feel like "Nope nope nope" and closed the tab
