It's well established that the wizarding world is at least technologically behind the Muggle one and is likely culturally behind as well. This got me thinking about what the governments and borders of the rest of the countries outside of the UK look like, and even within the UK. For example, are the continental countries dominated by absolute monarchs, is the UK an outlier by having a 'democracy'? Does the wizarding UK control all of Ireland, just the North, the Pale (The area around Dublin) or none of it? Do the European powers, or other powers, possess overseas colonies? Have Germany and Italy unified or is central Europe still dominated by the HRE or magical equivalent? Who are the Great Powers?

I know I'm probably one of the only people to think about things like this but if the Wizarding world succeeded from the muggle one in the 17th century then it is likely that the rise of liberalism and nationalism that came with the 19th century didn't affect the Wizards and thus there would be no calls for unification. This is something I often wondered and something that kind of irritates me when I read fics, for example, I was reading one the other day in which a portrait created in around the 11th century mentioned that it enjoyed visiting Germany when Germany didn't exist as a unified nation until 1871. This got me to thinking what other people though the borders of the magical world looked like, whether it complies with the Muggle borders, is just a few years behind or whether it is centuries behind. This, various in turn, got me thinking about whether all the nations have ministries or if there are various different ideologies and what peoples own headcanons for the state of the world are as the fics I have read mostly stay within England and the area around Hogwarts.

tl;dr what do you think the borders and governments of the wizarding world look like and why?


** Bruh, you have no idea how much I've been thinking about this. I've even made a map regarding the actual borders. The main thing is to understand the demographics of the wizarding world. In essence, the number of wizards is too low for some countries to have their own ministries, government and schools. Look at the British Isles. If you take into account the number of Hogwarts students and the fact that wizards live longer than muggles, then it's safe to assume that there are around 5.000-7.000 wizards in the entirety of the UK and Ireland. So for clarities' sake lets say that there are 7.000 and currently the number of people living in the UK and Ireland is about seventy million. This indicates that one in every 10.000 people is a wizard. Now, this means that is is useless to think that a Lichtensteinean (even though it's in the books in a short reference), Monacan, Andorran, San Marinese and even Slovenian, Montenegrin and ministries of other small countries would even exist. It doesn't make any sense to. In my imaginary map there are but a few countries. I think that it would be easiest to create countries on linguistic and cultural ties. So here's a short rundown on how I would draw the maps of wizarding Europe: 1. UK and Ireland are the same entity in the books, 2. France stays a separate ministry, but the french speaking parts of Switzerland, southern Belgium (Wallonia), Andorra and Monaco are added to the mix. 3. Italy is the same as in our world, but italian-speaking parts of Switzerland are added 4. Spain and Portugal form the Wizarding government of Iberia due to their shared culture, history and simmilar languages, 5. Central Europe has a government simmilar to that of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, German speaking regions of Switzerland, Slovenia, the Czech republic and maybe the western parts of Poland form a wizarding nation; heck I'f even add the Netherlands, Flanders and Luxemburg into the mix) due to the shared history, culture and mentality 6. Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland form the Scandinavian ministry for magic 7. I would somehow combine Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro into one ministry 8. Greece and Albania and some parts of southern Macedonia and Bulgaria and eastern Thrace form one entiry 9. Hungary I would redraw on the borders of the old Hungarian kingdom of the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen (Hungary, Sovakia, parts of Serbia and Romania) 10. Romania and Bulgaria into one government 11. The three Baltic countries form one wizarding government 12. Poland and parts of Belorussia and the western part of the Ukraine (somethibg like the Polish-Lithuanian Conmonwealth) 13. Russia and the eastern parts of Belorussia and Eastern Ukraine.

And please, don't take this too seriously guys, we don't want a shitstorm abrewing.

*** I think it's a mistake to view wizarding population as a function of Muggle population.

The reason for this is that there's no strong causal relationship between the two. Most wizarding births are going to be from wizarding parents, with the only impact of the Muggle population on the wizarding population being that of Muggleborns.

Given that Harry's year only contained 2 known Muggleborns, out of a minimum of ~40 students, this does not appear to be a major demographic factor. Further, it's not clear that more Muggles would translate to more Muggleborns in a linear fashion, as it's not clear what results in magic returning to squib lines to result in Muggleborns.

So wizarding population is unlikely to increase much when Muggle population increases (and vice versa).

As wizarding population is almost entirely disconnected from the Muggle population, wizarding demographics are likely to be determined by wizarding social factors.

I think the most likely scenario is that wizarding population is quite stable over time. The factors which have resulted in the fall of birth rates to around replacement rate in the rich West (in the Muggle world) largely apply to the wizarding world too: low infant mortality, no economic benefit to having more children, the existence of state support (e.g. free healthcare in the form of St Mungo's), and a comfortable standard of living which generally lowers risk.

This is further supported by the apparent social stability in British wizarding society. Places like Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are centuries old but appear to continue to serve their purpose much as they always did.

On this basis, I think it's a mistake to identify the ratio of wizards:Muggles in Britain and extrapolate that to other countries. The ratio is pure coincidence. It will have been lower in the past, when the wizarding population was more or less the same but the Muggle population was lower. It will be higher in the future, as Muggle population continues to grow but wizarding population remains largely stable. And it will be completely different in other countries, depending on what "starting" wizarding population they had.

With a stable wizarding population demographically divorced from the Muggle population, there's no reason to think that wizard:Muggle ratios will be anywhere near to similar around the world.

**** That's quite an interesting idea you've come up with, and it should be taken into account.

But I should note here that when talking about the demographics of Wizarding kind I didn't really think about the change throughout time. I was just under the impression that it was somehow safe to presume that regardless of the existence of a causal relation between Wizard:Muggle (and a lack of thereof) the population of Wizarding Britain could be calculated to about 7.000 individuals in the 1990. I've written another comment on this thread regarding how I've gotten the figure of 7.000 and you can check it you if you wish.

But I still find it somehow hard to believe that there are no connection between the populations of the Wizarding:Muggle worlds, especially before the signing of the ISWS. JK should have made the books longer and filled them with more thorough world-building.

***** Well, there are ways to estimate the wizarding population in Britain, but my point was that once you have that population, there's no real way to jump from that to estimating the wizarding population of other countries.

As regards the population of Britain, I think 7,000 is a bit low. Canonically, I think we're looking more around 18,000 wizards in Britain. Still small, but a bit more functional as a society than 7,000.

This is based on the following observations:

1. The only explicit, unequivocal statement of Hogwarts numbers in the books is in PoA, where there are said to be 200 Slytherins at a Quidditch match.

2. Assume the houses are roughly equal in size.

3. That gives a total Hogwarts population of 800, or around 115/year.

4. Assume that almost all magical Britons attend Hogwarts, as it is the only formal school of magic in Britain.

5. That gives you 115 magical births a year in Britain.

6. At the time Dumbledore died he was 120. At 120 he was quite sprightly, still in full time work, of keen mental ability, and generally active. Additionally, we are aware of people significantly older than him such as Madam Marchbanks. Therefore wizarding life expectancy is likely to be substantially in excess of Dumbledore's age when he died. Maybe another 30 years, to 150, though I wouldn't be surprised if it went further than that.

7. 115 births/year multiplied by a life expectancy of 150 years gives you 17,250 wizards. Add an extra 750 to account for people who turn Hogwarts down and to get a nice round number.

So 18,000 wizards total. Of course on top of that you have the rest of the British magical community e.g. goblins, werewolves, vampires, etc.

****** Your maths does seem correct but consider this. Does it say that there were 200 Slytherin students at the match or were there 200 "slytherins", i.e. slytherin students and former students who cheered for the team? It isn't a stretch to think that some parents, people from Hogsmeade, professional Quidditch coaches and players, Ministry officials (due to Sirius Black) and others would attend a Hogswarts quidditch game? In that regard, it is possible that the number of Slytherin students is lower than 200. That's of course just a theory but it would explain the discrepancies regarding the number of onlookers.

800 students, in my oppinion is simply too much. If you do your maths you'll see that that means there are 114 students in each year, which would mean that there are around 28 students in each house in each year. Yet we never see more than five people to a dorm. Plus, if your numbers were correct, why in Merlin's good name would they combine the classes? Imagine being in a potions classroom with 56 young witches and wizards. Pandemonium would ensue.

I argue that the "mediada" for the number of students is roughly 7 per year. Seven boys and seven girls per house (and, come on, the fact that seven is the default number is kinda fitting for the world of HP). That would mean that there are 14 per house, times that by four (houses) and seven (years) and you get 392 students. That (in my view) would make sense.

These however are "peace time" figure, i.e. figures before Voldemort. If you look at Harry's year, there appear to be around 5 boys per house per year, which would indicate the ofter cited number of 280 students in total.

And yes, Wizards do live longer than Muggles which indicates that students comprise only a rather small portion of the entire population, which I reckon is anywhere from 7.000-10.000. But again, it's kinda hard to do the numbers as we don't know how many people Voldemort killed. I do however agree that I don't see wizarding populations going through the same demographic phases as Muggles. That would mean that their demography is rather constant and non-changing (regarding numbers, not composition of course).

By 1700 the Iberian peninsula held dominion over almost all of Central and South America with only the Amazon remaining outside of their control, would these colonies carry over to the Iberian ministry or would the colonisation be a wholly muggle thing?

**** Interesting idea. I would argue that even with the signing of the International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy both worlds influenced one another. In that regard, it would be reasonable to note that the European Wizarding Ministries would hold sway over the areas of South America, Africa and parts of Asia in the same manner as the Muggle ones did. Nevertheless, I would also argue that the extent of European influence was not as widespread as we are led to believe in the modern historical narrative. Sure, these areas were formally part of the European Realm and yes, millions were subjugated in one way or another, but at the same time there vast sways of land where no European set foot. Look at Africa, for example, European colonial ventures didn't reach each and every single village and there were millions of natives who had no idea about the European presence.

I would argue that wizards did not venture into these areas to such a great extent as Muggles did. After all, there weren't that many of them to start with. They most likely signed some unfair treaties, held great political influence, lobbied and were able to cheaply import resources with magical properties into Europe and certain ministries most likely had a monopoly over certain areas (like the UK over India, Portugal over Brazil,...) but not much more. The only advantage that the European wizards had over the native ones was the Wand. When these tools were integrated into other wizarding societies, the Europeans didn't have any advantage left. I would argue that the exchange was of a more cultured nature than in the Muggle world. European wizarding influence spread not only in the form of Wands and language, but also with the establishment of wizarding governments, magical lore and knowledge and wizarding schools. In that regard, I believe that Europe definitely left a mark on the world wizarding community, but I don't believe that they were true colonial holders such as the Muggles. Of course, Wizards are also defined by their national identity (Harry is English, Fleur is French, etc.) and the wizards of the 17.-20. Centuries probably were weary of outsiders and to some extent frowned upon other wizarding societies that weren't European.

Let me give you one example: India. I don't believe that there was a "Magical British Raj" but that the European wizards forced the local population to sign unequal treaties, the heads of the state were most likely european or at least the kingmakers behing the scenes were. This most likely forced theIndias over time that they "Europeanised", i.e. started using Wands and developed a system of government and education influenced by the European one. That probably happened in the 19. or 20. Centuries. It happened parallel to the Muggle development in India and when the Indian Muggles started to break away from the UK, the wizarding population probably managed to put away with the unequal treaties and develop relations with their European counterparts which were of equal footing.

***** That's a fascinating take. I, personally, was operating under the assumption that the colonial holdings of the European powers were only to the extent of what their muggle counterparts possessed at the time of the statute. For example, a Magical Portugal would hold onto Brazil, though perhaps not all of it due to their limited population, though perhaps easier travel through things like international portkeys would enable them to have an easier time of controlling their lands, Though that is a topic in and of itself. Spain would still hold influence over at least part, I imagine they would have released some of their holdings just because of the extent of their lands at this time, of South and Central America, though the British and French American holdings would have been lost during the American revolution which would have spilled over into the Wizarding world earning them their independence. This would also mean that the Dutch held a part of South Africa and had the beginnings of the Dutch East Indies. I feel that while limited colonialism may have occurred in the Wizarding world, it would be to a much lesser extent than the Muggles would have at the same time. I hypothesise that if/when industrialisation takes off in the Wizarding world colonialism will pick up massively.

****** I believe that if there was emigration it would follow the muggle model. Up until 1800 no more than around three milion Muggles ventured into the colonies and that would mean that the wizarding presence of Europeans was somewhat minimal in the New World. Things most likely changed around 1850 when Europeans started emigrating to America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand /en masse/. But because to wizarding connection to the land and the fact that there was prejudice, I believe it is safe to assume that most wizards outside of Europe who are of Caucasian descent are most likely Muggle-born (or were Muggle-born when they emigrated). It doesn't make too much sense to me that wealthy, Pure- and Half-blooded families emigrated, but on the other hand it makes perfect sense that Muggle-borns, who were discriminated against, decided to flee to the New World.

Actually, now that I think about it it makes even more sense. The fact that Muggle-borns fled to America is the reason why the entire continent (albeit with some exceptions) decided to revolt against their european masters. Wizards probably wanted to create a society where blood status wasn't seen as important and they probably covertly assisted the Muggles in their fight for freedom against their Muggle colonial powers. So it may be safe to assume that there are more Pure-bloods and Half-bloods in Europe than in the USA and the rest of America. That will change in time, of course (considering that the US banned Wizarding-Muggle relations in the 1920s (but let's just stick to the Books and not the /Fantastic Beasts series/, thank you very much)). It's just a thought-experiment though and I'd love to hear your ideas regarding this.

***** African possessions are pretty irrelevant when you consider that around 1700, France owned most of North America, and Spain most of the rest. And the idea of decolonisation is pretty much the result of two straining World Wars, something irrelevant to the magical world. Which means that if there even is an independent US, it should be limited to the Thirteen Colonies at most.

I still stand by my decision to unify Spain and Portugal into one single entity in regards to the Wizarding world. Portugal has a population of about 10.000.000, which would mean that there would be about 1.000 wizards in the entirety of the country. Now, one thousand people is still a great number, but given the complexity of wizarding bureaucracy I doubt that that would be enough wizards to run the government but still have a functioning economy with shops, production and sports.

***** I know this is probably nitpicking, but this is a historical situation.

As a native portuguese speaker, I can say that we can get the gist of spanish, but that can be because many Portuguese speakers tend to learn a bit of Spanish. The two languagues can be quite different, sometimes like English and German(an exxageration yes, but in some cases and dialects that is the case), specially the Spanish from Spain that is more gramatically heavy than some from Latin America.

But I would really doubt people born in Portugal would accept being governed by people from Spain, they have gone to war multiple times due to it and muggleborns would probably be offended if they had to use spanish for documentation.

I would find it more beliavable that they just have a closed community that has some representation in the ICW.

The part about a magical version of the HRE still being around is more beliavable, same thing for some of the countries in the Eastern Europe having older border than moder ones.

On account of pragmatism I'd say that Finland would form a "region" of the Scadinavian wizarding nation. It would be like Germany for instance. Bavaria, is a separate "federal" state but is part of a greater entity called Germany. It has its customs, laws and traditions but it still sees union with Germany to being the best possible way of conducting politics. I'd reckon Finland would do the same. Of course Finnish is a completely different compared to the north-germanic ones, but if I'm not mistaken, there was some swedish influence in the country before Russia got it in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars.

** I think the best way to frame this discussion is to think about the following 2 questions:

1. Do wizards engage in colonialism themselves, or is it just Muggles that are doing it? (joint colonialism/Muggle colonialism)

2. Do magical borders change to match Muggle ones, or do they have separate territories? (parallel/divergent)

This then gives you four different possible shapes of modern magical political geography, depending on the answers.

*Joint colonialism + divergent states*

In this scenario, wizards and Muggles engage in colonialism together, with wizards assisting in Muggle conquests of the New World.

However, the magical societies established in the colonies are independent from the Muggle ones. Therefore, when Muggle empires fall, magical ones may continue (and vice versa).

This option gives you the most leeway to create some interesting magical political geography and to engage in all your neo-imperialistic wet dreams.

However, the biggest question it has to answer is: how were European wizards able to conquer the rest of the world so effectively? It also has to answer the question of why wizards waited to conquer the Americas, given that they knew of the Americas existence long before the Muggles did.

The other big question is how divergent political geography is dealt with. Over time, wizarding and Muggle populations would become so divergent that they might even be speaking different languages.

In terms of canon support, joint colonialism has mixed support. We know that there was a Quidditch World Cup where "New Spain" entered a team. It would be unusual for native Mexican wizards to refer to themselves as "New Spain", which implies some level of wizarding conquest of the Spanish main.

However, against that view, it seems that in the rest of North America things were quite different, with Native American wizards peacefully integrating into MACUSA.

Aside from the colonialism question, the model of divergent states has some canon support in the fact that magical Britain (as ruled by the Warlock's Council) predates the Muggle unification of England and Scotland by at least 500 years (notably, also well before the Statute of Secrecy was passed).

*Joint Colonialism + parallel states*

In this view, joint colonialism happened as above, but when the Statute of Secrecy was signed, wizards collectively decided to put wizarding solidarity and cooperation to achieve secrecy above their nation.

In the name of secrecy, when Muggle borders changed, magical borders would follow suit. This is the basis by which wars between wizarding nations are put to an end: their borders are now dictated by parties over which they have no control. It is considered necessary because any large scale war between wizarding nations would surely be noticed by Muggles.

Thus, when Muggle empires expand, magical administrations expand with them. And when they fall, so too do their equivalent magical administrations withdraw from those territories. This ever-changing administrative geography is stabilised by international cooperation at the ICW-level, resulting in a fairly standardised approach to wizarding government around the world, with global freedom of movement and things like (after GoF) standard cauldron bottom thickness rules.

This approach delivers a wizarding political geography and demographics closest to the real world. It is also finds a reasonable amount of canon support in the fact that American and British wizards did not participate in the American Revolutionary War, with the respective governments agreeing to put kind over country.

The biggest question this approach has to answer is: would wizards really sit by and watch as their Muggle compatriots are conquered and oppressed? Would wizards really just calmly accept rule by foreign wizards in the name of secrecy?

To the extent that the answer to this is "no", however, that is not necessarily a problem: rather, it creates interesting tensions which can lead to conflict and thus good stories. And we know that on at least one occasion (World War 1), wizards were not able to just sit and watch.

*Muggle colonialism + divergent states*

In this situation, only Muggles would have colonised. Wizards have independent states and therefore would completely ignore Muggle colonialism. Therefore in the present day, the magical geography of the Americas would be extremely different and would be dominated by Native American wizards.

The big question this has to answer is: would wizards really sit by and calmly watch the genocide of their Muggle compatriots and the complete destruction of their societies?

Besides that, the biggest problem for this position is that it doesn't really fit well with canon. From what we see of MACUSA, native Americans are far from dominant. Magical New Spain existed, as described above.

*Muggle colonialism + parallel states*

In this situation, only Muggles would have colonised, but in deference to wizarding secrecy, wizards would adjust their borders to match.

This would produce a situation where borders match the Muggle ones but demographics do not - Native American wizards, having never been conquered by European wizards, would still be the dominant demographic in North America. But they would exist within an administrative framework which mirrors the Muggle world's borders.

This scenario faces the same questions as Muggle colonialism + divergent states (namely, whether wizards would really sit by and watch as their Muggle cousins were wiped up and subjugated) but also asks an additional question: would those wizards not only watch the genocide of their cousins, but then follow up with the statement "Well, I guess you rule us too now" - without ever giving fight?

This, I think, stretches the Statute of Secrecy to breaking point, and I consider it the least plausible of the 4 scenarios.

*** Of the four I'd say joint colonialism and divergent states is the most likely if only because colonisation of the new world was already occurring. I imagine that wizards would find their way over. The real question is if it is muggle-borns escaping oppression or pure-bloods trying to get rich of the silver and gold. Either is possible. After that I feel divergent states because the British wizards at least seem to have no idea about anything muggle so the idea that they would match their borders to theirs is preposterous, and that's just their ignorance and doesn't take into account how the government is a noble republic with a large population of muggle haters, especially when one considers the time and context during which the statute was signed, or more specifically the witch hunts.

I'd go for Joint Colonialism + divergent States, after all, Wizards and Witches might have been more o less present in each society over Time according to each societal ideology (more secret in Europe, less in Africa for instance), but after the institution of the SoS everyone should be going underground. Therefore in the specific case of Southern America, I headcanon a Joint colonization process where Iberian Wizards fought under the Crown orders against local tribal magic-users, to later stablish local ministries and during 1800 following international developments seize opportunity created by the Nomaj Latinamerican Independence Movements to create their own separate nations such as *MACUSA* and the *Argentinian Council of Magic* these new nations while initially respectful of their counterparts inherited regions over time would evolve independently of their muggle counterparts as there is no longer a link with the Nomaj.

**** Yeah, pretty much. Those regions would tend to correspond to muggle nations more often than not, given their history, but they'd be far less formal (no border control, for one) and it does open up chances to alter things slightly and gives the opportunity for Wizards to be nationalistic or highly individualistic without much changes needed.

It's also apparently how the schooling system works canonically - the main ones we know are just the ones that are registered with the ICW, so there are/can be more that just never bothered to register and operate more informally.

In government terms, those might be 'Covens' in a similar vein to the Native American tribal governance. So, the British Ministry claims Great Britain and Ireland as its operating territory, but it tolerates a semi-independent cult of Druids here, a warrior-monastery there, etc, letting them pretty much govern themselves so long as they recognise the British Ministry's authority when it wants something.

Which also seems to parallel how the ICW runs fanonically - they never seem to give much of a shit about anything if the Statute isn't at risk.

** The only conclusion to draw from Canon is that by and large, the nations exist as they do in the Muggle world, if perhaps not with the same borders. There is a Ministry of Magic in Andorra and Norway, national Quidditch teams for Germany and Luxembourg, Voldemort hides in Albania, Charlie works in Romania etc. The one remarkable exception is Transylvania, which was only ever really an semi-independent entity for 50-100 years, after ca. 1606 to 1699. It's a piece of the puzzle that doesn't really fit with the rest, but there you are.

Another thing to consider is that magical wars mirror muggle wars. Were there not a somewhat-correlated national structure between the two, this wouldn't make sense.

So, TL;DR, regardless of what one considers likely or appropriate, it appears the general idea is that what exists in the muggle world exists in the magical world. Whether this (for instance) Germany will have the borders of the HRE, the post-1871 empire, the modern one, something in-between or something else entirely, is up for debate.

** I feel that I should probably outline some of my own ideas of what the wizarding world would look like.

Firstly, I feel there would be no unified Germany or Italy in this period as without the rise of Napoleon or equivalent the Wizards would see no rise in liberalism and nationalism which were the catalysts for the formation of these unified states. Despite this, the HRE (or equivalent as with no knowledge or wizarding religion I don't know if it would be called the Holy Roman Empire or something different) would not exist. In this world I feel Grindelwald takes the place of Napoleon in that it is he who effectively rampages across Europe by seizing power in his homeland of Austria (He has no canon birthplace) and brings about the end of the HRE, though Grindelwald's decidedly less liberal ideology prevents unity. After Grindelwald's defeat Austria once more rises to the status of Great Power, much like France and Germany did after their defeats in our own world and came to encompass much of the lands of Austria-Hungary.

Another rather interesting country would be the Russian empire. Assuming the rest of the world follows the British model of informing the Muggle leaders of the Wizarding world the Magical Russian state would face much the same fate as the Russian Empire, though at a later date. After the death of Lenin, and despite his wishes to the contrary, Stalin would seize power over the USSR. With this change in leadership, power-hungry the head of Magical Russia would inform the new head of their existence. Now Stalin was a paranoid and power hungry man who would inevitably see this non-communist state that lies hidden within his own nation as a threat and would set out to bring about a communist revolution in magical Russia, how this would be done I don't exactly know but it would likely begin with spreading the ideals of socialism to the Magical would, no industrialisation means no communism, and given the relative poverty and 'backwardness' of Russia for most of its history it is likely the ideals of equality and equal distribution of wealth would resonate with the lower classes, especially the serf populations and would result in a communist insurrection. How exactly this communist wizarding society would look I don't know but it would likely follow the Stalinist model and would, in essence, be a Soviet puppet state.

In the ununified lands of the HRE Prussia would still rise to be the dominant power and would come to be in a constant struggle with Austria for influence in the area. Though Bavaria would be a rising power in the are but would lack the influence to rival Austria and Prussia and would simply stay neutral in their struggle.

The British Ilse would be unified into a single entity though would be exceptionally isolationist and would distance itself from the affairs of Europe. The civil war would have greatly weakened the UK and it would only hold onto its Great Power status as a result of figures like Dumbledore and Harry Potter who greatly raise the prestige of the nation.

These are all the ideas I have so far and would love to see what the rest of you think!

That could indicate that the ISWS has a clause that the heads of Muggle governments have to be notified of important events.

This does however raise some questions. Is the prime minister the only one informed? What about the queen? Does she get to know that there is a parallel society inside the very country that she formally governs?

******** They most likely would try to obliviate any leader that tried to imprison them but I thought that rather than act directly it would be through espionage and infiltration that the USSR would flip Magical Russia. I'm sure that the Soviet secret police could find a few muggle-born wizards who would be willing to infiltrate the magical world to bring their glorious revolution to their magical brethren. This would mean that there would be no direct intervention by the Soviet government and it is possible that the Wizards would have no idea that Stalin and the Supreme Soviet had anything to do with their revolutionaries.

With regards to rogue leaders and Anti-Muggle sentiment, I also thought that it was more that they thought of them as inferior, rather than dangerous. I picture it like the Wizards see the Muggles in the same way that the muggles saw the 'uncivilised' tribes of the world, or perhaps animals. They were no threat and were fun to make fun of and watch as they went about their stupid little lives. I feel like the wizards didn't realise the Muggles were a threat until at least the First World war (in western Europe) or perhaps the Second World war because prior to this muggle wars would have little impact, but with the advent of things like bombers and vastly improved artillery the Wizarding settlements could now (indirectly) come under attack from the Muggles.

I find that international politics - and changes to /not/ be the modern world transposed into the WW - is a fun thing to imagine changed up. It could take the situation from the SoS and use that as the basis for the various political entities. Or it could pick other, new states to imagine - particularly in the Americas, if we take the idea that indigenous wizarding society existed pre-colonization, that could have had massive changes to how the WW did things. Same across Africa/Asia - did European wizards colonize/take over in the same way that muggle nations did?

I've had an AU wizarding world setup that's been bouncing around my head for a while with some things like that - like the inclusion of a magical Byzantine Empire, taking the idea of the split of the empire to also have included a magical emperor (and not just East/West) and that letting it survive, along with Western Europe being divided along French and British lines in the aftermath of the French Revolution (and the repercussions of many French wizards joining in the revolution and playing a role in it, counter to the SoS).

** Well since we've had a nice chat about population, European borders and colonialism I was wondering who you thought the 'Great Powers' would be. A rather simple description of a Great Power would be the 8 (Based off of the number in EU4 and Victoria 2) nations that command the most respect within the ICW. For example, in our world the United States would be the number 1 Great Power as everyone pretty much does what they say at this point.

I have devised three things that each nation would be graded on based off of the criteria in Victoria 2 (Never played EU4) which are: Military score or basically the size of any potential mobilised armies, basically how populous they are, The number of unique or important magical ingredients and such produced by the population (Larger and more tropical countries would have a higher score than more temperate regions due to their larger biodiversity), and finally national prestige, this is based on the number of prestigious people and events surrounding this country. The UK, for example, would have one of the highest prestige levels in the world due to the likes of Dumbledore defeating Grindlewald in single combat and ending the war, Harry Potter ending the civil war and surviving the killing curse, and even the likes of Snape (For being one of the youngest potions masters).

I will now provide who I think the 1st and 8th World powers are. Number one would be China, mostly due to its massive population allowing it to field a massive army. I feel ICW meetings are basically just everyone trying to annoy the Chinese, their vast land and the variations in climate and biome within the country also allow it to produce a wide variety of important magical ingredients.

The number 8 Great Power would be the UK. With its rather mild climate, it produces no rare ingredients and with its rather low population, it can field only a small military. The only reason it is still a great power is due to prestige.

** Wizarding communities often form around wizarding schools. The only all-magical village in Great Britain grew around Hogwarts (this comes from the games, but Hogsmeade was supposedly founded by a Hogwarts alumnus). Hogwarts existing brought the British wizarding community together, creating connections which wouldn't be made if everyone was homeschooled, finding muggleborns and training skilled wizards necessary for creating future government agencies. I imagine countries which did not have a good school of magic had less opportunities to create a national identity early. Wizards could even permanently leave their countries of origin to live closer to a good magic school and communities around them.

For example, I imagine prestigious Beauxbatons laying near the French-Spanish border might have caused many Spanish wizards (especially the rich pureblood ones, who knew about its existence earlier) to learn to speak French and then move to work in France, which was easier after spending years in a French-speaking environment and having lots of French friends (migration is easier for wizards). This would mean that there is proportionally more wizards living in magical France than in neighboring countries, since they all flock to Beauxbatons and related communities. It's nearly certain that wizarding France is in control of neighboring French-speaking countries due to controlling their education. They might also be richer.

In Eastern/Central Europe purebloods might also speak one language that is taught in Durmstrang and identify with their country of origin less (unless their country has their own well-established school of magic, which I imagine Transylvania has) . However, since nobody really knows where Durmstrang is (just that it's cold and near a large body of water), people can't really migrate here. Still, Durmstrang graduates probably stick together, living in the same wizarding communities. I think the city of Kaliningrad would be a good bet for a place where they congregate - it has a multicultural history and is probably close to the location. Maybe it even has a separate wizarding government? That being said, muggle-born and half-blood wizards seem like they would be more patriotic. If pure-bloods weren't interested in creating a unified wizarding Germany or Poland or Hungary, people raised with muggles would probably do that anyway (unless their country was really small). As long as muggles of certain nationality remain in one place, there is no reason for local wizards not to create their own country apparatuses. Who's gonna stop them? A dozen of foreign wizards (proportional to the number of foreign muggles in the area), armed with wands no better than the locals'? This obviously only applies to large groups of people who are the largest in their territory - Jews would have their own communities, but it is unlikely that they would form an actual internationally-recognised country before Israel.

Going with the idea of different European wizarding cultures, wizards colonising America (and I can't imagine wizard colonization not being a thing - without having to worry about foreign magic-users, Native wizards would be able to help their muggle equivalents and Harry Potter would live in a universe very different from our own) could be different from the muggles colonising America. I imagine wizards colonising Latin America being mostly muggle-borns and half-bloods and speaking Portugese. Blood purity would be less important than in Europe, if at all, but magical prowess and wealth (derived mostly form exploiting nature and Natives) would be the king.

It's important to consider how the International Statute of Secrecy became international. From Rowling History™ we know that it was mostly prompted by the witch hunts in Great Britain and France. I can imagine purebloods from Durmstrang-dominated countries agreeing to stop mingling with the muggles, but what about other countries? Witch-burnings weren't very popular in Russia or China (Mulan movie is not historically accurate), and there are many pros of being able to work with or even near muggles. How was the Statute enforced outside of Western Europe?

Indigenous wizards of the world could be conquered under the pretense of spreading the Statute of Secrecy, not Christianity (which is probably not as popular among wizards as among muggles). That being said, I don't imagine Native wizards being completely under the thumb of Europeans - there are many magical ways of hiding places, so maybe some some of them went into hiding after European "discovery", only revealing their existence (but not location) later. Wizards from other countries could stay independent of European wizards for a longer time, but there just wasn't enough of them to stop colonization from happening. Ultimately, as Christianity and anti-wizard sentiments spread among their own populace (with the help of European wizards hoping to dominate the international wizarding community), they had to agree to sign the Statute od Secrecy and probably some other papers which determined muggle-borns from which muggle countries/parts of countries were they responsible for. Their governments remained dissimilar to the British MoM in many ways, but they had to change to accommodate for the Statute. Some African and Oceanian wizards became even more serious about secrecy and separation than Europeans, taking muggle-born children to magical communities the first time they experienced accidental magic instead of waiting until a certain age.

Also, I can't imagine wizards having actual border control. Everyone can apparate and even if cross-country apparation is impossible, one can still apparate right next to it and then cross it, since there could not possibly be enough border guards available and any spell stopping people from crossing the border illegaly would probably endanger secrecy, since it would also work on muggles/muggle-borns. I think wizards just leave immigration papers to the muggles and check for illegal goods/criminals whenever they see them.

TLDR; European countries have similar borders (it's harder for European to oppress other Europeans due to all of them owning wands), but the power relations between them aren't the same, mostly because of wizarding schools. Wizard colonization happened and is the reason for making SoS international. Countries colonised by Europe irl might be different in theory, but are either hidden or are equivalent to muggle countries/provinces/a mix of those for secrecy reasons. Not all countries have an equal percentage of wizarding population because of migration, and they might have very different cultures. Wizarding border control is practically nonexistent.

*** I have to disagree that there should be more than one school. The entire point of the magical community is that they're a really small minority. The fact that there are so few wizards is the reason Muggles can't understand them. If - let's say - 1/100 of the population would have magical abilities, then I see no reason for there being prejudice against Wizards and Magic. If there would be a lot of wizards, people would just accept Magic as a part of everyday life. But if you have a really small population (let's say 1/10.000) people would judge and discriminate, even act violently against a small minority that has freakish and "unnatural" skills. Otherwise there'd be no reason for the existence of the ISWS and the separation of the two worlds.

I think you actually can calculate the number of Wizards if there is only one School in the UK and Ireland.

The "Hogwarts formula" goes:

number of years x number of houses x 2 (gender) x number of students of each gender per year

which means that there would be

7 x 4 x 2 x 5 (in 1991), which means that in 1991 there were about 280 students in Hogwarts. Now let's take into account that for the last twenty years, the wizarding population stagnated as many people (many of them young people) died; thus there were many "unrealised" births.

So the figure of about 280 students is the bare minimum. Let's say that Voldemort's reign was an extremely cruel one and many wizarding families were killed. If you look at Europe after the first world war, there are estimations that about 13 milion people died from the war and Spanish flu and there were 13 milion unrealised births. If you look at the numers for WWII the figures are even worse. Considering that the wizarding world is a tightly-knit community, the percentage would be even worse for them.

So I'm guessing that the maximum of students (if there were no Voldemort) would be double of that in 1991 - that makes sense as we know that they actually combined houses when they had classes which would indicate a massive 50% decrease of students. But let's not be so pessimistic and let's agree on the "mediana" figure, which would be about 420 students. Now we know that wizards live waaaay longer than Muggles which indicates that students comprise a rather small percentage of the entirety of the population (let's say about 7-10%), which would indicate that the Wizardin population of the UK and Ireland would have to be anywhere close to about 7.000-8.000 people., which coinsides with my estimate that there is one wizard for every 10.000 Muggles. And with that formula you can basically calculate the population of European (and even World) Wizardry.

**** the world cup hosted 100k pepole, the numbers arent consistent across the books, in some cases, it shows a huge world (quidditch league, massive ministry, world cup).

On the other hand, Hogwarts is the only school in the uk with around 600 pepole studying there

***** Most of these things are reconcilable if you are willing to make wizarding society less like Muggle society.

For example, one can say that in the wizarding world, where instantaneous intercontinental magical transportation is possible, big events like the World Cup final are attended by a substantial proportion of the global wizarding population.

****** I'd have to check the GoF chapters that centre upon the quidditch world cup. I'm not sure but I think there were mentions of the various wizards that attenden the sports-finale. The referee was Egyptian or something like that and I believe that Wizards from all parts of the world were mentioned. So yes, 100.000 people at the QWC isn't that of a stretch if you consider that people came from all corners of the wizarding world. Plus you need to realise that Quidditch is THE ONLY sport that we know of. It's basically like football, basketball, cricket, baseball, hockey and all the rest put together. If you take that into account it seems likely that a large portion of the population would be interested in seeming the finale. Plus, there's no wizarding television so people would have even more of an initiative to go.

*** I mean there must be more schools. I mean according to the wiki there are only 8 schools in the entire world which is ridiculous. At least Rowling hasn't given us an exact population number so we can have a little fun with it while still remaining relatively cannon compliant

**** The schools thing are technically just the ones that registered with the ICW. Rowling doesn't say that more schools can't or don't exist, just that those eleven are the only ones that the ICW has on file. Which kind of makes sense with the low numbers thing - if there are only a hundred wizards in an area, with a 'sunday school' type set-up teaching a dozen local kids, then why would they bother with the paperwork? :D

** I like to think that no wizard US exists because the Native Americans cursed their land while retreating from the colonists (just for magicals, though). The British ministry has several outposts all over the muggle US to deal with magical creatures and the remains of the native wizards.

** My version is that the Statute of Secrecy was made law in Europe in 1692. For this to be enforceable, the muggle and wizarding worlds must already be completely separated, so all the obliviators needed to to was clear up the few cases where mistakes were made, not mindwipe entire populations and rewrite histories. Given that there were probably a few stubborn holdouts who resisted the Statute who needed to die off, say they were fully separate by 1600. This is your starting point for magical borders in Europe. Other parts of the world evidently split the societies by now as well, but when and why is up to you. I think that in any case when you have enough magicals together to form their own society they will break away, if only because there is no way to stop them and nobody likes paying taxes.

Early European colonisation was driven by national pride and commercialism. They set up small trading enclaves to enrich themselves and deny resources to other countries, or in the case of central America, looted civilisations devastated by disease and took it home. I feel that wizards could have followed the muggle counterparts in trading, especially as different magical plants and animals would have all sorts of interesting potions applications. However, it is strongly implied that muggle and magical diseases are separate, and magicals don't seem to have the population density to support full-blown plagues, so with both sides having magic I don't see how a few magical European explorers could have subjugated entire civilisations in the same way. In addition I don't see how the later colonisation by the mass emigration out of Europe driven by religious persecutions, war and famines would have happened to magicals. So at best I think that magical colonisation consists of a few trading posts, but there was not the population to support more. Consider though that current muggle population distributions would bleed over a bit through muggleborns and mixed marriages.

The last thing you need to consider is that this is just the starting point. Just like with our world three/four centuries is a long time and things can change. If you want inspiration, boot up a game of EUIV, play for a bit and then use that map as inspiration, it is as valid as anything else. As I wrote in another post on this topic:

Maybe the Catholic Church, which must know about magic, decided to annex Greece, or the British Isles is a single magical nation because a group of Irish wizards conquered England using mercenaries payed for with Leprechaun gold. Then when the mercenaries realised they had been tricked and were out for revenge, the Irish were only saved by the intervention of a fearsome clan of Welsh dragon tamers, and swore fealty in return. Go wild.

** For my stories, I generally assume the Magical World developed differently after separating from the muggle one in 1692 - and what happened in the muggle world rarely affected the magical world. So, Magical Poland didn't get partitioned, Magical Germany isn't united, there's no USA but several different enclaves and nations, etc. etc. The different countries also have different governments, ranging from the Duc d'Orléans in France to the Ministry in England or the Chancellor in Prussia.
