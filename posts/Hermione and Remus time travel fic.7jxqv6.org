Hermione is sent back in time and falls in love with Remus. I remember he takes her to visit his parents and his mom doesn't like her because she thinks Hermione likes Sirius.


** Is this the one where she sneaks out to visit the department of mysteries with Sirius on the motorbike in the middle of the night and Remus' parents see which is why they don't like her?
