  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Well, on one side there's “Sisyphus” (linkao3(1113651)).

And on another you have “The Substitute” (linkffn(4641394)).

There's no exploration of the afterlife in those, but there certainly is an exploration of ... something.

****** If you are into fanfiction, there is no way to not know FFN exists. That means the writer deliberately chose to not post there. There could be a number of reasons why they chose to not post there. For example, AspenInTheSunlight who wrote "A year like none other" had her story taken down from FFN for no reason and very publicly stated that she wouldn't post there again. It was so bad that she even made a parody story about the whole situation. The author should have control of where the story is listed.

******* You are probably right, but not definitely. Maybe the author had a preference for the site he originally posted it on, and was uncaring or too lazy to post it on other sites, in which case he would have been fine with someone else posting it on fanfiction for him and giving him credit for the story.

******** I think it would irritate me less if it was a reposted story that had been taken off the net. Kind of a "we cant let this story die" issue. He doesn't credit the author, he states that it isn't his story and that a link is in the profile. There is no link there and the Authors name isn't mentioned to where people can google if they want to. It really isn't that big of a deal. I mean i'm not going to report the story or anything, but this sort of thing just doesn't set well with me.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
