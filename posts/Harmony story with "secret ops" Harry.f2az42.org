:END:
In the fic, harry was trained by Sirius Black and the Order and wasn't revealed to the world. After battling Voldemort in the department of mysteries. Sirius wants Harry to go to Hogwarts to learn how to socialize. I read the story a few years ago and am having trouble finding it.


** I'm pretty sure it's What *We're Fighting For by James Spookie*.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** There was another which i always forget the name of. It was similar and ended up being H/G. He was basically a weapon, had magic limiters, and the big bag was thought dead and came back (no horcruxes). I think it was less an Order and more a ministry military unit.
