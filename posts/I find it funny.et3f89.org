I always have a good laugh when I read about Harry going to a magical pet shop.

Most of the time he bounds with dangerous creatures that make the shopkeeper piss themselves. You're working in a magical menagerie for Pete's sake, why are you afraid of snakes, shadow wolves, crows or lions?

Harry just comes to the register and the shopkeeper starts stuttering. “B-but it-it's a sna-ke, wouldn't you rather have a ni-nice kneazle?”

Pull yourself together! Why are you selling creature you can't handle? How do you care for them if you crap yourself at the mere mention of them? Or rather why do you try to dissuade customers from buying?

Another thing that is funny is when the salesman/saleswoman doesn't know what the animal is. Come on! It's ridiculous to sell something you know nothing about.

“I'm not really sure what kind of creature it is. This egg has been here forever; it has never hatched. I fear it never will, you might find yourself disappointed”

Bravo! You just sold an eleven-year old a dementor egg! (Might be possible we don't know how they reproduce). So you've got an unknown species magical egg and rather than studying it for the sake of magizoology, you put it on sale.

It might be dangerous. It might never hatch in which case you robbed people of their money. It might be worth millions.

And cherry on the top, there is no set price. “I don't know what it is and it's been here forever so you might as well take it off my hands for 2 galleons”

Congratulations, you just sold a Thunderbird-Basilisk hybrid for 2 galleons. Fool.


** Shopkeep - "Sorry kid, gotta be 17 or older to purchase a pet!" "But its just a dangerous venomous snake! I'm a parselmouth it'll be fine!" Shopkeep - "Sureeee you are. Come back with mummy and daddy alright?"

** Harry feeling drawn to Hedwig by some ancient magical bond. Literally was a gift from Hagrid amd Harry had no choice at all in purchasing her.

*** See also, in order of escalating weirdness:

Hedwig is as smart as an intelligent human, and she and Harry can communicate nonverbally.

Hedwig is actually one of Harry's lovers from the future reincarnated as a bird with the express purpose of defeating Voldemort as a bird.

Hedwig is secretly a Phoenix - and Harry is a Phoenix. And Phoenixes can shapeshift to humans so Harry can have gross babies with Hedwig.

** It's a fantasy shop trope - the ancient doodad that's been there since the owner's grandad's days that only gets attention by the 'right customer'. It might be a British Literature thing, but it's pretty well known. There's even an entire book series based around the concept that I can't for the life of me remember the name of, and Terry Pratchett used it twice.

**** Really? I didn't know about that. Always cool when tropes are international. Literature is the universal language and all that. :)

**** I happen to agree. It stems from the canon portrayal of basically all adults being generally useless or incompetent, combined with Hermione's observation in book one how most wizards wouldn't be able to figure out a (very basic) logic puzzle.
