:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm already searching for this one for a few days...

-dementor or vampire abilities but would learn everything from the person he had kissed/bitten

-maybe time travel and/or master of death

-i think he sided with Voldemort (but really not sure)


** It's apparently not what you were looking for, but you may be interested in linkffn(Shifter by Outlaw Realms), which has a very similar premise.

  AU! 3RD YR plus. If you had a dark fate forced on you, and found your power to shift your form and take on the form of any living being you've touched, personality included; what would you do? For Harry Potter his options become clear when he discovers his power when he's attacked by his Uncle, and chooses to hide in plain sight, at Hogwarts, and taking back a stolen freedom.

*** Oh I answered the other person (it was the fic I was looking for). Maybe it didn't show? Thank you anyway for the recommendation!

**** I did see that, which is why I said this wasn't the fic you were looking for. I just thought it was similar enough that you, and anyone else who is interested in the story or comes across this post in the future, might also be interested in it.

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots
