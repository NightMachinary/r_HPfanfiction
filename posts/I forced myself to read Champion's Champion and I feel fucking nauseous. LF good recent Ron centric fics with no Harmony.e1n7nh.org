** Why would you force yourself to read an obvious crack fic that advertises the ship that you hate in the description of the story and states that it is bashing Ron in the description and then complain about it? Especially when the description of the story straight up says "if you aren't a fan of this go read something else"

*** Because they needed a reason to bitch here. It's no where near bad enough to make some this exaggerated, and it advertises very clearly that it's crack and definitely not for Ron fans.

*** The fact that JKR switches between liking Ron (enough to have him end up with Hermione, who is definitely her favorite character/self insert) and making him look like a fool is so strange. Just a few adjustments to make his arc consistent and the books would have been stronger for it.

** I'm sorry you had to go through with that.

Though, why would you do that to yourself? Honestly, you dislike Harmony and Ron bashing, but you forced yourself to read though a fic that is for the most part Ron bashing with some Harmony sprinkled in.

Treat yourself better, I wouldn't force myself through some Hermione bashing Snarry.

If I had anything to give you, I would, but with my reading habits I would just be regurgitating something I saw on this subreddit. Again I am so sorry.

*** Exactly. Don't force yourself to read awful things. Honestly, the humor doesn't age and it's not particularly well-written as well.

I don't know. I think you'd enjoy a fic that makes fun of certain fanon tropes like Potter ever After. Hermione trying to hide Harry at her house and getting it burned down because death eaters can use phonebooks is pretty funny. Making fun of poor renditions of characters is always good for me.

I also think the first half of Rise of the Wizards has some great writing in the first half that makes it palatable (at least for the first half) despite quite a few cliches and yes, Hermione bashing. I mean seeing the misunderstandings escalate is just something you rarely see done. I think it also helps the author doesn't typically write Hermione in a bad light, so while she was bashed and I disagree with the reasons why about the degree of bashing, it was actually good writing.

But Champion of champions sticks to one joke repeatedly that wasn't really funny. Seventh Horcrux in comparison had a running gag with multiple takes and subtle jokes.

**** I have seen Potter ever After mentioned a bit, but have so far avoided it, +I'll have to try it :)+ I'm halfway through the first chapter and enjoying it so far. :)

#+begin_quote
  After helping defeat Voldemort, Ron finds himself not only dead, but a ghost. Worse, his brother Percy had died unbeknownst to the family a year earlier. Worse still, they've been sentenced to spend the next century together. Will they survive?
