Are there any fics where there's a more realistic reaction to her lack of support in canon?


** I have this idea in my head for a story, where Neville has a talk with McGonagall, when he becomes head of Gryffindor and McG wants to give him some advice that he politely declines and than goes on to explain that he really doesn't want to be a head like she was, because she was always unreachable and never gave them the feeling that she was on their side if they have a problem with other teachers (Snape) and that she wouldn't fight for them those small battles and that made them think they had to fight to big battles themselves as well. And that really hurts McGonagall more than anything.

I really have to write it one day

** There was one crack/humor fic (I think it was a chapter in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/284419/dogbertcarroll][dogbertcarroll]] Fragment series) that had one of the most memorable burns from Harry to McGonagall:

"And that is why our house ghost is Nearly Headless Nick, because we are the Nearly Headless House."

Tonks time travel fic set during OotP.

After Tonks and Hermione find out about the blood quill, they drag Harry to McGonagall's office where she give her canon response to keep his head down and not antagonize Umbridge. Tonks is pissed. Harry just shrugs /"... in the past when I've come to you with things you haven't done very much so I didn't really see a point in this trip. You've never overturned any of the biased decisions Snape makes, you ignored us with the Philosopher's Stone, you brushed us off with the basilisk, you didn't do anything last year with the Tournament...

** I don't know how to use the bot but, Weary Wizard, is a pretty decent one shot where Harry and Hermione treat McGonagall like she treats them. It's a Harry/Hermione but McGonagall is brought to the light a few times.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
