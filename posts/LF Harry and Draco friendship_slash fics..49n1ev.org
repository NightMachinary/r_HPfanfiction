Looking for fics where Harry and Draco are a bit older (preferably not first year) and they develop a friendship through the story. I don't mind if its eventual slash, so long as there is a decent friendship development there first.

It's just so tricky to find fics where these two are buddies, even where they're buddies before any fluff/slash happens. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

*** Yes!! Azoth is so good, one of my favorite HP fanfics, and definitely has a slow build friendship/romance. Golden Age by the same author, linkao3(4787480), is similarly good with a slow building relationship and interesting plot and also doesn't have the amount of smut that Azoth has.

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.

** My favourite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/261823/chapters/409958][Cunning and Ambition]]. I really liked how the authors handled their friendship and depicted what Draco might be like to people he cared about. Let me know if this suited your taste (:

** How about linkao3(a year like none other)? It's a slow buildup but Harry and Draco end up basically being brothers (no slash). Snape is a mentor/father figure.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
