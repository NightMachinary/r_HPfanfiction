Is there a fic where either the horcrux in his scar or the diary helps Harry defeat Voldemort? The reasoning could be that the horcrux contained the last friendly part of him and that's why it wants to stop the rest of him. Please no slash it bothers me when they make someone who is heterosexual homosexual and vice versa. Thank you!


** linkffn(11762850) and the sequel linkffn(12278649) its very well written even though the first couple chapters are a little bit unusual. it contains no real slash but hermione is a lesbian and a different male(not tom riddle) character is also attracted to males.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** /Seventh Horcrux/ isn't a crackfic either, though. You could make a case that it's a /parody/ (though I'd say it's mostly just a fanfic with a comedic tone), but it's a seriously-written parody, not the mind-boggling insanity and OOC-ness that would be associated with the term of 'crack-fic'.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

***** Naw my mind is very sensitive on the comedy / crack induced insanity fic. So for me probably 76% of the parody/comedy is insane enough to qualify for crackfic.

*** I've long wanted something like this. The closest thing there was until recently was probably linkffn(Souls Abound by robst), which has fun ideas but questionable writing, and in which all the Horcruxes are /allies/ rather than enemies. So one day I just sat down and began my own story of this kind, linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stone by Achille Talon), where 'Harrymort' is given control of Harry's body after the Limbo scene and is given a mission to stop his other self, and, if possible, redeem him.

By the way, though, Quirrellmort and the Homunculus couldn't exist in the same time-frame, because they're the same soul-shard in two different incarnations.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
