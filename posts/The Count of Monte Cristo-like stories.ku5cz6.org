I'm in the mood for my enemies to be destroyed through the long and overly complicated means of receiving their comeuppance (it's been a day). However I'll settle instead for reading it in fanfiction. Are there any stories featuring Harry being betrayed or set up, then eventually getting his revenge, e.g. The Count of Monte Cristo?

Specifically I'm looking for stories where the people around him don't know he's setting them up until the trap has been sprung. Also, the more loathsome the acts of the betrayer the better - I'm looking for some well deserved payback.

I know there's a lot of stories where Harry gets sent to Azkaban on trumped up reasons, gets out, then proceeds to do his payback thing while everyone is begging for his forgiveness. That's not necessarily what I'm looking for, but feel free to include those stories as well - maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.


** I've written "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", where Hermione gets framed as a thief and expelled in her second year, and then becomes an actual thief to take her revenge on everyone who wronged her. It takes her years to accomplish it.

** This could be really easily done within canon just by doing a POV of Sirius.

While in prison he knows Peter is still alive. He spends his time digging a tunnel in his animagus form. He springs into action when he finds out where Peter is hiding through the paper.

When he is out he can use his family fortune to plot revenge on Peter and his family. He uses his fortune while on the run so this shouldn't be an issue.

He could also plot his revenge on the people in the Ministry who imprisoned him without a trail. Crouch Sr, Fudge and Dumbledore. These could be epic.

Lupton would also be a target for not believing in his innocence. Though it would have a redemption story for them. And building a relationship with Harry would also be would also be a great arc.

I would read this

I'd like to see more of these. What I usually get is that Harry is imprisoned in Azkaban on trumped up charges, gets out and is imprisoned at Hogwarts, and forgives everybody after far too little grovelling.

** Not remotely what you're looking for but it might scratch that itch: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6827897/1/Shadow-over-Hogwarts][Shadow Over Hogwarts]] is a fic where Harry becomes a Frank Miller type Batman and dishes out some pretty brutal vengeance. It's also solidly crack, so your vengeance comes with bonus jokes.

This could either be incredibly good, or hilariously awful, depending on /which/ Frank Miller type Batman we're talking about here.

** Hmm... Not /exactly/ the same, but Hermione's revenge on Dolores Umbridge in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is elaborate, drawn out over years, and when all is said and done, when Umbridge is humiliated and deposed and suffering from radiation poisoning, she /still doesn't realise that Hermione was working against her/. As befits an AU where "Harworts" is a nonmagical school training the next generation of counterintelligence agents.
