Are there any fanfics where Harry or any character from the book somehow founds out that his life is a book? I wanna see (read?) their reaction.


** I don't recall the names of the fics but... there was one where Snape gets the book series and acts differently (repents a bit I think), and at least one more where McGonnagal (I think) along with others reads the books.

** Sarah1281 of "Oh God, Not Again!" and "When In Doubt, Obliviate!" fame has a short one-shot called "Nice Try, Potter" where James Potter discovers the books at Hogwarts, reads them, then shows them to Lily Evans in an attempt to convince her she should date him because they're destined to be together.

It does not work.
