They both got second-hand copies Slughorn got for them. What if, it was Ron who actually got the book with Snape's annotations?


** I feel like since Ron is even more adverse to doing well in potions than Harry, that Hermione would catch on much quicker to his sudden prowess, and be much more adamant he get rid of the Prince's book immediately, Harry at least had the excuse that Dumbledore wanted Harry to get into cahoots with Slughorn for the memory, which sates Hermione's bruised ego due to her love of authority figures. Least that's my headcannon

*** In terms of relationship with Hermione... things would be all over the place. Hermione would totally have so heavy rows with Ron because of the book, and Ron would be less willing to doubt of "easy good grades" than Harry, which would totally put Hermione and Ron at odds. On the other hand, there would be no Lavender, because Ron would totally use the Felix Felicis before the Lavender thing and in a way or another would end up with he and Hermione having some sort of approach. Now, I don't see Hermione would stop nagging Ron about the shifty book if she was his girlfriend... actually she would feel more entitled to an opinion that way. So where does Hermione/Ron relationship go... who knows...

Ginny might take longer to break up with Dean.

About plot. Harry might be unable to get Slughorns memory, which really is not that big of a deal. The only thing Slughorn told them was the confirmation of the number of Horcruxes. Harry and co could live with "are they seven... or they more..." through the whole hunt.

Now Malfoy is the real wildcard, and in no scenario things end up well for him. Either Ron's use of felix ends up revealing Malfoy way earlier... or Ron uses Sectumsempra on him and there's no Snape around to save him. Lets see how the Dumbledore, Weasleys and the Trio deal with Ron killing Malfoy sort of unintentionally... HIgh chances SNape dies because of his oath...

In the remote case Malfoy manages it to the end of the book... there will be no felix for the last fight and someone important (Ron, Hermione, Ginny) might die.

Also, how the fuck are these guys going to find the diadem...

Interesting scenario indeed.
