Okay, so there was a fic I read in another fandom (Naruto) where Naruto uses logic to pass the chunin exams and I was curious if there were any Harry Potter themed versions.

Like Harry gets past the door with the keys by picking the lock, etc.

I figured that Philosophers Stone would have the highest chance to have this kind of fic but any example would be fine too like the Triwizard Tournament.


** I can't help you out but maybe you could change the flair to the right one? You use Fic Search for fanfictions you once read but can't find anymore whereas the flair Request is used for fanfictions you would like to read in particular. :)

** Rorschachsblot's Better Living Through Chemistry, in Odd Ideas takes a sort of logical approach.
