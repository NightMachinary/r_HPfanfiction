It seems the review system on Fanfiction.net is kaput again. Trying to show my latest reviews on my (now completed) story The Betrothal Situation, it seems that reviews have gone missing, ones I know I haven't moderated as the numbers are all wrong between the user page and reviews page.

Is anyone else having this problem

*** Is it that often now? I rarely get reviews so I don't notice. If it's happening that often, it seems like only a matter of time till the system breaks down completely.

** Yup. I'm seeing none of the reviews on my new chapter on site. Thank goodness FFN has a good automated emailing system.

** I've seen it too. It happens a lot, I've noticed. The glitch should be fixed soon enough.

** This seems to happen five or six times a year these days. If you can't reply to your reviews you should still be able to PM your reviewers until the problem sorts itself out.

Edit: It is frustrating if you can't read the whole of a long review but otherwise it's not a big deal.
