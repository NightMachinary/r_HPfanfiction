Draco/Ginny, 99% sure it was on ff.net

Plot is Draco being a complete playboy leading to Lucius blackmailing him into getting married (to a pureblood). Draco aks Ginny, who helps him out of kindness. Romance ensues, yadda yadda. I remember it being pretty good, but then again I was a teenager when I read it so who knows.
