The reason I got this idea from a random post on facebook talking about an idea for AU with where a pureblood Slytherin is chosen as champion instead of Cedric in GoF. Despite all the changes to the story, this Slytherin ends up taking the cup-portkey with Harry in the third task just like Cedric did and is killed by Wormtail. The main difference being that all the Slytherins (including the children of Death Eaters) then realize that Voldemort is insane and doesn't actually care about their cause because he murdered a pureblood heir (their classmate) without a second thought just because he was there. The discussion than specified that eventually all the houses, including the Slytherins unite to take down Voldemort since he is a threat to the whole world, even if they have to fight their parents to do so.

I was just wondering if there is actually story like that out there? If not, like the title suggests I just want stories where Harry succeeds in uniting all the houses against the Death Eaters some how.

Another request thats somewhat unrelated but also came to mind because of that post I spoke about above, are there any good stories out there where all four of the tri-wizard champions bond and become really good friends? I just think that would have been cool to see.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might send me.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
