linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578431/1/]]) I can't guarantee that there aren't any bashing fics here, because some users have a habit of linking fics that focus on Ron-bashing because it's "technically" Ron-centric :/

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I just read this one today and I loved it! Not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, it was meant to be a Fremione fic but became Ron-centric.

Goes well into his character and who he becomes after Hogwarts and trying to fix his bad decisions. Really wholesome!

  Ron wakes up one day at a hospital with a memory loss. His life has drastically changed - for the better mostly - but one thing is definitely worse: apparently, he's no longer friends with Hermione and no one wants to tell him why. So Ron decides to rediscover his memories to find out what happened. Modern and Muggle AU / No Magic/ Fremione / slow, slow burnIt's no real Ron 'bashing' but rather a real character development throughout the story. I love Ron as a character and I hope I did his character justice even though he doesn't end up with Hermione.
