This info is provided by Luna, probably, at a OotP meeting, and everyone is reasonably shocked.

This is quite possibly a humor fic.

These events are said to have happened after 4th year, when Harry was isolated.

Anyway, it was a funny story. I remembered Harry nailing these Chinese girls who were twins and their mother.
