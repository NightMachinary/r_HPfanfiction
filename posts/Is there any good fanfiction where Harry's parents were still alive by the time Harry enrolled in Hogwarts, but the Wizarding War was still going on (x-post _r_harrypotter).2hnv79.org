** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] sorta fits the category. Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna get pulled into a different universe where your requirements are true. However, in this new universe, Neville is the BWL.

** There's one called Promises Unbroken by Robin4 on ff.net. It's a trilogy that also has a prequel where Sirius really was the secret keeper and everything turns out differently. Harry's parents are still alive and the war is still on.
