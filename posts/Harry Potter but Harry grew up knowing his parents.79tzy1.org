As in the prophecy either gets delayed a few years or Voldemort's rise got delayed or James and Lily graduated, married, and procreated a few years earlier.

So say Harry is either 7 or 9 years old when his parents got killed.

Everything else doesn't have to stay the same but it could only with a Harry that remembers he's magical/a wizard and had his parents with him most of the time. That also means Harry grew up with Sirius, Lupin, and even Peter too... and possibly the other Phoenix members
