Harry must be so morally grey that even Severus Snape, who has a strong opinion of who he thinks Harry is (arrogant just like his father etc) would be like dafuq this doesn't seem right.

Severus Snape must not die

Severus Snape must be a frequent character in the story.

No Harry/Voldemort Harry/Tom Riddle.

Must be a completed fan fic


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8288341/1/][A True Daughter of the Black]], linkffn(8288341): apart from the very OOC Bill Weasley, this story is kind entertaining. Snape is a major character and he liked to verbally snipe at Harry. [[/spoiler][He also won big in the end, becoming a highly ranked official and getting Fleur]].

*** Was this the one story where they got into a war with Magical Spain, and had some sort of portal to South America?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]] was what came to mind the moment you mentioned Snape.

Although I'm not exactly sure how much he was part of the story, he was certainly such a poignant part that your request immediately brought this to mind.

*** I DO NOT FORGIVE, I DO NOT FORGET.

I just can't get over that line. Decent story otherwise, though I got kinda bored with it halfway through. But it definitely did "morally questionable" Harry right.

**** I know what you mean on both counts. I did read all of it though and it had some of the most rewarding moments in it that I can remember. It had a kind of "Harry against the world" feel that woks for me, and it really made me feel it too.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
