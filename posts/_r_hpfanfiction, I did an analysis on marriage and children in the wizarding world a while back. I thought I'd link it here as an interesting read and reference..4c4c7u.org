Does this apply to magical women? The source if for Muggles and we already know that JKR has said that wizards/witches have the ability to overrule mundane maladies. I don't think it's too much of a stretch to apply this to cover things like Down's, Edwards, Pataus, etc, rendering such observations as inapplicable to the HP `verse.

That being said, it looks like this too a very long time to put together. Thank you for sharing it.

*** I know she said that, but I kind of hate it. I feel like it's yet another example of her not thinking through the implications of something like that. For example, the Gaunts are a direct contradiction to that, because the effects she describes (other than Merope's low magic) /are/ mundane results of inbreeding. If wizards and witches can't get genetic disorders, then why are there still consequences to inbreeding? Shouldn't their magic sort it out? The only non-mundane effect should be an increase of Squibs, in theory.

It also makes me wonder why there are so few wizards, since she removed thousands of reasons people die young, and only replaced them with a handful of magical ones. Shouldn't wizards have outnumbered Muggles long before Grindelwald or Voldemort? Basically, it just confuses me, so I wish she'd left it vague, rather than making a definitive statement like that.

**** Oh, I agree.

JKR's stance on magical physiology /always/ trumping mundane illnesses is ridiculous. She didn't bother to do any research in several areas of her story and it shows.

If a wizard breaks into the CDC and ingests cultures of pathogenic organisms, would they get sick? I think they would, but JKR says no. I think she's wrong.

***** I agree. Merope sorts helps us look into this.

Magic can't absolve Magicals of biology/pathology AND Magic diminish with genetics.
