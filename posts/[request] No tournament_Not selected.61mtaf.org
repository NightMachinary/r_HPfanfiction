** There's /Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle, where Hermione accidentally gets in the way of Crouch Jr.'s machinations and her name ends up coming out of the Goblet. Portkey is down, but I have a copy, if you're interested.

**** I've uploaded it to [[http://www.fast-files.com/getfile.aspx?file=134907]] . The site appears to be a bit spammy, but I was able to download the file intact. Per Rule 6 of this subreddit, I have no reason to think that Couldson Eagle intended for his or her fanfic to perish when Portkey closed.

You can can also read a review/discussion of this fic at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54urhk/book_club_hermione_granger_and_the_goblet_of_fire/]] .
