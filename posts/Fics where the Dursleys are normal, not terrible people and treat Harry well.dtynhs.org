Just what the title says. They can either be loving or just neutral but still caring for him without abusing or neglecting him. Petunia or Vernon having a different spouse or Dudley also being magical is also fine.

Not HPMOR. I love that fic, but I've already read it twice.


** There's one called A Better Man (ff.net blocked at work. will link when i get home). It starts off at Vernon's funeral after he +dies of a heart attack+ is killed by a Death Eater (oops. Sorry) . At the end, Harry goes to speak to Petunia and Dudley, and says he wishes Vernon had been a better man (or something like that).\\
Incidentally, this awakens The Fates of Whatever HIgh Atop The Thing, and Vernon learns he gets a do over.

(don't worry. time travel ends here)

And thus it starts back over, with him making a conscious effort to introduce himself to his wife's sister and new husband at their wedding. When Harry ends up on their doorstep some years later, things go much better this time around.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/Proud]]) Petunia dies without telling Vernon about magic, so Vernon feels that it's his duty to provide a proper upbringing to Harry. Vernon's still a flawed individual, he still (internally) favors Dudley but tries not to show it and he is committed to having Harry develop into a good person. I liked this fic because Vernon still seemed very in character to his canon counterpart, but without the notion that his nephew was some kind of freak that needed his freakishness beat out of him.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
