Hi, I have a piece in the making. and it's kind of set in the HarryPotterverse but not really starring HP himself. Can i still post it if he and his emerald orbs arn't AKing everyone over the place? Or is there a better subreddit for it. It does mention the main man, and I do intend to have my characters meet them. But much later.

Thanks in advance


** If it's in the /Harry Potter/ universe, it has its place here. Hell, there haven't been many, but this would also be the right place for /Fantastic Beasts/ fanfic or the like. Tons of fanfictions don't star Harry, and quite a few don't even feature him (e.g., Marauder-era).

*** Crap, I just realise that there are a lot of people who already have made stuff. I didn't know there was a marauder era, guess i'm spending the rest of my sunday getting up to speed!

**** Please still write anyway! Let yourself write without being influenced by common fanfic tropes and cliches, it's rare to have a fresh author :)

** Of course it has its place here. There is so many fics without even Harry in it. Theoretically Fantastic Beasts would still work. As Achille-Talon said there are Marauder Era fics but there are also post Epilogue Fics featuring principally the new generation with few or no Harry & Cie in it or Grindelwald era. I'm sure you could find some Founder Era fics or even Harry era without him fics (like another POV). There is no limit to imagination and that's what's so cool in fanfiction. Heck there's crossover which aren't even in any "era" XD Write away and dont forget to keep us updated ^{^{.}}
