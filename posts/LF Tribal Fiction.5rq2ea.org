  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Linkffn(Liberi de Luna) Not actually about Luna Lovegood, as you might first think, but rather a village of werewolves in the woods.

  Abandoned by his uncle in the middle of the woods, young Harry Potter is sure that he's going to die - by starvation or by wild animals. That is until he's found by Elysia, who brings him to her non-human clan... of werewolves. What will happen when they realize he's not just a human boy, but the famous Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived? [CURRENTLY ON HIATUS - SEE AUTHORS NOTE]
