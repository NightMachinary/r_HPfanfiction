So.........the plot basically has a Harry multiple thousand years old either cause the master of death or some other circumstances and he basically one day sees Lily Evans, James potter, Sirius black, lucius Malloy, remus lupin and/or any other characters and gets kinda freaked out by that then asks death about it and so death basically tells him that every one who dies gets reincarnated it was just pure random luck that so many of people he knew have been reincarnated and so he gets up mixed in their lives could be something perhaps? For example Lily takes a liking to him like someone trying to figure him out......eventually they come to posses the knowledge of Harry's past........for example they can find the Hogwarts entrance records(not canon AFAIK)find out the his parents were the same name as two of his parents and then just a slice of life story of good time .........he could even encounter a changed tom riddle where he's a good guy same with the other bad characters.


** This is not a plot. This is a premise.

** I like this. I like the opportunities you would have to play with "Did this happen in the past because of fate or circumstance?" questions. This idea is played with a lot in AUs, but I like the idea that, in this story of yours, James and Lily did /actually/ fall in love in a prior reincarnation, and now the question is will it happen again, or will different circumstances lead to a different outcome? Will the marauders be friends in this life? Will Peter betray them again in this life?

I also really like the idea of playing with this idea for Tom Riddle. In a loving (or at least less-neglectful) upbringing, how do his prodigy characteristics manifest? For a good Tom Riddle, I feel like the opportunities are limitless.

Go for it! Feel free to return here and let me know when there's something to read!

** So what's the plot, then? The main idea? Do any of the characters have a motive? And why wouldn't any of the other characters wonder if they're reincarnated? Why is it only Harry? It seems like you're onto something here but it's still masked in uncertainty.

*** plus it sounds like this is going to be another case of background not matching the character. every story where harry is so old and powerful has him acting like an emotional teenager.

** There isn't really a plot here though. There's a background premise and some vague ideas, but what's the story? What does the protagonist want and what gets in the way of him getting it? Where will he end up and how will he have changed? What is the journey?

** A main character that is thousands of years old? Unless you are using time-travel, then the world is thousands of years older as well. Can you build a plausible world (including magic) of the 50th century? Or the 70th? What happened in the past? How can they access Hogwarts records at all?

And once you have managed that, can you build a plausible Harry that is so old?
