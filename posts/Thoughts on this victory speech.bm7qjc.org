This is the first half of Harry's victory speech in a fic I'm working on. I want to point out that what Harry says here shouldn't be taken at 100% face value. I'll put a spoiler that he's lying about Dumbledore, before anyone gets grumpy about “manipulative Dumbledore”

------------

"People of Magical Britain," Harry's voice drifted out of every active magical radio in Britain. "Today is a day of great success, but also great tragedy. Mere hours ago myself, the Dark Lord and Albus Dumbledore waged open war for the first and last time. He-who-must-not-be-named was the first to be defeated, cut down after a grueling battle. It was at that point that Albus Dumbledore turned on me with intent to kill. I'm sorry to say I was forced to protect myself with utmost lethality. Albus Dumbledore, secret ruler of Magical Britain is dead. While the sheer scale of his manipulations are still being discovered, I have no doubt that his tragic death will be a great loss to us all.

"He, like You-Know-Who, had the potential to bring our great nation to new heights of glory and prosperity, but fate and circumstance twisted their goals into selfish desire, corrupting the ones who trusted them most in the process. Blame not their victims. Their minds were weak against the might of the Dark Lord's power and Albus Dumbledore's guile. Rather than condemn, we should assist them in breaking free of their invisible chains. I implore you all, good people of Magical Britain, do not let the deeds of twisted men linger. If you suspect anyone of harboring residual mental damage, contact the ministry as soon as possible. We will get them help.”

------------

Some added context: The three of them were fighting for control of Magical Britain (or in Dumbledore's case, to prevent the other two from getting control). Harry's not the good guy savior he is in canon, and when he talks about those effected by Voldemort and Dumbledore, he wants to know who still supports his enemies and who might try to oppose him.


** Would Harry call Lord Voldemort "the Dark Lord", though?

*** At least in this story, Harry had (and at the end honestly still has) immense respect for Voldemort. He calls him the Dark Lord as acknowledgement of his power and accomplishments as a dark wizard

**** If Voldemort was finally defeated, Harry should say 'Voldemort' rather than 'You-know-who' or any of the other epithets. The Dark Lord is a borderline case.

As for the speech, it seems a bit pretentious and melodramatic. I mean, yeah, he killed two powerful men, but the tone of the thing is like Fudge declaring that 'we' have done this great deed.

Moreso, break up the messages into their own passages:

1. Who am I

2. what has happened; the details of confrontation

3. the reasons for the event

4. assessment of first enemy

5. assessment of the second enemy

6. how they (the audience) might react, and how he suggests they act differently than their base instinct would indicate

7. next steps for him, for the authorities, and for the population

8. sum up (for those just tuning in);

You shouldn't have him offer help if it isn't his Ministry doing the helping. If this was planned, he might hand off continued details and allow Q&A with someone more skilled at it, like the Minister, Director of DMLE, Head of Aurors, or some other adult representing more than just themselves.

That's my take on it, anyhow.

***** It's supposed to be melodramatic, haha. I guess I'll add more context in the original post, but Harry's victory allowed him to take over the ministry. And when he says get them help, he really means re-education. He's not the good guy. That was Dumbledore. I see what you mean about what he refers to Voldemort as though.

**** In the books, I think it's Harry who says the only people who called Voldemort "the Dark Lord" are Death Eaters. Also, Harry's never afraid to call Voldemort by his real name, and never uses "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" or "You-Know-Who".

***** True. Now that it's been mentioned, this Harry is too prideful to use a name given out of fear. He'd use the Dark Lord out of respect for Voldemort, or just call him Voldemort

****** Why not "Lord Voldemort"? That is, after all, his name. People who disrespect him skip the "Lord" part, and so do we fans, out of laziness, most of the time. But properly speaking he should be referred to as Lord Voldemort if we want to call him by name but use his chosen rather than birth name. In other words, I'd say the equivalence in formality is something like this:

/Tom/ ---------------------------------> /Voldy/

/Riddle/------------------------------> /Voldemort/

/Mr Riddle/ or /Tom Riddle/------> /Lord Voldemort/

/The Heir of Slytherin/ ---------> /The Dark Lord/

****** Even then, I doubt Harry would have any respect for someone who murdered his parents. I'd just have Harry called him Voldemort, or Tom Riddle (a name he did use in the books, though I believe this was out of mockery). Going with Voldemort is your best bet.

******* This Harry thinks a bit differently. He works with Voldemort for a number of years. He's not the man that killed his parents, he's the man who embodied quite a lot of his own ambitions. Not eradication of muggles or anything, but power and such.

** Firstly: I like it. It's threatening and eerie and I want to know more. Link to the fic if/when it's published?

Secondly, did people think Harry and Dumbledore were on the same side? If Dumbledore was widely regarded to be good, I think you could place more emphasis on how surprising the betrayal and manipulations were.

#+begin_quote
  Mere hours ago myself, the Dark Lord and Albus Dumbledore waged open war for the first and last time.
#+end_quote

This point depends on the context of the fic as well as your own opinion of how it sounds, but "waged open war" reads awkwardly to me. Was their conflict well-known beforehand? Was it really considered a war, or could battle or fight be used here to sound more natural? Also, add a comma after "Mere hours ago" as it is an introductory phrase.

I also agree with what some other comments have said about formality. People referred to Voldemort as You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named less out of respect and more out of fear, and it seems to me that Harry would want to place himself as more powerful than the Dark Lord at this point while also being respectful. Lord Voldemort or the Dark Lord is respectful enough, just like how Harry's always referring to Dumbledore as "Albus Dumbledore."

Lastly, I'm not sure about the "fate and circumstance" twisting their goals piece; it might be more effective for Harry to just say that they and their goals were twisted, and they corrupted the others around them. That way, Harry is still a hero for defeating "evil" Dumbledore rather than killing someone who was simply led astray by outside forces, like Dumbledore's followers are implied to be.

*** Harry frames him for manipulations and such, and it's a bit later when they do battle. Dumbledore obviously had his followers who saw through the ruse, or just refused to believe it.

They were all doing some guerrilla-ish fighting among each other, but the fight preceding this was the first time they all met on an open battlefield with their “armies”

That is a good point, yeah. I'll have to do some fiddling there. Thanks!

I do agree with people about the naming too.
