** The "investing in a Muggleborn" part reminds of /Serena Miller/ and her /Miller's Magical Mirrors/... which can be found in *Harry Potter and the Lighting Lord*. In particular, the investment scene with the goblins can be found in chapter 28.

The author re-wrote / ripped off himself into *Saviour of Magic.* Unfortunately, I do not specifically recall if Mrs. Miller made the cut into the rewrite or not.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  This is smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Grey Harry; Manipulative! Dumbledore; Harry/Daphne

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

**** Thank you for the reply. It is a good story, and I have read it and enjoyed it before (as well as the sequel), but it is not the one I am looking for.
