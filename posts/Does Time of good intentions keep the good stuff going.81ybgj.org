** When I first read it I wasn't super impressed, instead I thought it was a sub-par sequel to TPS. Triangle prophecy was good, the writing was better, but on subsequent reads, I've started to really appreciate ToGI.

Definitely finish it. It's really worth it, especially if you've finished Canon.

*** Good. Im very interested in see what affects this all has on this canons harry. The idea fits in as a continuation of TPS with all that happened in the book. Im also interested how he will get out of it, if he does.
