Just curious. I remember not liking Methods of Rationality at all and this one Harry/Luna fic called Bungle in the Jungle, it was good but I just didn't mesh well with it.

Was wondering what else does everyone else love that you just don't. It's interesting to see how different/similar we all are.


** The Arithmancer. I usually love Hermione-centric fanfics, but I feel Hermione's math ability changed nothing. Sure, Ron became a runes genius and Harry became a better person, but besides the minor changes, it followed all of the stations of canon, except Hermione did everything. I really liked the magical theory though.

White Squirrel is now writing a crossover with Matilda. The writing is fine, but again, nothing changes apart from some snarky comments from the new character!

*** Black Comedy is a classic, ok it takes 2-3 chapters for the story to make sense.\\
What I think makes BC so special is the humor, especially the interaction between Harry and Sirius. That's something I'm missing in current fics, where's all of the humor.\\
Even if you write one tragic / dramatic Fic, you have to come to the point where the protagonist says "fuck it all, iam out" and then humor can start.\\
You should really read BC to the end, it has a very funny and above all unique ending, which hardly a fic can say about itself today if if they have a end.

*** Reading all of the other replies, I hazard a guess that stories written in the same time period as this one (i.e. A Black Comedy, HPMOR, Robst stories) probably get recommended by older readers like myself due to nostalgia, having been one of the "firsts." Need a story about Harry raised by goblins? Here's /Harry Crow./ A story about Harry and Sirius' shenanigans? Have /A Black Comedy,/ even if there probably is or will be a better written story than that one, just not known coz it came or will come after the "trailblazer."

Heck, I'm guilty of having read them all and liking them. But when I go back to try and reread them, I just can't anymore because they're so full of edgy/indy-ness which I can't stand anymore due to a shift in tastes.

**** The gist is that a fragment of James latched onto Harry when James "died," so Harry-James is a hybrid of father and son. Lily had cheated on James, so James makes sure that the part of Harry that still exists hates his mother. Harry-James then goes around humiliating teenage girls for sport, etc.

*** Huh, I would say the exact opposite. Robst fics are universally disliked /here/ and are periodically used as examples of bad, overhyped and trope-y writing. Just search the subreddit for "Harry Crow". You will find hundreds of mentions, almost every single one negative I would bet. I don't think I have seen a robst fic seriously recced more often than a handful of times in the past years. And never without many people voicing their disagreement.

Now if you had said in the fandom as a whole, and not limited it to "here", I would agree. A very big part of HP fanfiction readers love his fics.

EDIT: If you do search for "Harry Crow" I think one of the few more or less positive mentions you will find is actually me listing it as a "guilty pleasure" fic. Dunno why, but for some reason I enjoy reading it every once in a while. Fully aware it is not a good fic.

**** I liked Harry Crow, for two reasons. First, it was the first "Harry raised by goblins" story I read, and I liked the very detailed goblin culture that he created. JKR certainly never bothered to give them a culture at all (but that's okay because it wasn't the story she was telling).

Second, although I'm not a Harry/Hermione shipper, this was one of the very few H/Hr stories I enjoyed, because the author bothered to change their canon relationship enough to make it believable. I always get downvoted when I mention this, but you CANNOT make a credible non-canon relationship by just having them decide one day to start snogging. You have to put in the early stages of attraction, uncertainty, fumbling and nervousness, etc. You don't suddenly decide you want to make out with your best friend who acts like a bossy older sister.

All that said, I've never reread the story. It's quite possible that, if I were to do so, I'd feel differently about it.

It's not strange at all, because a) you know them and are comfortable with them, b) you spend a lot of time together (increasing the odds of a sexual situation arising), c) the longer you know someone, the more curious you are about chemistry, d) friends of the opposite sex are who you turn to in order to regain confidence after breakups.

This is kind of unrelated, but i'll also add e) the sex is usually great because - unlike one-nighters - you both bring your A-game since you have to continue seeing each other.

**** It is true that RobSt and old-crow (these authors seem to be so interchangeable in my mind, that I have constant tendency to confuse one with another) are universally and rightly criticized here for obsessive tropeism (except they have invented plenty of those tropes), crazy bashing, Amelia Bones ex machina, etc.

Let me just add one word in their defence. In their crazy overproduction (especially old-crow) they created number of smaller stories which after some editing (usually cutting to half of the size or even less) are really original. I have just reread yesterday “The Dentists' Daughter by old-crow” linkffn(4571803) and I liked more hesitant approach of Hermione's parents towards sending her to Hogwarts. Or “Dan Granger by old-crow” linkffn(10775872). And yes, in terms of guilty pleasures, I have to admit I liked super-ultra-oversweetened first three and half chapters of “A Different Halloween by robst” linkffn(6439871) (yes, I am ashamed to admit it) ... after Tom missing a fine print it goes down the drain into senseless bashing story, but the start is again at least original.
