I'm looking for a fic where cannon harry become a death eater. Like maybe after goblet of fire he somewhat become darker and ends up joining voldemort? But he's not crazy powerful, just a death eater with the dark mark. Maybe he's civil with other death eater kids and all. Something like that or similar.


** I just want to read a fic that portrays Harry as Death Eater (with no "Harry is Voldemort's second in command" bullshit, just a common DE), and treats the subject as the tragedy it would be, with no Voldemort/DE apologism. A story where perhaps, at the beginning, Harry is manipulated, but later on makes his own choices and stand by them (again, no apologism for joining the terrorist group that killed his parents).

I don't think I've ever seen one of those.

*** In any story like this, Harry couldn't be just some "common DE". The prophecy says he'll have the power to defeat Voldemort, so if Voldemort didn't just straight up kill him, he'd have to be a very high up and influential member. So unless the story gives the prophecy to someone else, it would make no sense. And then if that happened, there would be no point to follow Harry, because he'd just be some random thug.

**** That's assuming that Harry himself knows about the prophecy. In other scenarios, it's reasonable to think that Voldemort wouldn't want one of his followers aware that they have the power to bring him down. And besides Voldemort, Dumbledore and Snape, there would be no one to tell Harry about it - and writing about how internal and external circumstances led these characters to keep the secret would be part of the fun. Harry ending up a lowly DE despite the prophecy is even more tragic (and, as I said, I'd want to read this written as a tragedy).

And I am very partial to AUs that go beyond canon divergence, so I am fine with a setting that, for example, has Harry being a common war orphan that ends up as DE, without the prophecy being involved, as long as a few character traits and personality remain similar, and the differences are explained through character development. But I am understand that some people do not like very different AUs. My complaint is more on the lines that no matter how wildly different the setting is from canon, a Harry joins Voldemort fic always portraits him as a important/influential member, when it doesn't need to be that way.

*** Look up choices on ao3 it portrays Harry as a normal death eater at the start and show how Harry slowly climbs the ranks becoming more and more desensitized to dark magic and killing and getting addicted to cigarettes and alcohol

** The closest I've seen are a couple of AU's with Harry as the older brother, who essentially pulls a Snape and does the whole spy spiel. One is a oneshot that is frankly heartbreaking, the other is a WIP on hiatus for the moment but is quite good up to where it stops.
