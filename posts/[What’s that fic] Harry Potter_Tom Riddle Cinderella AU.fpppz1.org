:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a long single chapter fic with a second chapter added later as a sequel. And pretty sure it would have been on ao3 or ffn. I'll try to be as specific as possible to help find it. I loved this fic, swear i have it saved in at least ten places. Lord help me if i can find any of them. So, first of all, obvious tropes.

Tom is the king The Dursley family is the evil ones

Harry is an abused unloved slave.

Tom begins his hunt for an heir, and invites all young people to his castle to choose. Severus and Lucius are sent with the invitation, meet harry, are interested because they know about the Potter family history.

Harry is forced to ride on the ouside of the coach, and almost freezes to death. Severus and Lucius save him, protect him, and he and Draco get along well. It's got a nice dose of Severitus, and they help him attend the ball.

At the ball harry is found and attacked by Vernon. Tom is meeting all the candidates in an actual meeting with them, and hears the commotion and saves him. He decides to make harry the heir and there's a bit of slow burn while harry thinks being chosen means tom is interested in him, which is only partly wrong.

Eventually they get together and it's cute.

The sequel chapter is Bellatrix arriving, poisoning Tom's mind with dark magic, which he used to practice. Harry notices tom being meaner and harsher and eventually helps him break through the fog she's forced on him.

I'd appreciate any help you can give finding this fic. Also- i think it had a two word title? Very simple but with kind of long words? If that's any help.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, raised and abused by the Dursleys ever since his parents died, lives in the cupboard under the stairs. He has no friends or family who love him and his life is dull until one day a letter arrives arrives for him, written in green ink, that promises freedom. Sounds familiar, right? King Thomas Riddle's illness combined with his political paranoia pushes him to arrange three royal balls, after which his son, Prince Tom Riddle, must choose a guest to marry, thereby securing the kingdom's future and solidifying their strength in the eyes of their allies/enemies. Tom is convinced that he will be able to defy his father and choose no-one, or at least he is until at the first ball he meets an attractive stranger with dark hair and glasses who won't tell anyone his name...
