Anything that has Cruse breaking As a major part of the story would also be appreciated.


** On Wattpad, KMBell92 has some GREAT fics with Bill and Charlie as main characters. Mona Lisa Smile (Bill Weasley) Imagine Dragons (Charlie Weasley) - my personal favourite, along with Tightly Knit (Fred Weasley). All are complete with sequels.

Everything she writes is really interesting. They're the types of fics you can spend the day reading and not want to put them down.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.
