So, a fairly common scene I've come across is the one where one of his uninvolved peers learns what Harry really got up to at Hogwarts. You know, the scene where Whoever finds out what exactly Dumbledore was handing out those last minute points to Gryffindor for in first year, and that Harry's lived through sword fighting a giant basilisk that envenomed him, and that he patronused off a swarm of dementors, and yada yada yada and now they're overcome with awe/lust/inadequacy/etc.

What would you say are stories that do that scene extremely well? Either a unique take on it, or particularly evocative writing, or just a great job staging that revelation & reaction?


** "I swear to you, Potter was in the girl's bathroom with Ginny Weasley"

"Are you sure? They're a tad too young for that sort of thing, aren't they?"

Shrugs.

"I just heard from Seamus, who heard it from Dean, that Parvati heard Hagrid saying that Harry went down there and put the giant snake to rest"

"Ew"

"I know, they're too young,"

No, I mean, yes, but that's not it."

"Then what got your knickers on a twist?"

"I really didn't need to hear Hagrid describing a sex scene, like ever"

Moments later, that same gossip boy is asked what is wrong with his friend, and politely answers that Hagrid got her knickers on a twist.
