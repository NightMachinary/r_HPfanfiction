** 1)The Devolution of Cedric Diggory (AKA: How a Hufflepuff Became Popular!) byHemsonTenths Summary: So for the first time in his, thus far, meaningless life; Cedric Diggory aspired to do something more than the bare minimum. All because of Harry Potter. Perhaps this was the incentive the Sorting Hat had been talking about. And so began his evolution.

It deals with an obsessive Cedric and his feelings toward Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17414504/chapters/40992482?view_adult=true]]

2) The Condition to Tutoring Harry Potter » Roger Davies thought Harry's condition was ridiculous. "You have to promise that you won't fall in love with me," Harry said. Why would he, Roger Davies fall in love with a small scruffy bespectacled boy from Gryffindor? Roger/Harry, Slash. (Very cute story)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/825063/#google_vignette]]

3) Incorrigible Infatuation » AU: SLASH: How it started? One day Harry was in panic and the next delirium struck and there he was lying underneath a cruel-hearted Slytherin. He wasn't the most appealing but what was it that made Harry fall? Marcus Flint/Harry - COMPLETE -

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4746794/1/Incorrigible-Infatuation]]

4) Nights of Insomnia » AU: Who would have known all it took was a gentle touch to cure Harry's growing Insomnia? Dean/Harry SLASH 3 Part Tale.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4825826/1/Nights-of-Insomnia]]

5) Kairos Amid the Ruins byLomonaaeren Summary: Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived. Orion Black/Harry Potter

[[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/65054077?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_348505576]]

6) I usually hate Snape/Harry stories but this is one of the exception. Snape's vulnerability and genuine passion is fantastically written

with great outbursts and lightnings by LilaDiurne

Summary: They stand there for a moment, just looking at each other. Harry has developed smoking to an art form that fascinates Severus. Everyone smokes in Paris, but he's never taken up the habit himself. Watching Harry smoke, however, is strangely erotic. It feels like watching something that ought to be done in private. He wants to say something, anything, but he's speechless. He's a bloody poet, and here he is, standing speechless in front of a nineteen-year-old boy. March, 2013. In which Severus is a semi-famous poet with writer's block who moves back to London after the death of his lover and meets Harry, a prodigy struggling with his own demons.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13181586/chapters/30149994]]

7) However I Fall by mia_ugly

Summary: In one timeline, Severus lives. In the other, he dies. In both, he falls in love. Another fantastic Harry/Snape story were Snape is both a portrait and not....

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3979873/chapters/8932390]]

8) In the Stillness of This House by Paimpont Harry/Arthur Weasley. Anything that this author writes is gold especially their Tomarry fics. I mean if this quote from the story doesn't convince you...

“I seem to recall, from somewhere far away, dreaming of a strange and quiet love, of imagined kisses that vanish with the light of day, of a shadowy longing that must never be uttered, of dark hair and green eyes."

9) An Eternal Flame "Being dead is always more difficult in the spring..." Rare slash pairing Cuthbert Binns/Bertram Aubrey.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7627914/1/An-Eternal-Flame]]

10) Angel Halloween 1943: Abraxas Malfoy is dressed up as a demon, and Tom Riddle is an angel. One-shot. SLASH TR/AM.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7386157/1/Angel]]

“Abraxas broke off and stared, transfixed, at the door. He stood completely still for a moment. Then he whispered: "Never mind, Fudge. Another time, perhaps. Right now I have an angel to corrupt."

  Hogwarts throws the first annual Order of the Phoenix reunion celebration after the end of the war. George spikes the punch. Hermione can't get out a single line without terrible puns. What could go wrong? HG/MM. Slash. Oneshot. Rated for the last line of dialogue and my usual paranoia. Complete.

** Well, Snape and Harry is pretty popular. I won't deny that there are some really cringey fics out there that do a really bad job dealing with the age difference, but it can be done well.

My favourite fic (which is also a rareslash) is "Fate is a four letter word" by philo. It is a falling in love and coming-out story combined with a murder mystery and absolutely keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole 525k words.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422]]

The story starts with Harry in his 40s and having a career as a carpenter. James and Al have graduated, Lily is in her last year of Hogwarts. Ron is an auror and Hermione works as attorney. To outsiders it looks as if Harry and Ginny are happily married, but it soon becomes clear that their marriage is long over. When Ginny gets murdered, it looks like an open-and-shut case to the MLE, but Harry has reason to suspect that more is afoot. He, his friends and family as well as old enemies must team up to catch the real killer and stop pure-blood supremacists from taking over the Wizarding World.

**** Well, this is not slash, but really good: The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga. It is a Remus-centric story where he gets send back in time from the point of his death to the start of PoA. He tries to fix things and succeeds in some and fails in others. It is currently a WIP, but with 300k words and at a point where I wouldn't mind if the author wrote "The End" under the last line currently posted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/49515/Iniga]]

Iniga's portrayal of Remus and Sirius in "Bureaucratic Error" makes a bit more sense if you also read "Darkness Dying" and possibly "Interim", but it is not really necessary. A bonus is that Iniga adds recs to various stories at the bottom of the chapters in TBE, so it is great tool to find good shorter fics.

Another story that I really like is "Blood Magic" by GatewayGirl. It is a Severitus story. At the beginning of sixth year Snape and Harry discover that Snape is Harry's biological father. Stuff happens and they slowly built a relationship. Snape/Lupin on the side lines and some humourus references to some tropes in Drarry, but Harry is mainly pre-occupied with being a teenager and figuring out his new father-son relationship with Snape.

I love the world building and background theory on pure-blood society and dark magic in Blood Magic as well as the complicated relationship between Harry and Snape. The only caveat is that it was written before HBP came out, so Snape has a different background and is portrayed as a pureblood. But don't let that deter you, bc it is really good writing.
