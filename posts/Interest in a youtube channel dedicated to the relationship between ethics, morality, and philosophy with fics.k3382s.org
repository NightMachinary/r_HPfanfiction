After reading The Eyes by Shadenight123 the other day (shoutout [[/u/gertrude-robinson][u/gertrude-robinson]] for posting about it way back) I decided to create a YT channel dedicated to exploring the ways philosophy and morality are woven into the fics we so love. I've got a couple of scripts in the works. Overall I will mostly be giving background on how different philosophers, poets, and authors have evolved the ways we understand fiction in relation to the events in the fics. Would yall have an interest in something like that?
