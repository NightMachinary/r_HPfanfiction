I started wondering this while reading a fanfic this morning. Ollivander refers to the fact that the brother wand of Harry is the one who gave him his scar. I'm going out on a limb here, but wouldn't Ollivander have sold that wand to Tom and not Lord Voldemort?

Any thoughts on this?


** He did sell it to Tom, but that was way before he became Lord Voldemort. At the time, he was just starting Hogwarts

****** I think it depends on how successful said Muggleborn was at passing themselves off as pure-blood. If the Muggleborn in question "discovered" (i.e. invented) some family connection to a known wizarding family, and were useful to the cause, I think they would be acceptable, yes.

Indeed, one suspects the pure-bloods would prefer it that way - consider how Slughorn assumes Hermione is related to the Dagworth-Granger family when he sees that she is talented - there is an assumption that people who are good at magic must be pure-blood, and so for such a person to "discover" that they are not really a Muggleborn but a half-blood would probably be greeted with satiwsfaction among pure-blood advocates.

Of course they'd probably continue to gossip about you and look down on you, but it would be enough for appearance's sake.

Maybe I'm not explaining myself clearly. That pottermore quote says something to the effect of “being a pureblood is more accurately defined by political intentions than biological fact”.

But this is obviously not the case. While excuses could be made for worthwhile deviations, they're still very much focused on your blood status. The fact that we would agree that they'd /entirely change your classification to make you a more acceptable addition to their political party/ is kind of a confirmation of that fact, not an argument.

You were looking for an explanation to the apparent dissonace between the stated pureblood tenets and their application and I gave an example of how purebloods reconcile their ideology with that dissonance--the same way Nazis did. Or the same way any ideology does, really. Twisting the language to appear as if it supprts what you say.

And I don't know why you backpedalled with "plz no offense". It's pretty obvious that purebloods are wizard Nazis and I don't think anyone would be offended by this comparison.

What? I wasn't, though. The Pottermore wiki, apparently, states that being a pure-blood more has to do with political leanings than biology.

While there can absolutely be that dissonance that allows them to make excuses for certain individuals where it improves their position, the only point I'm trying to make is that they're /absolutely racist/ and it's not /simply/ a political movement.

/That's/ why I said your post supports my own position. I wasn't twisting your language at all - you were just saying something that coincides with my point.

I suppose you could say that no one would be offended, and maybe that's the case, but I wasn't /backpedalling/. I didn't change my opinion or position or anything like that, I was just making it clear that I understand and acknowledge there's a difference in regards to the scope of damage between the Nazi and Pureblood movements. Like I said at the end, their ideology, however, is nearly exactly the same.

********** I think the miscommunication between us is that you consider that "Muggleborn" means something independent of the political pure-blood movement. But my position is that "Muggleborn", "half-blood", and "pure-blood" are invented social categories, not natural kinds. Characters like Dumbledore don't just oppose pure-blood supremacy, they reject the whole classification system as false.

So it's not that someone /really/ is a Muggleborn but the pure-bloods pretend that they are a half-blood. It's that what a person /really/ is, in terms of blood-status, is determined by those people for whom blood status matters, the people who maintain the classification system, i.e. those who subscribe to the political movement. There is no "truth" to blood status, other than what social category your peers place you in.
