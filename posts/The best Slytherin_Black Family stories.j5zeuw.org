I'm looking for fics that are canon and don't have the Golden Trio or Marauders as the main characters. I feel like I've exhausted [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] (but maybe not!) so alternate sites would be great. I just don't want to see lot of Harry (time travel or not) or James and Sirius. Honestly I don't really even want to see Draco. Any amazing Abraxas Malfoy or Cygnus Black stories to read? Black sisters also fine, as long as there isn't overwhelming emphasis on Andromeda/Ted. I definitely don't want stores where the Lestranges or Narcissa or Lucius are sad about/feel dragged into Death Eater life-- lets be real, they're evil. Want something that explores/understands that. Recs?


** hey, I don't have any recs (sorry lol) but I'd really like to read some like these, I'll happily take James and Sirius and it seems like you've read quite a few of those, so it'd be great if you could help me :)

bonus for Black family feels - I really like the Black Mask, for example

I'm really sorry about any mistakes in this post, english isn't my first language
