Wondering if there's any fics out there where maybe /everyone/ turned on him when his name came out of the goblet or maybe he was just tired of his near death experiences every year so he just says fuck it and lets the dragon toast him


** Harry Potter and the Scaled Mother linkffn(12606858)

Kinda sorta. Harry has no plan and steps into the arena with every expectation of dying. As he's telling himself he's going to die he slips into parseltongue and the dragon is all, "Are you OK?"

  Harry is convinced he's going to die as he waits to start the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, and looking back on his life... he's not happy with how it turned out. When he receives advice from an unexpected source, well, what's a pissed off savior to do? Mild Dumbledore and Ron bashing.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

** In this fanfic female Harry Potter (Lotus) fakes her death. It has Dumbledore bashing & Lotus Potter x Diary Tom Riddle relationship. Unfortunately this is the only fanfic I've found so far where Harry dies or fakes his/her death in the first task. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13481380/1/Inglorious]])

  Lotus Potter is an exhausted soul. What better way to be victorious and throw a wrench than death during the first task?

** I thought there was one where he was going to do that, but the dragon felt sorry for him and literally took him under her wing. The title has "Mother" in it.
