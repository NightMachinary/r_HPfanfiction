I've been working over some thoughts on a Christmas fic, and that's had me thinking about Care of Magical Creatures, which gave me the idea for this prompt:

Harry has had a miserable morning wrestling skrewts. While complaining about it at lunch, he learns other years love /Care/ because their classes always seem to be magical petting zoos. When pressed, Hagrid in typical fashion unintentionally conveys to the trio that it's specifically about preparing Harry for dangerous beasts/situations.

Could be manipulative Dumbledore


** "...So I'm going to need an explanation," Harry said, his voice fierce. He couldn't believe that it had taken two years of Care of Magical Creatures - well into Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts - before he'd realized what Dumbledore had ordered done.

Dumbledore regarded Harry for a moment, before rising. He made his way over to the Pensieve, beckoning Harry. Reluctantly, Harry followed.

Dumbledore stirred his wand in the glistening contents of the stone bowl, until a memory began to show itself. While they weren't diving into the memory itself, it wasn't difficult to listen in.

"Compromising my position would be ill-advised, my lord," came the unctuous voice of Severus Snape from within the memory. The volume and clarity of his words suggested that it was his memory that they listened to. "Under Dumbledore's watchful eye, it is unlikely that such an attempt would succeed, and the loss of a spy within the Order's ranks would doubtlessly hinder your plans. To say nothing of what information they might tease out of me with Potions and curses, should they capture me alive afterward. There would also be no hiding your return with Harry Potter so blatantly killed."

"Your words make sense, Severus," spoke the cold voice of Voldemort himself, "and yet your actions seem... lacking. The boy sits safe in Hogwarts, where he cannot be touched..."

A small murmur could be heard in the background of the scene.

"What was that, Lucius?" asked Voldemort, his tone frigid, yet deceptively calm. "You seem as though you have something to add to the discussion."

"I... I said, 'safe outside of the half-giant's care,' my lord," Lucius Malfoy answered, sounding thoroughly intimidated. Harry took it that he had meant his grumbling to go unheard. "My son, Draco, has told me of the manner of creatures that students in its class are expected to handle. From the hippogriff that brutally mauled him not two years ago to horrible abominations of the giant's own breeding, armored, venomous, /exploding/ insects that grow to the size of a man. When I attended, it was flobberworms and unicorns. An easy A. Just like Divination."

There was a small chorus of agreements. Harry found himself nodding despite himself. He'd seen how thick Hermione's Arithmancy textbooks could get. He'd take skrewts and nifflers over 16 inches on laguz any day.

Voldemort's musing seemed to agree. "If Hogwarts itself is so dangerous to the boy, then perhaps he can be left alone, for now. We have other objectives to seize at the moment..."

Snape's voice filled in the silence. "He /has/ nearly died every year so far, my lord. You yourself managed credible attempts on his life twice, stymied only by miraculous occurrences. Even this year, a Dementor attempted to Kiss him over the summer. His relationship with Dumbledore is tearing itself to shreds, and the Ministry and the public both hate him. He is marginalized more with each passing moment. You've placed him in check most thoroughly. Perhaps it's time to make larger moves?"

"Yes..." Voldemort agreed. "Potter himself is not an issue. Instead, we must seek that which empowers him..."

The memory abruptly cut off.

"Many of Voldemort's plans are protected by Fidelius Charm," Dumbledore said, mildly, "and so cannot be shared, even by memory. Still, I think that's a decent enough illustration of the worth of Hagrid's lessons, don't you, Harry?"
