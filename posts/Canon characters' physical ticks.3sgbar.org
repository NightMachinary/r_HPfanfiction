I've noticed Hermione wrings her hands a lot. But I can't pinpoint any for Harry? or Ron?

Or any other canon characters.

On a related note, do you have an headcanons about physical ticks or habits? For example, your version of Ginny bites her nails.


** I'm not remembering any canon stuff but I've got some headcanon on how they sit and their posture.

I bet Ron is a sprawler with an arm over here and a leg up there, elbows out. It was a thing we did in a big family-grab extra space while you can to try and preserve it. Hermione has good posture in general as required of her long hours seated studying. Her parents taught her proper ergonomics. Of course, after an all-nighter, she can slouch with the best of them. When Harry first came to Hogwarts, he had the tendency to make himself appear small, as if trying to be nonconfrontational. Backed hunched a bit and shoulders rolled forward. He quickly got over it and carried himself with more confidence.

** Doesn't Harry run his hands through his hair a lot? I know James did it just to get his hair to look messier to impress the girls or whatever, but I think Harry would do it too just as a nervous habit? I could be remembering wrong though.

*** I think James did it as a habit, not to specifically impress girls. I think it was just Lily who said that's why he did it because it bothered her. But then again, I could just be mixing up fanfiction for canon again.

**** I'm pretty sure James thought messy hair looked cool. His dad had invented the Sleekeazy hair potion which James didn't use. Probably too-neat hair was "dad hair" too him and he associated messy hair with quidditch playing which made him think it was cooler.

***** Or alternatively he got his hair from his father due to his father testing the potion on his own hair, and his father had kept on telling him that it looks cool when he was a little kid so that he wouldn't be bothered by it.

Either version would work, really.

** I don't have any personally in my writing, but I've noticed that in an absolute ton of fics I've read involving Lucius Malfoy, he seems to often pick lint off of his robes. At least three that I've read, all with different authors, have said nearly verbatim "he picked an invisible piece of lint from his clothes." Usually after being insulted or trying too act nonchalantly superior.
