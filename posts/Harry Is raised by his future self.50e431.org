Are there any fics where that happens? There's a few Harry raises Tom Riddle but I don't think I've found any fics with that premise. Apart from that, I'd really prefer that it's not slash. Thanks!


** One of my ideas was for canon!romance harry and friends and ginny sent back in time and they end up with harry and ginny taking lily and james's place and dealing with shit only for the new timeline to have harry/hermione which absolutely horrifies ginny!lily and freaks out future!ron when ron/neville happens

** I've mused sbout it a few times. In my anthology, i have a gilmore girls/harry potter where an adult harry is thrown back in time to 1992 and moves to stars hollow anc takes in harry. It's obviously a fixfic since his future knowledge allows him to deal with things rather easily but that's all background to past!harry/lorelai.

**** I've written this. It's pretty much older Harry making sure than all the plot holes in canon work out. Such as how the Dursley's got back off the island shack in book 1, or making sure that young!harry is in the right place at the right time.

Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress and I haven't posted any of it yet. :(

  At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things. Wherein Harry---now Hadrian---raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Marvolo Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world.

** The closest one I can remember is where HP & HG separately travel back in time, to try to improve the lives of their younger selves. HG winds up basically being the de facto guardian of the young HP, and HP gets adopted into being the trusted family of young HG after being found homeless in an alley. They wind up meeting each other at some point. I thought it was a nice story, but it was unfinished and I can't remember the damned name.

  No change in characters from the original trilogy. This is a continuation. Ana and Christian have endured a tumultuous year. Yet they remain strong with their love for each other and their family. Will new revelations tear them apart? Will the coming changes divide them or make them stronger. You may want to read Fifty Shades More and Fifty Shade Clarity first. This is book 3 of 3.
