** I'll second the recommendation for Harry Potter and the Sun Source - it's one of my favorites.

Another "martial artist Harry" story is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Oriental Philosophy by Fiori75). I didn't particularly care for this one, but YMMV.

I'm certain I've read a few others, but I can't seem to come up with any titles. Sorry.

  Martial Arts. Two words that mean so many things, but above all it is the drive to better ones self, physically and spiritually, it is an ever distant journey to perfection. What would happen when a small green eyed child with a destiny far greater than even he knew enters this seen yet unseen world? Adventure, magic, love? And it's all due his cousin's past as a spoiled brat.

I really like these stories and Harry fights hand to hand a lot in both.

  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Will have my own characters starting from chapter 26. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey, strong, intelligent Harry.Harry x Fleur.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
