So that way they can stop being on Voldemort's side, and being with someone else (if they want to).

Not looking for evil or dark Harry and co, if they're the ones to do this.

If Harry is "Lord" I don't want him being Draco Malfoy 2.0, I want him to still help people. No Harem Harry.

Would rather not have character bashing, if at all possible.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual /Asexual (Et Cetra) Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Edit: Doesn't have to be the focus of the story, it can be a minor part, as long as it's there somewhere.

** In Harry Potter and the Elder Sect, I had Harry make changes to the mark... Horrible evil changes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elder-Sect]]

"Is there something wrong Severus?" Dumbledore asked while wondering why his Potions Master was in his office. He and Severus normally greeted each other over breakfast in the Great Hall.

"My mark," the sallow man said grasping his left arm. "I woke this morning to find it was back... and changed."

The headmaster stood from his desk and crossed the room to his potions master. "It's back? But... it cannot be. The stone is still untouched." The old man frowned, his mind obviously racing. "You said that the mark was changed? How is it different?"

With a grimace, Snape rolled up the sleeve that covered his left forearm before offering the arm to Dumbledore.

Albus took hold of the arm and bent to examine the new mark closely.

Where before there had been a skull and snake intertwined, now there was a yellow disk with dots for eyes and a half circle for a mouth. Albus tapped his glasses with his wand to activate their magic divining abilities. The magic imbued in the mark had at very least tripled in complexity, and the original Dark Mark had already been one of the more complex magical constructs known to wizarding kind.

Dumbledore moved to probe this new mark with his wand in hopes of starting to understand the magics involved when the yellow form blinked its dot-like eyes at him, dodged away from the probing wand, and then blew a raspberry with a very three-dimensional tongue and very real saliva that spattered the old man's glasses.

Albus backed away from his potions' master in shock as music filled the air and the yellow circle began to sing;

"*/I love you/*

*/You love me/*

*/We're a happy family/*

*/With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you/*

*/Won't you say you love me too?/*"

"It won't stop!" Severus moaned piteously. "It just won't stop!"

*/"Oh, come on Sevvy,"/* the yellow mark called out, */"You know the words, sing along!"/*

"*/I love you/*

*/You love me/*

*/We are friends like friends should be/*

*/With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you/*

*/Won't you say you love me too?/*"

"Remarkable," Albus said as he watched the mouth form the words with was singing.

Snape quickly rolled down his sleeve, and the voice continued but was somewhat muffled. "After a few moments in the dark it goes quiet, but is anything touches my entire forearm, it starts up again.

*/"Second verse,"/* the now hidden mark called out from inside the sleeve. */"Same as the first, Scottish accent all the words!"/*

"Merlin," Snape whimpered, "If Minerva hears it doing that horrid accent, she'll kill me."

"This is an amazing feat of magic," Dumbledore said as he retook his seat. "But what does it mean? The Dark Lord has not taken the Stone, I am sure of that, what could he have done to regain the power needed to activate your mark, much less make such an inexplicable change to it? Are you the only one so affected?"

"I don't know, and I've no idea how to find out," Severus said shaking his head. "I can't exactly floo call any of my old associates and ask if their Dark Mark is singing to them. If it is, they'd likely deny it, if it isn't they'll think me insane."

"True," Dumbledore acknowledged before looking up suddenly. "Azkaban! Investigating the Death Eaters in Azkaban would be the easiest way to find out."

"But that won't tell us what it means," Snape pointed out as the enchanted tattoo on his arm began yet another verse. "What does it mean?"

** I've read a lot of stories (either mentor or Snarry) where Harry can change it using Parseltongue. It's really not that uncommon a trope. In some it's replaced, in others Harry can only change it so he is the "owner," and sometimes it's removed completely.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
