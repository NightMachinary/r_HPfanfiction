I just realized I haven't read any stories of my favorite twins in a long while! Any will do as long as they are well written and not depressing (as in, let's avoid a rewrite of Fred's death. I don't need to read that a second time!) It doesn't have to be about both twins either, though their combined comedy is always welcomed :)

Like the title says, any pairing is fine but I'm not a huge fan of stories where it's a twins + one relationship. Or there could be no pairing, I'm not picky!


** linkffn(8775977) has a McGonagall PoV of the twins' years at Hogwarts... brilliant and touching.

  Professor McGonagall makes a habit of writing to the parents of her students once a term. However, her owl has recently taken to pretending he has a broken wing whenever the name 'Weasley' is mentioned.

** Linkffn(4562496) - This fic is based off a list from somewhere on the Internet. The story status says it is incomplete, but the chapters are not connected in any way.

Linkffn(6499889) This is Post-DH, and describes how George is dealing with the loss of his brother after Hermione moves in with him. It is depressing at times, but there are also many happy moments.

Linkffn(5549681) - GWHG, Post-DH

Linkffn(2423447) - This one is silly. I didn't enjoy the commentary much, but everything in bold was fun.

Linkffn(3810590) - This is on a hiatus, but it is such a great fic, that I couldn't help but to recommend it.

Linkffn(3624776) - This is complete except for the epilogue. It can be read as is.

Linkffn(6403370) - *Warning*: While Fred /is/ dead, this is still a humorous fic. In Fred first person POV.
