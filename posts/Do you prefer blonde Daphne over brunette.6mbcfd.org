Some fics have her as a blonde and other have her as the latter... I prefer straight hair blonde Daphne... It balances out bushy hair brunette Hermione. Btw what's her real hair colour?


** Her real hair color is blonde. As a result of that, all but one Daphne I've read have blonde hair.

I just can't imagine her as anything /but/ blonde.

**** So you mean Daphne as an "Daphne Greengrass" or "Generic Slytherin Female"?

Because the latter is all we know about her, besides her sister marrying Draco and some family curse if you consider CC canon.

**** Even if it wasn't Daphne, I do admit I think it would have been cool if partway through the series Harry actually made friends with Slytherin and had to get over his prejudice because despite many of the new Death Eaters coming from Slytherin, they were not all bad and Harry never saw that. He really bought into the whole all Slytherins are evil thing that Ron sold to him on his first trip on the Hogwarts Express. I think it would have made for interesting character development. It didn't have to be a potential romantic partner, but could be as well.

Edit: Spelling. Wrote comment orginally on my phone.

****** God, yes! Like the part I liked most about him when he stood up for a mad mass murderer on his broken foot to protect his best friend while Hermione was the one whimpering in the book. His loyalty in that scene shone through the pages. Then we have movie!ron who whimpered pathetically as movie!hermione stole his lines.

******* Well, there is the part where he leaves Harry twice when things get hard (GoF, DH) while Hermione stays with Harry. I think that also went a long way in people liking her over Ron. Especially during GoF I really started to feel some anger at him sometimes, in DH he had the excuse of the locket.

And during the books Hermione hermione became more like- and relatable (relative to their situation) while for me at least the older Ron grew more and more unlikeable (Won-Won, ...)

To blame everything on the movies everytime is a bit of a cheap excuse. It's certainly part of it, but Book-Ron's characterization has problems, too.

******** Book!ron is already overshadowed by his five older brothers and his younger sister who would get much more attention because she was the first Weasley girl in generations. He also grew up and hardly got anything he ever wanted-not that children should get everything they ask for.

Then, Ron escapes from his family to Hogwarts and he makes friends with non other than the Boy Who Lived, who gets attention when he as much as sneezes. He then makes friends with Hermione Granger, the brightest witch he ever knew.

So now Ron is Harry Potter's friend and not Ron Weasley. He is Hermione Granger's friend but not Ron Weasley, of course he's going to get jealous!

His best friend saves the stone, kills a basilisk, has Voldemort's biggest supporter break out of prison to murder him and is then picked by the Goblet of Fire as a 'fourth' champion. Come on!

His other best friend is a prodigy at magic, teachers like her and she gets the highest grades in their year.

In DH, it was a bit insensitive for Harry to leave Ron out of the conversation with Hermione though it is very understandable and excusable. Ron was manipulated by the Horcrux and when he left he wanted to get back that very moment.

Ron is one of my favorite characters in the series and in my opinion, massively and criminally underrated. He always came back when he left and as Harry tells Ron, Dumbledore gave him the deluminator because he knew he would come back.

********* I know all of that, I was just trying to explain why despite all that I just don't really like him as much - because if you argue that way, Harry would also have every right to never forgive Ron.

From Harry's perspective his first friend - that he trusted with /everything/ - doesn't believe that after all he went through - including saving his sister- doesn't trust him to not lie in his face.

Harry, who has never had a friend before the Hogwarts express just forgives Harry after the Goblet, but man that must have hurt for Harry. What more should he do for Ron to trust him?

And that is why I started to dislike him after the scene in GoF, and he never was the same for me again. While yes, he does have his reasons they are just not good enough for me to remain liking him as if it never happened.

Other people with different experiences and priorities will see the situation differently, but for me it was such bullshit that after all Harry went through, with and for Ron, he can't trust him for months and then simply comes back.

Only a while later Harry gets him a date for the yule ball, and it seems like Ron isn't even trying with Padma, and instead is angry and accuses Hermione of betraying Harry (He says l"He's just using you Hermione"). That especially annoyed me after what he did just a short while before.

You can have a completely different view of this, and I know that 14yo kids are sometimes insensitive like that - but not all the time, at least the ones I'd like to have as my friends, even at that age.

********** You do realize that Ron also went through so much for Harry. People point out his behavior in GoF and DH and yet they don't seem to remember that he stood by Harry in OotP when the ministry was ridiculing him.

This was the guy that sacrificed himself to a go at Che's game at age 11(?), the guy who rescued Harry from his cage of a room in CoS, the guy that stood on his broken foot to tell a murderer that he has to kill him if he wants to kill Harry, the guy that knew his faults and acknowledged them, the guy that stood by him in OotP, the guy who still stood by him in HBP, the guy that came back and was the one who insisted to come on the Horcrux hunt because he wouldn't leave Harry, the guy that helped him win against Voldemort, the guy that later became his brother-in-law and the guy that accompanied him in his years as an auror.

Edit: this is also the guy that faced off his own phobia because Hermione was petrified. Come on. He is also very relatable because he is the most realistic of the characters.

*********** I don't think we'll ever really agree over this, because our perspectives are fundamentally different in some ways.

Yes, I see what Ron did for Harry and I never said that I hate Ron - just that because of some of the stuff he did I prefer Hermione's character and that I can understand that the dislike for Ron comes from more than just the movies.

I never said Ron was a bad person!

And while Ron is in some ways relatable he in some ways isn't. I can relate to Hermione's love for books. I can relate to Neville's lack of confidence. I can relate to Harry's awkwardness in certain situations. I can partially relate to the shittyness of Harry's childhood, but way less to the problems of Ron's.

One example: I never had any expectations on me, neither of my parents ever got any higher education and neither did my brothers - in fact, I was teased heavily because I was sucessful in school and book-smart.\\
Yet I had the feeling that I /have to/ be academically sucessful or I'd be worthless, and I absolutely worked for it. (I've been called teacher's pet on more than one occasion).\\
My boggart would be more similar to Hermione's (when I was thirteen).

Another example: While my family was poor growing up (debts + gov. aid) I never felt ashamed of it, not in the way Ron seems to be.

So in the end I have to disagree on one point: In many ways I can relate way better to Hermione and Harry than to Ron.

** Hm...depends on the characterization:

If you go the "Ice-Queen" route then blond probably fits better (most arrogant girls/women, who think the world revolves around them, that I know are blond)

Otherwise? I don't care! Not even if you make her a redhead or give her raven black hair!

** Well, we do know she is blonde so I am operating with that assumption when I read anything that features her and I need an image of her for whatever reason.

That said, I don't know why but any time I try to imagine her without any prior image to influence my imagination, she comes out with green hair. And I've already ruled out the option of this happening because she is a slytherin, so I guess it's just my imagination going haywire.

*** She gets mentioned once in the books. That's it. Now as to why she's so popular you have to remember the idiot ball idea. For a story to be compelling and believable then people have to do dumb stuff or else problems are solved and the issue that creates the plot goes away. In Harry Potter obvious points are the seeming incompetency of adults and Harry seemingly ignoring the return of Voldemort in his fifth and sixth years. If we categorise then about half of fanfiction isn't new stories using the Harry Potter world but rather the canon story done 'right'. This often means the idiot ball is kicked away and the characters 'improved.' Some of Harry's idiocy can be blamed on the fact he's a Gryffindor, a house known to leap without looking. Fanfiction writers have hindsight. This often leads to them picking up foreshadowing and the like and seeing the 'obvious' outcome. To get this into the fic you need a 'cunning' planner, so a Slytherin and since this is fanfiction it needs to be a pairing. Pansy's face looks pug like and she's a brat with Draco. Millicent looks like a troll leaving Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. Which has the cooler name and being a pureblood from Slytherin opens up more ideas than a halfblood.

She's also the default pairing for Slytherin!Harry for the reasons listed above, she's the only choice.

Harry Potter world > Harry Potter Story. I want to know more about the magical world. To explore that we need a guide. The Weasleys won't do, they're too quirky. We need a pureblood to guarantee the magical background to contrast with the readers knowledge. Name purebloods that didn't fight for Voldemort? I think the obvious answers are Susan Bones, who might be a halfblood but comes from an old pureblood family and just so happens to be quite a popular pairing, Neville, he knows his way around but isn't a girl so isn't a traditional pairing or oh look its Daphne.

By this point she's found her way into so many fics she's taken on a life of her own and is the fandoms own child.

*** As I understand it, she is used as an OC who's the pureblood slytherin that can get close to harry and show him a different world. She's grown in the fandom as her own character: the beautiful ice queen.

She's got an awesome name and she can be used as an example of the good slytherin. Cunning, ambitious but not evil, not necessarily blood supremacits or Voldemort's blind followers, like pansy or malfoy.

I like some stories with her, yet I never forget that she's just a very interesting common OC. Unfortunately her stories usually have a lot of Gryffindor bashing and ridiculous tropes (that some times have been done right, after all tropea are tools) like marriage contracts, goblins, lord potter black slytherin.
