All I remember from this fic is that during the Triwizard tournament Harry summoned one of the winter fae(Mab I think) and Dumbledore flipped when he realized who it was. She also had some agreement with him where he essentially agreeed to give her his firstborn

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

***** It can be a bit silly from time to time. The fic is fairly well written though, and so far it hasn't failed to keep me entertained. Narutoverse doesn't really play a huge part in this (thank god), it's much more of Dresden Files later on.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.
