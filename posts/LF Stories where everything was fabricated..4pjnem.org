I read a fic a couple of days ago where Harry, Hermione and several portraits were telling people, /specially the Weasleys/, that everything that had happened was not like they thought they knew. I don't remember its name.

While it did have more underage sex that I'm comfortable with, the idea is one that I rather enjoy.

Do you guys know of more fics like that? Bashing not needed, but I don't mind if there is some (as long as it's not Robst-levels). And as always, completed/long fics are best.

Thanks!

********* Okay, I'm definitely remembering a different fic, and somehow those memories merged with ones where I've read descriptions of this monstrosity.

And what the shit. Not the /weirdest/ thing I've ever seen, read or talked about, but easily top 2000.

EDIT: Dropped a zero.

***** Reporting it is going a bit far. Obviously the fic isn't something most people want to read but you aren't being forced to. If fics were removed based on a certain percentage of community dislike then MoR would have been insta-banned.

I'll take my downvotes now.

** There's linkffn(The Truth by Clell65619). It is an older Clell fic so there are... issues, but it is /definitely/ a fic where everything was fabricated. It's only 3 chapters, though.
