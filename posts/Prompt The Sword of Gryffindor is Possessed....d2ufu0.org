By the insane, overly chatty spirit of Godric Gryffindor. Once Harry pulls it out of the Sorting Hat and slays the Basilisk with it, Godric decides to hang around and "train" his young champion. This leads to the sword constantly appearing and randomly teleporting Harry into dangerous situations as training, making insane commentary "This blonde brat challenges your honour! Slay him where he stands!", and just generally being a deranged warrior spirit. Harry, for his part, just goes with it after he realizes that he's stuck with the sword for life.

** This exist of sorts. It's far less whimsical than what your asking for though. This story goes to some dark places at time The sword has a thing going on with one of Gryffindor's descendants, a grandson I think. Haven't read this since I was 14 but I loved it then. It's a whole series, lots of action sequences
