*The Format*

Knockout debating tournament, 1v1 leading to the final where a champion will be crowned.

Each debate will have a topic to be discussed with the two competitors getting 24 hours to prepare *and post* their arguments after being informed of the topic.

Each will then make their own starting point in a separate comment, one persons being pro and the others against the topic (so two starting comments in the thread). Then each competitor will get the chance to reply to the others starting comment and so on for 2 replies in each starting comment.

After the concluding remarks are finished, but before the vote, the debate moderator creates a top level comment which is for official audience Q&A. Audience members are allowed to ask short, narrowly focused questions at a specific debater, who must give a short reply. Maximum question length: 50 words. Maximum answer length: 250 words. Audience "questions" that aren't questions but rather grandstanding will be deleted.

Word limits are also in place for the original posts to keep the debate focused and readability high. Upper limits are as follows: Opening: 1000 words Reply: 1500 words Conclusion: 500 words

*The Rules*

1) All sidebar rules apply.

2) Any post by the audience before the vote, except those in the official Q&A, will be deleted.

3) After the vote is closed and the victor declared, posting is a free for all.

4) The winner can't compete the next time and rather becomes the 'Champion' that you have to debate if you win the competition.

5) Accounts must have been created prior to this post to take part.

6) If you don't post all your comments for any reason you can still win but will be deducted 10% of the votes for you per comment missing. (So if you forget to post a concluding remark you need to win by +10 on the strawpoll, forget 2 comments +20 etc.)

7) Smacktalk is not only welcome but encouraged once you find out who your opponent is, provided it stays within the matchup announcement threads.

8) If you miss a post without explanation you loose automatically.

*Fair warning that these may change as and when is necessary as determined by the community yelling at me for change. *

*Determining the victor*

I will make a strawpoll that everyone can vote on, it will stay open for 24 hours after the debate concludes.

*Determining the match-ups*

I'm going to make a standard elimination table. In order to determine who faces who i'll randomly stick everyone into it. If the number of people necessitates a by i'll either pick someone at random or put up a strawpoll to determine the top seeds who will then get a by.

I'll announce the lineup once/if 8+ people sign up.


** Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who helped me out in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3iwsjp/the_great_hpfanfiction_debate/][this]] thread. In particular [[/u/taure]] (who, if you look at his comments in that thread, I have blatantly stolen many of his ideas. :P), [[/u/PsychoGeek]] for general help and [[/u/traildiver]], [[/u/MarkDeath]], [[/u/NMR3]], [[/u/_Alinia]], [[/u/Aidenk77]] and [[/u/SunQuest]] for ideas on debate topics, many of which will be showing up. :)

Also [[/u/catholicguy]], [[/u/denarii]], [[/u/kemistreekat]] and [[/u/tusing]] if any of you aren't cool with this (I did ask permission a while ago but life's complicated) let me know and i'll take it down (p.s. help with getting rid of unwanted comments in these threads once it's underway would be great! :))

** I'd rather have judges than strawpolls, I have the feeling people who hold the most popular opinion will win instead of the person who deserves it, which is why debate clubs use neutral judges instead of random fans or the audience.

And strawpoll is hilariously easy to vote manipulate, too. Something involving accounts would be better.

*** Personally is rather have judges too but I don't know how big this is going to be so for the first run though I thought this would be a good way to get people involved if they don't sign up.

***** No, no I think that's a great idea.

I'm actually not going to take part this time around so what I might do is have the strawpoll up to the semi-finals so people are taking part then have a 3 person committee vote from then on in.

That way if we do this again we can see what works best.

How would this rule be in any way beneficial?

Your examples reminded me of both [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAyuhfZ85nE&t=120][this]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO23WBji_Z0][this.]] : 3

p.s. I think adding apostrophes to this would make it much less confusing:

Just entertaining. If you look at [[/r/civbattleroyale]] there's entire threads dedicated to people supporting their favourite civilisation slagging of the other ones. It's just meant to be fun, not serious.
