** If you want a bouncing board, PM me. I am not very much into Rainbow Six, but am a huge fan of the original Tom Clancy Universe through the novels. Rainbow is part of that, or at least it was at some point (not sure about the recent games though).

One thing I can tell you immediately is that the timeline does not check out. Rainbow Team wasn't a thing until after the Cold War in Clancy Canon (established around 2000) and your story appears to be set/diverge in 1986/7. Which is interesting because the Clancy Universe has a very different 80s/90s timeline than the real world, up to and including a premature 9/11 by a Japanse Pilot after they lost a small scale war about trade. Not sure if you care about that though. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanverse#By_chronological_order][Link to the Wikipedia overview]]

*** I think you misunderstood what Rainbow is in this context. OP is not talking about literal rainbows or LGTB, he's talking about an counter terrorist unit in the Tom Clancy universe, which appears in the later Jack Ryan novels as well as their stand alone and many video games where you kill terrorists and rescue hostages. In the Clancy universe, they also attack a Chinese ICBM launch site with heavy losses.
