Dumbledore, for some inexplicable reason, decides to allow parents to visit Hogwarts a few times each year to see the progress their students have made. Harry invites Lupin to come, but Lupin keeps making excuses. The Weasleys try to include Harry, but somehow Snape ends up in the mentor/parent role instead. I have no idea what site I read it on, unfortunately.


** I think you're looking for Family Night by Celebony. It's available on ff.net.

** I took the opportunity to read it, and if you can put aside the really OOC Remus, it's a very sweet story. I went through the whole spectrum of emotions, from aww! to lolz (and even a few tears).

So I'd recommend it if anyone is hesitating to give it a try.
