I know most people have said that this theory is debunked but i wanted to alter it a bit for it to make more sense bc i think its an awesome concept. So lets say that in timeline a,\\
1) Dumbledore takes his own life after defeating Gellert and voldemort left hogwarts due to the pressure put on him as great wizard and his remorse for his sisters death 2) Events play put very similary until HP goes to hogwarts but the order of the phoenix is replaced by another society to fight voldemort (but far more people die in this timeline than the canon HP timeline) 2.5)Mcgonagall or someone is headmaster, snape is permanet dada teacher and later becomes a very loyal death eater to voldemort 3) HP is given to Remus instead of the dursleys by Hagrid and Mcgonagall 4) The events of book one and two happen very much so the same, but book three would have sirius being captured and killed whilst persuing peter after biting ron in the leg as remus was never there to help him 5) Year 4 would have voldemort gettig resurrecting again using harry and maybe the triwizard tourny 6) in year 5 or 6 voldemort would kill harry in his home with remus and voldemort would regin the wizarding world 7) ron hermione and rons “blood traitor” family would go on the run and ron would have to witness and they and many of his friends die to the death eaters/ voldemort (snape could be involved to explain why albus had disdain for him when he came for albus's help) 8) ron and hermione(herm) would go on to study ancient magic and history to fond a way to defeat voldemort. They would then find a powerful and difficult spell that would allow one of them to go back in time a set distance( they are also traveling with aberforth at this point) 9) ron and herm would decide that ron should go back and take over as albus when he kills himself.(as thats about how far the spell could go back) this is bc ron looked alot like albus and he was a powerful and influential wizard that ron could use to build up a way to defeat voldemort. and aberforth wouldve told ron how to pull off being his brother as he knew hom best 10) ron goes back in time and takes over for albus

Timeline b (ron is dumbledore) 11) ron forms the order of the phoenix and is able to save many lives in the first wizarding war 12) ron sends harry to the durselys to prevent his death from timeline a as they realized that the durselys were needed to continue lily's ancient magic 13) ron is able to prevent more deaths that happened in the alternate first 3 years of hogwarts 14) in year 4 things become semi uncarted waters for ron as this is when tve tinelines start to diverge heavily 15) ron does dumbledore things and comes out destroying voldemort in the end

- this would help explain why albus saw socks in the mirror as he misses his family from his timeline (yet he knows he cannot attach himself to the weasleys Of timeline b as things have been altered and they are not the exact same people he grew up loving)

- why he and ron both love sweets, look alike and can be jokesters

- why albus seems to know things before they happen as similar things occured in his original timeline

- why he was so keen to have a relationship and protect harry as he was his best friend and knows he is the key to defeating voldemort

- why he isnt keen to attach himself to ron as he knows himself already and doesnt want to make himself suspicious to himself as ron might be able to pick up on his own euphemisms and spill the beans ( people would be less likely to trust an older ron (a jokester) than someone like albus who is trusted and respected by the wizard world)

- why he never took a wife despite being so praised as the woman he loved was in an alternate timeline

- why he was accomplished at occumency as he didnt want anyone to know what happened to them in the alternate timeline ( and bc those memories would cause people to doubt in him as they would think hes crazy )

- why dumbledore has the scar on his knee as in his own timeline he was bitten by sirius leaving the scar and how he knew what ron would see in the mirror.

- why dumbledore was crying for them not to hurt them but to hurt him when he drank the potion in halfblood prince ( as he is referring to watching his friends and family die while trying to protect him )

- why he cared so much for everyone, as only he knew what it was like without them in the world

Please post any comments, questions or concerns with my idea. I really want to flesh this out and anything constructive would really help.


** This was a really popular theory back around OOTP and HBP. A lot of people found the connection in the blue eyes and red hair and also some of the other points you've outlined such as the Occlumency and eternal bachelorhood.

** I don't want to poo poo the idea or tell you not to write it. If it interests you, WRITE IT. Someone out there will enjoy it, and you'll have made the world a bit better for them.

But while its an interesting idea / thought experiment... not sure whether I'd read it or be hooked by it.

It's better as a reveal towards the end of the story, filling plot holes and surprising the reader/Harry. At a point when it doesn't matter anymore. I'd write a story that was interesting despite Ron's meddling in the timeline, then reveal the meddling once it was done.
