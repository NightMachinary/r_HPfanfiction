Hey guys. So I'm writing a fanfic that will have Harry end up in the past some how. I know, it's a cliche, but I hope to do something different with it.

Any how, I wanted to ask, what's the most realistic way to get Harry/Tom into a relationship, and that relationship will stop Tom from becoming Voldemort?

I thought of a few things.

*Harry still has the Horcrux within him, and goes back to the past with it. This will make Tom be attracted, not physically or emotionally, to Harry. He will think it's one of those two things. Or think it's fate or destiny or something.

*A prophecy. Perhaps Tom gets a prophecy that tells him that Harry is his equal, his partner or something along those lines.

I need some plot device to make them get into a relationship. Because let's be honest, even if Harry did go back in time. It's highly unlikely he would get with Tom Riddle.

I want this story to be realistic and have reasons as to why things happen.


** You could find a way to force Harry to ask for Riddles help. I once read a fic where an Unspeakable knows about Harrys time travel and wants to lock him up as an experiment. Harry has to ask Riddle to help him kill the Unspeakable and destroy the evidence. Or something worse than Voldemort could happen in the future and Harry wants to stop that and thinks Riddles help is necessary.

Or Harry could have lost some memories due to time travel, he befriends Riddle and some future Death Eaters and when hes in too deep his memories come back.

** I think try to explain what would Harry find appealing about the man who killed his parents and tried to kill him several times

** Well he isn't him yet. Harry can see how the horcruxes have messed with tom riddle's mind. Tom riddle can be made relatable a lot of times. A determined harry trying to be independant, would be great. Maybe make him change his name because potter is very well known so he is harrison/harry? Peverell and tom is like :0 this guy is a mystery so he tries to talk to him and realizes that he treats him like a person and he values that. Peverell is just so elegant yk

A prophecy would sound forced yk? Tom riddle and his adventure having emotions would be great. And harry always had this empathy with tom, I truly liked it, he knows what abuse feels and they had similar pasts but tom riddle was without help and more ambition so he went to a insane path.

Harry learning that dark and light isn't good and bad would be also great. So a type slow burn romance with harry actually having brain cellsâ„¢ (you were almost sorted in slytherin for something) maybe a sort of competitions between both !

Sorry I'm rambling well Good luck!
