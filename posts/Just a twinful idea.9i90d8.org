So... I had come up with an idea i'll be trying to write. And I thought- Why the hell not tell others about it?

​

Imagine an AU, where Tony Stark is actually Tony Potter. Twin to Harry. I was thinking, perhaps:

- Tony is magick'd to safety by Harry during Voldemort's attempt at killing them.

- Tony reunites with Harry upon receiving his letter, then later on falls for Hermione.

Imagine it.

** I am afraid that your idea seems horrible, but you could still make it somewhat decent if you execute it well. My opinion may be biased, since I dislike Avengers crossovers.

*** The problem with Avengers crossovers is the scale. They are either limited (only Tony) and become "Harry Potter with Stark tag-along" or run wild and power levels quickly get out of control. Voldemort ain't shit in comparison with Thanos, Hela, Ego and other high-end villains. At some point those stories become "Avengers with Harry Potter tag-along".

I have yet to see a fic that would actually merge these universes.

** I see that happening after canon. Maybe have them meet at the defense of New York?

The MACUSA decides that the muggles can't possibly fight an extraterrestrial invasion force and the ICW agrees. Globally, the greatest Aurors are sent to fight off the invaders - when the Avengers arrive. They fight together, and Harry makes good battle-buddies with Tony.

Tony has been adopted by the Starks, and is legally a Stark as well. Through X (I don't know how) they find out they're brothers. Harry tells him what he did and who he is - and what he knows of their parents. Tony is conflicted, but asks Harry to live with him to get to know him.

I'm not sure what the actual plot could be, but you'd basically have to up the ante with Harry involved, since he can pretty much curbstomp 80% to 90% of the entire MCU lineup.
