:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I lost a fic that starts in Book 1 Christmas where Hermione insists Harry to send Dudley a present, he sends a letter and a book explaining the magical world. Their relationship gradually changes, also Sirius escapes early and Harry adopts him during his first summer outside of Hogwarts as a dog he names Snuffles. Also they suspect Quirrel at the end of Year 1, start trusting Snape and the trio is overall more logical, an have a connection via their wands. The first part is eleven chapters and was on AO3.

#+begin_quote
  It's just before Christmas in Harry's first year. Giving presents does not come naturally to a boy who has never received any. But sometimes, it only takes voicing a random thought to bring changes to one's life.This story is also posted on FanFiction.

**** I liked the premise too but I thought the story got a bit bogged down after the first year.
