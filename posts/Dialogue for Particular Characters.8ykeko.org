So I am working on a fic right now, and I have found myself with some difficulty. I realized I have difficulty replicating the speech style for certain characters that are in the story. On the one hand, I could simply not write them, but its mostly to make the story feel more 'authentic.' So any advice on how to write speech for these characters would be appreciated:

Hagrid

Fred and George

McGonagall (can't do a scottish brogue to save my life)

Seamus (don't even get me started on gaelic slang)

Possibly Moody too

** Listen to how they speak in the pictures and audio-books (or otherwise pick an actor somewhere whose voice and accent you think would fit); then once you've written a line for them, read it in your head in that voice. It's a neat trick and it helps.

As to specific advice:

- Someone already linked [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/swissmiss/HTWHD01.html][this]] helpful guide, though for my part, I find that imagining the movie version speaking mostly deos the trick;

- Fred and George's manner of speaking can be summed up in one word: "banter". They speak fast, cheerfully, and cram in as many wisecracks as possible. Mark: they do /not/ do the twinspeak thing, nor speak in unison, for the most part; rather, they have "mock-conversation" to check on what the other is thinking ("I think this is most peculiar, brother mine...“ --- “As for me I'd say it's downright odd, George, old chap").

- McGonagall's accent is not written in canon, and should not be in fanfiction either. She has only a hint of a Scottish accent for the most part; writing an accent phonetically gives the impression that it's very thick, which works for Hagrid, but not her.

- Avoid phonetic accent again, lest you lapse into cliché. I'm sure there's a dictionary of interesting Irish slang you could use somewhere online, but /don't/ overuse it; Seamus deserves better than to be turned into The Irish Kid Who Says Irish Things.

- Moody speaks roughly, with a few shorthands, but nowhere near the levels of Fletcher. Inasmuch as he gets vulgar, he won't do so with particularly recent insults, since he's most certainly over 70. An easy trick is to make him talk like a pirate (without overdoing it). "Yer a damn fool, Auror Wilkins, if ya think this broom'll catch a flying Dark Lord, I'll tell you that!"

** McGonagall doesn't really speak in a Scottish brogue in canon, does she? I know many fanfic authors make it so that she slips into her accent when she's upset, but as far as I can remember, she has never done that in canon.

As for Fred and George... Well, the only advice I can give you is don't fall into the twinspeak trap where they speak in turns and finish each other's sentences. I'm pretty sure that only happened once in the books. I'm not sure if they spoke in unison all that often either, though they did do so a lot in the movies.

EDIT: To be clear, when I say canon, I mean the books. The movies are more supplementary material to me.

I'm pretty sure the only actual instance was when they were teasing Percy about gloating about his Prefect badge.

"Once..."

"Or twice..."

"All summer."

** For Hagrid, more than anyone else, you can read it out loud and see if it sounds right.

Fred and George like to derail conversations into something more amusing. They like to build on each other's premises, but they don't finish each other's sentences as often as people think. They are often mock-formal in the way they talk, particularly to each other.

McGonagall. Don't worry about the accent. Just write her as stern without being mean and you'll be fine.

Seamus. Same thing. Ignore the accent. Just write him as kind of an idiot. Like a perpetual 12-year-old who knows he likes girls and does like girls but really he likes explosions and laughing when people accidentally hit themselves in the balls even more.

Moody. The advice from [[/u/achille-talon]] is good. Write him like a pirate without nautical slang.

** I recommend listening to a lot of The Wurzels for Hagrid.
