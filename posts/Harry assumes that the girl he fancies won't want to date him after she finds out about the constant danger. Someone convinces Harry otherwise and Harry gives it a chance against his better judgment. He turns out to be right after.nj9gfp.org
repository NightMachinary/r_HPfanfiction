I'm kind of convinced that not everyone is "strong enough" for Harry and it irks me when the girls he knows for like 3 days are willing to put their life on the line for that 3 day-old friendship or romance.

Ron and Hermione I understand wanting to stick by him, but not like Parvati or Daphne or something.


** The realistic outcome. Like, shit half those kids that went to the DOM with Harry probably would've come back traumatized and wanting to quit. Realistically they all should have taken a lot more injuries, too, though...they should've been fucked up.

*** I totally agree. I mean: everybody gives Ron shit for leaving because influenced by the horcrux.

But if you're realistic: most pre-teens and teens would have left Harry during first year after the forest when Harry was told Voldemort is still there and after him.

*** Keep in mind it wasn't random kids who went to DoM. It was his best friends who've already faced a couple deadly situations, Ginny, who has also faced a deadly situation, has had a long time crush on Harry and definitely has a bone to pick with Voldemort; Neville, who was out for vengeance for his parents (the books even mention that he became way better in the DA after the Lestranges escaped and here they are) and Luna who is quirky and so desperately lonely that she'd probably put up with a lot more to have friends (Not to mention people who deal with and search for exotic and dangerous creatures absolutely have a different level of tolerance for how dangerous a situation has to be before bailing).

Harry becomes a werewolf and get's together with Cho. They date and he tells her the truth. In the beginning she is okay with it, but after seeing him turn she leaves him if my memory is correct.

** yea! being realistic, most of Harry's friends would not be friends with him for long. For the tendency to judge the public figure Harry Potter or his parents who do not want their children in constant danger.

Another, these children would suffer from PTSD, Harry had many nightmares, but we do not see that deepening either in Harry (in his attitudes) or in other characters ... I am incredulous with Ginny perfectly well after the possession or Ron after seeing his sister almost die or even Hermione after a whole year going back in time or all the events in the saga on any character other than Harry

#+end_quote

Well, statistically speaking only one of them would, only about 20% of people who experience a traumatic event suffer from PTSD. Granted this data is from adults, not children, but still, most people do not get PTSD, some people are just better suited to mentally recover from things than other people. And given that all the people who wouldn't be able to handle the pressure/trauma have had 5 years to distance themselves from Harry, plus the various selection biases that caused them to go in the first place, I'm perfectly happy to believe that the 5 people who went to the ministry are all examples of people with about average resistance to trauma.

**** Yes, OK. I can accept and understand that they don't have PTSD and everything you say, but I really believe they'll have some trauma, even Ginny (she must be traumatized) doesn't have to be PTSD or serious cases, but it's a traumatic event, for me it is very difficult to accept that they left completely unharmed.\\

**** But that is statistically speaking after ONE traumatic event. In Harry's case we need to accept that even if the chance of PTSD per event might be 20%, he has come across a wide spectrum of trauma inducing events with his friends. Take Ron for example, even if the forbidden forrest, the chess sacrifice and the acromantula didn't give him PTSD, he is not immune to his sister dead in the chamber, dementors, being attacked by someone assumed a mass murderer ect and that is only the first three books. You also can't assume that if you got out of one traumatic situation relatively fine that you will be numb to all the other stuff, especially because not all traumatic events described in the book are the same or simple worst versions of the previous trauma. Also these kids got almost no downtime to recover from their traumatic events, nor any professional help. Maybe not all of them would have gotten PTSD, but I assume that at least the Golden Trio has to be fucked up at the end of the war.

** My headcanon has been that the Hogwarts graduating classes of '98 and '99 ended up collectively traumatised by the events of the last three books to the degree that their definition of 'normal' ended up skewed.

Basically, they can't relate to people who didn't go through what they went through.

** Also, I could see this as being a serious of humorous or dramatic one-shots with Harry and his friends (the Ministry Six) where they try to date other people, but either something happens on these dates (attacks, situations, pressures from fame) or the relationships just quickly become strained and collapse due to irreconcilable differences.

Eventually, they realize the only ones to put up with either the crazy shit or their own fundamental natures are, well, themselves. And they're actually fine with that.

So, Pair The Spare happens, and Harry begins dating Ginny; Ron, Hermione; Luna, Neville.

** This actually sort-of happened in canon, though Cho didn't "leave him" because of the fear of /danger/ but because she was just... well, fucked up mentally from what happened to her.

Her boyfriend just died barely a year prior, and she was grieving. She also tried to have a connection to him via another boy she /also/ fancied somewhat while /with/ said boyfriend.

She became /irrationally/ jealous of the closest female friend he had (which he considered pretty much a sister-figure -- the phrase "bros before hoes" is an apt one here), and her own best friend, Marietta, didn't like him -- and Marietta likely had her own hang-ups, too.

Predictably, that "relationship" went down in flames because of how fucked up the whole situation was.

Years later, during the Battle of Hogwarts, there was a scene, IIRC, where Cho tried to lead Harry off somewhere by the hand? Yeah, she got shot down by a territorial Ginny in one fell swoop, so I think that signaled to Cho that she had as much chance of Bellatrix deciding to become a stripper in a muggle strip-club.

Later on in life, I think Cho pretty much called it quits with dating a magical bloke as she settled down with a muggle, but that's just my reading between the lines.

On the plot bunny...

Harry begins dating X: Maybe someone the audience thought could handle it, such as Daphne (if you use the Ice Queen stereotype to subvert it) or Susan Bones (because of her Aunt)...

But while she really was keen on him, a life-or-death situation caused Daphne to break (maybe internal House pressure got to her too) or Susan to panic and run for it because although she picked up a few things from Amelia, said Aunt wanted to keep her away from any of that sort-of thing due to her own experiences during Voldemort's first attempted rise.

Naturally Harry is hurt and it damages his ability to intimately trust future people he didn't already know.

She tries to reconnect with him a bit later, but she is shot down coldly, despite her protestations. His friends, namely Ron and Hermione, also close ranks around him.

As time goes on and she continues to try anything to get him to hear her out and give her another chance, she's stonewalled. Eventually, she gives up or retreats to a distance, feeling as though she'd lost something potentially special.

Harry begins dating another girl, cautiously, and she doesn't chicken-shit run at the first sign of trouble -- it could be Ginny, or it could be someone surprising, like Lavender or Katie Bell.

She feels a lot of resentment and a bit of self-loathing on hearing that.

Years later, she hears through the grapevine that they're getting married.

Maybe it just ends with her sadly staring at the section in the Daily Prophet that announced it, her cereal forgotten. Maybe it ends with her trying to make a last-ditch confession to him, in the vain hope he'd change his mind. Maybe, despite the hurt she inflicted on him, he hadn't actually thought of her for years except for when mentioning her as part of his and his bride-to-be's origin story, and he is genuinely surprised when she shows up, saying that she'd been thinking of him all these years, et cetera.

A cold, brutal twist? If it were Daphne?

The girl he initially moved on to after her didn't work out, though it was amicable and just a "normal" break-up.

Years later, after Hogwarts, she learns that he and Astoria are dating, and she stuck by him during an attack -- something Daphne did not.

Daphne's views on muggles and the like (didn't care about half-bloods who had a muggleborn parent(s) or others like that, but hypocritically didn't like muggleborns themselves or muggles) hadn't changed, while Astoria's did (like in canon, which caused tension between her and her in-laws), leading them to become somewhat estranged.

Astoria and Harry marry and have a child or three, and they're ludicrously happy. It makes her so damn envious! The self-loathing also comes back, especially after she'd been influenced by her petty Housemates all those years ago. That she sees Astoria with the life she could have had --a loving husband, children, excitement-- also burns every time she sees her nieces and nephews running about when they visit.

But then the Family Curse hits and Astoria dies. Harry and their children are devastated, naturally.

It seriously fucks her up. She just lost her sister, something that hurt her deeply, but she also feels a bit of petty satisfaction deep down that their perfect life, the life she could have had, is shattered. And then she feels horror and shame on feeling that.

Part of her wants to try to hit on the widow too, now that her sister is no longer in the picture.

A whole mess of unstable elements ready to explode at any time,

Alternatively, Harry's future wife or girlfriend is a muggle or squib, and despite she crazy shit happening to him, sticks by him and helps as best she can.

This burns the Ex even more, even if she didn't have any beliefs about magical people being superior to those without magic.

After all, someone "inferior" to her did what she could not.
