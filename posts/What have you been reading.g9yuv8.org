Basically the title this seems like a fun way to get good recommendations on fics (got this idea from plenty of other fanfiction subreddits)


** I'm reading linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error) and linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff). I've seen them both recommended often or in my favourite authors' Favourites or as recently updated stories on the site and passed them over without looking back. I was so mistaken. I'm just in chapter 2 of /What's Her Name/ and I'm already hooked and /The Bureaucratic Error/ is so much not what I thought it would be the first time I read the summary. I'm also following linkffn(New Blood) which updates every Tuesdays and Fridays.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

*** Amusingly enough, I stopped reading what's her name in Hufflepuff because it was a well-written story about teenage / preteen girls. For me, it got entirely too bogged down in the minutiae of being a young girl in a boarding school and lost sight of the magic as anything more than a minor plot device.

** Most recently I've gotten into Worm fanfics, on Sufficient Velocity and Space Battles.

But as far as HP fanfic's go, I re-read a bunch of Lucillia's works, recently. Not all of them, of course, but a few.

** I just discovered The Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe, and stayed up all night reading it. It's a self-insert where the narrator dies and is sent to help a young boy living in a cupboard. He's astounded to find himself a spirit in the fictional world of Harry Potter. What I like about it is him trying to figure out the inconsistencies and plot holes: pondering whether this is the movie-world or book-world (nobody looks like their actors), whether Dumbledore is evil, trying to limit stressors that might cause Harry to perform accidental magic, etc. He spends the first year or so possessing Vernon (it started as a way to get him to stop abusing Harry, but he provides a benefit by getting him in better shape, which Petunia does agree to). linkao3(21500365)

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

** Let's go with a mix of complete and WIPs.

linkao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1628140]]) Do read the tags before you begin. They are there for a reason.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22881265]]) Fun take on the disowned Blacks.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) Fun AUs regarding who Harry is.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16532957]]) Anything by this author is awsome but this is probably my favorite.

linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/404224]]) A slightly different take on pureblood culture. Still very much a pureblood culture series.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
