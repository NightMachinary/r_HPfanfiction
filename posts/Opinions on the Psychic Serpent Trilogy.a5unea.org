Hi Everyone,

I wanted to discuss the Trilogy in the title by Barb LP. This trilogy got me reading fanfics 5 or so years ago. I thought they were very well written and enjoyed them immensely. I held them for a long time as my favorites. I've been meaning to go back and read them over again but just haven't gotten to it. As such they may not be as great as I remember. However, I have noticed that no one seems to ever recommend the works. Why is that? Was I the only one that liked them? They have a lot of favorites, so have they just been forgotten?

One things that I really liked about them was that the final 2 books came out before the real books. To be honest, I did not like the direction the last 2 canon books went and find this trilogy to be much preferable.

Two things that I recall that would I would recommend this series for is: 1. A realistically redeemed Draco Malfoy 2. While I HATED it at the time (emotionally) the ending is a huge twist and singularly unique.

Anyways, if anyone can share their opinion on this series and why it never pops up on this r/ I would like to hear it.

For those who haven't read it Linkffn(Harry Potter and the psychic serpent)


** Maybe a lot of people don't read it, because the topic is already pretty far out there and not everbody's cup of tea? I know I'd never click on it

*** Yeah I guess the description isn't very good. Really it is just his last 3 years at Hogwarts but without canon rehash because there was no canon

** I dropped it after a couple of chapters, and suspect that the people who praise it read it as their first fic and thus see it through nostalgia goggles.

** The PS trilogy is a mixed bag. The first book is a standard 6.5/10 post-GoF fic. Good, but nothing special.

The 2nd book (HP & The Time of Good Intentions) is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. It's raw, full of emotionally charged powerful moments, danger lurks at every turn, nobody is who they seem to be. 14 years later I can still clearly remember my emotional state when I read it for the first time. The pacing, plot & characterization are masterful. The fic's only bad point is the ending, which is, admittedly, very cheap.

The 3rd book is again good (imho better than PS), perhaps a 7.5/10. It does well in wrapping up almost all plot points and gives closure for most characters. Of course once again the ending fucks everything up. This is more of a personal peeve, as I generally view sacrificial endings very negatively (icluding canon), more so when they occur to "save" unworthy bags of dirt.

*** Thanks for sharing your opinion. I also liked the second book best. The whole time you are like WTF is going on. Why is Harry working with Voldemort!

Yeah I hate endings like that. What on earth is the point of me caring for him for 750k words if everything was for nothing!

** I've never heard of it but I'm interested now so I'll give it a shot. I will say that it seems like the older fics, particularly ones written before the final book just aren't recommended often in general

*** Cool, I'm glad to here you are going to read it. I hope you enjoy it. I guess since people know what happens now the old stories can seem silly. I still like them because they have a greater chance of being original and not a canon rehash. I guess the old stories can also forget to add content and stick with the same 10 spells

** It's definitely worth a read.

The most impressive part of the trilogy was that it was completed before its counterparts in the canon series. These days, fics that use the same techniques, similar plots, and same ships feel played out and unimaginitive.

Back then, Barb's trilogy was groundbreaking, and in some ways, made me disappointed as fuck when Rowling's books 5-7 dropped because I'd already read something that was outright superior.

Barb also managed to 'call' a few plots that I just did not see coming in canon back before OotP dropped. When she put out ToGI, I was all 'well, interesting use of a side character, but no way Harry actually gets together with Ginny, she barely even exists in canon.' And then with TP 'A prophecy? I thought that was a throwaway gimmick. Doubt we'll see Rowling pull that out in canon.'

We know how that shit went.

Barb even outdoes Rowling on the low end. If you thought canon Voldemort's defeat was a bit of a letdown, wait until you see what does Barb's Voldemort in.

But as for why it doesn't get recced as much? Maybe most current readers don't even know it was the hottest shit ever at one point. I mean, the series completed in like 2003-2004? It's almost fifteen years later, I can't even name a dozen fics from that far back, and I've been reading HP fanfiction for about that long.

** I started it but stopped because I didn't understand the actions and feelings of the characters, for me they were not logical. (I stopped sometime after Dudley died?!) What I do remember and took from this story was the Welsh Lullaby, I looked it up and fell in love with the song. Can't speak Welsh but I can sing that song :)
