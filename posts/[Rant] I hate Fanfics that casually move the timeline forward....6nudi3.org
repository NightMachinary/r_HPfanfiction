... am I alone in this? Harry Potter for me is so essentially 90s that any fic that tries to move it to the present time immediately loses most of its appeal. I mean, even basic stuff like Hermione being so invested into books becomes ... weird instead of endearing. Is she from some kind of religious cult who shun technology? Or is the author going to turn her into some kind of computer nerd? Not to mention that I'll always see the Marauders as kids of the 70s, anything else just feels wrong.

It's not just about the 'familiarity' about the 90s setting though... it also seems to me that you have to rethink A LOT about the plot if you move it into present time - or just have to gloss over a lot of questions. I'm gonna cry foul if there's still a phone booth as the inconspicuous secret entrance to the ministry! Did Dumbledore still fight Grindelwald at the end of WW2? Or is that also moved 20 years into the future?! I'm not sure anyone who does a timeshift like this really thinks it through..

I'm already (in comparison to the 90s) one of the, just a guess, 50% of the fandom who isn't very impressed by the Wizarding World and I'm unsure I'd find their society very compelling if I had to lose access to all my technological gadgets in addition to all the other bullshit that they have going on. Communicating by owl as a 90s kid? Wicked! As someone from 2017? Yawn, no, thanks. I can just video call anyone by the press of a button. I'm not saying that this makes magic any less awesome, but you're casually adding another 25 years of 'backwardness' to their society. Unless you also invent new and exciting stuff for their side of the technological divide. Maybe young authors just don't fully appreciate how our world has changed since the 90s and think such a time jump is just a minor detail...

Just had to get this off my chest!

Dumbledore stopped him, but the remaining magical defenses led to the American losses, even though it was a complete victory for the British Magicals.

** I dislike it as well. Usually it's jarring to me, and there's really never a good reason for an author to do it. Nearly every time I've seen it, it's usually arbitrary so Harry can be listening to the author's favorite boyband on an ipod while at the Dursleys, and most likely setting up for some muggle vs wizard debate/bashing.

The wizarding world is slow at changing and adapting, so I really don't see what adding 20 years to the timeline is really going to do, other than feel contrived. Like, if I'm writing a fic, I can probably count the amount of 90's references used one one hand, and that number is usually pretty close to 0.

** I think the trend is fascinating. I myself am debating with way to go...

For myself, the.. gimmick of my AU is easier to pull off if I push everything 10 years forwards, but only because for accuracies sake there is info about certain aspects of UK society and law that is extremely plot-relevant, and I have tons of knowledge & data about the state of the relevant areas from the early 90's onward, but I need to know about the 80s, and I have found /nothing/.

That said, I feel that "AU set X years in the future/past" is a perfectly fine AU property, and at the very least, when done well, is just as interesting as "AU where property Y is different".

Fics pushed forward so 1rst year is 2001 or 2011 are very much changed - even if they handwave the backstory (the further in the future we push 1rst year, the older certain characters are - Dumbledore and Voldemort are born in the late 1800s and Great Depression UK respectively, and their characters are very much shaped from that, which cascades - either they have very different childhoods, or wizards have to be able to live longer...) they then have to address these very issues.

Of course, when they ignore them, it's just as bad as it is for any AU when it ignores an obvious major consequence of its what-ifs. But that's neither here nor their.

***** Most of that would definitely go under 'relevant only to trained professionals and people with autism', but for the general awareness, I can tell you that it was crap. IME, people were generally not aware of autism at all, unless directly involved, until 1988 when Rain Man came out, at which point, he's their (our) reference point for what autism is.

Aspergers became more generally known with the rise of the internet.

I worked for a disability charity in the early 2000s, and then people were still very much unaware of autism, beyond the 'autistic savant' stereotype. I, myself, became very rapidly educated, which is how I came to understand how poor the general understanding was.

Among educators, for special needs children, [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarah_Helps/publication/245772219_AutismThe_Teacher%27s_View/links/5655ee1d08aeafc2aabedc7c.pdf][this paper]] gives an oversight which shows that awareness among teachers in 1987 wasn't great either. Assume that for most things, attitudes are slow to change and the main /new/ concern for teachers at that time was educating children about AIDS and HIV.

At some point there was a move from teaching children with special needs in special schools, to giving direct support within a normal classroom. I can state absolutely that this move was /after/ 1989, and would have been slow, so someone in primary school from 1985-1991 would probably not expect to meet an autistic child unless they were high-functioning, at which point the label would be more likely to be 'weirdo' than 'autistic' or 'a child with Aspergers'. A close friend of the child would likely know.

There definitely had been a strong move to place children with special needs in normal classrooms by 2003 and it had been going on for some time, I just don't know when.

I can't answer at all as to specific services in Surrey in the 1980s-2000s, sorry, but I expect that's not a surprise.

As for Dumbledore? Being born 10 years laters doesn't make that much of a difference here, should you decide to go down that road...not that you need to! (He would still grow up so that he can kind of witness WW1 and WW2 and he can still meet and fight Grindelwald etc.)...for Voldemort it kind of would change things a little, but then again: You don't need to change him, he's immortal!)

Basically, although the 10-year effects are minimal, you must concede that there is /some/ number of years such that an AU taking place that far in the future is extremely changed in its properties from canon.

  Even nowadays I still read a lot of books for university in physical form, or did for school in general. So saying Hermione shuns technology is being very prejudiced from your part. Obviously I use the internet for a lot of stuff, but I cannot do anything I do without books in physical form and A LOT of my fellow students also use physical books. As I said, that comment is very biased.
#+end_quote

I think you're reading much more into my comment than I intended to say... of course books are still relevant, but I think everyone's perspective on books and libraries shifted a lot with the advent of the information age. Hermione isn't a scholar in some specialised research field, libraries and books are her window into the world... she'd soak up Wikipedia and be much less impressed by a physical library in terms of scope.

Edit: Oh, and since you like to talk about academia: I can't even imagine what it would be like not having millions of papers and full-text search over most of them at my fingertips 24/7. It's insane!

#+begin_quote
  It can become so much work, that people simply up the timeline and have less work to do. If they do it for free, why should I complain? Nobody forces me to read it.
#+end_quote

Sure, I understand those reasons. So I guess since Latin is hard authors should just make up their own spell names in english right? Who cares about immersing themselves into the world they are writiing about? Why bother with getting the character names right?

#+begin_quote
  Thus the only thing that might change is more muggle stuff being modified by magicians, like Arthur or Sirius did with their respective vehicles, car and motorcycle. But I doubt there would be any advancement from the magical part itself.
#+end_quote

The information age in the muggle world poses a huge challenge for their society. There's certainly potential in coming up with solutions on how they can incorporate those advancements, but it's a tall order and most authors don't even bother... I mean even one of the coolest invention of the magical world (Pensieve) is becoming less and less cool with the rapid pace of VR technology...

**** Your edit about having millions of papers available makes me think that your exposure to academia has been in science-related fields only. I did my BA in English Literature (and I'm currently finishing a Master's in a related field), and I can /guarantee/ you that it is next-to-impossible to find sufficiently detailed web resources for this kind of thing. And my thesis involved 20th-century stuff, which isn't even that old. The fact is that while scientific papers were converted to PDFs and made linkable and so on by their publishers/journals, this has not been the case in the vast majority of humanities-related fields. And no, Wikipedia does /not/ have the answers you need. Sometimes Wikipedia isn't even correct, because the sources are all on paper and Wikipedia can't find them to begin with.

So even if you /did/ time-shift wizarding society 20 or 30 or 50 years forward, there's no way the kinds of resources Hermione wants and needs would be available digitally (since texts would have had no reason to be digitized, and wizarding culture is notoriously slow with tech anyway).

***** You're right... I actually had a short stint in the humanities (Philosophy) and while I greatly enjoyed the content, the format felt *incredibly* backwards to me and I was constantly astounded. I kid you not, the main teaching method of the professors at the faculties still revolved around *photocopies*! It was kinda endearing and made me nostalgic about my childhood, but it was all kinds of ridiculous to have to make copies of hundreds of pages of photocopy templates... It's not really an admirable quality to be so incredibly technologically retarded and I honestly felt bad about wasting so much paper.

Oh and I know for a fact that full-text search would be just as useful in the humanities, they are just set in their ways, but it really made me shake my head observing professors searching for a reference by flipping pages for 5 minutes on multiple occasions. What a waste!

At worst I'll cringe when the characters research something on a computer and I'll leave a review: "Hey, FYI, the internet as we know it wasn't really a thing at the beginning of the 90s"

I'm currently writing a self-insert when I'm magically transported into the HP universe in 1990. And the whole research-part is actually incredibly fun, yet not always easy.

For example, try finding the pricing for the London tube in 1990 for an 11 year old (Best I could do was 2000 and extrapolate using inflation). How much pocket money would an 11 year old in orphanage in 1990 get? (I only found a source how a German state did it back then, I converted that to pounds)

And all the surprising stuff I come actross is going to be a fun for my main character as well. For example with the internet. It's a self-insert so the character has the information of a CS student in his 3rd semester - but I never conciously realized that the internet was invented in 1989 so they won't either. I'm really thinking about having my character go out of his way find a computer at some library or office and then notice that it's still 5 years till Google.

** Imo the idea seems quite interesting, although in that case the author has to go pretty AU, and address the issues you brought up.

For example have Dumbledore die due to old age, Harrys magical forehead stuns Voldemort shortly afterwards, making Potter an even greater hero since before that all hope was lost.

Due to advancement of tech and surveillance and ministrys incompetence at dealing with it, perhaps the Unspeakables launch a coup and start cracking down on any breaches to the statue of secrecy, which in return causes discontent among purebloods. So when Voldemort makes a comeback he has more support but also greater opposition and as two sides war the veil of secrecy around the Wizarding World starts to crumble..

So basically my point is that moving things to a later date could be very interesting. It's a shame that thus far such a thing is only done so Harry could do canon while listening to modern music...

I've had to double check myself multiple times to remove modern pop culture references (I even wanted to reference The Blair Witch Project once, but I had to restrain myself as that was after 94/95, as well as keeping Quentin Tarantino movie nanedrops to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. I've also stuck to song titles as chapter titles from music that has only been released before 94/95 as well, which hasn't been a problem.

It always annoys me when I see pop culture references for modern 21st century stuff too especially in fics that take place in the 90s. Moving the timeline a few years forward most of the time feels lazy.

I think the big paradigm shift that's hard to grasp for most people is the huge, huge change in mobile phone technology. No, someone living in 1991 probably didn't have a mobile phone. Yes, they existed. But still, any given character didn't have one unless they had a /reason/ to have one. They had pagers (bleepers) and used land lines and phone boxes.

I'm sorry but I have a hard time believing that. What could you have possibly researched for school on BBSs and maling lists?

******* Well, for one, the Internet wasn't either of those things.

I was an active BBS user as far back as 1992 as well. However, our school and local libraries had connections to Usenet. Fidonet was also a thing for sending messages to colleges. Finally, we had a CompuServe subscription both at school and in my house, which had active Internet, paid by the hour.

Just because you don't know about a thing doesn't mean that it isn't a thing. Channel some Luna Lovegood.

***** I guess. It's your world as long as you can make it internally consistent (why is there no Wikipedia? Why no digitized books? Seems like you're hand-waving problems away - but I always give authors credit when they at least acknowledge problems in such a way even if they can't make them go away)

** And now i want to read/write a story with a sarah connor chronicles time jump in it.

Hermione is a golem, sent back to protect harry. She then initiates a jump forward in time because riddle won't be looking for a harry that's still seventeen(ignoring horcruxes for this idea I think).

Edit: actually, i already did kinda do something like this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/7/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]]

** Eh i really, really dont care. Im not one of those fanfiction readers who analyzes the fanfic put infront of me, if i like it i like it and keep reading, its that simple.

Moving the timeline forward is an insignificant thing in my eyes and just doesnt matter to me, especially since the only times i usually see it comes from fics where Harry interacts more with technology usually as some form of crossover. And as for the Hermione book thing i just read it as nerdyness itself, books, computers, whatever it all fits in just fine.

** Agreed. I think part of the charm of the HPverse is that Harry is relatively far away from modern-day, and the narration of the story suggests that it's a telling of the past, probably through older Harry's own POV (though the wording catches up to more present tense during Book Four, so idk).

** 'My Immortal' nails this perfectly. Honestly, it's the best fanfiction in existence to this day.

PS: it's a troll, right?

** Thats why I love AU fics where you tell other people's stories in the same world as HP, but without HP. The AQ series is pretty much perfect in that regard.

** I agree, in fact I don't like it when they change the timeline at all. I read one that was taking place in the 1980s instead and it just felt wrong.
