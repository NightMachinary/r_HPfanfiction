Has anyone ever done this? l've been watching a lot of How I Met Your Mother reruns recently and Lily Aldrin fits a lot of the headcanons I have of Lily Potter. I like the idea of a crossover fic where Lily or James is living as a character from another series. I know there's a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover like that.


** Link to the pirates one ?

  When Harry and Hermione's visit to Godric's Hollow goes terribly wrong, they escape into a parallel world where greed and rancor rekindle an old war for the mastery of the sea. And it so happens someone they thought dead crossed too, long before they did.
