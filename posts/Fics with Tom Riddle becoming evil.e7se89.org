I am looking for fics set during Tom Riddle's school days that show how he became Lord Voldemort. Ideally, I am looking for something where he is not a complete psychopath from the very start and his motives are a bit more complex.

Preferences: No time travel please. Tied in with that, no Tom Riddle/Golden Trio pairings. Shame that I am not in to those plots, because he's my favorite character to write and to read, but these two remove a good chunk of stories.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3198890][good friends]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/anotherbuskitten/pseuds/anotherbuskitten][anotherbuskitten]] is one with Tom having a friendship with Hagrid before the whole chamber thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/932445][Green Apple]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tumblewaltz/pseuds/tumblewaltz][tumblewaltz]] is a genderswap that doesn't really change much with said swap. Essentially a Tom Riddle character study with the added cultural biases of being a girl in the WWII era.

I can't really think of any others like that without some form of time travel. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293][Realignment]] might be something you like just because the character who time travel is just an antagonist and not really a main character. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] is probably the most in depth exploration of a Tom Riddle that doesn't start out evil, but it's extremely time travel (and quite dark), although there are no romantic relationships.
