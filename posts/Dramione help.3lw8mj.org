I am looking for a specific dramione fanfiction that was published YEARS ago. I wish I could remember what year exactly, as that might help. Anyways. I don't remember everything about it, just some specific things. I remember that draco and hermione were (forced?) to live together. NOT A MARRIAGE LAW FIC. I don't remember the reason for it. Anyways it was like.. in a cabin or something? (I have checked out the fanfiction "The Cabin", it's not that.)

Also one other thing I remember is that at one point, Draco accidentally walks in on a naked hermione, who is about to take a shower.

That's all I remember. I never got to finish the stupid fanfiction and I'm really sad about it.


** I believe it was written around 2010-2012. Not 100 percent but like 50 percent sure.

** I don't know what fic you're talking about, but in case no one else has an answer either I do have a suggestion. There is a /very/ active tumblr for dramione that's great for requests like this: [[http://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/]]

Their tag system is also great for finding stories with themes you like that you haven't read yet.

** linkffn(6291747) had a plotline similar to what you're asking after, and from memory I /think/ there may have been a scene where he walks in on her.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

** Could it have been a head boy/girl fic with the shared dorm? This was some of the first fanfic I read and Draco walked in on hermione a lot in those.
