** Realistically... I don't think he'd stop calling muggleborns "mudbloods" or the Weasleys "Blood-Traitors." Draco's not an orphan, and i'm sure his parents would still love him if he were sorted into Gryffindor ( maybe he'd transfer to Durmstrang?) Lucius and Arthur still have their feud, and Molly doesn't like the Malfoys, so I don't think she'd be knitting him a sweater any time soon. I don't think Draco would get bullied much either. In the first book, Pansy Parkinson seems to be on good terms/knows Parvati Patil, who is in Gryffindor. Houses don't seem to mean nearly as much as in canon as they do in most fanfiction.

Just my two cents

**** I think he would just transfer to Durmstrang, since he wanted to go there anyway. If for some reason he stayed, he would probably ignore all of his housemates, and/or make fun of them, at least for the first year. Perhaps long-term exposure to Gryffindors, who generally are perfectly fine with muggleborns and hate the pureblood supremacy stuff would soften his heart a bit. But he still has outside pressure from his parents/friends he had before getting sorted into Gryffindor to pull him back. Even so, if Draco's parents figure out that he's being influenced, they'd pull him out of Hogwarts.

** I don't want to spoil it... but Snape and Narcissa conspire to change Draco's personality and make him into a Gryffindor in the Innocent series! The story is about Sirius kidnapping and adopting Harry when he's 8 years old instead of in third year, and a lot changes based on that. I don't think Hogwarts happens until the second installment of the series though you do meet Draco in the first one. The whole thing is excellent and I suggest you check it out if you want some adorable Draco & trio interactions, plus some great mentor Snape!

Draco's internal conflict with his upbringing and father vs. the new people he meets and ideas he comes across is really well done. I think he's my favorite character in the whole story (and I'm usually not a Draco fan!).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkffn(Living with Danger)

Is probably the closest I can think of but it's dramatically AU.

(Also has 4 complete sequels and tops 2 million words across the series)

*** This is pretty good. A bit overly long, a lot of the dramatic tension in the plot feels forced, but the characters are enjoyable, if slightly overpowered. (May I also recommend linkffn(Be Careful)? It's a post-6th year Draco hops to an alternate universe fic, but it's a bit better IMHO than the main Dangerverse.)

  It never once occurred to him, that his lifelong wish to be granted. The unspoken rhythm, her lips never cease to create. Events had abruptly taken sudden twists, as to how little red starts to look out for the wolf. ('Supposed' description inside! Too much chars for this box to handle! I guess! Waha)

Yup. That would be the start of the 'sexual tension' between them. Instead of 'scared Potter?'
