Does anyone here have any recommendations for story that explore the traditional/pure blood side of society, especially religion, nobility, or social customs?


** /The Best Revenge/ by /Arsinoe De Blassenville/ ends up with a Hogwarts club headed by the Muggle Studies teacher where most of the first years get together to explore the traditions and customs of the wizarding world.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** I've created a pureblood society in Patron covering religion and social customs, though it is an AU - a society that split from the muggle one in 1692, and developed differently. Not just "Old England with a few spells and Quidditch", but far more magical/fantastical, with magic used far more than in canon, and customs that are sometimes more archaic, sometimes far more progressive than muggle ones. Also a society where custom and social pressure change how archaic laws are enforced, and where there are different cultures outside the mainstream one as well. Needless to say, the other magical countries - France, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, Jamaica and Scandinavia are covered in various depth - have different customs as well. Religion-wise, the wizards "went back" to pagan gods after splitting, in response to the christian witch hunts, but that means that they reconstructed in the 18th century what they thought was the pagan faith of their ancestors pre-christianisation. Not that most of them are particularly religious anyway, even though they celebrate the rituals.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Currently on a hiatus.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Very AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and dark magic. Sadly dead.

Ffnbot!directlinks

From the things that others mentioned: Perfectly Normal is ridden with all the usual bad cliches, Patron is terribly written and Claw of the Raven is both.

On the Wings of a Phoenix has many problems (like handling of Dumbledore), but is a interesting read regardless.
