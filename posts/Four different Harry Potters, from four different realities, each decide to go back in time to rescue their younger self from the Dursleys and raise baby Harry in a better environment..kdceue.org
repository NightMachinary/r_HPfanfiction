However, all four of them end up in the same past. And because of how radically different each of them are (in part due to each of them having ended up in all of the four Hogwarts Houses between them), they have wildly different ideas on how baby Harry should be raised. Bonus points if one of them is a recovering former dark wizard, and /not/ the one everybody would suspect is.

** Okay, the chaos about raising Harry between the four of them would be funny enough. But what if there were other things that changed in the different universes too. Like, after they figured the basics out, Gryffindor Harry says: "We have to free Sirius."

And it turns out the Potters weren't all betrayed by Pettigrew.

In one universe it was actually Sirius who betrayed them - because he was actually the spy (maybe taking the dark mark to save his little brother, because in that universe the abuse of their mother bound them together instead of driving them apart) and in another universe it was Remus who betrayed them (maybe because after everyone already though he was a traitor and to be sold out to the ministry he run to the werewolfes for help). In one universe there was actually a evil!Dumbledore who tried to only use Harry and even enhanced the abusive ways of the Dursleys to break him. Now they have the problem to figure out who is an ally and who is a danger for little Harry.

I like time travel fics but after awhile it just gets kinda boring cause you already know what's going to happen. The idea of trying to work out what universe they're in /so that/ they know what will happen is hilarious and engaging.

** "Don't dare cross me, You Gryffindor-me!" Shouted Slytherin-Harry.

"Or what Lord Slytherin-Black-Peverell-Shaka-Shaka-Wee-Wee? You gonna kill me with your Avada Kedabra eyes? My Expelliarmus eyes are faster!"

"Boys, can you knock it off a moment?"

"Shut up HuffleHarry!" yelled Slytherin-Harry.

"Yeah," agreed Gryffindor-Harry, " This is between Mr. Secret-Handshake and me. Your Rictumsempra Eyes are useless for this, Hufflepuff-Me!"

"Where's Ravenclaw by the way?" Asked Slytherin-Harry.

Hufflepuff-Harry sighed, "Oh, he wanted to see if he could find Luna at this time period. To bully her or something"

******* Reminds me of the Hufflepuff rules from You did What! by nonjon.

"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled wasn't convincing the world she didn't exist. It was convincing her researchers, her grunt workers, and her scapegoats that she cared. And that they mattered. She even convinced most of them that they were more important than her. So she gave them qualities, characteristics, jobs, and duties. She renamed them Ravenclaws, Gryffindors, and Slytherins . . . Ravenclaws plan your strategies, Gryffindors fight your battles, Slytherins take your blame. And only behind the curtain, have the Hufflepuffs now and forever reigned supreme."

**** However, despite Slytherin!Harry being called a dark wizard, it turns out he was more along the lines of morally ambiguous and the whole 'dark' thing about him was that he was fine with using some really messed up spells and dirty tactics, but he draws the lines at actually hurting innocents.

Gryffindor!Harry, on the other hand, seems to be off somewhere most of the time and former death eaters and not quite yet deatheaters are going missing. Turns out that he's torturing them in a small prison complex he built just to keep them alive and contained, but he only uses spells and objects that are deemed as 'not dark'.

Also Ravenclaw!Harry is experimenting with some real shady shit. Hufflepuff!Harry just has a weed garden in his suitcase.

Moral of the story kids, evil isn't always what it seems to be, even when it claims to be simple.

** It would be cool if if they were all coming to terms with different things.

Slytherin Harry is a bit stiff, uptight and proud but has Snape as mentor and comes to the sudden realization that no this realities Snape does Not want to help Harry.

Hufflepuff Harry is trans (mtf) and still carries some self doubt that is put there by transphobic people.

Ravenclaw Harry is not the boy who lived but Neville is. He is a bit of an introvert and does not know how to communicate properly and is also a total bookworm and is hence a bit of an outcast. Also because his parents are in saint mungo's after being tortured.

Gryffindor Harry was basically the same but started going dark around fourth year. He built his own side of the war and played dirty

** How about, the four Harrys are:\\
Gryffindor: Dragon Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay]].\\
Slytherin: Elf-raised Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To The Waters and The Wild]].\\

Hufflepuff: Lazy Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]].\\

So, a slightly-odd all-loving overpowered Harry, a Harry who consults the spirits for direction on everything, a Harry who puts a phenomenal amount of work into being lazy, and a Harry who's pretty normal aside from being a dragon (and is rather bemused by the whole thing).

** Oh one of them comes from a Wrong boy who lived Universe (the Slytherin or Ravenclaw) and has a superiority complex.

The Hufflepuff was the Neville of that universe and grew up cowardly and not the boy who lived he is generally helpful but when it comes to betrail he is unforgiving. He killed Nagini in the Final Battle and is the magically most powerful out of the Harry's but hides it out of fear of the others. He wants the Harry that they are raising to be braver than him and have more confidence.

Depending on whoever was not the WBWL

The Slytherin was a Sudo dark lord who had no problem killing and selling out his "friends" killed both Dumbledore and Voldemort is and thinks of himself as a god amongst men because of that but is the magically second weakest of the group. His only friend in his universe was Snape and he has to come to terms that this universe Snape hates the little Potter. He wants the little Potter to grow up to rule magical Brittan like the god that he is.

The Ravenclaw Harry was the heir of basically all of the Houses of Hogwarts and took all of the titles of the Deatheaters he imprisoned Dumledor after the manipulative old goat's plan to make him a Puppet of the greater good backfired. As the Heir/Lord of all the houses, he was the most Magically powerful person in his own universe but is the weakest of the Harry's but knows the most about Magic he can't use half of the magic he was used to he also doesn't like to share his knowledge with others. He wants young Harry to basically be a mini-me and pull of the same thing he did back home.

The Griffindor Harry is a carbon copy of the Original Harry that just wanted for Harry to grow up loved by those around him and to not live with the Dursleys. He is the magically Second most Powerful. He trusts very easily but is not influenced by those around him He is also the only one that has any Baby experience because he raised Teddy in his own universe for a year before he executed his time-travel plan. He doesn't like his fame and is hesitant to use his magic to harm others and lives by the stun and disarm rule of Dumbledore. As previously mentioned he wants Harry to grow up loved and to prevent him from living through the same hardships he had to go through.

The power difference between the Harrys is due to the Magic levels in the separate universes the universe they all traveled to has an even higher Magic concentration than Hufflepuff Harry's universe therefore everyone is more Powerful here than back home.

Hufflepuff Harry is about as strong as Dumbledore In this Universe. Griffindor Harry is around as Powerful as Hermione or Mcgonegal or Snape here. Slytherin Harry is around as powerful as Ron here (which he takes as a personal insult). Ravenclaw Harry compares to Crabbe and Goyle put together (so still significantly lower than the rest)

Baby Harry is about as powerful as the other Harrys put together chaos ensues once he reaches his schooling age because by then only Griffindor and Hufflepuff Harry can compare to him in Magic power he also isn't the Heir to any other houses than Potter and later Black.

Have fun
