:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a few months ago, and enjoyed it. I read it on ff.net. Harry was put up by the Dursley's for adoption, and she stared to figure skate, her coach eventually adopted her. When the Hogwarts letter comes, Harry is skeptical.


** Damn, I was intrigued by a unique take and it turned out to be one of a million interchangeable James and Lily bash-fests.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N: Fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
