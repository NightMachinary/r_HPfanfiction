There was a fic I read a while ago that was a crossover between the two. I remember a bunch of details, pretty sure it was written by a popular author. The trio work with Hood, Voldy and Bismark fuse.

anyone know the one? It isn't in the crossover section with KC.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** Another HP/KC story (albeit a BIG one) is Harry And The Shipgirls on SpaceBattles.

The story (primarily by Harry Leferts but with many others contributing) has grown so big that you can find thread one [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][just here]] and thread two [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][over here]].

Harry being the adopted big brother of an Abyssal (Elder) Princess is just awesome... especially when she shows up at Hogwarts just in time to deal with a certain troll...

*** TBH don't know that much about Kan Cole lore (currently play azure lane though). It does sound pretty awesome, will try it after reading through my current list.
