TOP TIME TRAVEL AU: HERMIONE CENTRIC

•Rewriting Destiny » by mayawrites95

They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU

•Damage Control » by sea.nymphe

Her goal had been to earn his trust -everything after that was unintentional. Student/Teacher Tomione AU

•Saving Severus Snape » by MegGonagall

Hermione's Plan: Travel back in time and show Severus Snape that he does have a life worth fighting for. Not Hermione's Plan: Fall in love with him. *HPFF 2017 Dobby Winner - Best AU* *HPFT F.R.O.G.s Winner for Best Novel* *HPFT Slytherin's My Father Will Hear About These Awards 2017 Winner - Best Chaptered Fic*

•Something Borrowed » by it'slaterthanyouthink

The odds of Hermione falling through time? Slim. The chances of a young Severus Snape recognizing her? Minuscule. Join her as she attempts to discover her purpose in the past. Sirius/Hermione, Severus/Hermione

•The Other Evans Girl » by El Montgomery

The war was lost and the Order eradicated - all except one. The one that Voldemort really should have killed first. Hermione Granger rips apart space and time to make the impossible happen. January 30 1960, Lily Evans enters the world and so does her twin sister, Hermione. Marauders Era. EWE. Sirimione.

•In Another Life » Nishtha Parshwal

Voldemort fled but had not been defeated. Biding his time, he had once again brought about terror. Harry and Hermione have lost everyone they held dear. And so a blood rite, almost sinfully dark, helped take them to the Marauders' era to fix the world and prevent it from meeting the destruction it had once already suffered in another life. WARNING: Major Character Death. HGSB

•The Gnarled Tree of Time » by Silk Lily

Hermione Malfoy is the cherished and sheltered only daughter of Lord Abraxas Malfoy, and lives a peaceful life at the center of her brother Lucius's world. But when, at age six, strange dreams and visions of another life begin to plague the young lady Malfoy, it becomes clear that she is not what she seems-and neither is the world in which she lives.

•Bearing Your Burden by TheTitaniumSerpent

When Harry Potter is dying from Nagini's bite at the outskirts of Godric's Hollow and the war seems lost, Hermione Granger decides to use a spell to exchange his fate to hers. After the future is blown away, Hermione Potter is born to Lily and James Potter: the new Chosen One, with the clues to the future sleeping safely inside her mind.

•Quantum Entanglement » by CaspianAlexander

Voldemort won. The last of the war criminals Hermione Granger is about to be publicly executed. Except - it doesn't quite work out that way. What would you do if you were thrown back twenty years in time? With nothing to lose, Hermione creates a ruthless deception. She enters Slytherin as pureblood Hermione Black - with one thing on her mind: Revenge. \/ Unapologetic trope-abuse

Let me know if there's a particular pairing or any other details you would like me to narrow down for you :)

Happy Reading Everyone!!!!


** I really hate time travels that try to keep the time line or have the protagonists behaving stupidly. Time travel, or advance knowledge, is pretty much the ultimate Deus Ex Machina; and if you are still too stupid to fuck it up, then perhaps your enemies deserve their victory!

That being said, I have several time travels to recommend that do not fall into my hated category:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories and power to her two years old self. Voldemort was easily taken care of, but that was the easy part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. After a slow start, things looked up until an accident hit...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He did well and remained in character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Luna raised Tom Riddle, who still couldn't escape the fate of becoming a dark lord. But he would at least have Luna at his side this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly, but had to fit in this new reality.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]], linkffn(6452481): In their 60s, Harry and Ron appeared rich and powerful, but actually led fairly miserable lives, so they were given a second chance. Once back, they wasted no time in antagonizing everyone around them, especially their former spouses.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10938984/1/][Heterochromic]], linkffn(10938984): Crazy twist near the end.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV, and she wasn't paired with anyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Time traveling Harry killed them all again, but without getting kids involved. Hermione wasn't too happy though when she found out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Time traveling Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan killed most of them even before going back to Hogwarts, and also did the Goblins in soon after. But they were unable to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): The only Hermione time travel in which she KILLED Tom Riddle in the orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. But she didn't stop here either...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/][Strawberry Fields]], linkffn(4940094): Dr Who entered HP world and took the Books with him. He brought Harry to the Grangers, but things didn't always work well.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day old Rose were thrown back to Aug 31 1991. They got down to business immediately and finished off Voldemort in record time. Great depiction of Trio friendship, but bad spelling.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix became very impressed.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
