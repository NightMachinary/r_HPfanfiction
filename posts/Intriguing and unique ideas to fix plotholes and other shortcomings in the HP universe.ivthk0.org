I was working on how many wizards existed in the UK, and this led to a tangent on Hogwarts, how many students were there and the teacher/student ratio, etc etc. Then I remembered that I read a story a few years back where there were 2 sets of students and teachers at Hogwarts. I think the author was trying to reconcile the fact that Rowling said there were around 1000 students in Hogwarts with the fact we don't see nearly as much students or enough staff for that.

What the author ended up doing was divide the students in 2 groups, based on academic performance or magic strength or whatever. There were 2 teachers for each subject as well. Then, the students we were familiar with were all in the better performing half, and all the teachers we know were the better masters in their field. So the lower scoring population received education from the other set of teachers.

I kinda admire that, now that I'm thinking about it. The author had to develop an entirely different set of characters from scratch to make it work, whereas I'd say that Rowling was just wrong and would've decided that ~500 students would make more sense, removing the need to do that. I have no idea why the author didn't do that, maybe changing the number had some other implications he wasn't ok with. But either way, it was unique enough that it sticked with me over the years.

Anyway, I'd love to hear about unique and/or intriguing ideas that people used to make their stories work, to fix plotholes, to implement dumb stuff Rowling said, stuff like that.


** I read one where all the teachers used time turners and 36 hour days to keep up.

I'm partial to there being more than the 11 schools since that seems basically impossible. Seriously how big would Uogadou's student body have to be to cover the entire bloody continent of Africa? Then factor in the number of languages involved to teach. Not that this one is that novel I suppose, but it is one of the biggest world building gaffes.

*** Yeah I greatly prefer the idea that there are the 11 main, well known schools, and a bunch of lesser known schools.

*** That's interesting.

By my estimation, there are around 700k-1mil wizards in the world, and around ~50k children between 11 and 17. No way they have only 11 schools. I'd say there's 50~100 magic schools in the world.

I think I saw that 3 mil wizards in one of the works, so that would make the number even higher. If we take that number, it's not hard to assume that literally every country has a magic school.

About the timeturner, that does make some sense. I could see that working if I don't think about it too much. I had considered this to make 1k students at hogwarts work, but then I realized that even with an extra 5 hours, this wouldn't be enough. Plus they still need to grade essays, work on the curriculum, patrol, etc. I honestly have no idea how snape had so much free time to catch Harry so many times he was breaking a rule.

You know who definitely has a timeturner? The astronomy professor. Students are always slotted in to the last block of the day. If we consider that there are 14 unique groups (2 groups per year), and we have 5 free blocks( free weekends, iirc). There is literally no way to not do it with just 1 teacher, even if you combine all the houses so you have 1 group per year.

**** Other possibilities include: NEWT students having class on weekends, NEWT astronomy involving learning actual magic to track and chart stars so night hours aren't required, or that there is no NEWT astronomy class.

I like the last theory the best, but the time turner is interesting as well. The real question about astronomy is what did they do when it was cloudy?

***** Hmmm, that could work, but whatever magic they'd be learning, it's probably not tracking and charting spells. If such spells existed, it would make sense to teach them as soon as possible to students, so they don't have to stay up late or have their session disturbed by the weather.

As to the weather, I dunno. Charmed weather? Telescopes which magically pierce clouds?

*** This is a fair point. There could easily be more teachers we don't know about.

By my calculations, there should be 13-21k wizards if there are 500 students at Hogwarts. I agree that <10K would be pretty hard, but I think I can work with ~20k.
