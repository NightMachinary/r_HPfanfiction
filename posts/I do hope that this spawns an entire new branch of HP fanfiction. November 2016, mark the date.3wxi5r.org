** Harry walk down the aisle of the Hogwarts Express he passed the compartment of Hermione and Ron but kept going. He was angry that they didn't contact him at all over the summer. The first days after returning to pivot drive was expecially harsh after witnessing the death of Cedric. .

He came to a compartment that was only occupied by a girl with protruding eyes and blonde hair. He set his worn brown suitcase next to him on the bench as he sat across from Luna. .

Luna looked up over her copy of the Quibbler and said hello Harry Potter where is your school trunk?

Harry replied I got an upgrade over the summer. He then paused but after casting a locking charm and a notice me not on the door. He asked Luna would you like to see my crumpled horn Snorlack. .

Luna looked up into his eyes, looked down at his crotch, looked over at the suitcase, then back to his crotch, and finally up to his eyes and said yes Harry Potter I would like to see your crumpled horn Snorlack

******* I don't know; considering that Cruciatus is supposed to subject the target to the perfect pain, which whatever it means I presume can't really be improved upon via a spell upgrade, the notion of this spell being amplified is just silly.

But in any case, I only started with the first one (“Avada Kedavra Maxima”) as a crude joke, which I presume you to be aware of but I'll just note it now since my jokes seem to sometimes be incomprehensible and I don't want you to think I'm seriously complaining now.

Well, thanks for trying to guess how the whole thing would work, and for replying at all, in any case. I appreciate it.

  *THE EIGHTH STORY. NINETEEN YEARS LATER*. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child officially opens at the Palace Theatre London in July 2016. *It is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series* and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.

It's canon, no turning back. We have EWE (Ending, What Ending?) now we'll have PWP (Play, What Play?). But there will also be fanfiction based on it. Don't deny it. It's ok to cry.

**** And we'll also have MWM (Movie, What Movie?), since the movies of the books played loose with a lot of elements from canon, so to have a movie treated as part of the de facto canon (which it likely will end up as, what with it being only inspired by the book but the script being written by Madame Rowling) means some people will automatically reject it.

****** Ah, yes, I do the same with the previous movies.

This case is a bit different, however, in that the movies are going to be inspired by the book (so to say) but not an actual adaptation of the book's content, not a direct one in any case. And with the play giving us a precedent, there is a possibility of the movies being treated as canon by Madame Rowling herself.

I hope that won't happen because the past movies had really broken the expectations in that particular regard (keeping to canon, that is) and not in a good way, but oh well, can't say either way this time.

Coming from this industry I can just imagine how some producer was like "We need a trailer NOW!" and some artists looking forward to christmas scrap together some half-done scenes, place/crap a bit of Nuke and After effects magic on it, and there it is, ready to be shown in cinemas, just before Star Wars.
