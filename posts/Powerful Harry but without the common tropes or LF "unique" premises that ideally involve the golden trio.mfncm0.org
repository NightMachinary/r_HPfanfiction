And by "common tropes" I mean things like Lordships, Black/Grey/White magic etc.

I'm looking for relatively speaking unique premises. For example, I found [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a linear Circle]] to be extremely unique in, premise, the way it deals with magic systems, the way it deals with the medieval ages and the way it presents the founders.

My only real complaint is that it didn't really involve much interaction between the golden trio (it just didn't fit what so ever with that kind of premise), which is something I really like to see developed.


** I mean, it'll never finish, but Harry was certainly becoming powerful in linkffn(Forging the Sword)

*** I remember that fic! It's sad, I wish so many of the older stories would get adopted now. This one, along with Death Has No Dominion by Morta's Priest, were 2 of my favorites back then.
