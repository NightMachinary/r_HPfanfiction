As it says, looking for stories set before at least one of the canon books (can be more then one). Would be interesting to see how they take the story, especially the defeat of Voldemort.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Anyone can be the main character, can be on ANY site, any warnings.

No OP or Super smart Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd want it to be believable.

No Weasley or Dumbledore Bashing.

Would rather have it be completed if possible.


** Note sure if these qualify, since I havent read them in ages, but some old fanfics I remember are:

The Hidden Hero by EveBB

RuneMaster by Tigerman

Harry Potter and the Other Path by Fez8745

Cub by SlytherinsScribe TCL: The Cubs' Legacies by SlytherinsScribe
