hope every one is doing ok staying at home !

to pass the time i am looking for long stories ( maybe several tomes) about different subjects if you can recommend me some :

about : - young tom riddle with perhaps some romance involve but still a pretty dark mind or a really cunning slytherin one

- slytherin Harry and maybe some dumbledore bashing involve with some great characters developpement

- some good dramione because why not ( but not with too much clich√©s please )

- feel free to just propose your favorite harry potter fanfic ever no matter the subject i am open minded ( just make it more than one chapter please ! )

thank you in advance

ps : sorry if my english is incorrect i am not speaking it fluently (or writting it for that matter)


** Will you read Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger?
