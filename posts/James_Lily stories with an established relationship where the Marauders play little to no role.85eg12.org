Are there any decent stories with an established relationship (or one established within the first few chapters) between James and Lily where the focus is not on the other Marauders? I can only take so much of Lupin pity-parties, Peter "I'm obviously not the traitor" Pettigrew and sex god +Barney Stinson+ Sirius Black.

Please, no suggestions where they die or their death is implied.
