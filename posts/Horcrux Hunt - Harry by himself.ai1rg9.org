No bashing of characters (preferred) . Harry just goes off on his own to destroy horcrux (after Dumbledore's death but before Order gets him from Dursley's preferred) without friends. Exceptions being help from house elves or other magic beings. (bonus for keeping it H/G) Thanks!


** I've heard great things about this story here on this sub but have never read it myself.

** No bonus points as this ends HHR, but this one features Harry on his own (though he does use Dobby a lot). Basically, the premise is that Harry has to grow up by himself because Hermione eas pulled out of Hogwarts after second year. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6737085/1/I-Need-You]])

  What if Hermione's parents had pulled her out of Hogwarts after she was nearly killed by a basilisk in her second year? How would Harry have managed without her? Years later, she returns and learns about his life in her absence. H/Hr

  Hermione and Ron both leave Harry behind in the tent. Neither return, and were among the few to escape Britain when Voldemort took over. Years later, their daughter Rose has joined an ICW operation that tries to stop Voldemort's power from spreading beyond Europe. However things take an unexpected turn when she discovers what became of Harry Potter. Ron Bashing and Deaths.

** I don't remember much, if any, bashing in this fic, and it also doesn't diverge from where you wanted, but it is close enough, meaning he hunts them alone.

** I don't remember if any of these have bashing.

linkffn(Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum by White Angel of Auralon).

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Mask of Loki by Marcus S. Lazarus). Too many songs and comic book/TV characters for my taste.

I also remember one story in which Harry goes back to Privet Drive after Ron & Hermione leave him, and gets help from Kreacher, but I don't remember the name.
