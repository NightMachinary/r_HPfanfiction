Does anyone know any good time-traveling fics that meet these criteria? 1) Harry-centric 2) 60k+ words for completed fics (WIPs don't need to meet a min word requirement, but do need to be updated regularly, so no abandoned fics) 3) slash or no-ship only 4) good grammar and at least decent writing 5) no BDSM/pwp/harem/mainly smut fics 6) no major character death (at least no permanent major character death) 7) no genderswap 8) no “non-magic” aus or “Voldemort wins” aus
