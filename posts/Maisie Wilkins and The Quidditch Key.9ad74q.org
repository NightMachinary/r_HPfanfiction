Title: Maisie Wilkins and the Quidditch Key

Rating: T

An EWE, Snape Lives fic - Hurt/Comfort, Banter, Angst, Friendship, Mystery

Summary: Five years after the defeat of Voldemort, Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts as the school's new Potions Professor. She's prepared to deal with trouble-making students, exploding cauldrons, and the difficulty of being less than a decade older than most of her students ... but she's not prepared for what she finds in her classroom.

Why has Minerva McGonagall inveigled so many of her former students to return to Hogwarts as staff, this year of all years? Do the mysterious rumours about the dungeons have anything to do with the jinxed Defence Against The Dark Arts position? And can Hermione, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna unravel the mystery while steering a new crop of mischief-prone students in more productive directions?

Cautions: If your reading of Snape is that he's an unmitigated git who deserves nothing but death or ostracism, you'll hate this fic. This is a gen fic, with a background relationship of Harry/Ginny, Ron and Hermione have broken up but are still good friends, so if either of those are a deal breaker for you, you'll hate this fic. It's long, with 100k already posted, and it does feature original characters (such as the new students of Hogwarts) some of whom get POV chapters.

Feedback welcome!
