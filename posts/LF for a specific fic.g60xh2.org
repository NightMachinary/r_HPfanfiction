:END:
So i remember reading this fic where what happens is

In the beginning he and dudley are kidnapped then the kidnapper wants a ransom and finds out about the extreme abuse vernon says he will pay extra if they keep harry but then later says he will pay even more if they let him take harry but they refuse. Eventually he starts going by the name James instead of harry and helps them to collect debts and stuff. He fins the diagon alley on his own after getting his letter and eventually goes to knockturn alley where he finds a bookshop that you later find out is run by a hag. Someone he knows is sick I think it is someone who is in a coma or something and it is the person who kidnaped him so harry wants to heal him. While in diagon alley he ends up pickpocketing Malfoy so malfoy gets Snape and chases him. I remember he faced of against fenrir greyback a couple times.

If anyone knows this story please tell me
