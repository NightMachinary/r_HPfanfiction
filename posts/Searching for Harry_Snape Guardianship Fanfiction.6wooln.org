I'm looking for an old story where Harry thinks that Snape is nice because he takes care of him like a proper guardian should.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions so far! I'm currently in that terrible spot where I'm all caught up with all my currently ongoing fanfictions and have to dig through the sites to find more gold or potential diamonds in the rough. I'd even take iron class or cubic zirconia at this point.


** A favorite fic of mine. Linkffn(the Best Revenge). It begans when Severus is the one who delivers the letter to the boy in the cupboard

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Mrs Figg has enough. 7-year-old Harry Potter cannot stay with the Dursleys any more. Severus Snape thinks everyone is better suited to raise the future Saviour of the Wizarding World. Harry dreams of being taken away by a tall man who scares even Dudley.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
