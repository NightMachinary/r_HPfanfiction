Harry that has reached that age and acts it. He might have a temper (Gandalf), be loopy or twisted and turned dark, or be an educator and protector. The fact is he's considered old for wizarding standarts and has the life experience to prove it. It doesn't matter if it's a time travel or crossover or AU, the point is Harry is old enough to have built himself a reputation, even if it's that of the old wanderer or monk. fem!Harry's fine too but I'm not sure there are too many that would fit the request.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
