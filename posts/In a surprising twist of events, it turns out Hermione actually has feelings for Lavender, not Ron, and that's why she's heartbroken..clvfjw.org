I personally don't think Ron is suitable for romantic relationships. The Ron bashing goes too far, but I can't imagine ever willingly reading a fic where Ron is in the main ship.

Which is fine, but it seems a bit childish to go about it in that way. I don't think it's 100% neutral, but I don't think it's more of a hint at being negative when it's on its own. Do you genuinely think that everyone has to believe that Ron belongs with somebody or else they're Ron bashing?

You're an idiot, and I disagree with you. I recused myself because my original comment was meant to jokingly remind you of the exact wording of the comment you'd followed up on, which was obviously negative. I assumed you'd forgotten when typing your own comment, then realized that you were 100% serious when you replied to me.

There is a massive gulf between 'Ron doesn't necessarily have to end up with someone, and that's not an indictment of his worth of a person' and 'Ron is literally destined to be alone forever because of who he is as a person.'

I find this interesting. In the golden age of Harmony/Lunar Harmony fics. Ron was a (barely) self-aware stomach, one step away from being actual Hitler (there might have been a fic where he was Hitler) who crucios mudblood puppies for fun. The Ronbashing is extremely toned down from the days where it was common that Ron secretly hated Harry and was just in it so his family could snag Potter's enormous fortune and he could finally live out his dream of owning the chudley cannons. There were even fics that invented a new way for Ron to die in each Author's Note/Disclaimer. Now the most I see in Ronbashing fics is him have poor table manners or him being downright jealous of Harry. Which, actually happens in canon, and usually he grows out of these behaviors.

She is a sixteen year old girl. Yeah, who had weird school experience with random weird things every end of the year, but... She is just a student. She is noy part of the social circle of the trio. With her first serious crush. Who she is dating. Probably her first relationship. Are you going to tell me we were the height of maturity at 16? Aaaaand I love? For the first time?? Honestly???

Actually commenting on the post, it would have been pretty awesome and Hermione's grumpiness could be that she is questioning herself. I would totally read something along those lines.
