My fic is headed to Asia in the next chapter, China specifically. What were some really cool ideas that you've seen for magical culture in Asia?

Not looking for fic recommendations, looking for inspiration.


** China: None. Fell during the revolution and the central government would never allow a semi autonomous entity to form. Leaves the magical world there in a semi-permenent state of anarchy.

Or alternatively, the magical government survives with authority based on the old Chinese emperor's. Lots of conflict with muggleborns and their patriotic ideals

*** I like the latter one, but the former one implies that muggles could ever defeat wizards at all. Plus it would make the Statute impossible to maintain.

**** If the communist chinese government had a magical branch of loyal muggleborns they could probably defeat the traditionalist wizards. A combined force of many replaceable muggles and a few wizards to break shields and reveal hiding magic could be quite effective.

**** Well, I do maintain that muggles would inevitably win any conflict, although not with the statute surviving.

However it doesn't have to be that: We've seen that wizarding conflicts can coincide with Muggle ones.

It would be a chance to explore how the ICW handles rouge states (any one taken over by dark wizard/dark creatures). Do they send a task force of oblivorators to maintain the statute?. Is it like international peace keeping? Do they just give up on the country and do magic at the borders to keep the information from spreading?

Maybe the statute is being held together by some Dumbledore like character.

***** As long as Voldemort does enough obliviating to make the giant attacks look like hurricanes the ICW won't do anything, we know that already.

****** Sure, but then that begs the question: what would they do if he didn't?

Assumgingly there is some system in place should a location suffer a breakdown in law and order and the obliviations are not happening. Maybe the ICW will magically nuke any country that violates the rules, killing all magic users, and that keeps everyone in line. Maybe they embargo the border do no info gets out.

******* I think the ICW is a bit like the UN, in that they almost never agree on something (except keeping secrecy) but if secrecy is threatened somewhere they could probably act pretty quickly and get the entire magical world to intervene.

If a country is having trouble keeping secrecy, there are probably going to be obliviators from foreign countries all around the world arriving pretty soon.

** Look up ancient tales and stories. They are often have magic assosiated with it. Old mythology is also a great source. It's one of the reasons HP is so great.

And don't forget Asia is big. China will be far different than Japan vs India vs Thailand. Hell, even Western and Eastern China are crazy different, let alone North vs South.

** Honnestly, I would just take the world building of a martial art novel (with sects and schools), and replace the martial art by magic.

â€‹

Full separation between the Muggles and the Wizards world.\\
To maintain this separation, the Wizards integrate Muggle born children at the first sign of accidental magic. The politic of the unique child helped greatly the wizards, among the "abandonned" girls, several where in fact Muggle born girls brought to the magical world, or even boys with the parents memory charmed to think they had a girl.

Because of the full separation, witches and wizards live together in magical settlements, each settlements being auto suffisant and even having its own schools (think martial sect, or in this case magical sect). The muggleborn of each region are brought to the nearest magical settlement where they are raised together in dorms. This separation also mean that Squibbs are not brought into the Muggle world, but stay in the settlement where they represent a kind of lower class and are used to do some menial task like raising non dangerous creatures are low level herbology.

The country is governed by a concil composed of the leader of each settlements, who elect among themselves a represent to not only "preside" the concil, but also to represent them abroad.

The country does not directly discriminate against Muggleborn, yet the fact that they are raised by the settlement mean that they lack the social networking pureblood children have. A muggleborn can still achieve greatness if he has talent and find a master/ protector while in school, but most of them still have a little harder time than the pure bloods and half bloods.

** I have this personal head canon that China would have a big problem with muggle borns after the cultural revolution. Maybe in order to go, you must pass some sort of loyalty test, and if not your magic is suppressed. That, or it completely functions in a dynastic system separate from Muggle China all together, and it does everything in its power not to let the Chinese gov find out

** Old streets as Diagon equivalents (e.g. Tunxi old Street)

I've seen some fics that incorporate the idea of land spirits as a ghost/magical creature hybrids, but that's bigger in Japan based HP fics

Alternative healing (acupuncture, cupping, etc), but HP healing is quite unique already, so I don't exactly know how you'd adapt it. Maybe instead of potions, they solidify or apply them onto needles for targeted treatment or weaponization?

Perhaps a more physical dueling style (martial arts?), Or maybe they disdain it as a muggle necessity. Forms and fluidity probably bleed through though.

Schools or towns or creatures up in the mountains that use the rolling mists to hide

Some way to resolve the huge number of dialects that sound nothing alike.

Veneration of immortality and its study? Tales of immortals exist all over Chinese folklore, and emperors have often searched for its secrets

Maybe a zodiac based system somewhere? I was gonna say a school system, but 12 is kind of unwieldly. Maybe famous animagi in their history?

Even more rigid family/class system than magical Britain. Tradition, filial piety, etc. are huge there culturally, but then you also have to consider the sheer size of the population, so keeping muggleborns second class like in Britain would be ridiculous. Maybe they have them join under the banners of family in hierarchies, forming miniature courts. I just had the horrifying thought of squib eunuchs.

feng shui, yin yang, four humors, etc. deal with balance in some way. I feel like China's magic society wouldn't shun dark magic and ritualism.

Isolationist government that's more strict with the statute. Maybe they take all muggleborns away from families early on and toss them into orphan communes separate from the family courts and resources but within the magical world, encouraging them to remain subservient to the hierarchies when they grow older?

Maybe the magical community there never really got over the warring states period and have a number of fractured societies and courts that have a grudging alliance with one another?
