Hi again - I remember reading a fic a real long ass time ago where McGonnagal and Harry both travel through time to win the war. They end up in their younger selves during an order meeting. Harry starts crying because he's a baby and he see's Remus whos alive. Anyway Voldemort can feel him and knows thats he has traveled back in time. During an attack on Diagon Alley he rapidly ages Harry and they have an epic duel but I don't remember reading anything beyond that point. I would have loved to read their reactions. I know its a long shot, but help please?
