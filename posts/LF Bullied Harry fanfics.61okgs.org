Fanfics where Harry gets bullied by the rest of the school. I'd prefer it to be romance, but it can be gen as well.


** He gets bullied really badly in this one.

*** It's pretty odd that people don't know this about canon? Sure, Harry could talk to other people in his year, but beyond that, everyone, even in Gryffindor, disliked him. Likely because of jealousy, as we see with Ron, a lot of Gryffindor's wish for the whole 'Fame and Glory thrust upon them' thing.

**** I don't see the whole everyone disliked him thing? I mean, sure, he had people who didn't like him, but on the whole they seemed either neutral about him or they liked him. The Quidditch team liked him, Weasleys (minus Percy), Parvati liked him enough to go to Yule with him, everyone in the DA minus Zacharias Smith seemed to like him, etc.

****** Oh lol I totally missed the 'other people in his year' part. But even then, it's only Parvati that I mentioned who is in the same year as him. Most of the Quidditch team isn't in his year, e.g., Angelina, Katie, Alicia, Oliver, Fred and George, Ginny, Demelza Robins, Jimmy Peakes, etc. Either a few years older or younger than him. A large part of the DA isn't in his year either, some from other houses, too, e.g., Cho Chang, Luna, Lee Jordan, Weasleys and Colin Creevey off the top of my head. They all seemed to like him well enough.

******** Well, no, they didn't regularly talk to him, but they didn't 'dislike' him. They were more like friends/acquaintances. They were friendly to each other, just not close.

********* Exactly, that distance was always felt to me in the books. You'd never see them ask Harry how he was doing, or attempt to help him with the TwT as good teammates would have done. All you see is Fred and George attempting to make humour at Harry's expense, then leaving.

********** I still don't think I would classify that interaction as dislike. Just because they don't talk to each other a lot doesn't mean they actively dislike Harry. Angelina even gave Harry a hug when he was picked for Triwizard, to show there were no hard feelings.

As for helping him, there was a rule for Triwizard that no one should be helping the Champions. Plus, all of them also believed that Harry entered his own name. If they thought he hadn't entered his name and didn't help him, then yeah, that's pretty shitty of them. Besides, some of them were in their O.W.Ls year, so they're pretty busy, too. The rest are sixth year, which seemed pretty intense, too, from what we saw in HBP.

Fred and George makes humour at Harry's expense, but they're teasing him. Harry's not usually upset about it and they know it. And while I love Fred and George, they're not the most sensitive people. They're usually involved in their own stuff like blackmailing Bagman or trying to set up their jokeshop, and rarely do they interact with even Ron and Ginny in a serious manner. So them making humour at Harry's expense, I'd argue isn't targeted, but just how they treat people in general.
