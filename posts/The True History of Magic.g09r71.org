So, I've been working on a personal version of my local Wizarding Government (the Argentinian Council of Magic) and I came across the interesting subject of Wizarding History (Yes I know JK Rowling hate it) So I'm inclined to make a collaborative sort-of Magical history, if any of you is interested. For instance, Argentina is quite maped based on Spain, which I'm working under the supposition than Wizarding Spain unlike it's muggle culture grew quite diferent, so I'm imagining a Celtiberic Magic (Tribal and Animagic), followed by Roman (Latin Spellcasting and Divination), then Visigothic (Germanic adaptaion of the later) and then during the medieval period a tense coexistence of two cultures: A Romanic-Visigothic Wizarding vs a Moorish. All of this later casted upon the Americas. If anyone is interested feel free to share your ideas (specially if you0re into European-American history, sorry I'm quite out of touch with the rest).


** What do you mean by wizarding Argentina being ‘quite maped based on Spain?' I'm not sure I follow. I also have some international headcanon, but they're more Head than canon because it's part of an AU fanfic.

** There will be a problem with languages. I am a Czech, and there is whole community of people (not a bit dormant) around the website [[http://budec.net/]] which is build around the idea of the ancient school (originally post-Roman, post-Celtic, going into hiding in 935) at the ancient Czech hillfort of [[https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(hradi%C5%A1t%C4%9B][Budeč]]). Unfortunately for you, everything is in Czech.
