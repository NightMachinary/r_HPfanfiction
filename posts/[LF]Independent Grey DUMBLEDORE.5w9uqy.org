I'm looking for a fic where Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore comes into his inheritance and has had enough of the wizarding world expecting him to kill Voldemort, he's just one guy. It's not like people expect other crime lords school headmasters to fight evil, but take on a crazy ex bent on world domination once and people will expect you to take on all dark wizards for the rest of your life.

It would be cool if Albus knew arcane magics and maybe used his parseltongue and mermish to effect in the fic, I mean JK gave him these skills but you never see him use them.

I don't mind slash, some het is okay but on a case to case basis. No harems please.

  As advertised! My take on the book made famous in the Deathly Hallows. What was the real reason for the Order of the Phoenix as according to Rita? Why did Dumbledore dislike Dementors so? All the questions you want answered. CHAPTER 4 NOW UP!
