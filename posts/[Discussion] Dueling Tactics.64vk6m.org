So, I've been playing a lot of strategy games lately, and I was wondering what kind of strategy might be involved in a tag team duel.\\
Imagine one offensive caster, and one defensive caster whose job is to set up a superpowered shield against physical objects and then just feed his magic into the offensive caster, multiplying his strength and spekk repertoire and reducing his reaction time.

Or, a double offence, where one makes it rain and the other transfigures each falling drop into an ice spear.\\
One transfiguring an army of animals, and the other infusing his own blood into each to effectively bloodlust all of them.\\
That could be so cool. There's so much scope for stuff like this limited only by your creativity.\\
Hit me!


** From what we see in Dumbledore vs. Voldemort, high level duels seem to be largely based around manoeuvring your opponent into a position where you can land a single incapacitating spell on them.

This makes a lot of sense compared to the fanon tank-like hour long duels in which each participant takes multiple hits and keeps fighting. Really, a single spell should be enough to end any duel. Either it incapacitates the opponent instantly, or it puts them at sufficient disadvantage that you're able to gain the upper hand and incapacitate them shortly after.

So the key is to land a single successful spell. With unequal opponents, this simply means overpowering your opponent, as Dumbledore did against the Death Eaters in the DoM. But with equal opponents, where you can't blast through your opponent's defences, you have to find a way around them.

We see a number of tactics to this end in the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. The base of these tactics seems to be trying to get your opponent to have to dispel a complex attack, which keeps them busy while you reposition yourself via apparition to launch another attack while they're still vulnerable. A variation on this is to gain a "multiple attacks" advantage by reversing your opponent's spell back on them rather than merely dispelling it. For example, Voldemort turning Dumbledore's fire whip into a snake. This means that you get "2 attacks for the price of one" which keeps the opponent extra busy and leaves an opening for you to land another spell on them.

This leaves a hanging question: is the best tactic therefore to gang up on people? It seems to depend heavily on skill level. For all her vaunted skill, Bellatrix barely even qualifies as a distraction in the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. Dumbledore dispatches a single animated guardian to deal with her, and she can't do anything to stop it -- all her spells bounce off it, whereas Voldemort's spells smash the guardians. This seems to indicate that a bunch of weak wizards ganging up on a powerful wizard like Dumbledore and Voldemort will not produce the same "distract them then land a spell on them" effect as we see when powerful wizards attempt the same tactic.

We see a similar scene at the battle of Hogwarts, where Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley gang up on Voldemort but can't touch him, and in fact lose the duel many times over -- it's only Harry's sacrificial protection that stops them from being quickly swept aside by Voldemort, since he lands multiple spells on them, it's just that they're protected from them.

** I took a stab at a formal duel [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMsEW54OUMXOhFI5upg0ViaqqyHVHv8Sf8diOV_pQyw/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. From my understanding of the books, tempo -- who's acting and who's reacting -- is very important in magical combat.

As [[/u/Taure]] said, nearly any spell that makes it past the opponent's defenses will end the duel in one way or another.

Depending on how much concentration, familiarity and effort apparition takes, combat anywhere that apparition is possible would be much, much more frenetic and chaotic than what we see in the movies.

We don't actually get a lot of professional-level magical combat in the books, and so things like the mechanics of shielding while casting other spells, transfiguring multiple things at a time, etc. don't get explored, and so we have to resort to fanon and/or speculation.

** 1. Wizards cannot funnel magic into one another in canon, it's implied that they may create magic, control it, manipulate it, but they cannot absorb it (hence why Voldemort didn't just take all of Bellatrix's Magic and overcome anything Dumbledore sent his way in the Ministry).

2. We don't see everybody using Transfiguration in Duels in canon, in fact, from the people we've seen use it, it only seems to be reserved to those that are extremely prodigious at the art, when in combat. It's likely that it's a field of magic that provides a lot of magical 'strain', and requires a lot of talent, power, and creativity.

3. Bloodlusted Animals are still Animals, and once again, creating multiple animals at once is likely a lot of hard work, to the point where you will be significantly at a disadvantage if your enemy Duellist is someone quick on the draw (like Harry).

4. Don't believe Tag-Team Duelling is a thing, Duelling matches naturally have seconds if someone dies, but at no other point are they allowed to step in, at least, for a Standard Wizard's Duel (According to Malfoy, then later the Duelling Club).

5. Even in the scenario, that you set up above (which is likely the reason why they don't have 2v2 Duels or Tag-Team Duels), a Stronger opponent can still win. Take Dumbledore in the Department of Mysteries, apparently, he took down many Death Eaters before going to fight Voldemort, one of them probably attempted that strategy, and got their shield blown through and their arms blown off.

** A tag-team duel would involve an incredible level of coordination, especially if one was shielding and the other attacking. The shield would need to be dropped and the spells cast at precisely the right time to prevent both friendly spells from hitting the shield, and the unfriendly ones from hitting the pair while the shield is down. The Killing Curse also limits the utility of such a setup on the battlefield. Levels of success would vary greatly depending on the skill of the opponent and pair.

It would be more ideal, I think, to have a pair constantly on offense. They could do a pincer move, and circle around opposite sides of an single opponent. That would make it very difficult for the enemy to see all oncoming spells, and just as difficult to block them (depending partially on whether the author portrays the Shield Charm as a dome around or as a flat surface in front of the caster).

Other things, like one of the two Transfiguring the surface beneath the opponent to oil or another highly flammable substance while the other uses flame attacks would be interesting. The trick would be to use two spells, both of which would normally damage an opponent, but would also interact to produce a third, unexpected, effect. The changing raindrops into icicles is a good idea, but it doesn't really play on the power of two duelists - you still have only one end attack (the ice spears), and countering them would only be as difficult as countering the initial raindrops. It would be more efficient for one wizard just to condense and freeze the moisture in the air into ice spears in the first place.

** Lots of good points here already. Here's my contribution to the subject of magical combat.

Magical Dueling: Conventional magical combat is reminiscent of gunfights at low levels where taking cover is viable. At high levels cover becomes meaningless as the combatants are easily able to destroy or transfigure their surroundings and the combat begins to resemble sword fighting. Formalized dueling resembles fencing. Different shields block different kinds of spells more effectively and different spells are better at piercing certain shields. This creates a rock-paper-scissors scenario where the wizard with the larger repertoire of spells has a significant advantage (assuming they are otherwise evenly matched) because they have more options that their opponent won't know how to properly counter. A wizard with a sharp mind and sense of creativity can make effective use of even mundane spells that would not normally be considered combat spells. Low level spells are still relevant even at higher levels as distractions as well as the fact that many do not emit light when used and can be easily cast without notice due to their low complexity. The reason there are so many unnecessarily complicated and often gruesome dark curses (even though a severing curse to the neck is perfectly deadly) is because they were designed to be difficult to counter due to the strange and unique ways they operate as well as the shock factor to allies when they hit (though some of their creators really were just twisted fucks). Silent casting and casting with reduced wand movements provide a significant advantage in reducing your opponent's ability to counter. Another major skill is spell chaining, which is the act of sequencing spells such that their wand movements and incantations flow into each other in the most efficient manner such that the caster can get more spells downrange faster; serious duelists practice common and unique spell chains like a martial-artist practices kata. Unless the combatants are very evenly matched, most duels are fairly short affairs as it usually only takes a single successful hit to end a duel, either by directly disabling the opponent or setting them up for a subsequent finisher. Area-of-effect spells are usually difficult to cast but can effectively swing the momentum of a duel. Many mundane combat tactics (such as flanking, mobility, countering, misdirection, advantageous use of terrain, etc.) can be applied equally well to magical combat.

** Assuming the tag team has substantial teamwork, high coordination, and all the fighters are around the same skill level this could work. We don't see many complex spells in Harry Potter the fighting seems pretty straight forward dodge, attack, block repeat and quite frankly, the fighters tend to lack creativity or maybe just simply lack the skill and power (Voldemort vs Dumbeldore had a creative edge to it) so I'm not entirely sure this would work but...

For example, two people can have a ring with some kind of twist effect or very small hidden blade compartment that draws blood with certain subtle movements and teleports the other who is also wearing a ring to the person who activated it or lets them switch places. It would work kind of like a portkey that only rakes you to the other one. It would completely blindside the person you are fighting and they wouldn't be prepared for a strange occurrence such as that.

I mean think about it, you're dueling someone and they are entirely focused on you. You're partner is dueling someone else, when out of nowhere he/she is now by your side sending two attacks from different angles and can press the attack. Basically this is how it would work,

You guys would show off your spectacular team work to make who you're fighting think it's better to fight 1vs1 and separate you two. Now you're fighting one person, while you're partner will fight farther farther away from you. As this happens, the opponents have to think they have the advantage here and they will press it. Then at the right moment, you activate the teleportation. Now you both are fighting 1 enemy instead of 2 while the other doesn't know what happened. The person you were fighting now has to deal with attacks from two angles and two people.

I find the idea of a double connected portkey quite intriguing, could even develop this more to be able to orchestrate full on ambushes. A group like the Death-Eaters would take full advantage of something like that. Idk about anybody else but if I was a Harry Potter characters I'd be making new spells, curses, tools, battle items, etc left and right. I would never be satisfied with what is available, I'd be a Scientist Wizard. Well I guess that technically counts as an Alchemist? but whatever. I mean seriously, don't the antagonist in the series get bored of the same killing curse and Cruciatus curse? Gets old very fast need to spice things up
