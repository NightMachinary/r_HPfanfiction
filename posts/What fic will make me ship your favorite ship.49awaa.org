  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

** Linkffn(one hundred sixty nine). Sirius / Hermione. My favorite fic ever, the end. The fact that I can't pay this author for writing this is criminal. It's hilarious. It's clever. It's poignant. It's got great dialogue.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out.

  Hermione is kidnapped and thrust into a life she's never seen before but already lived. Clinging desperately to the idea of free will and choice, she tries to ignore Voldemort's words from her old life - "In this matter, there can be no alteration of the path, no compromising reality. You were there, and therefore now you must go." Tomione COMPLETE!

** Linkffn(5278050)

A Tom Riddle/Minerva fic that made me fall in love with the pairing. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The author manages to depict both characters very accurately in my opinion. Something which you wouldn't think was possible considering. But Riddle is just as manipulative, cunning, cold, and evil as you would expect.

** I didn't mean to be cranky earlier in the thread, so now that I'm back at the computer I'll post a few favorites. Thing is, I don't expect any fic to change a non-shipper's mind, although it might give them a glimpse into why the fans ship it.

Snarry's my poison, and it comes in various flavors. There's bitter-but-sympathetic Snape and a Harry who forgives him:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032][Rapture]] by mia-ugly. Lovely characterization, poetry, humor, romance filtered through heartbreak. A few plot hiccups.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2712814/1/So-Lonely-Without-Me][So Lonely Without Me]] by caligryphy (This one's 10 years old, omg) OOC but within spitting distance, excellent banter, a nicely dry and self-loathing Snape, poignant Harry, locked in a room together during the war.

[[http://inkstain.inkquill.net/isf/archive/21/achoriambic.html][A Choriambic Progression]] by mairead triste and aristide. Another very early fic, and I believe Harry's 16 here. Excellent dialogue, farcical beginning and increasingly interesting magic, lyrical first-love/first-lust passages, an ending twist that has nothing to do with canon.

Then there's cruel bastard ambiguous Snape and messed-up Harry:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] by atrata. Warning: underage. Takes place the summer after Sirius falls through the Veil. Basically a Stockholm-syndrome fic. Intelligent, manipulative, disturbing Snape and depressed Harry.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2590][Reconciling Lily's Eyes]] by persepolis130. Shite title, hilarious, grotesque fic. /Very/ fucked-up and ugly Snape and OOC whacked-out Harry. Amazing deadpan comedy and the hottest gross-out sex I've encountered in fanfic. Also surprisingly touching at moments.

[[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion series]] by alchemia dent and bugland. Five and a half books long. Goes AU early on. Wonderfully inventive, magical, dark, disturbing, fascinating fic. Unfinished but completely worth it even so. Starts relatively light and descends into hell. Harry is underage. The relationship is beyond dysfunctional. Contains rape (not the configuration you might expect) and a terrifying Voldemort.

Comedy:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/77600][If This Be Error]] by nimori. Harry screws up a binding spell and adopts a senile snake. Snape is definitely not amused. They work it out, much to everyone's embarrassment.

I could keep going, but I think that's probably more than enough.

***** Well, yeah, that's what I figured. I'm always happy to see recs for good fics, because I multi-ship all over the place. But Snape/Harry was my gateway into HP, it's still my OTP, and JadedReader linked a fic that dismisses and mocks it. It doesn't inspire me to leave a favorite fic or author open to ridicule from an anti-shipper.

I'll just hang out, browse the other links, and see what else turns up.

  When the mirror shatters and the shards have left their mark, who's left to pick up the pieces? Snarry with some self-harm and mpreg.
