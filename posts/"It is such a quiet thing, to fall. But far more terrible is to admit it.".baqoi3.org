** He stood alone in the Great Hall, in what used to be the Headmaster's golden throne. The golden pillars lost their once famed glamour, and the banners long fell, remaining motionless on the floor. It was cold. /They/ took down the warming charms five days ago, hoping that perhaps the last of the defenders would freeze to death, taken by the Arctic cold of northern Norway. Outside, he could hear the barrage of spells and bombs smashing into the ever waning wards. What an irony, he thought. Taken down by a joint army of Wizards and Muggles. Ironic that once the war was over, in the middle of celebrations, their comrades will raise their wands and utter that repulsive spell. /Obliviate/. The most important war in the history of mankind, and they will only remember half of it. So many deaths, so much destruction. Cities razed to the ground, entire families exterminated, so many compromises and sacrifices, and now, in the end, nothing would have changed. All for nothing.

He was tapping the edge of his glass with his silver ring, lost in thoughts. Durmstrang was the last stand. He knew that. His army, whatever was left of it, knew that. His enemies knew that also. He looked up at the mark he engraved above the main entrance, on that fateful day of his expulsion. /For the Greater Good/. Written in Old Norse, and the mark of the Deathly Hallows above the Runes. It all seemed so long ago. Like a different life, almost. There were so many dreams back then. His friends, all alive. All rushing to support him. The future all seemed so exciting. There were so many mysteries to solve, so many wrongs to right. Ah, the enthusiasm of youth. He remembered training in the empty classrooms with his friends, all of them day dreaming of the world they were going to create. Joking about who would take which lands. And once they were done, he would be busy getting into trouble pranking those pompous Purebloods. Well, it was them who would have the final laugh now. After he lost Nurmengard to ICW forces, all those bastards were released and took back their lands and privileges. The old borders were back, the old ills back with a vengeance. His reforms cancelled almost entirely. The ICW did manage to convince the re-established Archmage Council to cut down on all the Pueblood privilege, but only out of fear that they would all run away and join him. He sighed.

After so much death and so little in terms of achievements, even he started to have doubts. Looking back, it all seemed like a slow descent into madness. How did he manage to lose control so much? To lose himself? Maybe Albus did have a point. The Muggle leaders he kept under the Imperius, the Flag-Bearers - war mages - he sent across the world, to support the Muggles in their foolish destruction. He raised Hell itself, and in the shadows of the flames, his armies slowly took over Magical nations across Europe, and beyond. His gamble on the Golden Dragons from China, such a sure bet at the time, failed. The Emperor's loyalists were defeated by the ICW and their Chinese sympathizers. The Jade Throne was forever lost. His attempt to incite riots in America were also foiled. It was well known that Muggleborns managed to poison MACUSA with their racist ideas, so when he sent a Flag-Bearer to train the oppressed and form an army, he thought it will be an easy victory. Yet once again, his plans were failed. African Magical cities however remained largely neutral. In retrospect, it was a good thing. He managed to send many families of his soldiers there, as political refugees. Perhaps it has been easy to lie himself into thinking he is a hero.

His heart clenched, and he took another sip of vodka. He remembered the reports he had from his agents in Europe. Detailed accounts of the camps. Trains which only went in one direction. How did he get here? Were people just evil by nature? Was he a demon hiding behind fancy speech and enticing slogans? He remembered the young man he was when he was expelled from Durmstrang. That excited and brilliant boy, whose eyes would sparkle every time he saw a new spell. That boy that tried to take every enchantment apart, just to see how it works. Would he have stood by and watch millions die? Maybe. Albus would say no. Everyone was good in nature, he kept repeating to the point it became annoying. He begged to differ, but didnt Albus proved to be right eventually? He remembered the rationalization after reading new reports. /For the Greater Good/!

/Gellert, magical or not, all beings are capable of higher reason! They should be equal under the law, once we finally break free!/

How sweet and innocent those days were, in England. Him and Albus, going through old tomes, visiting cemeteries, and debating for hours on end. Reviving magic thought lost for centuries. Searching the Hallows. The blasted Hallows.

/Albus, intelligent or not, we are no longer Homo Sapiens! Do you think early humans wept when they condemned their Neanderthal cousins to death? We are something beautiful, Albus! We are the next step!/

He kept switching his grip on the Elder Wand, while reminiscing his younger days. Somewhere, at some point, he lost himself. Maybe it was when his family disowned him and branded him a Blood-traitor. Maybe it was when Arianna died. Arianna. His sister in all but blood. He loved her, the poor, beautiful girl. He loved her like family, and now she was dead. And when she died, she took Albus along with her. And like that, in one afternoon, he lost his anchor to reality. His equal. His friend. The one who understood him like no other. Or maybe it was when he decided to ignore the reports coming from the expanding Muggle Reich. And then his friends started dying. His soldiers turned into numbers. Battles into statistics. Perhaps it was all that. He lost himself in the war. At some point, he must have decided that his innocence no longer served the greater good. And now, at the end, he realized it. He lost. Even if he somehow managed to turn this disaster around and defeat the ICW, he still lost. He became what he once hated and the reckoning was at his doorstep.

"Master Grindelwald?"

He looked up. The recruit in front of him was evidently tired. He was wounded, and his dark crimson robes had burnt patches. Came straight from the battlements, it would seem.

"What is it now?"

"Sir... A Phoenix just appeared on the walls. It... did not attack us, sir. Well, except for... a few of ours tried killing it and... well, sir..."

Gellert chuckled. /Oh, Fawkes/.

"Dont worry, I am familiar with how proud Phoenixes can be. Especially that one."

The young man looked at his commander with surprise evident on his face.

"You know that Phoenix, sir?!"

"I believe so." he said smiling. "Come on."

The two made their way across the abandoned castle, the sound of battle becoming increasingly louder. Gellert looked at his black long coat and the crimson vest with silver buttons. He fixed himself up a little bit, and arranged the collar of his white shirt into a better looking position. He could not, in good faith, allow Albus to dress better than him. He smiled, remembering his first encounter with his old friend. Yet despite the fondness of this memory, something felt... hollow. Like this was the memory of a different man and it simply ended up in his head.

They finally reached the battlements, and saw the wards sparkling bright when hit by spells, or being engulfed in flames when the thunder of artillery would make contact. It would not be long until they collapse, he thought. Some spells would already slip through and chip away at the walls. His soldiers, few as they were, fired without pause. Lights of various colors shot out of their wands.

"Fawkes, old friend!"

He smiled at the red bird and went towards it, despite the protests of his soldiers. The Phoenix flapped his wings a few times, and let out a sad, long thrill. He stretched his head towards Gellert, letting a sad song escape his beak.

"Come now, Fawksie, is this how you greet an old friend?"

The bird's gaze looked as if it penetrated deep into his soul.

"Dont be like that, little one. We both know I was your favorite. Does Albus still feed you those horrid sweets?"

Despite the gravity of the situation, the bird managed to somehow appear amused. He let Gellert pet his head some more, until he gave another long, sad sound. The wizard sighed, and looked much older than he truly was. He looked down, and then towards the large army of Confederate wizards.

"I know why you came, Fawksie. Albus is here as well, isnt he?" The soldiers suddenly became stiffer when they heard the dreaded Albus Dumbledore joined the assault.

Gellert looked around one more time, and then tightened his grip of the Elder Wand.

"Comrades! Brothers and sisters in arms! I will go and defeat Dumbledore! And then, we will defeat these slaves that dare extinguish our Magic!" Even he was surprised by how natural the lie came out. Fawkes knew, of course. The wizard turned towards him and smiled.

"It is time, old friend. And thank you. For not just abducting me. I will miss you, when this is over."

Gellert Grindelwald stretched his arm, and Fawkes flew gently on it, looking intently into his eyes. The last thing the soldiers saw was their commander being engulfed into flames and going who knows where. Little did they know that it would be the last times they saw him. The war was nearing its end.

** The fall had come like fate's whisper in his ear.

That high, cold voice from the ether had set Peter's course the moment it slithered over his shoulder like icy calamity manifest. There was no question, no suggestion of resistance; the Dark Lord would have what he desired without exception---so much the better for Peter to make himself truly useful, at last, and secure his place in the new order soon to be.

Peter had landed and broken before he knew he'd slipped. With heart trembling like that of a cornered rat, he spilled secrets under slit-pupiled scarlet eyes that gleamed with the patient expectance of death itself, an inexorable force of nature with desires the world was made to fulfill.

Peter gave Voldemort all that he was, all he could've been, until nothing was left but fear and shame and shaking breath.

--------------

To the final gasp he was afraid.

And then, white eternity. He rose from the inscrutable surface he'd woken upon and peered around at a pale void veined with barren trees rising from nothing in the distance. The ashen branches swayed in a breeze he didn't feel. It was a vision reminiscent of the forested backyard of Peter's youth, but when he turned around, there was no modest home with the crooked weathervane---only more mummified trunks.

"Peter."

His heart would've stopped in life. Nothing was worse than what he knew came next, but he turned around anyway; just as surely as he was dead, he knew there was no escape. No longer.

Of course they were there, all of them, and he stood before them like a shepherd of death come to join his flock at long last.

Lily, James, Sirius, Remus. There was a brief impression of uncountable pairs of eyes behind them, eyes he knew and eyes that knew him, all with the same weight of condemnation---they faded when Peter blinked.

"Were they worth it?" Remus said quietly, as if he were genuinely curious, though his eyes were dark as the rest. He looked younger than Peter could remember. "The years you bought . . . were they worth the price?"

"I . . ." Peter couldn't think for the despair sinking through him---couldn't they understand, couldn't they try? "Don't---don't look at me like that! You know, you /know/ we were doomed from the start---the Dark Lord---!"

"Dead," James said, voice filled with pride and satisfaction. Then his tone sank like an anchor, each despiteful word a strike in the gut. "Though you did your best to see it otherwise. Lucky for us your best isn't much."

"Oh, he did well enough." Sirius was hale again, substantial, but the shadow of Azkaban seemed to return as he examined Peter with utmost contempt. "Had me nailed to the wall nice and proper. How long did it take you to plan it all out, Peter? How long did it take for you to decide what our lives were worth?"

They waited as if expecting an answer, and their eyes, their hateful and heartbroken eyes, wouldn't leave him. Peter turned around and ran and stopped; they were there. He cried out his despair and shut his eyes and willed himself away, anywhere but here, anyplace but here.

Brilliant green eyes seized upon his own when they opened again and wouldn't let go.

"You robbed us of Harry," Lily said with a voice like glass. Her glossy eyes begged for reasons they couldn't perceive. "Robbed Harry of us. How could you, Peter? How could you /ever?"/

It was too much, all of it, too much to bear---Peter burst into shuddering sobs that carried into the pale void, swallowed by indifferent infinity until he caught his breath.

"I was afraid . . . I was afraid . . ." Peter moaned. He hated his being, his powerless self, with everything he had left. "We were dying . . . we were /all dying,/ don't you understand? Sooner or later . . ."

"Are you afraid now, Peter?" Remus asked.

"I'm miserable, Remus . . . I'm miserable, but not---not scared . . . not any more."

"It seems to me," Remus said, "that this is what you should've been afraid of; this thing you've become."

Peter sank to his knees as the will to stand left him, and he received their looks of disgust, pity, hatred, sorrow, like a bleak waterfall pressing him down and drowning him in his own misdeeds.

"You're right," Peter whispered, turmoil twisting in him like a burning serpent. "I'm sorry---I'm so sorry."

The words stumbled inadequately into the space between them, and James's eyes hardened while Lily's softened, ever so slightly. Of a sudden there was a sense of rightness, a feeling so foreign Peter looked around for the source in dazed confusion, and when he turned his head back round, their backs were to him, stepping away shoulder to shoulder into emptiness.

"Wait---where are you going?" Peter called after them. It felt as though his heart were retreating with them; he tried to stand, to follow, but hadn't the strength. "Please---don't leave me here! Don't leave me!"

"Don't worry, Peter." James alone turned for a brief glance over his shoulder as they were enveloped in stark, blinding light. "You'll have everything that ever mattered to you here."
