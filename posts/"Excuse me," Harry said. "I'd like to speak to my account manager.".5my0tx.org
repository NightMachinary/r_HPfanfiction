"Just one moment," said the goblin at the front desk. He (she? it?) contorted his face, raising a claw and summoning another Goblin to lead Harry down into the halls of Gringotts.

The walls were lined with gleaming suits of armor and weapons, all engraved with the finest Goblin runes of indeterminate effect, perfect for establishing that Harry was among a Proud Warrior Race, in spite of the fact that the Goblins were ostensibly a race of ugly and greedy bankers with large noses. Off in the distance, he heard the roar of a Dragon. He also heard the scream of a Horcrux being easily and harmlessly extracted from a priceless and fragile magical artifact, despite the fact that Goblins didn't have wands.

By the time that Harry arrived at his destination, his feet hurt terribly. He tried to knock on the door he had been led to, but it opened at his touch.

A Goblin was inside, doing paperwork and looking quite put-upon. Harry smiled, though, at the familiar face he saw. He'd met this Goblin before!

"Oh! Oh! Griphook, is that you?"

The Goblin looked up briefly, not to glance at Harry, but to check that the nameplate on his desk was still there.

"My name is /Blogrot/, you racist little fuck. Get out of my office, and don't come back."


** When I first got into fanfics, I loved reading the cliche stories where HP is the first person to be nice to them ever, or like remembers Griphook and makes a goblin BFF.

Now, some of my favorite portrayals are them as bloodthirsty warriors who want to exterminate wizardkind. I like the ones where HP gets one over on them in one way or another.

** Something else that's silly: you mean to tell me that in all of Goblin-Human history, not one person has treated Goblins with respect, nor has one person called a Goblin by their given name? That's just silly--even more so for an 11 year old to just waltz in, say some words, and then become Super Lord Percival Jesus Abraham Deus Ex Machina Potter Black Riddle Hufflepuff via the magic of Goblin bullshit.

I don't think Goblins are that complicated: they provide a crucial service (banking) with great benefit to themselves. To take a non-magic example: you're a banker, and for whatever reason, you're hated by your local community. A kid wanders in, says "Hello Mr Stiffdick" with a polite smile on his face. Sure, no one's ever said your name before, nor even given you the pleasure of a smile. Will you immediately bend over and pronounce this kid as the lord and savior of everything? No. At most, you'll treat the kid with the mirrored respect you receive. He is, after all, just another customer. Even if he's the King of England, Spain, and France--he's still just a customer, and you're still just a banker.

Or something else that bothers me in fanon: Dumbledore being the account manager and stealing money (with optional Weasley participation). As far as I know from canon and from normal banking laws, Harry's funds (inherited from his parents) would've been placed in a trust, accessible only once he turned 17, or by a guardian (the Dursleys, but they never went to Gringotts, so it's a moot point), or to otherwise pay for school supplies (I imagine there's a strict, binding credit limit on his account until the age of 17). Dumbledore was not Harry's guardian, and so unless if the late Potters wrote in their wills "Dumbledore can take money out FOR THE GREATER GOOD at any time for any reason", he has no way of accessing the money. Goblins to me would respect the harsh finality of wills and other contracts, which means that they would uphold the Potter will. Which, leaves out: why. Why does the most powerful living wizard need access to a few extra ducats? You'd think--with all his inventions, his salaries, and his just general awesomeness, that he'd be rich. Or, at least, well off enough to live without need of other's funds. Don't forget: Dumbledore lives rent-free, with zero expenses, at Hogwarts.

Oh God. Now I'm considering all the horrible ways his first cross-species ancestor was conceived.

And it's quite likely that Dumbledore got heaps of rewards and 'thank-you' gifts for defeating Grindelwald and ending that war. Considering it was a war in Europe, and he was just a school teacher, things must've been pretty bleak. Granted, Dumbles isn't the type of man to /keep/ any of it, but if he were, then he wouldn't need to steal off little orphan boys.

It's not an exaggeration to say that throughout human history, banks have weilded tremendous power. Subtle power, but power.

Then add to that the fact that goblins explicitly have a nasty history with wizards (all those wars), plus the fact that neither race seems to trust the other all too much.

** Neither appeals to me really. I prefer goblin-centric goblin that are embroiled in an unending series of inter-tribal conflicts. Wizards are rather unimportant to them (except as possible tools in their latest campaign against whatever tribe they are fighting at that moment) and Gringott is merely a prominent trophy to whatever tribe controls the bank, with some added perks like easier access to wat meagre resources the goblins would be interested in the wizarding world can provide -- mainly manpower, mercenaries to fight for them (known to the wizards under the euphemism "curse breakers").

Strict rules of formal politeness wizards can't even start to fathom rule goblin interactions and wizard behaviour is unbearably annoying to them (the habitual politeness of British muggles somewhat less so) and scamming them is a casual pastime as well as a coping mechanism ("a fool and his money...").

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Just once, I'd love to read something where Harry is polite to goblins, who then collectively stumble over his "never-before-seen" kindness ... just so they can utterly screw him out of his assets.

*** The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady touches on it briefly where the Goblins pretend to be nice to muggleborns but are gouging them. Hermione proceeds to be extra condescending about her /special Muggleborn/ rates.
