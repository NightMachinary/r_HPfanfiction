So over the past few weeks browsing through here, the Denarian Saga was recommended quite a bit and even searching for all time favorite cross overs, it was recommended a lot too. I just got through Renegade and started the first few chapters of Knight because I just couldn't get over how much I hated Harry.

I get he's demonic and what not... but close to 50 chapters later and Harry is still an obnoxious, arrogant jerk? No matter how many times someone tells him to calm down or to control his temper it gets even worse and he ends up in more trouble. The plot and action scenes are great and I'm now interested in reading the Dresden Files but Harry's character development is terribly ruining the story for me.

Does Harry ever change? Does he ever not be a Douchebag?


** Ah, if I recall correctly, no, he does not ever cease to be a 'douchebag.'

The Denarian Saga was written some time ago, when the average quality of fanfiction was considerably lower, or some claim. It hasn't aged as gracefully as it might have. Many people have likewise noted the lack of appreciable character development in the fics. The Denarian Saga is still a very good series, but it focuses more upon action and witty banter than it does character development.

*** He doesn't change but he does evolve somewhat. I feel that through the Amanda storyline he develops a certain amount of empathy he lacked at the beginning of the trilogy.

**** True, I'll certainly concede that. Overall, however, he still is somewhat immature and something of a jerk, but it never really detracted from the story for me. I'll trade obnoxiousness for Shezza badassery most any day.

It is in no way my intention to imply that the Denarian Series, especially the first one, are not an excellent pieces of work. I'd still give it a 4 and some out of 5, and gave it a 5/5 when it first came out.

OP, the Amanda storyline starts to pick up after the first book, and was certainly intended as a romance subplot of some sort, but I can't recall for the life of me if anything ever came of it. I have this thing about skipping parts of romance in fanfiction.

**** Where is this Amanda storyline? Does a romance ever develop? I respect that its held its own through time and some of the writing really is terrific, but it ends up not really being what I like. I guess I read for the character development sometimes and so the fact that Harry remains so full of himself is offputting.

** Eh, he improves very slightly, but "douchebag" is his baseline personality in that fic, which I quite enjoyed.

Shezza also demonstrated an amazing ability to understand the canon magic of both Harry Potter, and The Dresden Files, managing to fuse the worlds together in quite an extraordinary manner.

I think it's aged quite well.

** The stories focus more on the action and plot, rather than the character development. I think the series has aged quite well as compared to many of its peers from that era. I haven't read much truly evil/demon/douchebag Harry, so I do appreciate the change of character considerably more than others might. I'm used to reading stories where Harry either improves his attitude, is good from the start, or adequately justifies himself and his actions.

*** I agree, I guess it's because I've read so many stories of Harry improving or his coming of age stories that it's just what I prefer. I like a feel good, better at the end of the day story, so I guess the Denarian trilogy is just a twist in and of itself. Not really my thing though but I would have pushed through and skipped around if there was significant character development.

I just feel bad for Amanda because at this rate it seems like there will never be a romantic plot or something.

**** From the point in the saga I'm in, I have to agree.

Not to mention I really don't see Harry ditching his bachelor lifestyle.

******* eh idk, it just pisses me off way too much about harry's character. And i don't think any amount of action is going to make up for it if I hate the guts of the protagonist

** Nope. I quite liked the first book, went away and read some of the Dresden books, came back and got through another 1 1/2 books before giving up because I disliked the protagonist so much.
