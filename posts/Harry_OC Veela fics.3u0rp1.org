** linkffn(8554615) has some OC Veela.

Pretty short story(25K). Haven't read it in some time, so I don't really remember the quality of content.

  Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.

** linkffn(11188292)

It's not a pairing between Aimee and Harry at the present time but in Deal with a Devil Harry has a Veela friend pre-Hogwarts. The fic is still ongoing, with regular updates so who really knows if they'll end up together. No... hm, now that I think more about it, there is actually quite the chance that their relationship will remain platonic.

Give it a go anyway, it could be to your liking.
