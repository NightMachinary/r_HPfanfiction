So I started this fic on my phone at work last night, but my phone died and was charging so I tried to find the fic on my laptop. ONE HOUR LATER I still couldn't find it, but I did gain another 14 to-be-read fics /-/. The fic I was looking for ended up being one of the ones that I had selected to read later but I didn't recognize the title till I turned my phone back on and re-opened the fanfiction.net app, and I had actually found it fairly early on in my search. Just an amusing story I felt like sharing.


** So...you're not gonna tell us what fic this is? :'-(
