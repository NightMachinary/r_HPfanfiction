Does anyone know any fan fictions where Molly looks into the fact Harry had bars on his window or anything like that? Or where they realize he's abused during the summer before second year?


** 1. This is a Request.

2. The fact that I've never seen someone run with this concept is shocking to me..

** She finds out only later, but it is one of the best Molly Weasleys anywhere. linkffn(6782408) ... unfortunately, in the later parts it turns into Severitus. But the beginning is really good.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

**** And actually, to be fair, this is one of the best Severituses (is that a proper spelling?) around, because they have to really struggle to get to their relationships, it is not cheap.
