** Someone should just make a master sheet for "WBWL" genre recs, since they comes up so often. No clue why we still use that name when none of the good ones are actually WBWL.

Anyway, here you go. Aside from Subversion (and Boy Who Lived) none of these are in my top tier of fics, but there are some decent guilty pleasures around here.

*Subversion* by Myricle - incomplete, a pseudo-satire of the genre. The best one I've read. Wish it were longer.

*Sarcasm and Slytherin* by sunmoonandstars - in progress through book 5. Exactly what the title says. Starts out very promising, I thought the quality decreased a little over the course of the series.

*Prince of Slytherin* by The Sinister Man - probably the most popular currently-updating fic on this subreddit. Sprawling, too big for its own good IMO, but pure entertainment. Has a really good Lockhart.

*To Be a Slytherin* by Morgana Deryn - large and long. Romance with Draco. Drags a bit through book 6.

There's also *Antithesis* and *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches*, neither of which fit my taste, but give them a try. Antithesis is extremely dark and DPSW pretty controversial.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** A Train to Nowhere on ao3 has a Harry going to Durmstrang. It's an incredible fic but has elements of slash. I'm not a big fan of slash myself but the quality of the fic makes it totally worth it.
