I love Harry Potter fanfiction and I'm looking for some to read over the holidays. I'm looking for very long fanfictions (preferably completed or regularly updated). I like post Deathly Hallows fics about Harry after the books end and before the epilogue. Otherwise I love time travel fics! Canon pairings preferred. Please help me procrastinate hehe. Thank you all in advance :)


** Then you should like Northumbrian's post war stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

In addition to the usual main characters, he also writes about less well known secondary ones such as Terry Boot, Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, and Dennis Creevey.

Although each of these stories is short, they are all related in the chronological order, so I really see them as a gigantic single story. There is one that's still in progress and of novel length: *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126)

** Hmm, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4427065/1/Strange-Bedfellows][Strange Bedfellows]] involves Harry to some extent, and is certainly post DH.

/“We all need someone we can lean on...” Two unlikely men in an unlikely place find an unlikely friendship in each other. A post-DH, post-Once Upon a Time in Mexico crossover AU featuring Severus Snape and Sheldon Sands./

It's a crossover with the movie Once Upon A Time in Mexico, but the HP plot is pretty good. I really loved the characterizations, and the relationship between Snape and Sands */works/*.

** I searched for "Long Quality HP Fanfics" in our subreddits history and got this:

#+begin_quote
  "Have you tried searching this subreddit?

  Here's a couple threads that might be of interest:

  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2kjcf2/][One]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2dq7gb/tearjerkers_of_any_length/][two]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2j5lge/destroy_me_emotionally/][three]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2hnwrt/looking_for_stories_that_do_not_contain_the/][four]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2jrndz/top_20_overall_hp_fanfics/][five]], [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ewn2n/looking_for_the_best_of_the_best_in_malemale/][six]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ekxqc/looking_for_long_fics_to_read/][seven]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2abmk8/your_very_best/][eight]], [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/22jd26/looking_for_good_time_loopgroundhogs_day_fics/][nine]], [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/209ne0/what_are_your_favorite_obscenely_long_fics/][ten]]

  If you come by the subreddit every couple days or so you'll find a thread with the best of whatever on it.

  Other than that, the hardest part will be finding fanfics with competent teachers. Everything else is quite plentiful."

You will almost definitely find something in one of those threads, we are a small sub so the largest majority of the suggestions you get are the same everytime.

** Time-travel fics? Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]]. It's a Bellatrix/Hermione fic, probably the best one out there, and its most distinctive aspect is the sheer emotional torque it can have on the reader. If dimensional travel/alternate universe exploration is okay, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]]. It /is/ a Harmony fic, but not obnoxiously so, and without the usual accompanying bashing.

But if you want really long reads, look no further than the Alexandra Quick series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]] are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the fifth is set to come out sometime next year. I hope). They really are incredible - possibly the best writing in the entire fandom, bar none.

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will not be controlled. Dumbledore, Ron, Molly and Ginny bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
