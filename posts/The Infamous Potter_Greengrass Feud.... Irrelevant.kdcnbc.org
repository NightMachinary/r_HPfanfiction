Harry and Daphne begin dating.

This shocks a lot of people, but not for the reasons you'd expect: no, she's not some Ice Queen thawed by Harry's 'heroic' presence and he's not some love-starved monkey dancing to a tune string by her.

The Potter and Greengrass families actually have a feud that goes back several centuries: no-one can remember who started it or /why/ it was started or if /anyone/ was at fault, but bad blood between the two families has existed and caused some pretty big wakes in magical society over the years.

Unfortunately, Daphne, a regular girl who like girly stuff, and Harry being Harry didn't get that particular memo.

Harry's parents, specifically his father, were murdered before anything of the like could be 'passed on': likewise, Daphne's father died when Astoria was barely a few months old from one reason or another, and their paternal grandparents have long since been worm-food. Their mother? Purposefully kept quiet, mostly because she wanted it to die and because she didn't know the full 'story' herself, too.

When the happily dating couple learn of this familial feud for one vague reason or another, they shrug and get back to smooching.

This baffles some of the older students, particularly those from lengthy pureblood or wizarding backgrounds, the teachers, and adults that know of the families' history, and they can't understand why the pair just don't give a house elf's bollocks about it.

Could be tied back into the Greengrass' blood curse, with one of their members marrying into an "enemy's line" breaking it, so Harry and Daphne eventually tying the knot and her getting knocked up might save Astoria and any future children from suffering from it.

This could be adapted to use any witch that has a lengthy wizarding family history, but I'm a fan of non-Ice Queen Greengrass personally, so I used her as the example.


** ‘Speak, now -‘

‘Wait!'

A young man with white blond hair and green dress robes jumped up.

‘I just can't watch this going on,' Draco cried out. ‘You two have a blood feud for Merlin's sake!'

‘...sorry, what?'

‘Yeah,' Daphne backed up her husband-to-be in feeling somewhat out of the loop. ‘What are you talking about?'

Draco looked stunned. ‘Don't you know the prophecy?'

Other people began to murmur. ‘Yes, yes, the prophecy. “All will end , when a Greengrass and a Potter will intend... to swear their love, and swear it true...”

‘ Don't you /get it/?' Draco asked, over the murmurs. ‘/All will end./ Your whole family, they'll all die!'

There was a pause. Harry looked at Daphne, remembering the other prophecies that had come true... but never in the way that it seemed or should have. Daphne said nothing.

‘Can't it just mean...,' he tried, feeling rather out of his depth here. ‘That the /feud/ will end?'

Draco blinked. ‘Some people thought that,' a raspy voice croaked from the back. ‘They swore their love, and it was true, and they died anyway, either by the hand of each other - mistrust sown by the prophecy not working, no doubt - or by their enraged family.'

‘Not much chance of /that/,' Harry quipped, but he began to get a bit nervous. ‘Okay, can someone tell me the /whole/ prophecy?'

There was a pause. People began to shuffle their feet.

‘Nobody is sure how it began,' Draco admitted. ‘Some say it predicted a betrayal and that the one who heard it went and confronted the betrayer - or decided to betray the betrayer - but not before hearing this:

“All will end when a Greengrass and a Potter intend to swear their love and swear it true, -“

‘Shouldn't we have died already then?' Harry interrupted. ‘I mean, we've been intending to do this for a while.'

‘Will you let me /finish/?'

‘Yeah alright alright, carry on.'

I wouldn't be surprised if the author pairs up Draco and Ginny now that it's been resolved in-story.

** Wait, "blood curse"? Is this a canon thing, or a fanon thing that's become so widespread in the fandom that its used in every Greengrass fic to some extent?

EDIT: I should probably clear this up, I'm not asking if blood curses are a fanon thing. The original post mentioned the GREENGRASS blood curse in the same way a post would mention Harry's curse scar, as if it was supposed to be a well known thing. I was asking if the Greengrass Blood Curse was a canon thing, not blood curses in general.

****** It is fanon. Cursed child was not written by J.K. Rowling. The potterverse is not an EU (and as Star Wars showed, even EU can be un-cannonized)

It was a fanfic that she signed off on allowing to be presented as a play. And honestly I am not sure she had a choice in the matter... traditionally published authors have less choice about things than people assume. It is why so many people indy publish... so they can say "you can't do that with my world/characters" But even if she wholeheartedly agreed, she did not write it, nor is it part of an EU. It is only canon if enough fans agree it is. Which makes it fanon even if it is canon.... But most people do not agree it should be canon.

******* She signed off on it. It's (legally and technically) canon, as much as I hate it.

Don't get me wrong -- again, I hate Cursed Child on the whole. It's awful, and I get the feeling the writers behind it were university graduates who got started writing awful fanfic that never grew past that phase (well, either that, or they were high when writing it -- the fucking Trolley Lady, for example? Probably the result of a bad Acid Trip experience!).

But it's still canon, unfortunately. The fans can't just decide "lol nope don't like that, not canon" otherwise they'd be doing the same to awful stuff like the Disney Wars Sequel Trilogy or even the purists who deny that the Empire Strikes Back onward is canon. The world doesn't work like that, and there's no wiggle room.

But on a personal level? Yeah, consign that to the Pits where the like of Partially-Kissed Hero resides.
