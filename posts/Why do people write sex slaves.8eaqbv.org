I dunno, why are you reading fetish smut you're not into?

*** I think that's unfair. Maybe OP was reading smut and it went somewhere they didn't expect.

Why do people write anything? Because they get off on it, one way or another.

#+begin_quote
  God its disgusting to read
#+end_quote

Then... don't?

#+begin_quote
  And do they really think Dumbledore will let him get away it?
#+end_quote

I don't think a fictional character's hypothetical counter-actions would stop anyone from writing about their preferred fetish(es).

#+begin_quote
  Seriously If i ever hear the word Master again

You can save the story, then use a text editor to search and replace with a honorific more to your taste. Check [[http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/master][here]] for a list of appropriate synonyms.

** He's also not the type who will love Malfoy/Snape/Voldemort, but at this point I don't know which is more popular, sex slave or the above?

Point is, the author has a story to tell or a fantasy to satisfy.

*** I may be wrong but I think ff.net published its top 50 ships awhile ago and Drarry was the top rated of the HP ships.

** It's easy. Rather than deal with plotting out the complexities of human interaction, all Harry/(selfinsert) has to do is go to the goblins who for some reason handle that kind of stuff on the reg.

Then they are forced together and whatever smut the writer had planned can happen. Plus all your dialogue comes prewritten. Just have Harry call whatever he's with a slut and a whore repeatedly. Ta-da!

You might enjoy the satire that is [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=991][Harry's magical penis]]
