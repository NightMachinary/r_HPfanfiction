Hello All,

I recently finished reading Turning of the Times on AO3 and as it was amazing but not complete. As a result I'm looking for other fanfics in the same vein to satisfy the itch. A Harry Potter who travels back in time to the first war with Voldemort and somehow manages to get his attention although he is actively trying to avoid it.

I really liked how Harry in this fic remains good but is used by Voldemort regardless of his preferences.

Recommendations would be greatly appreciated! (Plot heavy and the long preferred!)

Thanks in advance!!

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** Since you like the dynamic between Harry and Voldemort in "Turning of the Times" you might also enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056/][Flight]]. It has a similarly unhealthy/controlling relationship between the two of them after they both accidentally travel to the past. (Mind the tags.) linkao3(16497056)

Unfortunately, all of the 'Harry encounters Riddle during the first war' fics I would recommend are unfinished. Here they are if you want to try them anyway:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330/][Chained]] - Harry's accidental time-travel lands him in Grimauld Place and thus directly under Voldemort's control. He struggles to spin lies fast enough to save himself and the people he loves from disaster. linkao3(14403330)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11161695/1/Chasing-The-Careless-Traveller][Chasing The Careless Traveler]] - While searching for a solution to his problems post-war, Harry travels not just to the past but to an alternate dimension. There he runs afoul of Riddle's plans when they wind up seeking the same artifacts. linkffn(11161695)

  A magical accident in the Time Room leaves Harry and Voldemort stranded in the past. Harry learns that nothing about the magical world in the 1940s is truly familiar, and Voldemort discovers there's much more to Harry than he ever suspected.

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  Albus Dumbledore was too late. Someone else managed to defeat Gellert, leaving chaos and too many questions behind. Tom Riddle, who recently graduated from Hogwarts, was fully committed to become the greatest Dark Lord of all time, chasing immortality and surpassing Grindelwald's legacy. It's too bad that Unspeakable Harry Potter had something to say about that. HP/TR. Time travel
