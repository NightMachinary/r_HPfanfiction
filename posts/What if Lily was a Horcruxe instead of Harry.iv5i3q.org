What if James Potters death helped in creating Lily Potter nee Evans into a Horcruxe instead of Harry? Would she be proclaimed 'The-Woman-Who-Lived'? What would happen?


** There's a fic with this premise. I'll have to look for it.

**** I think her being a Horcrux is supposed to be a spoiler in that fic? Not sure if I remember correctly.

But yeah, she's a Horcrux in there, although I got the impression it wasn't the kind of premise OP was looking for (but rather Lily taking Harry's place as the One-Who-Lived)

** One obvious thing would be that Sirius wouldn't be sent to Azkaban. Unlike Harry, Lily would be able to explain "the plan" to Dumbledore. I don't know if Peter would be send to Azkaban or, just like in Canon, he would have managed to escape (at the very least, Lily and Sirius could break his cover an an Unregistered Animagus).

I'm not sure Lily would become the "Woman-Who-Lived". Part of the reasons for Harry fame was how "miraculous" his survival was (a baby vanquished the Dark Lord). With Lily, people could find a more believable situation like "she must have got a lucky shot". Vanquishing Voldemort would still make her famous, but probably in a different way.

Other wizards reaction would also be different. Most of the Blood Purist (at least the ones not caught after Voldemort' fall) took a passive stance between 1981 and 1991. That was partly due to the fact that Harry could potentially become a new Dark Lord once he had grown up. As a Half Blood with (supposedly) immense powers, he was an acceptable master to follow.\\
But unlike him, Lily is a "mudblood" who clearly showed her opposition to any Blood Purist notion. So I guess people like Malfoy and his close minded friends would gather way sooner than in Canon, either to "restart" the war or at least to reduce Lily influence.

â€‹

For the rest, I have no idea what would happen. I'm not sure how "James love protection" would behave without any Potter relatives to life with (not to mention the fact that, in Harry case, the protection ended when he became 17 while Lily is already an adult). I also has no idea to what could happen with such a situation, since most of Harry's adventures should not happen to an adult like Lily. I guess you can cook something to explain her presence at Hogwarts (became the Potion Mistress of the school because she didn't really have any other place to go after the death of her family), but the plot would still need to be changed for Voldemort to come back.

Is there any canon support for this? The only fics I can recall reading that did anything like this were featuring a dark/Slytherin Harry.

** There's an unfinished horror/lovecraftian fanfic where Lily is the one with the scar (can't remember if it's a horcrux) and becomes a dark witch to save Harry. I mean like super dark summoning Cthulhu dark. I can't find it anywhere though ðŸ˜•

** I'd caution against reading any fic with this premise with Snape as a major character, with the exception of linkffn(Puzzle) which is very dark but well written if you like dark fics. Those tend to degenerate into LESS, and while I normally like that ship, I find the idea of it as an endgame /as a direct result of revealing the prophey/ very, very disturbing. Not implausible (Lily is in a bad spot after James is dead, and if the Marauders vanish like they did in canon, there aren't a lot of alternatives to support the grieving process, and I can see Albus engineer something like it to prevent him from doing something stupid after Dumbledore failing to protect her adequately), but even so, nothing I want to read.

** That is a side-plot in Harry Potter and the Rune Stone path (no link due to Rule 8). The fic has issues, namely the harem part and especially the whole pureblood culture bs with Daphne and Tracy, but it also has one of the best mentor arcs with Professor Babbling and the whole "Lily's Horcrux" thing (technically not a Horcrux, but same effect).
