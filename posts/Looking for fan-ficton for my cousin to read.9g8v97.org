Hi!

My boyfriend has been reading the Harry Potter books to his cousin, they are only in the first book and she loves it. She's getting so into it that she want some other stories to read by herself. She is 10 and at a normal to a bit advanced reading level for her age. So i'm looking for some not too complex and not too long stories, where the characters don't change too much from canon and not too much is spoiled about the books themselves.

​

I'm a perfectionist so it would take me hours before finding THE perfect story for her, and i don't have the time right now, so any suggestions are welcome! :)

​

Thank you


** I would be really wary of introducing a kid to fanfic when they're that young and before they've actually finished the series, it could be quite confusing.

** This one fits neatly into canon. It is absolutely suitable for children and well-written. It's a crying shame it doesn't get more attention. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10934094/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Golden-Sovereign][10934094]])

  This is a complete Harry Potter novel, set just after Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets - this in no way spoils the main official books and it fits in with their order. Plenty of magic and danger, as Harry encounters wizarding and non-wizarding London. Some readers have said it is like an extra book in the original series! It was written for my niece. My son loves it too.

** Would you be surprised if I told you that I never actually read the books; and that the only real reason I watched the 5th, 7th, and 8th movies was because I discovered fanfiction after I got turned off to the Canon after the 4th movie? Canon barely matters at all to me these days. I think more on the opinion of my Headcanon than anything; which is a combination of the some 300 Fic's I've read and cared about up to this point.

Although I still respect spoilers; even if I'd be slightly hard pressed to come up with what was strictly Canon and what was more Fanon, so I don't spoil things without warning...

*** I think its difficult to understand the canon of the books with only the movies. Loads gets left out and changed. I dont agree at all for example to the changes they made in the last film, especially the ending (Hagrid is supposed to sob, the battle is in the great hall and Voldemort does not turn into pieces of burnt newspapers - especially that last one is só far from how its meant in the books its frustrating). I have tons of friends who stopped watching the films cause they stopped understanding them, you kinda need the info of the books to get some scenes.

Ive also grew up with the books and think its great how the reading level goes up with every book. The books grew up, like their "original" readers did.

If you wont read JK's books, i strongly suggest reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, maybe you'll like that type of writing more.

**** Already read that, thankyou for the recommendation though, all the same. Maybe some day I'll read the canon, but not today...
