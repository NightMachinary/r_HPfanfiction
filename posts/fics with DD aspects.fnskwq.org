does anyone have recommendations for fics using stuff from Dungeons and Dragons? monsters, storylines, specific spells/artifacts, the authors making character sheets, the characters actually playing their own campaign, anything. can be based on any edition. hell, even Pathfinder or other RPG stuff works.

i've read bits of the Rose Peta-Lorrum series and am writing my own with a bard/wizard OC but other than that i haven't seen anything yet.


** There was a fic like this, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, I think. A wizard from D&D ends up in the Harry Potter universe and works exactly like his class is supposed to work in D&D (memorized spells, cantrips, full body heal after 8 hours of sleep, etc.). The author even had a character sheet and threw dice for his character's actions. Unfortunately, the fic was abandoned after some time (at least when I checked last).

  My 2010 Nanowrimo story. A crossover between Harry Potter and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Harry ends up in an ADnD world at a young age. Trained as a Ranger, when Dumbledore gets him back he's not a little boy any more.

** I think there was a russian fic about that. Harry somehow was transported to a different world and comes back as D&D wizard. There is no translation though.

** The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries. It has a strong D&D element running through it, along with bits of various mythologies (bits of Norse and Egyptian most obviously)

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, OP!Harry, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.
