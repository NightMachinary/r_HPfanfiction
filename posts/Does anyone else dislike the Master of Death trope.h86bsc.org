This always seem to be used especially in crossovers to give Harry a massive power boost. While I understand the need to have him more powerful in comparison to other fandoms like Marvel or Naruto but why is it necessary for him to have control over the personification of death.

If anyone has recommendations for fics that subvert this particular trope they would be welcome.


** I like when it's subverted, like it just means he gets to talk to Death, or that he can see when it's around, without gaining any special powers or immortality. Canon was full of things not being what was expected, and this is a perfect place for another.

** Truthfully it depends on the setting. Magic by itself is borderline overpowered in a something like MCU but put canon Harry in the comic version and he needs the boost to stay relevant It also depends on the how, did he just get a boost from becoming the mod or did he become an immortal world hopper who slowly grows in power I dislike putting an overpowered MOD Harry in a low powered setting and then him waving his hand and fixing everything

**** Didn't they have to underpower everything to keep a few of the avengers relevant? That, and the comics give everyone insane levels of power due to how long the comics run, with how they need enemies of increasing power. Like in Dragonball, once they added in power levels, things became redonkulous. At the start of DBZ, 9k was a big deal, and then when Frieza showed up, it's millions. Then near the end, it's in the trillions.

** As I am currently writing a MoD!Harry, I guess I'm guilty of perpetuating this trope. I don't see it as often, and several of the examples where it was used were in stories that I enjoyed, like Rise of the Wizards.

I generally prefer super!Harry stories, and the MoD concept is loosely canon (even though it is entirely undefined). It's more logical than "Gringotts powerup!" or "Black library study!" or "Founders Knowledge!" stories, after all.

I think the super!Harry trope is more problematic as a whole than simply the MoD! subset in particular. But again, just one guy's opinion!

*** Same I don't see it as often, perhaps because I don't actively look for it. It depends on what "superpowers" being MoD gives Harry whether or not I think it's too OP. I mean if he has the ability to not die, which is basically canon, then I don't see a problem there.

** Me. It screams OP and clashes too much with my interpretation of canon. I've always though MoD meant nothing, just that a person was ready to meet Death ‘like an old friend' and wasn't afraid of it, accepted it. Hallows are just powerful artifacts, not something that really gives you special abilities.

The only time I'm ok with MoD being some sort of... wizarding superhero is when the Hallows are used as a starting point for a plot (like exchanging them for a time/dimensional travel or someone's resurrecting; somehow messing up with them so you're cursed or thrown in other time)

** The Master of Death trope is one that's very very hard to do properly - particularly since it doesn't really fit well into the universe, IMO.

I don't mind if it's used as a setup for something like time travel or universe jumping or the like - then it's just a convenient way to have Harry go back in time.

But as an actual thing, OP main characters are very hard for me to enjoy - and just giving Harry a super powerful boost isn't all that fun.

I think to make it interesting, it would need to be a story that works around that power - I suppose some sort of slowly losing his humanity could be workable.

I much prefer other ways of powering up the protagonists, that take more effort on their end.

I feel the same and that's exactly why I prefer non Harry-centric sorties. He's too much of a blank slate for me, he feels like OC in every other fic. I find it more interesting to read characters like Hermione and Ron changing, adapting and developing, than Harry just getting ‘different settings'.

***** Yeah, in a crossover Harry is a terrible character to focus on IMO. He's so defined by the characters around him in canon that taking him away from that just makes him a generic character, more or less.

I think Hermione, Ron, Luna, or a bunch of others from HP would be a lot more interesting in crossovers - or, my actual preference, crossovers with people going to the HPverse instead usually work better for me.

******* To me, the issue there is that it's not really Harry - it's more like generic good guy wizard.

Ron, Hermione, Luna, etc all have more independent character traits that make them more interesting in crossovers while staying in character imo. And I mean with them individually, not as a group - though the trio going to a different universe would be much more interesting than Harry alone imo. (Or the trio + Voldemort or another antagonist could be interesting too)

** I like it when the combination of the Hallows does something, not being able to control Death, but as in, each of them have different abilities that when combined make one more powerful

I think my favorite one had the Cloak at the full power being able to absorb and shield against all kinds of spells, other had the Stone being the ultimate necromancer tool, temporarily raising recently dead enemies as thralls to fight on your side.

The Wand is mostly just a super wand that lets people do stuff normally impossible(like fixing a broken wand) or cast stronger spells. The best one I've seen is when it's an artifact that can turn into a scythe and was connected to necromancy(the setting has high power levels)

** I liked them when they first started coming out, but over these many years they all are so familiar that I just skip over them, people who write them should have something more unique to them or something more to it that we usually have, as it's kind of boring to read over 10 years (is it that long already, or did I count wrong) of same thing.

  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

** I only like it when it's used for interesting effect.

Like, someone who actually /was/ master of death would gradually become separated from the mundanity of life and would sort of become otherworldly and separate from the daily concerns of humans in the way that the gods do in some lore. Or Or they do their best to remain connected to something, and the conflict in the story comes from them trying to deal with what amounts to immortality.

Like, you live so long that you forget what it's like to be human (sort of like a less interested version of Ego from GUardians of the galaxy 2) or you've lost and will continue to lose everything you've ever loved.

I've seen it done twice in ways I liked, one was for humorous effect and one was sad.

  (Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork.
