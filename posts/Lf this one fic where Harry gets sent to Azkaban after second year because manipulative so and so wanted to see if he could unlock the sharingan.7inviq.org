It was unintentionally really damn funny. If I'm remembering right it was his 8 year old sister who is living with James and Lily in France who planned it all out and got him sent there.


** That actually sounds really cool, definitely emotionally scarring and probably ruins his ability to trust people, but awesome.

** linkffn(Kaleidoscope of Magic by karldin)

There is also spinoff of sorts of that story where Harry time travel back to the beginning of the story.

linkffn(Kaleidoscope of Magic : Machinations of Time by Atlanrom) It's abandoned though.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.

  The moment Harry realized that he can save his daughter with time travel, the fates collapsed. And his traitrous parents thought the sharingan was just a pink eye...Sharingan(Naruto) element. First attempt at fanfic. Spin off from karldin's fic. Completed.
