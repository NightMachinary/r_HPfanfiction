So I'm looking for an old Severus/Hermione story that I read ages ago. Might have been 2012, or before or a little later then that, can't remember.

Can't remember much unfortunately, but if anyone can help I'd appreciate it.

Hermione was kidnapped and Snape found her. I can't remember if she was kidnapped by Death Eaters or Snatchers or someone else entirely.

I think Hermione might have been under a memory spell (or something) because she acted differently. She had been placed in a place with strippers or something to that affect.

Severus managed to get her out of there and the two of them got to a cabin, that was around the time I stopped reading it . I am so sorry for being vague on the story, I just can't remember that much of it. If anyone can help I'd greatly appreciate it.
