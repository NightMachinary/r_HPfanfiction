hi, i was wondering anyone know any fanfictions where after snape calls lily a mudblood and she yells at james where they do a plot where lily reaches her breaking with snape and the marauders and she never speaks or hangs out with either of them again and then the hp universe is drastically altered?

I was curious because i found both snape and the marauders to be disgusting bullies and bad people so i wanted to know if and fanfics exist where lily's life doesn't involve either of them


** not what i am looking for, idea is she doesn't hang out with snape or james anymore and does not marry either of them or any marauders

** I read an alt dimension fic where Lily is married to Remus, can't remember the name though. James Potter isn't friends with the others, but Snape is.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** That's not what the OP is looking for, they want a fic where Lily is basically unflawed, though in canon she is very much so.

Regardless, I do adore that fic.
