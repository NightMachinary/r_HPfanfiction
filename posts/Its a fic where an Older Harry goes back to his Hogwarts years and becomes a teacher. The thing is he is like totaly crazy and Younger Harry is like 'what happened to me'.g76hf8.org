  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

**** I have /a lot/ of troubles with Ron Bashing, and by chapter 2 this fic seem to be full of it. And yet the plot still seem pretty interesting and the fic rather well writen so I guess I'll still try to read it, and someone who hate Ron should love this fic.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done? SLASH HP/? BS/SS

*** I'll de-rec A Black Comedy. The writing is serviceable, but the jokes and implications are just awful. A lot of the â€˜comedy' relies on stereotypes and bigotry. The house elves are literally just caricatures of slaves, with the same speech patterns, and the characters are super casually homophobic. If that doesn't bother you, it also starts up a whole bunch of plot threads and then just abandons them. It has an interesting idea behind it, but suffers horribly in the execution and lack of a good ending.
