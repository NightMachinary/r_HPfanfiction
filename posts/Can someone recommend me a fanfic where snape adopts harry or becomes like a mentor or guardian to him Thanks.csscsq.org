  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** This was the first Sevitus (adoptive father) fic I read and liked: linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes)

This might also be of interest for you -- IMO the best source of Sev(er)itus fics around: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=7]]

The more common kind is the one where Severus is Harry's actual biological father. I generally dislike this, because it usually boils down to one of 2 things implied in the past: Lily being unfaithful and sleeping with a fully established Death Eater which is disturbing, or he left her in a loveless marriage to James "for her safety" which is disturbing as well as plain depressing for all 3 of them.
