Just a sudden thought. Like, there are many stories where Harry is very different from the get go but I've seen few where he saves the unicorn in the forbidden forest somehow. From the top of my head he could get there sooner and protect it so Quirrel can't get to it in first place, he could figure out his self-healing (pretty sure that one is fanon) was done with accidental-magic and manages to imitate it on the unicorn; he could even just have healing potions on him or know healing spells, though those admittedly would be more likely in either genius!Harry or time-traveler!Harry.

Doesn't even need to be a particularly important plot-point.


** IIRC, there's a Nanoha-cross on FFN where Harry saves the unicorn by using Belkan-style magic to transform it into his Familiar.

I /think/ that he also does the same to a crow, but I'm not entirely sure.

Edit - Found it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10181533/1/Reinforced-Magic][Reinforced Magic]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10242368/1/Reinforced-Chamber][Reinforced Chamber]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160013/1/Reinforced-Revelations][Reinforced Revelations]] (slow updates).

** I know I've read several fics where it happens, but it's usually such a minor thing that I can't remember most of them. But there are a few I know about.

In linkffn(Knowing The Future by Danny-Shells) the unicorn is saved and it's even slightly relevant to the plot.

Animagus Mishap! by dragen/The Dark Dragen takes place in fourth year, so the scene with the unicorn happens as in canon, but it is later revealed that the unicorn survived, and she asks Harry for help. The story is also dead, I don't think it was great to begin with, and I'm not linking it due to rule 8.

  Lucy Ogden used to be Harry Potter. Until death brought an opportunity to redo things, just in a different body. And what's this about angel magic and demons? Apparently there's a reason people don't have contact with their guardian angel. (Harry doesn't go back to his old body) AU Fem/Harry

** If you can manage Harry/Snape it happens in linkao3(1024956) edit: Unicorn is the reason for mpreg as well (don't judge my reading choices here)

I think there is also something to do with the unicorn in linkffn(7508449)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
