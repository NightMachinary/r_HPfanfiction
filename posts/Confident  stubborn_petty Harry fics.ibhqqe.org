I understand that, logically, with Harry being completely isolated during an important time in his life, he is somewhat desperate to meet certain expectations and is quick to forgive; always trying to be the bigger man so he's not alone again. His behaviour is reasonable in canon.

I've read or attempted to read many fics (most recently /Rocking The Boat/) that have Harry get fed up with everything and turn over a new leaf only to be beaten back into submission by the very people he seeks support from. Usually it's some kind of emotional blackmail after everyone spills some tears over how he was treated at the Dursleys'.

While this is also very reasonable, it pisses me off to no end because it brings everything back to square one; the only difference is that instead of 'listen to me because I know better and it's for the greater good' it becomes 'listen to me because you're emotionally crippled and I have leverage over your emotional stability' or even 'listen to me because I'm sick of your anguish and you have no one else to turn to' (which is pretty close to canon actually).

Before this turns into a full-blown rant, here's my criteria with regards to content:

- Harry needs to be confident that he can manage on his own (at least for a while) without friends, because he could probably get new friends one way or the other
- He needs to be stubborn and petty enough that after a conflict, he doesn't simply forgive at the first (fake) apology or come running back right away to apologize
- No Lord Potter-Peverell-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin etc
- Dumbledore and Weasley bashing is ok to a degree (preferably without made-up crimes, there's plenty of ammo in canon)
- Poetic justice is nice, but actual justice is not mandatory
- Revenge is optional too, but would be nice

Hopefully, my request is not too unreasonable. Thanks in advance


** Lets see if i can do this right... this fic Might be what your after, the bashing criteria doesn't quite match...

#+begin_quote
  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.
