I'm looking for a fanfic for a friend that I saw ages ago, it's about hermione who time travels and is a lion animagus and makes her own order and defeats Voldemort and all that and she makes Lucius change sides? Help!!!!!


** It's called '/roundabout destiny'/, and is written on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Just search '/Hermione Canopia Potter'/ on Google, and it'll turn up.

It's a SiriusxHermione fic, where James Potter and Hermione are twins, in an entirely new destiny. Lily and Hermione are best friends. Regulus, Severus and Lucuis are spies for Hermione's order in the fic. Hermione is a lioness animagus. Severus, Lily and Hermione are bloos siblings. JIC Someone else is wondering. :)
