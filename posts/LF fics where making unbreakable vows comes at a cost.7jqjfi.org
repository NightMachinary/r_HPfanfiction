There's several fics that play around with ideas on why you can't just make an unbreakable vow every time you need someone to believe you.

I remember reading about each bow imposing a permanent cost on the witness's magic. I also remember about vows leaving some sort of mark on the person vowing something and Harry intensely feeling a vow he's made. All of them might be in one or a bunch of different stories, because I don't remember where I've read about each concept.

Right now, I'm mostly interested in seeing how different authors tackled this, not necessarily a specific story. I'm asking for fics here, but if you have something else that fleshes out Unbreakable Vows, I'll gladly take it.


** linkffn(11858167) The Sum of Their Parts

This has one of them doing things to avoid death from the vow. More complex than that but I don't want to give spoilers.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) tried to make Unbreakable Vows more realistic and /serious/ than canon and fanon make them out to be, as part of its general crusade to make the world more "reasonable".

In that story's universe, an Unbreakable Vow permanently sacrifices part of the binder's magical power ^{(Yes, the story has power levels, stick with it, it's done tastefully enough} ) and instead of punishing violation of the Vow with death, it outright removes your free will to break it --- you literally cannot bring yourself to break the terms of the vow, ever, even under an Imperius.

**** The only problem I have with it is the set-up. It's kind of ironic to try to explain everything "rationally" when the set up is magic, but it was a decently well written nevertheless.

Obviously we have a few favorites floating around where the majority of readers like them, but you can't win everyone.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
