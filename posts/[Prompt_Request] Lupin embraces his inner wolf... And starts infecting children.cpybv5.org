** He never thought he would become /this./

He had fought against it for so long. The aching in his teeth, the itching in his legs, the overwhelming urge to bite. To create more beasts.

It appeared that the longer he fought against it, the more his mind twisted. His thoughts splitting and reforming into demented versions of his original thoughts.\\
He wasn't sure when he became accepting of the idea. Perhaps it was after his first change as a professor, where he could smell the overbearing scent of children. Perhaps it was after several sessions of teaching his best friend's son how to perform the Patronus Charm. Maybe it was after comforting Neville after class in the hallway because of his Boggart. It could have been the time he recommended a list of books to Hermoine to further her understanding of Defense Charms.\\
He wasn't sure when he accepted the idea, but he had embraced it. Embraced the idea of no longer being alone and shunned. He wanted to be looked up too. He wanted to be someone turned to in their time of need. So he bit his first child.

His wolf howled in pleasure after they had lured Harry into the woods one full moon. His teeth sunk deep into the boy's shoulder, the wolf ignoring his cries of pain. It's better this way. Harry would be with him now. He would keep him safe. He would teach him as if he was his own child.\\
Which he was now.

Hermoine was next. Honestly, it made sense to choose the girl. She would be a great mate to his new son in the future. She was smart and headstrong. To have her on their side? They would be unstoppable.

He lured the girl with concern about Harry. She had run into the woods without hesitation, her feet slapping against the cold and unforgiving floor of the forest. Right as she came close to Harry's convulsing body, he had pounced and infected her on her left thigh. She screamed in pain as his teeth punctured into the muscles. The infection had spread quickly, leaving a small feminine werewolf in her place. Since then, Harry's wold refused to leave her side on the full moons.

A second year with blonde hair and a dreamy look was next. He chose her not for what she could for them but what they could do for her. She was an outcast in the house of blue and bronze. This would give her friends, it would give her a family. She had accepted the change quicker than the other two. Promises of a safe Haven had her nodding in agreement to why being a werewolf was better than what she had.\\
He thought about bringing Ron in, but he then thought against it. He didn't need the sanctuary as the other did. He didn't need the family that he was building. But Neville did.

Luna was the one to suggest it. She wanted someone like Hermoine had. She wanted to be able to turn around and have open waiting arms ready to comfort her and tell her it would be all okay. Who would accept her beliefs and not belittle her. Someone who understood.\\
Instead of tricking Neville she asked him. She explained Harry and Hermoine and how he would be part of their family. How he would be stronger and have people to back him up no matter what. She wasn't as good of a manipulator as Professor Lupin but she was able to convince him to see the professor about it. He was able to twist the boy's thoughts and ideas to believe that being a werewolf was what he wanted.\\
It was hard to keep the operation, as Hermoine had coined it, a secret but they did so. Each werewolf would listen and find potential candidates for their Pack. Each full moon brought Remus a new child. A new member to care for and teach.

Cedric Diggory was after Neville, though his change was truly an accident. He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. it had taken quite a few conversations to convince the boy that this was what he wanted. That he needed them. He may have mentioned that if he tried to go against the Pack, that he would deal with him. Permanently.

A seventh year Slytherin, Alice Berkin, was after him. They had found her crying at the edge of the forest after her family had shunned her for her sexuality. They had found her mate in Sixth Year Hufflepuff Mary Tyne.

By the time the school year had ended eleven werewolves were prowling the grounds under the bright moonlight.

And when Peter tried to escape from their Pack Leader, he was quickly ripped to shreds under small sharp fangs.

*** Gloriously screwed up.

Thank you very much!

I made this prompt in response to all those fics that have Lupin embrace the inner wolf, or have a pack, or some junk.

***** It's what I was hoping for.

I'm a terrible writer, but a voracious reader, and I see these tropes pop up in fanfiction. Your response is well-written and highlights exactly what was wrong with the trope.
