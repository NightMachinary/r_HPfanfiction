*** I'm going in boys. A 300k story I haven't seen, and that popular?

Ashamed of myself.

EDIT:

So I've just finished reading it.

1. Seemingly every other scene a character "threw back their head and laughed." I don't know why this causes me such annoyance but my eyes just glaze over each time I read this.
2. Passive voice writing
3. Ending is a bit shit.
4. It isn't superior to the original DH story
5. However, I enjoyed how the final confrontation with Voldemort was orchestrated
6. Everything, within reason, seemed to fall within
7. Use of the word "decimated"

#+begin_quote
  "He'd decimated half the Death Eaters before the rest of us got there." I take the historic view of the word "Decimate" as "to destroy by one tenth" but apparently Google favours the "destroy a large portion" meaning. Just a nitpick, really.
#+end_quote

1. This story is really, really good at getting itself into tense scenes with real consequences and then fucking the scene up the ass by introducing and droning on with dialogue that doesn't matter. Multiple times I had to put my phone aside and just curse the fact that the scene has been chopped low at the legs, then hope the rest of the scene will build something up again.

2. Abuse of adverbs. Harry often /snaps/, Hermione seems to /shout/ a lot. There's lots of bellowing, yelling etc. For me, at least, this was a noticeable point and was ill-used (often made the dialogue unrealistic, i.e. multi-line speech that ends with ..." she shouted.) Like seriously? You couldn't find any other way to break up that block of speech to fit that adverb in there more cleanly?

3. Just nonsense scenes. Like Harry in the hospital recovering near the end. Goes on for too damn long.

4. All that being said, I can't help but be impressed with how many parallels there are between this story and canon Deathly Hallows, given that this story was published before DH.

__

End-result - 5/10, won't be reading it again, though some people would get good mileage out of this fic.

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated fight. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause hold the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU that explores the questions of how much we know ourselves, how much we're truly influenced by our surroundings and how much we do so in turn, whether unexpected consequences arising from the choices we make are our responsibility, and ultimately, whether truth is truly an objective axiom of existence, or only what we make of it.

Pureblood Pretense (and sequels) by murkybluematter on Fanfiction.net

Does a fantastic job, it's a crossover but you don't need to know anything about Alanna the Lioness to enjoy it. Book four is a work in progress and the previous three books all show careful planning and interesting characterisation. I find it incredibly easy to enjoy each time I re-read it.

** 'Well-written,' is, of course, highly subjective. Someone could have shit prose but good plot/character ideas, and vice versa. I prefer character-driven to plot-driven, so here are some with great prose and characterization:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]] and all her other fics are fantastic. I'm currently reading her latest [complete] fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12431049][we can still be, who we said we were]], which is part of her sequel series to /The Changeling/. Great coming-of-age story and depiction of Ginny.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7213144][Let Perpetual Light]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tehtarik/pseuds/tehtarik][tehtarik]] is beautifully written as well, with an interesting alternate take on the Deathly Hallows mythos and depiction of Ariana.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/24216/Lady-Altair][Lady Altair]] is one of the most recced fics I've seen here, for good reason. Packs a punch in less than 2000 words. In my opinion, it takes skill to condense that much emotion into so few words.

** If we're talking about the craft of /writing/, as opposed to what fanfiction one likes, then one of the best is definitely Taure's most recent story, Victoria Potter.

It's been too long since I touched either one of them to say with certainty, so take this with a grain of salt, but Newcomb's linkffn(What You Leave Behind) and linkffn(Circular Reasoning) by Swimdraconian also feature what I judge to be good writing.

Also anything by joe6991 since Unfound Door. Of his earlier stuff (2010 and before) I know Wastelands, and prose there gets heavy-handed--which doesn't prevent it from being a good story, of course. I never read the Hero Trilogy, so no comment on that.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave]] (and the associated 7 book series).

It's like Harry Potter the way I wanted it to be. It takes the common tropes (Slytherin Harry, Snape Mentor, Harry is a Twin/not the boy who lived, Draco/Harry pairing ) and really turns it on head. It is a slash fic but that's hardly the point in fact I think in the whole damn series maybe one sex scene occurs if you're sensitive to slash pairings. It features complicated but reasonable pureblood society with a variety of factions and political intrigue and reasonable motivations. A pretty wild magic system with a system of checks and balances. Deals with the questions of creatures rights and the general backwardness of wizard society. Deals with the idea of subtle forms of child neglect and the repercussions of this on ego and development. Even the OCs are so well thought out I forgot they didn't exist in Canon. Plus I've read it about four times in full and I still enjoy it.

It's a bit of a slow start but the writing is very good (the writer is as far as we know an English professor).

** *Chasing the Sun* linkffn(7413926) is good, despite a pairing I would never read otherwise.

*Exile* linkffn(6432055) is a very unusual fic, in which Draco is humanized without resorting to any Draco in Leather Pants-type justifications. Slow burn and set almost entirely in the Muggle world.

*I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love* linkffn(11923164) Title is a bit melodramatic, but fitting this very touching fic about Snape and Luna Lovegood. Not a romance fic, don't worry.

*Not From Others* linkffn(11419408) and *Australia* linkffn(7562379) are both very well-written as well.

But hand's down, the most well-written fic I've ever read is not HP-related at all. It's an Inuyasha fic set in the classical Heian period of Japan, *Behind the Silk Screen* linkffn(3845343). If you're at all into history or stories like Memoirs of a Geisha this is the one for you. This fic hasn't been updated since 2013, and other that a vague author bio update in 2017 there's been no sign of more to come. Still, the story is already over 300k words and I absolutely recommend it despite it being unfinished.

** It depends exactly what you mean by "well-written".

I'm definitely biased but I love linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) for its incredibly subtle plotting. Too subtle for many on here, alas, but hey.

For the best OCs in any story, linkffn(A Long Journey Home) can't be beaten. There's a lot more to recommend on this one, but that's always my #1 point.

But there are a lot of stories where the writing is superb: the eternally unfinished Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past and Unlike a Sister spring to mind.

** Linkffn(12132374)

Six pomegranate seeds by Seselt and Annerb's stories are the only two stories that I still follow.

Six pom is lyrical at times and the author should really write original fiction IMHO. The prose creates an atmosphere that has made this story on par with Stages of Hope linkffn(6892925). The character development is slow in the beginning but that's understandable as the author is building towards what is happening right now in the story. Annerb's Changeling series has some of the same features. Excellent prose, at times more human or relatable characters and the potential in the plot is astounding. I love the balance she ( I'm assuming they are a she) hits between character development, romance and plot. It is in that sense better that Six Pomegranate but SPS has better prose.
