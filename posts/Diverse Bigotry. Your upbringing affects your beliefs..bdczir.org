Mild bigotry. Not like Lucius or Draco's views on muggles and mudbloods. Just misunderstandings or whatnot due to how they were raised. I'm not saying any of these things are canon, but I feel it would be a fascinating thing to see in a story. To add more depth to a character in a way. Not to bash these characters, and these are just examples.

The way you are raised affects what you believe. The Weasleys can be totally in favor of muggles and muggleborns while still holding incredibly wrong and offensive ideas about them. The classic Ignorant Ally.

I'm talking about Arthur Weasley being very accepting of Hermione while not being convinced she is particularly powerful given she's just a muggleborn. It's what he was told all his life after all.

Dumbledore is a nice guy and all, but a story where he objects to homosexuality as being wrong and is deeply ashamed of himself.

Sirius loves muggles! He just thinks that their women should stay in suggestive poses to make posters in his bedroom.


** The general assumption that Muggles are inferior to wizards (and can therefore be abused, insulted and obliviated without a second thought) is an underlying theme in most of my fics because my OC is a Muggle. But to be fair, that's canon anyway. There aren't any real positive representations of Muggles or squibs in canon.

** not sure what the point of this post apart from saying that cultural and enviromental factors weigh into your personal belief system.

Dumbledore being against homosexuality makes sense the dude grew up in the 80's the 1880's

as for the sirius thing, we do not know if he thought about muggles but was using it to piss his mother off

the Arthur thing makes the least sence as ever since he has known hermione ron would be telling how smart should would be

*** My purpose was to share my opinions and get feedback.

I did state that it wasn't canon. Given the age of the Harry Potter series, I would go so far as to say that the amount of fanon is approaching the amount of canon that is used.

***** The fanon that is terrible tends to be left behind and leave canon. There are exceptions, but there is a bit of natural selection at play to sort out the truly horrible.

** I know it was a throwaway joke, but the line where Mr. Weasley asked about the purpose of a rubber duck really shows his biggotry. Because he sees muggles as a novelty, as something amusing with amusing little things.

He made no effort in actually learning anything about the non magical world. The best stories with him is the ones where he is seen by the wizarding world to know a lot about muggles and is sent out to go undercover, and he ends up being the most ignorant simply because he is so patronizing.

*** I'm on mobile, so forgive me. I had to stop playing BotW for this.

"Are you sure about this?"

Arthur laughed, "I've been studying muggles for years! I'm certainly the must suited of us."

The two sat in silence as he finished pulling on his tanktop. Molly bit her lip and said,"I've never seen any muggles dressed like this though. I've been out there with Hermione, so I've seen them as well."

The patriarch hummed to himself as he toyed with the straps on his heels. The boots he tried before were a tad small, so this would have to do. "You haven't seen the muggles I've seen. I am quite certain I've seen many of them dressed just like this."

Molly continued talking, but he was too busy untangling some sort of fishnet to really hear her. He realized she stopped talking about the time he finally pulled them up to his thighs. "I absolutely love these! They feel like someone is hugging my legs!" He felt a tad upset they ended so soon, but his shorts made it look like they went higher.

Molly groaned and grabbed his arm in a final plea," Arthur, this is just indecent. If Ginny sees you-"

"Then she'll finally have a good sense of fashion."

With a final look in the mirror, Arthur Weasley went out on his mission, but he needed a muggle who knew how to drive first. He loved this one little shop - it was filled with all sorts of muggle bits - and he saw people dressed just like him being picked up all the time. He was certain it must've been the Tacksies he heard about.

*** Is it bigotry though? I mean, imagine how you would view a tribe of Homo Erectus(Erecti?) humans if they existed today. To us, it would look like a quaint and cute, but essentially stupid group of people that fumble around with no idea of how the world works. Not that we know everything, but the feeling of superiority is as normal as it is expected. And the Sapiens-Erectus comparison is about intelligence mostly, while the wizard-muggle comparison is about the control of, essentially, a superpower, so the feeling of superiority is equally amplified.

**** He asks about the function of a rubber duck. That isn't looking on normal humans as strange, that's him not taking any effort in learning about them and only looking on them as strange things.

***** I said quaint, cute and stupid for a reason. Arthur's reaction is like: "Oh, look at these adorable little apes and their cute workarounds to magic. I wonder what this rubber duck does?" To wizards, normal people look like what apes look like to us. I guarantee you, if we were able to ask apes anything and get an answer, the question: "What is the function of the stick that you lug around all day?", would be asked before the question: "What is the hierarchy of you tribe?", mostly because we already know most of these things through observations.

Bigotry, mild or otherwise, implies negative emotions toward another group of humans or ,in this case, another group of wizards. Most muggle supporting wizards want to protect muggles the same way you and I want to protect rhinos. They like muggles and understand their significance, but they recognize that they're not the same.

** Slughorn is a good canon example, acting so surprised that Lily, a muggleborn, was so talented. At least he wasn't bigoted enough to be blind to her talent.

One of my fics will have Sirius remark that “Muggle girls are so passionate and exotic,” but I haven't posted that chapter yet.

I'm working on a fic that shows Tonks's conventional anti-werewolf bigotry before Remus is outed. She commits a lot of microagressions before she finds out.

  Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?

** So I think essentially what you're asking for is microaggressions?

here's some examples of possible microaggressions towards muggleborns that I am making up/parodying with a wizarding flair

- assuming you either took muggle studies or that you got an OWL in muggle studies
- you don't act like all the rest of the muggleborns
- i don't see you as a muggleborn
- you're pretty good at magic for being a muggleborn
- when i look at you, i don't see blood status
- i'm not a blood purist, i have several muggle and muggleborn friends
- oh, you're muggleborn? i bet you'd get along with [name of another muggleborn]
