** Harry/Daphne: linkffn(Contractual Invalidation; Days to Come; Unatoned; Novocaine; A Game of Style and Brutality; Amalgamation Agreement). The last one is more for the sheer effort the author(s) made to break fan tropes.

Ron centric. For me, it's not only the definitive Ron/Hermione story, but the best post war story to date.

Great characterisation, plenty of Grief and healing, and one of the most realistic depictions of romance in hpff.

Fair warning, Harry/Ginny is in the background if that bothers you.

*** My problem with Harry/Ginny is its either canon-like, which is shit and boring, or way too OOC to me. I like Ginny as a side character, or as an ex-wife/gf that isn't that tropey shit of jealousy and potion-mistress crap. There are a few that I enjoyed, mostly fics where Harry and Ginny either never met in school, or when he's not the BWL, which is rare. But I think it mostly comes down to her canon personality. She's too prone to anger to my taste. About your suggestion, even if it isn't Hermione-centric, I'm assuming she's a MC, so idk. How is her personality there? PTSD, war veteran mind-set, or is it angsty-filled drama?

**** Yeah, she is a main in the story.

There is quite a bit of drama, and Hermione and Ron take turns being the caregiver for each other.

Hermione's main concerns in the story are taking care of Ron after Fred died (while grieving herself), searching for her parents (and the guilt that comes with it), and dealing with the her trauma after being tortured.

It's not overly heavy with PTSD/veteran themes, focusing more on grief, family and love, which are big themes in canon as well.

I find most Harry/Ginny fics boring too, but they are definitely only in the background here, and are absent after Ron and Hermione leave for Australia.
