My personal favorite sort of fanfiction is one where the main character is hideously overpowered and just sort of flits about doing whatever happens to catch his/her fancy. Maybe throw in a bit of slice of life and it's perfect.

Examples would be "The Peculiar Shopkeeper," "A Demon Lord's Hero," "Shinobi of the High Seas," and NoodleHammer's Trilogy. If you guys have any HP themed recs (Or any at all that fit that genre) it would be appreciated. Please and thank you!

Bear through the mis-spellings and general lack of editor polish and you'll enjoy some of the keenest coincidental comedy in the HP fandom.

** Not a Harry Potter fic, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001646/01/Nothing-but-Trouble][Nothing But Trouble]] is pretty fun.

** might try Hogwarts Strike Team by Myricle (I think). One of the better time travel mechanics. I think it's an interesting story, bit different than the normal Super!power.
