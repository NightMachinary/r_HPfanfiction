I read the start ages ago and now I can't remember what the title is anymore. Voldemort wins but doesn't kill Harry. Just his parents (I think). Basically the only thing I can really remember is that at Hogwarts the students are divided by their blood status. This is then shown by what colour robes they wear. Pureblood get black robes, Halfblood get black robes with grey trim and Muggleborns have grey robes. Harry as the son of traitors has to wear white robes. Any help would be appreciated!
