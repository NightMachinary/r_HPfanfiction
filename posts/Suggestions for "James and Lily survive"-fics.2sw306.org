I've read one, and I can't remember its name, but it was on LJ (I think) and I didn't very much like it. Do you have any suggestions for me?

*** I second [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived*]].

One of the best.

***** DLP is the best. It's a community made of the best writers and most avid readers in the HP fanfiction universe. I recommend checking out their library and looking at the reviews to find fics that are truly amazing and enjoyable. If you want to find stories with a certain theme (eg mentor!Dumbledore) just put something up in the Story Search thread to find the best of the best for said theme.

**** I also despise Drarry, and because of that it took me a long time to read this. Don't fall into that trap! It was excellent, so good!

** The Promises Trilogy by Robin4 is very good! It is a 'what if everyone had survived and were still fighting Voldemort 22 years later' story. The first story can be found here : [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/]]
