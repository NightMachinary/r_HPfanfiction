Idk if there is any like that or similar but please? üòÖ‚úåÔ∏è

Edit: if there's any with Snape nice to Harry in public too ? Idk if those even EXIST but yk üòÇüòÇ


** Here's one where Snape is mean to Harry in public but kind to him in private. It's mentioned that he was friends with Lily and held Harry as a baby. The fic turns Snarry but only after Harry is of age. linkao3(14656377)

It's basically the Jacob/Renesmee relationship from /Twilight/ but 80% less creepy. Snape realizes he's Harry's soulmate so he disappears until Harry is eleven and then keeps his interactions friendly and platonic until Harry's old enough.

  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, everything is overwhelming. Luckily he makes some friends, Hagrid who took him to Diagon Alley, Ron who he met on the train, and Severus, who explains why they have to pretend to hate each other.This story spans 7 years, during which Severus and Harry get to know each other and find understanding.
