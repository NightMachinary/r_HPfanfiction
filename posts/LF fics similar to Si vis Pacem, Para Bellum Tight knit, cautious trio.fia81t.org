Hi! So aside from constantly checking for updates, I wanted to ask if anyone has found fics similar to linkffn(12302907) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] where loyalty and an us against the world belief has basically proven necessary. Competent, focused on improving themselves, pragmatic, and dangerous while still accepting that they need advice and seeking training.

I keep rereading it and am hungry for more. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it regardless.

TIA!

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

** Also seconding this.

IIRC there are some post-War fics that have Harry and his friends like this, but I can't remember much, if anything, about them.

I think one had Luna pregnant, and she, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Fred/George were paranoid, suspicious of everything, and closely knit, like a commando unit.

** I asked something similar over a year ago, but didn't get all too many replies unfortunately: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8h7b3y/request_lf_fics_with_a_proactivecapable_trio/][link]]

You might like The Sum of Their Parts (linkffn(11858167)) or possibly linkffn(Forging the Sword) if you've not already come across them, although they are both much different in tone to Mister Cynical's more tongue-in-cheek style. If all else fails you might want to look through their favourite stories on their profile, or message Jack directly and ask if he can recommend stories he's enjoyed where fellowship/camaraderie play a strong role.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
