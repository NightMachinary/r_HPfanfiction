I'd love to see some Hermione-centred fics where she studies beyond the curriculum/unknown magics etc (becomes an apprentice?). She could be a Slytherin, evil, light, not friends with the trio, whatever, as long as it's totally Hermione centred. I don't mind any pairings, though it'd be nice to have no romance. Thanks!

Edit: no crossovers please, I forgot to mention it.

Edit: spelling mistake


** I love linkao3(Shield and Star - Book 1) and can't wait for the next installation of the series.

** Applied anthroplogogy.

Its about a hermione that slowly turns grey after being sorted into slytherin

The author does a great job describing the magic system and makes hermione learning magic enjoyable.

It's abandoned but there are a fair amount of chapters written.
