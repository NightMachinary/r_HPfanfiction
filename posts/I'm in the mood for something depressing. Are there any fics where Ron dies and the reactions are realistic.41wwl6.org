And not the classic case of "Yippee, Ron's dead! Harry, now I can finally confess my undying love for you and we can ride into the sunset on a thestral with rainbows flying out of its arse."

Nah, I want a fic where Ron dies and Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys are as torn apart as you'd expect them to be.


** *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925). What Harry and Hermione went through was utterly traumatizing: [[/spoiler][Both Ron and Ginny were killed, as with most of the Weasley family. The level of affection Harry and Hermione showed each other was stronger than most Harmony shipping stories, but the author never brought them together]]

*Harry Potter's Promise*, linkffn(3974563). One shot, but very emotional story [[/spoiler][Before the final battle, Ron made Harry to promise to take care of Hermione if something happened to him. Ron died, and Ginny was slightly crippled. The promise must be full filled, what would Harry do?]]

  Just before the final battle, Harry asks Ron to make sure he takes care of Ginny such that she never has to worry about the basics of life if he should die in battle. Ron thinks that's a good idea and asks Harry to do the same... see top of story

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

**** Although the author said it was supposed to be a dig at Harmony shippers, the story is so dark and the ending so sad (outcome significantly worse than the canon), I don't see it as a crackfic at all.

** linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) - plenty of depressing turns throughout, and even something to fit the original request right towards the end, there.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

  Even magic has its limits. She helped end a war and lived through some things people never should, but there are certain things that no one can overcome or undo - not even Hermione Granger - and it's a long, hard road to accepting the hand that fate deals. Hermione/Ginny
