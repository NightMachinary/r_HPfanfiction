*/Assuming they don't do it the "muggle way" of course/*

Is there an actual stork that delivers it? A cabbage patch where they find their baby? Is it a summoning spell aimed at the fetus? A portkey inserted into the womb? Do they engorge the vagina and cervix and squat underneath with a catcher's mitt?

This has come up multiple times in the IRC/Discord chat and we've never gotten a consensus.

** Of course via Vaginal Portkeys™.

When labor begins a trained mediwitch simply enchants a wristband, levitates it into the woman, and a portkey activates, porting the baby right out.

This avoids any complication and pain, and is the preferred method, since it reduces the amount of accidential magic a baby can do during the stressful birth, which otherwise might be painful for the mother.

In fact, the mortality rate for witches and women of muggleborn children during childbirth was much higher than for normal, muggle, birthings -- which is why it was often said that witches kill their mothers, worsening the witch-hunts.

And the converse sadly was also misinterpreted: If your mother died during your childbirth it was very easy to be accused as a witch, leading to more innocent deaths.

In modern times the ministry informs muggle doctors to advise a c-section if they are lucky enough to detect a magical child in the womb, or will covertly help during childbirth otherwise.

The doctors are of course memory-charmed afterwards, but usually voluntarily consent to that.

Edit:

When Merope was pregnant, she never told the ministry out of ignorance, and they didn't detect Tom Riddle being magical because she was magical as well.

Some education probably would have saved Merope Gaunt, and might have changed Voldemort.

*** That is completely ridiculous. Port keying the baby could adversely affect it.

The real way they do it is portkey the mother and levitate the baby that remains.

**** Wouldn't that mean no portkeys if you are pregnant?

Actually that would make a lot of sense. Seeing how badly brain damaged Cabbe and Goyle are. Gives dropping the baby on it's head a new meaning entirely. Or should I say dropping the fetus.

**** Sure, but that's part of the fun. Magcial babies are resistant, and the spinning helps them cry the first time. Also, they don't travel too far.

On the other hand, wizards /do/ seem to lack common sense sometimes, so that might be worth looking into.

** Pottermore does mention a "midwife" overseeing the birth of Neville, so probably it does happen pretty much the Muggle way... or at least close enough that they have a job title that's exactly the same as with the Muggles. :)

Most of the ideas you present here sound... kind of messy and dangerous; even more so than an actual birth. Now, I'm sure magic is used to make things easier, like magical painkillers or what have you, but I'm pretty sure the actual birth is pretty much the same.

** The magical midwives reading this thread are shaking their heads.

"No mention of pointing the legs towards the current celestial House. Nothing about the incense and inscriptions to keep away changelings and such. No consideration of what en-spelling an unnamed child could have on its magical development."

"No discussion of Divination or Astronomy at all!"

"If this is what they're teaching at Hogwarts, it's no wonder we're seeing fewer magical children born in each generation."

"When was the last time you were consulted on the right day during the first trimester?"

"Molly Weasley; it's like they all think she was an idiot and had all those strong children by happenstance."

** Apparation. It's a different technique to side-along someone, so when the baby is ready to be born you just stand in the birthing pool and apparate. If the baby is really ready, they'll be left behind, if they're not, then you can just try again later.

The same principles hold true for portkeys and floo -- once the baby is it's own person, then the mother traveling leaves it behind (this lead to the inventor of the floo powder being lynched in Diagon Ally after an expectant mother accidentally burned her baby alive instead of going to the store). This is why midwives are so popular, it's dangerous for expectant mothers (or, rather, for the unborn children) to travel magically during the last month of pregnancy.

But that's a boring answer. Though it does answer the question of “why do half the wizards/witches behave as if someone dropped them on the head as a baby”.
