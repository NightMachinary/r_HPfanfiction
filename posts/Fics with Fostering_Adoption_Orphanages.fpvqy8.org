So, are there any fics that cover this sort of thing - a character being fostered or adopted from a home, or their experiences in a home or orphanage or similar place? I don't care who the character is or who they're adopted by, but I'm looking for some coverage of the actual process itself.

eg. Harry is left out by the Dursleys and is taken to a home or orphanage, the story talks about his arrival and either conflicting with the kids there or settling in with them, then meeting prospective adoptive parents, him agreeing to be adopted, some home visits, etc.

Think the Tracy Beaker-esque situations, if you're familiar with her books/tv series. That's the kind of scenarios/details covered I'm looking for. The actual adoption bit, rather than immediately fast-forwarding to him living with the new parent, basically.

As I said, any characters involved at all are okay, even if it's Harry being adopted by OOC!Nice!Voldemort or whatever without any actual growth or explanation as to why he is now 'nice Voldemort'. I'm partially curious about how much/how well this sort of thing is covered in HP Fanfiction - for all the 'Harry is taken in by someone other than his parents/the Dursleys' fics, I've seen almost none of these fics - and only partially wanting to actually read stuff like this.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** There would be linkffn(11540013), where Harry gets adopted by Voldemort and while the procedure for him is quite fast etc they get to adopt another kid later on and the procedures have been changed around at that point so there is a lot more to it then.

There are some other fics, but I think most skip over the actual real adoption process, and just have the characters sign some papers and bam now they are magically your new guardian blabla.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

Yeah, they do and it's really quite sad sometimes - it can make for some really interesting, character-driven moments when prospective-parents and prospective-child meet, or when the prospective-parents talk to adoption staff about why they want to adopt, etc. Sort of a mix of Meet the Robinsons (the Disney Movie) and Instant Family (the Wahlburg Movie).

Thanks for the rec. Do you know when the second kid gets adopted? General ballpark, I mean - it's rather a lot to read through at just-under 900K words and I'd like to know vaguely when it'll get to what I want to read. :)

**** There is an adoption ritual somewhere around chapter 20 for a boy that is adopted into the Nott family, that is at least somewhat explored, and then the adoption into the Slytherin Family happens in chapter 88, but there is a whole bunch of pre-adoption talks etc in the chapters before and afterwards some visits from the Wizarding Child Services (or whatever they are called).

Also Harrys adoption is very fast, but the author tries to also deal with the fall out of Harry basically having no choice in the whole thing. Which would be the beginning of the story.

Edit: They also in general explore the setting of an orphange and a primary school etc and how those are run, so maybe the whole story will be a bit more engaging as a whole besides you just waiting for the adoption parts to start :)

** This is a big chunk of the initial sections of linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), where Harry is taken from the Dursleys and placed in a 're-education' orphanage for muggleborns. It makes sense in context.

Harry is also raised in a muggle orphanage in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), and is in conflict over leaving his former childhood friends behind for much of the story.

** I don't specifically know of stories with orphanages in the mix but there is a series i like that is called "alternate living arrangements" by triscribe and the author explores in each story a different situation for Harry to grow up in. Sadly all or most of all the stories in the series are incomplete, but still wholesome reading, to me

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1040795]]

In the same vein, with a Dumbledore who is for once not the selfish meddler so many authors love to bash, there is this story I'm following right now, "the Phoenix burns brightest" by AnyaYanko, in which Dumbledore himself is tasked with raising Harry

*** Oh i was forgetting, there is the "Animagus verse" series by White Squirrel, in which a five year old Harry escapes the abusive Dursleys accidentally turning into a kitten and ends up being adopted by the Grangers. Very interesting reading but I for myself lost interest once the story veered more toward politics (of the same author I find brilliant the interpretation they have for the subject of Arithmancy, well explored in their series "Arithmancer verse" but there the focus is on Hermione so it's completely off topic now)

**** The Animagus-verse is a good example of what I'm looking for initially, yeah. That whole bit with Ms Wilkins and the placement process is what I'm wanting more of. I've read it before, unfortunately, but yeah. That's precisely what I'm looking for, so thanks for the rec!

Alternative Living Arrangements seems close-ish, but not quite. Implied processing, at least, is a step up from no processing at all. Read the first chapter and it was definitely fun, wholesome reading as you said - I enjoyed the slight "What the heck am I doing, feeding Potter's damn bird?" tone to Snape's last scene. :D

Phoenix Burns Brightest is definitely not - as far as I can tell, Dumbledore just takes the kid with no processing whatsoever. It is a good story, so thank you for the rec regardless. :)

** Part one of the series Crow Rides A Pale Horse has what you're looking for, Harry grows up in a home for boys after being abandoned. The series is still WiP, and the world building and magic feel epic. I think there is also a part later that focuses on Lupin coming to the home and finding Harry. As the series progresses, there are bits about his childhood there, but the later parts have less of that.

** Less dark are these:

- it is not the main focus of the plotline, but in linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) (highly recommended!) Harry post-war is the patron of an orphanage for the war orphans, and it is very relevant for the story.

- in linkffn(3912184;4236594) Daphne Greengrass (very different from your stereotypical Haphne, and IMHO the best one out there) is an orphan, living (outside of Hogwarts) with her foster mother, who is a squib.

**** Neither of them have any entrance processing: in the first one, the actual orphans are just already living in the orphanage sponsored by Harry, in the Daphne ones the story is in her sixth and seventh years, so the orphanage (or actually the foster mother) is mostly in her memories. There is one scene, where she leaves that home because her foster Mum (being a squib) runs away to France, because Voldemort would not be kind to her, and Daphne is for few months before she is seventeen taken over by Weasleys, and then the paperwork is mostly “Albus made the paperwork go away”.

Are these the fics you're talking about, since the bot seems to have taken a moment off?

** Did you read this one already? Fostering a Nightmare: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12663206/1/Fostering-a-Nightmare]]

The Grangers take in foster child Tom Riddle. It talks a little about Tom's fostering history (minor spoiler: it's bleak).

It does end up being a Tom/Hermione story.

*** I don't think so, no. And yeah, I got that from the immediate edgelord "I don't give trigger warnings, everything but graphic rape and paedophilia is fair game" warning in the first paragraph of the first AN. Nobody says that if they're only writing happy things. :D

Is he still Voldemort in this story? And if so, is there some growth towards his and Hermione's relationship to explain how the leader of Magical Nazis and a Muggleborn got together?

Thanks for the rec!

** If you don't mind crossovers, there's a crossover with the Avengers series titled "Fates Be Changed" where Bruce Banner adopts Harry. I loved this story because the author explores how the two met and how they slowly adjusted to one another. In fact, they didn't even get to Hogwarts until many chapters later. linkffn(11397437)

  An orphan and an outcast, living two lives that should never have intercepted. However what could happen if a nudge forces these worlds to collide? With a new name and a new father will the Boy-Who-Lived accept what Fate marked him for? A Bruce Banner/Harry Potter father/son relationship. Skip to Chapter 13 for the start of the Avengers.

*** I mean, I don't mind cross-overs, but I know pretty much nothing about Avengers. I saw the first movie when it came out and found it intensely dull and generic and never watched another one. If the Hogwarts action is that late, I'm assuming Avengers stuff is quite prevalent in this story?

**** Except for Bruce Banner's presence, there's no Avengers up until chapter 13. And if the Avengers stuff really bores you that much, you can just skip from chapter 13 to chapter 23. That's when Harry gets to Hogwarts and the story pretty much focuses on Hogwarts & Voldemort from then on.
