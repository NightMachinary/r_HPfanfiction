:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a hp fic where a first year student hits harry with a reveal spell in the common room and reveals his scars and then the students of hogwarts come together to question harry about his experiences and what he wants to do regarding the war. I think I remember Luna being given free reign for questions? If anyone can help me find this fic it would be much appreciated!
