** Historically slash fics have been grouped in (whether inadvertently or not) with NC-17 and other mature content that were targets of purges on both [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Strikethrough_and_Boldthrough][LJ]] and [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/FanFiction.Net%27s_NC-17_Purges:_2002_and_2012#Fan_Comments_Regarding_the_2012_Purge][FFN]], initial discussions around [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Archive_of_Our_Own][AO3]] were actually started after one of the LJ purges

*** This. AO3 was literally created to host slash. Naturally it has a ton of slash.

**** Wait was it made to host slash? I always thought it was made to hold anything and everything anybody wants to write no matter the content.

***** Not specifically slash, no, but a lot of slash writers moved there /because/ of the ability to post there no matter the content, but there's also quite a bit of smut there too both het and slash

***** It /is/ made for everything, but it was the slash being endangered that prompted its creation.

***** Yes, you could post whatever you wanted, but there were plenty of options for non-slash. It wasn't restricted to slash, but it was made so people had a safe place to post it without the risk of capricious admins bowing to advertiser pressure and taking it down.

** Because the community that posts on AO3 likes slash.

** It has do with A) the freedom of the site. Unlike FF.net they allow M rated fics B) it has to do with majority women writers who write slash not because they like gay sex but because its the only way they can write sex and feel like they're writing a relationship in which they have choice and completely equality. Also the lack of female characters in most fandoms. When only the male characters have personalities of course the male characters get real relationships. You'll notice Harry Potter has less slash then alot of other fandoms because it has developed female characters.

** As a reader (and in no way a writer) from what I can tell other sites, such as ff seem to have more censorsing on them and don't allow the same level of content. I may be wrong, but that's what I've been able to figure out anyway

** They sort of got funneled there from other sites. There's already 100,000 (or whatever arbitrarily large number you want to pick) slash fics on FFN. So if you want your fic to stand out, you go to the new site where there's not already a thousand identical fics to the one you're going to post, a site where lots of other people have the same exact idea to post there and where people there aren't completely sick of indy!Harry version #2050. It's the lowest common denominator.
