:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking everywhere for a specific fic where Tom Riddle manages to travel to the future. I can only remember vague details, but here are a few big ones: Dumbledore takes Tom to the Burrow where he will be staying with the Weasleys. While Tom is meeting Arthur and Molly, Harry and the other kids are out at Diagon Alley, but Harry gets a feeling somethings going on and they all return in time to see Tom at the Burrow. I also think Luna and Hermione meet Tom earlier in Diagon Alley but he introduces himself under a different name. Also, I recall that Tom was tasked with feeding the chickens while staying with the Weasleys, which he really enjoys, and Molly keeps trying to make him go outside to join in with the other kids who are playing quidditch.

I would really appreciate it if anyone knows what I'm talking about. It's so strange to me that I can't find it after days of going through multiple sites for it.


** That sounds a lot like linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380/chapters/39160087][Diablerie]]by Oceanbreeze7). I don't remember the chicken part and I don't think he changed his name in it, but Tom definitely lives at the Burrow, has a connection with Harry, and has a disastrous visit with Luna and Hermione in Diagon Alley.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

**** Thanks so much for responding!

You're right that these share a lot of the same features, but it's unfortunately not the story I had in mind. The feeding of the chickens was actually a pretty significant thing in the story, because Tom keeps thinking about the simple joy he gets from watching them.

Another part that might help is that when the group gets back from Diagon Alley, they send Tom upstairs so they can discuss it without him there. He goes up to another landing, and eventually Hermione comes up and talks to him. She seems pretty reasonable, but she does warn him that she won't be nice if he is up to anything.

Also, there's a bit where everyone is getting up to have breakfast with Molly cooking. Tom tries to carefully plan where he sits so that he can avoid certain people, but I think Fred and George screw up his plan and land him to close to Harry anyways.

I'm so frustrated because I can recall so many details, but I just can't seem to find it!
