** I know I've mentioned it in posts before, but I'll have to recommend Vitam Paramus again for this.\\
linkffn(9444529)

It follows Harry as he faces some major changes in his life, including being traded to a new quidditch team and the loss of a number of people close to him. Hints of Harry/Gabrielle near the end, but does not revolve around romance.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** There is linkffn(letters) which is fourth year interhouse quidditch team, and linkffn(a game of style and brutality) both also have romance but the second is more quidditch oriented. There's also linkffn(Harry potter and the veela by z-bond) though I haven't finished it, Harry and his friends get into the U17 European quidditch league for puddlemere I think.

*** Wrong letters I believe it's linkffn(letters by endless7) so we'll see if that works. Ignore the letters not read one. No idea what that is.
