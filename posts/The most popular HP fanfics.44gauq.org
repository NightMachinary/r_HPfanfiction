Hi everyone, I'm pretty new to the Harry Potter fanfiction community so I am looking for those fanfictions that everyone has read? I'm looking for the 'big' fanfics that everyone loved and are massive in the community so I can be all up to date and know what everyone is talking about! Thank you ☼

I assure you, there's no single fanfic in the community that /everyone/ loved. Far too many varying opinions in the HP fandom for that to ever happen, and even the most popular fics have their detractors.

For the list of most popular fanfics in the sub, see the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/][most popular fanfics]] thread. Sadly, the list hasn't been updated in a while, but it's still good to go for a beginner.

**** Out of the first 100 lines (which is only 86 stories), I've not read exactly seven. And only three interest me, so I guess I'm doing something right. Or maybe I've just been reading fanfiction for too long.

** *Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past*, linkffn(2636963), is the story with highest count of favorites (I don't care for number of reviews) on fanfiction.net.

Unfortunately, it has been a WIP for more than 10 years and only reached middle of year 4. I doubt it would ever be completed.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** I've never read Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality, but that's hugely popular. It has its own subreddit too! It's AU. The Alexandra Quick series is also very popular, but it only has token mentions to canon.

I can't say I've been involved in fanfic for long enough to pass much in the way of judgement, but the big ones I know of are the following. (All canon or canon compliant)

1. The Life and Times (Not sure on the author)
2. These Cuts We Have, by Melindaleo
3. In Care Of, by Fang's Fawn

If you're looking for popular authors, little0bird has dozens of hugely popular stories. Melindaleo isn't as well known but is absolutely fantastic, in my humble opinion.

  Alexandra Quick series is also very popular

I'd take issue with that. It's not nearly as popular as a lot of other fics, and there's a sizable faction of people who hate the protagonist.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
