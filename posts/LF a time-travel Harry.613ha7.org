I am looking for a fanfic where Harry gets send back to his school years but Harry doesn't do any of his heroic actions.

Not going after the stone, not going into the chamber and so on.

Thank you


** So he lets Riddle win?

****** Ah. One would hope then he'd tell dumbledore everything he needs to know then he'd fuck off from hogwarts but not be suicidal.

** He does that many times in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]], but given that each timeline is usually only a paragraph it probably won't be what you're looking for.

** Yea there are plenty where harry time travels and doesn't remotely follow cannon (so sorta AU), but asking for one where cannon happens but Harry doesn't get involved at all... is a new one. Seems like it would be kinda boring and depressing to just have him passing time and not getting involved (unless hes working behind the scenes to do other stuff and just keeping his head down at Hogwarts or something).

** This is sorta the plot in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]]. Don't be turned off by the HP/LV pairing bc it's a really small part of the fic and easily skippable. Also this fic isn't dark!harry at all - the summary is fairly misleading. The premise is that Harry keeps being reborn every time he dies and has to live his life again. He keeps all his memories though and after a few times, he's just trying to die.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue. Dumbledore!bashing slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** Thank you very much. I have seen this one but never actually read it because of the pairing. I will look into it and trust you on that one.

*** Liked this story until some latest chapters. It has the 'Delenda Est' syndrome. It started brilliantly with an unique idea, then screwed up at midway through.
