A while ago I read an awesome Snape/Lupin fanfic that was hilarious. It takes place when they're both teachers at Hogworts. I distinctly remember one scene at a staff party, Snape notices Dunbledores eyes keep twinkling, until he realizes there's all these empty cups around him that reveal he's drunk lol. The fic was either on restricted section or adult fanfiction but both dont seem to exist. If anyone remembers the author or maybe another place the fic is located, I'd appreciate the help!


** I suggest asking here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/]]

Would probably have a better chance if you asked there. :)
