I'd be interested to read a story like this that /realistically/ changes canon. I don't want a rehash.

The only thing I don't want is a Harry/Draco or Harry/ any one whose old enough to be his or her parent. (I'm okay with canon male Harry recommendations, but I'd prefer a born female Harry.)

I prefer long, 40k+, fics.


** Do you mind a canon male Harry thrown back in time and turned into a girl? I'd shill mine if you don't mind (don't worry about the update date, real-life kept me from writing but things are calming down, so I can get back to it soon I think):

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
