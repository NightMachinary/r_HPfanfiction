So, I remember the basic setup of this fic. It wasn't on any of the big fic websites like ao3 or ff.net, and it was a crossover with some spy book. Basically, Hermione was caught doing some crime that had something to do with her best friend being killed. She found her killer and killed him i think? and then instead of being put into jail she was put into some special spy school where everybody either came from a long line of spies or they were criminals that were put into the school. The criminals had a derogatory nickname for them, kind of like mudblood. There were still the four houses. I also remember something about a cross-country team that Hermione was in? Or a running team or something like that. Oh also all the kids that were kids of spies were all lords and ladies. And Astoria and Daphne Greengrass had a grandmother that was some super famous spy that went to teach them in third year i think? i'm pretty sure it was an unfinished fic as well.

Any help would be amazing! Thank you so much

*** Yep, currently reading through it. My only annoyance is that so many of the events are "basically the same", as in just analogues of the actual stories. I wish it went off the tracks a little more.

**** It's supposed to be a canon rewrite in a non-magical setting.

But things begin to diverge after Year 2.

Years 6 and 7 take up 97 chapters out of 200, and Year 7 alone is 1/3 of the entire story. Year 7 is also very different from canon.

***** Oh, I know, I just finished Year 6. I still wish it diverged more, but I guess it already is such an ambitious project, there's only so much you can do.

*** It's almost as good as Harry Potter and the Man of Unknown, which was a story published in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.‚Äù
