I'm rewatching DBZ on my VHS tapes, and I'm on the SSJ3 transformation.

And it hit me, with how big HP FF is, their has to be a battle fix with epic fights, twists and transformations.

Imagine how good it could be, if there is one.

Harry asking for energy to blast Voldemort once and for all, so all wizards lend their magic to which he conjures magic in its purest form to obliterate Voldemort.

Then a sequel like Super (GT doesn't exist!)

So is there any?

And how would you write it?

Personally I would make Voldemort the big bad and him sending pawns to test out Harry's strength.


** EDIT:

I started to write it, its gonna be called Legacy and the first draft of the summary is

"The Earth is constantly under threat, the Wizarding world even more so. The last line of defence the Order of the Pheonix along with a wizard constantly training to get stronger save the world time in and time out again. That wizard? Harry Potter!"
