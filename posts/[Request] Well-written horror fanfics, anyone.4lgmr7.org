I'm aware that horror is a genre that isn't popularly explored in fanfic, but if anyone has any recs for horror fanfiction within the HP universe I'd love links!

I do mean stuff that's chilling & scary rather than just gory, if people can find it!

I'm cool with ships, but prefer gen. Thanks in advance, if anyone can think of anything!


** I've read an incredible Horror story set in Azkaban. There was a group of people trying to unravel a mystery.

I tried to find it, but couldn't :(. I'll be posting a spoiler version of the plot to see if anyone else remembers it. Please don't read it OP, if you don't want the story to be spoiled.

edit: I removed the spoiler, since [[/u/xalley]] have found the story.

** The first thing that comes up to my mind is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]]. It's a classic written by Arabella in 01 (I think? Can't remember for sure.) It has one of the most terrifying Tom Riddles I've seen until now.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see.
