In all the fanfiction I've read, even the Dumbledore-bashing ones, I'm surprised I've never once come across this.

So much of the Harry angst comes from the necessity of keeping him with the Dursley's because Petunia and Dudley are his only blood family. We know that many wizarding families would have been happy to take in Harry, with whatever baggage came with him. So what if that baggage included an artificially inseminated baby, courtesy of a donated egg from Petunia? Raise Harry with his cousin and you have a genuine familial bond and a happy Harry. And it wouldn't take much more manipulation than we already know Dumbledore is capable of.

Thoughts?


** Jesus Christ! Of all the reasons to bring a child into this world, this has to be the only one that is worse than both "to save a marriage" and "to get tax cuts". I mean, Dumbledore pulled some shady shit, but this... he'd have to be a sociopath to concuct a baby to be a safety net for Harry Potter without even considering how much in danger that baby would be in from Voldemort.

And another thing, a baby takes 9 months ro bake. Are we sure Dumbledore had that kinda time with Harry's placement?

Probably not, like when Harry was placed with the Dursleys, Bellatrix, Crouch Jr and the Lestrange Brothers were still free, I'd say that there would have been a very high chance that they would go after Harry instead of the Longbottoms if Harry hadn't been protected by the Bonds of Blood Charm.

*** It is indeed horrible! But you can't tell me you've never come across one of those fics where Dumbledore is inexplicably an unquestionably evil sociopath? It would make perfect sense for one of those! Hell, even in canon it would make sense, given the existence of the....interesting....piece of work that was The Cursed Child.

***** As for the time it would take, directly after Voldemort's defeat would be the best possible time to hide an infant in a different country for long enough for the baby to be born. It's a bit sketchy, maybe, but evil Dumbledore would probably see it as a worthy trade-off for giving Harry better access to the power of love. And, you know, an extremely easy to leverage younger cousin.

Iirc Harry was in a relationship with Luna at the time and everyone was very unhappy about it. The kid might also have been evil somehow because it was conceived under influence of potions?

That's also why there aren't teen pregnancies Ever at hogwarts, and why abortion doesn't exist, nor condoms, and why most families only have one kid. You can have all the sex you want, and it won't make a difference, until Magic decides to give you a kid.

****** Yes. He has over a hundred years of existence in DADA to draw from, and he's always been the kind of person to push for what ‘he' sees as right. Hearing a muggle, that has distanced themselves from their only magical sibling, try and tell him about “this thing he can do to help with those magical defenses” would almost certainly result in him refuting it. He'd tell her that he knew what he was doing, and that she'd learn to live with it ‘for the greater good', he'd say ‘he was sure that she would grow to love Harry' and she would Hate Him for it. She would ‘know' that her idea would work, and see Dumledore's refusal of it (without even a consideration) as just another example of the stupidity of the magical world. Then she would come the despise Harry for his existence, and his being forced into her life.

Was she even in an economically stable enough state to take care of him? Maybe not. But when she tried to communicate that to the Old Man, he wouldn't listen. Vernon had had to stay in a deadend position because he couldn't risk looking for better work. They already had one kid, and didn't have the resources to take care of another. But the Old Man refused to see it. Maybe she even took Harry to an orphanage, but then was met with Dumbledore not standing for that. Of course, Tom Riddle grew up in an orphanage, but the Dursley's didn't know that, and Dumbledore certainly wasn't going to try and explain that, after having them tell Him how best to practice magic.

**** A funny point could then revolve around the fact that, if it were merely acceptance of familial bond and not acceptance of the position of caregiver, once the child and Harry were like 7 and 9 or so, having them have a fight and the younger child petulantly saying something to the effect of "You aren't my brother anymore, I hate you" (not really meaning it if the child were more mature and really thinking about it) but magic intervenes and then breaks the protections. And since Petunia rejected Harry already by agreeing to this plan, she cannot take him so Dumbledore has to figure out a new plan. At which point, Harry, knowing nothing of magic, goes to a magical family for protection and is introduced to magic 2 years early.
