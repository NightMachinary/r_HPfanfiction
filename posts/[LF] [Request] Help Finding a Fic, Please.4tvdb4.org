Hi. I'm really hoping that you fine lot can help me find a story that I read a few months ago, but didn't save the name of, for whatever reason.

All I can remember of it is that Harry was killed to death after having his head chopped off. Dumbledore stole his head and body, sewed his head back on with golden threads, then performed some form of necromancy on Harry to bring him back to life as (as an Inferius?).

I am fairly certain I found it on this sub, but I have been searching for the better part of two days, and can't find shit.

Thanks!


** Harry was killed to death?

*** /nods solemnly/ Indeed, to death. Nasty thing, being killed to death.

*** People die if they are killed, so it all makes sense.
