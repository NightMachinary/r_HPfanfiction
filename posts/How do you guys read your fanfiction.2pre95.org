** I create PDFs of fics and use the app Voxdox (on Android) to convert them to audio files, and then listen to them at work, at the gym, when I drive or anywhere else that I'd normally be listening to music. The app actually works really really well. It's great to be able to "read" fics on the go.

I do read faster than that app speaks, but the app displays the text and turns the page in sync with the speech, so if I get a chance to actually sit and read, I can just pause the sound and read a few pages, and turn the audio on when I can't read anymore.

The app has a free trial of about 400 pages, but the lifetime subscription (It's like $5-$15 depending on what level of subscription you buy) allows up to 5000 pages per month.

If anybody wants to hear how it sounds I could convert a one shot to an audio file and sent it to anybody interested.

I'm currently listening to A Stranger in and Unholy Land. It's roughly 470K words which works out to about 856 pages in the app.

Edit: It isn't perfect. It does contractions really poorly, and usually spells them out. That being said the voice is really smooth and flows extraordinarily well. It even pronounces a lot of the spells decently, although the inflection is sometimes wrong. If you have high standards, it might not suit your needs, but I was really impressed.

Theres also several different male and female voices with both US and UK English. It also does translation, but I can't speak to the accuracy of the translation.

It only takes maybe 10-30 seconds to translate each page, so you can read as you download it.

Here's a link to download an audio sample I created with the app.

** [[https://github.com/dhasenan/fanfiction.ebook][Custom script]] to download stuff and convert it to epub or awz3, depending on which type of ereader I'm using at the moment. At least, that's for stuff over about 70k words. For stuff under 30k words, I'll just read it in my browser.

Because of this, I tend not to read stuff between about 30k and 70k words.

** For fanfiction.net i use a Calibre plugin to download books as epubs, then transfer them to my iPad and read them on Marvin, my fav open-source reading app. I keep files in a Dropbox folder.

(I also think it's ultralame when fanfic sites don't have a "save as epub" option.)

** Wait for good recommendations, or read the first few thousand words in a web browser. Then download, and it sits on my computer in a folder until I (maybe once monthly) transport to my Kindle.

But I still have a dearth of fics I haven't read yet, including ones I know are good. So I can afford to wait around.

Phone: browser app (using mobile ff.net with the reverse colors) Google Play Books (downloadable formats from AO3) Aldiko reader app (pdf downloads)

Tablet (all of the above)

Kindle (downloadable formats, transferred to Amazon library)

Desktop browser

I think the only way I don't read fic is audiobook or printed on paper. There are enough books to read in my house, I can't afford the shelf space to start printing fic!
