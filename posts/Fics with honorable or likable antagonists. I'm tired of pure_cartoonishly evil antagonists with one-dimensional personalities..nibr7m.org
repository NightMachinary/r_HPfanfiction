** Riddle doesn't appear all that often in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, he's mostly in the background, but when he does show up, he tends to keep to (the letter of) his deals, doesn't randomly curse people or punish the bearer of bad news, and even turns out to have /partially/ sympathetic motivations (much to Harry's shock; he may well be both right /and/ wrong). He wants to push purebloods to marry half-bloods in order to avoid the disastrous effects of inbreeding, but at the same time he wants to lock out muggle-borns and muggle culture.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
