:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
An AO3 fic I genuinely can't find. Hermione and Fred became best friends at Hogwarts whilst Hermione was lonely in her first year. They introduced her to their friend group of Lee Jordan, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson. It still goes pretty much the book's storyline, except the twins are more involved. Fred seems to take an interest in Hermione early on but doesn't realise it, and she realises it quite late. Ron and Harry don't really seem to grasp that Hermione and Fred are best-friends since circumstances like rarely seeing them together (despite hanging out a lot), and Ron's disbelief he would be interested in her. Hermione and Fred don't exactly hide their friendship, but they don't try to help him conclude it either.

Things I remember distinctly:

1. Once Fred and Hermione get together, she asks if he was jealous of her going to the ball with Krum, to which he replies "immensely" humoured.
2. When Hermione was petrified, Fred took it very hard, was very confused about his feelings and broke something in his dorm in silent anger whilst George looked on.
3. Hermione's parents send her books on her birthday every year, and a letter, to which a nickname the twins loved was on there "daughter o'mine", to which Hermione made certain rules on the usage of it, and Fred modified it to "Mine" because he was hers and would get severely pissed should anyone else used it.
4. Fred asks Hermione to the ball, to which Hermione sadly says no, telling him that Krum had already asked her. He walks away, slightly wounded but still kind and understanding, and she tells that, should he have asked firs, she would have said yes.
5. Each chapter is a year, and within that chapter, only the relevant points are written, it's not a hundred chapter fic, I'd say it's like 5-7 chapters.
6. In her first year, she refused to say what was bothering her to Fred and George, who were very worried, and they didn't speak that year because Hermione was keeping the whole philosopher's stone thing a secret. Once they found out, they crushed her in a hug.
7. Lee and Hermione weren't best friends, but they still were amicable, kind of friends and enjoyed each other's company when no one else was there.

Ask me anything if you need more info!

****** I was looking for a good fic (I'm kicking off my own Fred/Hermione fic and wanted to be in the mood for the ship!) and stumbled onto this recommendation over Tumblr. Once I read it, beyond hooked! I finished the last half a chapter I had left and now I'm eagerly awaiting the next! It's so so great!

  "Oh, my poor old heart can't take this," Fred says, clutching his chest."You're thirteen," Hermione scoffs, rolling her eyes. "There's nothing old about you.""I'm a twin. Combined we're twenty-six years old.""That's still not old, and that's still not how it works."*\ (or: the rewrite of the books where the twins befriend hermione early on. some things change, some things stay the same, some things... do a little bit of both.)

  Fred grins. "Her mum and dad call her 'Daughter o'Mione' so we took advantage of that. You've probably heard us call her other things like 'friend o'Mione.' Lee's favorite it ''Mione o'Mione.'"

  "You can make any version of it you want---there are a few rules though," Fred explains, and then launches into a detailed explanation of said rules. Hermione is genuinely impressed he's able to recount them so fluently. "When she says not to use 'sweet child,' she means it. Remember the day Lee's hair went Slytherin green your second year? He tried."

  "He regretted it," Hermione grins, though her stomach still feels heavy from the unexpected mention of her parents.

  Ron blinks. "/You/ turned Lee's hair green?"

  "Yes," she shrugs. "I tried green and silver but I couldn't figure out the spell to do both at the same time, it just kept turning fully green or fully silver on me. Green was more obvious."

** This one? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7292302/1/]])

My [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] review:

*The good:* A generally well-written fic, with good technicals and dialogue. Hermione's interactions with Fred and George are realistic, endearing, and feel natural.\\
*The bad:* The writing style uses a tad too many adverbs and superlatives, but it's a minor thing. At least as of this chapter, the fic is a canon rehash. We are given some glimmers of hope for a potential divergence (Will Hermione be sorted into Ravenclaw or even Slytherin in Chapter 6? Will she successfully manipulate Peeves in Chapter 9? Will she avoid the troll because she actually /does/ have friends in this chapter?) but then we are invariably disappointed when it's back on the canon rails, often with word-for-word identical dialogue.\\
*The verdict:* This fic is shaping up to be a canon plot rehash from Hermione's perspective, with an occasional interlude in which Fred and George grab Hermione and show off their latest prank, and romantic outcomes might be different.

  The greatest adventure of Hermione's life started when she got lost in the woods. If she'd known how much trouble she was about to get herself into, she might have stayed home with her books. But then, Hermione had never been one to say no to a challenge
