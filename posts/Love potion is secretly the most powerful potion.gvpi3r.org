We know that Harry's mother love is the reason the he can survive the killing spell and also Dumbledore also mention one time love is the most powerful. It means if the love potion is correctly used it can be a powerful weapon.


** I don't think it would be in that sense. I think for it to be powerful as Dumbledore means it, the love has to be genuine and authentic. Love potion doesn't allow for that.

However, a strong love potion could be used even better than an Imperio to control someone, and have them do all of your biding. Especially since people can fight Imperio, but I don't think they can fight the effect of the love potion.

** Love potion doesn't make true love, it creates passion, lust, and obsession with a person, Slughorn says it so. It's almost a rape drug or strong aphrodisiac.

It should be called a passion or lust potion, but love potion is already a cultural thing.

The love that protected Harry was selfless, true motherly love, not some chemically/magically induced obsession.
