"When I'm Headmaster, there will be changes. That day, all female students will be required to wear *tiny miniskirts*!"

** I had this vision of George being constantly followed by his shadow double. He managed to bring Fred back but as no more than a shade that can only mimic the movements of his anchor...

** Lowkey that would be terrifying, without his followers Voldemort didnt really have too much in terms of society wrecking potential but George would just need to tweak a few WWW products and he'd have the arsenal of an anarchist's wet dreams.

** I'm imagining he'd be like the Joker (second time I reference him on this sub in the last 20 mins): unpredictable, no real motivation other than getting his punchlines right and unfunny for everyone other than himself. Also his second in command would be a realistic hallucination of Fred at the time of his death. He'd also only speak in half sentences because he'd expect Fred to finish them.

** Alternatively: particularly important Weasleys are born in synchronized pairs of bodies (for redundancy) with one soul and set of memories shared between them. All horcrux magic is corrupted versions of Weasley family magic, modified to work with unnatural, evil soul anchors. When George tries a variant of the blood/flesh/bone ritual from GoF, everyone thinks he's gone dark, when really it's the dark lords who went Weasley-twin.
