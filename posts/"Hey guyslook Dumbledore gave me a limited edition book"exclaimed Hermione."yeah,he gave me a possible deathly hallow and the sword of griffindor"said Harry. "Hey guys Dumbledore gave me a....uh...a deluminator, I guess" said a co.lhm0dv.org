The deluminator is the first magical device or magic shown by jkr in the books ,yet I have read nearly zero fics which have the deluminator in them


** After Scrimgeour had left, the trio sat in The Burrow's living room. Hermione was puzzling over Dumbledore's book, flicking through a thick runes reference while making notes on a piece of parchment, occasionally humming in satisfaction; Harry threw the snitch up and down while Ron found himself clicking the Deluminator on and off. The metal, initially cold, grew pleasantly warm in his hand and the rhythm of the clicks was a tune he could almost hear. Ron's thoughts drifted to this evening's party, Mum would make a great spread, she always did, in fact she was probably in the kitchen right now...

Abruptly Mum's voice came from the Deluminator. "Merlin knows, I love Harry, but mouthing off to the Minister, Arthur! We need your job, now more than ever."

Ron looked up to see Harry was listening intently.

Dad spoke. "Scrimgeour won't want to alienate Harry like that. And you've heard the reports from the Order, with You-Know-Who ready to move, he probably doesn't have long anyway."

Mum made a hiccuping sound, somewhere between a laugh and a cry. "You know just what to say to cheer me up." Then there was the sound of stifled tears, Ron could only make out fragments of Mum's words: "I can't lose any more Arthur, I can't", while Dad made soothing noises.

"Shut it off! Shut it off now!" Hermione shouted and Ron clicked the Deluminator again. The voices stopped.

Harry's expression was stricken. "I could call the Minister back?" His fingers tightened on the snitch, leaving little dents in the metal. "He can have this fucking thing if he loves it so much."

Ron shook his head. "I think Dad's right, he's not going to do anything. And Dumbledore must have given it to you for a reason."

There was a long pause then Hermione asked tentatively: "So it spies on people?"

"I guess." Ron thought back. "I was thinking about Mum just before we started hearing them."

"Perhaps we should test it again?"

"You could listen to Voldemort," Harry said.

Sometimes Ron thought it must be nice to be Harry Potter, never to be afraid of anything. "The most powerful Dark Wizard in the world, and you want to try snooping on him with a device we don't know how to use?"

"Good point," Harry replied. He thought for a moment. "Not Snape either? How about Draco?"

Ron nodded and started clicking the Deluminator again. He thought of the thin, ferrety face, blond hair and perpetual sneer. Then of his appearance over the last school year: the black circles under Draco's eyes, the unhealthy pallor, the hunted expression.

This time the Deluminator projected a slick, wet, slapping sort of sound. After a moment, Draco's voice started, low and throaty: "... that's right... come on... yes... yes."

Hermione was bright red with embarrassment. "Is he with someone?"

"... like the Weasel bitch do you?... no, you like me... yes, Potter, pound me... hunt that Snitch..."

Ron clicked the Deluminator off again. "Kinda obvious when you think about it."

*** Is Draco calling his prostate a snitch? Because if so, that's an a amazing thing I've never heard before.

I want to see more done with this concept though! They could accomplish so much with this!

*** ...I can imagine them unintentionally listening to Pansy or other characters who dislike Harry, like Marietta, doing this, and Harry/company being mortified as a result.

"...I don't think this is doing the same thing that it did when Dumbledore owned it."

In reality...

Only the ghosts are those of Voldemort's victims, like James and Lily.

"...I'm not sure whether to be comforted on seeing my mum and dad kick ass like that, or be completely and utterly terrified."

** To quote my favourite passage from the otherwise mediocre linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/682335]]),

#+begin_quote
  It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed.

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

  In which Hermione takes over the Wizarding World.
