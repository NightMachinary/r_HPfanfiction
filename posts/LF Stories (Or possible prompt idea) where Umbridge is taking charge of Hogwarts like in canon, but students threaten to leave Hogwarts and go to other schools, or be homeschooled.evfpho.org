As it says. What would happen if Purebloods and certain Half-Bloods threatened to leave the school (Because Umbridge wouldn't care if Muggleborns left), because of the way it's being run by Umbridge? Maybe they actually do it, or threaten to, Umbridge is looked into by Aurors (Maybe they find out it was her who put Dementors where Harry lives or something, idk).

Not really looking for pairings, but am fine with het/slash/femslash

Can be on any site

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but if there's NO Weasley bashing, I'll allow it.
