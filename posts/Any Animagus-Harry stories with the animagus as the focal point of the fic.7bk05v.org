  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.

** [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/Cold/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]]

Old school story, Harry goes to Azkaban due to conspiracy. Phoenix animagus, the form is instrumental in his escape and subsequent shenanigans. Good balance of action, drama, fights, romance, reasonable plot. It's Harry/Cho, but she's not a whiny bint like in canon. Harry is resourceful instead of obscenely powerful, fucking up his enemies with clever traps and subtlety. Everyone is out of character, but then this was written before OttP. Has a complete sequel called Midnight Duel, Midday Love.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

** linkffn(8137134) I read part of this ages ago. Never finished, but HP being an animagus is definitely a huge part of the story. I can't say if the ending is good or bad, though, but I'm just recommending since it fits your criteria.

linkao3(6146470) Good fic, but hasn't been updated in over a year (it was going strong for awhile too...). Animagus!Harry is a huge plot point, but a lot of the story is about him learning to be human.
