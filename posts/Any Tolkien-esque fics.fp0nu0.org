As the title says, are there any fics that are Tolkein-esque in plot, style, or tone? Not direct cross-overs, I'm not looking for 'Harry is an elf in middle earth' kind of fics - just fics that imitate or are inspired by his works. At a stretch, I'll take fics that just make references to his works as well.

As an example, I've just finished reading this - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1423924]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

** i wouldn't really call it Tolkien-esque, but Hermione in the Arithmancer series is a huge fan of Tolkien and fantasy/scifi in general and creates a few fandom-inspired spells.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** Yeah, I'd say it sorta fits. Not quite, but sorta. I've only read a little to check if it was good enough to add to the 'to-read' list, but what I remember was pretty apropos. But even if I'm misremembering and it's not, it's still a good fic. :)

So, thanks for the rec!
