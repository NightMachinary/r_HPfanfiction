I don't understand why James always has to be a bad person if he survives Halloween.

He died trying to protect Lily and Harry in Canon. James was a bully during his schooldays, but grew up during his seventh year and became a war hero fighting against the death eaters.

IMO this could make for an interesting character who mourns his actions during his school days that pushed Slytherins like Snape in the arms of the Death Eaters and supported their radicalization.

*** We only really saw Snapes point of view. No doubt he gave as good as he got. And let's not forget his future Death Eater friends. Snape May have been a victim in the memory Harry saw, but what about the other times? Or the terrible way he bullies children as an adult. Snape is a bully now and was certainly a bully in Hogwarts.

****** I did.

Unfortunately, he went straight to victim-blaming, and decided to take out his anger at her rejection on other people sharing her origins as part of Death Eaters, a terrorist organization hellbent on exterminating those like Lily.

Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you.

If he took a moment to think and tried to be a good person instead of a terrorist, I'd have been more inclined to defend his character.

*** Actually, this particular scenario is usually much less "poor Severus, screw James" and more "poor Slytherins, screw Gryffindors". It sounds like the author is describing your typical WBWL, which typically doesn't focus on Snape specifically all that much.

Shit, it's fanfiction. If you really want, change the sorting process so that the hat doesn't give a fuck where you /want/ to go. He puts hat on head, hat shouts slytherin, boom you're done.

Otherwise, just make his parents.. not talk shit about Slytherin?
