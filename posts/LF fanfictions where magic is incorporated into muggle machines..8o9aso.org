I'm not looking for 'muggle rule' fics but a fanfiction where someone incorporates magic into machines and makes for some cool stuff. Sort of like the Ford Anglia or Sirius's Motorbike but on much higher and cooler levels as well.

This could make for endless possibilities and the fact that the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office is so small has been bugging me for a while. Arthur can have a much cooler job than vomiting toilets or dancing cutlery.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Arthur Weasley stepped up his game and charmed a flying, invisible Warrior IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian's]] postwar series features lots of magic and tech fusions. For example, Ron and Hermione have a Austin Mini that could go airborne, invisible, and through port key. Harry's Auror Office has a fleet of Range Rovers with similar capabilities. Furthermore, video cell phones, called “Mirrorphone” and developed by the Weasleys, have become very popular in Magical Britain.

But it's in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), that contains the greatest fusion of magic and technology. Since SoS has collapsed in this story, magical R&D is really taking off.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano/][Harry Tano]], linkffn(9264843) has Sirus founding a company that uses magic to replicate Star Wars tech.

Also it has this hillarious scene where shortly after Draco Malfoy's defection to the good guys it is mentioned that he is wearing /dragonskin throusers/.
