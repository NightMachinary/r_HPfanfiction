What are the darkest HP FCs centered on Harry?


** *Paid In Blood* - linkffn(9474009)

Severe AU. Stuff goes horribly wrong, Harry does a ritual to go back in time to prevent a lot of things from happening.

Anywho, the beginning leaves A LOT of questions, exposition happens when needed in the form of explanations or flashbacks.

Lots of drama, revenge, blood and guts, and feels. You will cry. You will cheer when the revenge happens.

Haphne.

#+begin_quote
  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.
