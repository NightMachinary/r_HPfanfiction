:END:
Ok, so over a decade ago (Yes, I am an elder millennial fan) there was a fanfic site called grangerenchanted which was primarily for Hermione romance fics. It is gone now, but once upon a time it had the Best Highlander series crossover I've found. I have no idea what the title was or who the author was but it centered around Methos and Hermione with Methos being the real Salazar Slytherin who shows back up in the Magical World pretending to be his descendant, is quite shocked to find out that there's a Wizard Hitler pretending to be his however many grandkid, takes a job as DADA professor? He took a job at Hogwarts, I'm not entirely positive that it was DADA. Enter Hermione who is a new Immortal who had her first death over the summer in an accident but doesn't realize she died because she thinks her magic saved her. Methos becomes her mentor. I remember the plot because I really enjoyed it and Methos has always been my fave from the tv series. But with the site gone I have no idea where to find it anymore. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
