So I just had this funny idea of people (maybe fangirls) constantly pestering an exasperated /frustrated Harry with requests for handmade clay-hearts, flower pots and other cheesy things.

After all, someone named Potter must be good at pottery, right?


** Albus - "Harry, my boy, this year you have been selected Clay Boy."

Harry - "Head Boy you mean?"

Albus - "Oh Merlin, no! Not with your copied essays and grades! That's some Ravenclaw who is boring but smart. No, I meant Clay Boy. You will lead our Pottery classes."

*** Love the play on Head Boy. *g*

Harry:. .. "Why would we need a pottery class anyway?"

Dumbledore: "/Pottery/ class, Harry - and I believe they would supplement our Defense Class quite nicely."

Harry: ".../Why/?"

Dumbledore: "Because my dear boy, flower pots are excellent projectiles if they are being thrown down from a high altitude."

*** And the world marveled over the Chosen One's masterpiece, the *Lightning Bolt* - an overly fancy flower pot with the scrawl letter H written on it. (Apparently Harry was also quite good at warfare calligraphy.)

Trying to curry favor with the pottery master, entire countries scrambled over themselves to get rid of the artisan's enemy - Voldemort. Each hoping that by eliminating the young master's enemy they might be rewarded with the clayey grail.

/\/Insert lots of scenes showing a disheveled Voldemort being chased around by soldiers, children, the residential retirement home's inhabitants and a stray ostrich**
