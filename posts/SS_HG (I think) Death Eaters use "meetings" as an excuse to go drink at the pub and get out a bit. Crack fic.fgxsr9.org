I think it starts out with Hermione finding Snape in a heap on the grounds of the castle. She is terrified that Voldemort has been torturing him and runs to give him aid and nope, he's just absolutely shitfaced. The great sacrifices Snape is making for the order? Not so much. Voldemort is still a bad guy, but his Death Eaters are really just in it for the perfect excuse to get out of the house and have a pint. When he tells them to wreak havoc on the muggles they just comb through muggle news reports to find an event that they can lay claim to.

** Oh, so that's the explanation. It always caught my interest that the Battle of Hogwarts happened twenty two days after the Good Friday Agreement. Deatheaters discovered that their biggest source of excuses dried out, so the whole Voldemort's empire was falling apart.
