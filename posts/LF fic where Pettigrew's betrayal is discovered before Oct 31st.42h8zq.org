Are there any fics where James/Sirius/Lily discover that Pettigrew is a traitor before Voldemort visits Godric's Hollow to kill Harry? Ideally this would include a time skip to the Hogwarts years after Harry has been raised by James, Lily, (and maybe Sirius), while on the run.


** It's not quite the same thing but in linkffn(promises unbroken), Sirius, not Peter, is the secret keeper and the Potters survive Halloween because of it. Might be worth checking out!

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** This doesn't fit the second part of your request and isn't a big part of the story (not mentioned until the very end) - but I recommend linkffn(8163784)
