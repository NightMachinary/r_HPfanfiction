:END:
Hi, I'm looking for a Non magical where Tom is some kind of criminal boss.

What I remember from it is that Harry was living with his uncle Vernon. Dudley and Petunia are not around anymore (don't remember if they are dead or simply left). I'm not sure if Harry is in college, in this fic; but he does get some beatings from his uncle.

Tom meets Harry in a club, I think, where harry gets harassed by a couple of guys trying to take advantage of him and Tom stops it. Harry gets out of the club and the two guys that harassed him kind of ask Tom to forgive them (they are scared of him), something along the lines that 'they didn't know the boss [Tom] wanted him'

Tom finds out Harry lives with his uncle, and I think that Vernon owns money or something and Tom Riddle takes advantage of that by telling him that the debt will be settled if he gives harry to him. Obviously Vernon accepts and while he is signing away Harry to Tom he makes some kind of comment about 'the freak being only good to get a good beating'

And so Tom kinda of "adopts" him, legally. I'm pretty sure Tom shows Harry the papers saying that 'legally' he is his new guardian and there's no way for him to escape or leave.

And that's kind of all I remember... I know it's not much, but if you know of some stories that sound like it, please tell.

Thank you!
