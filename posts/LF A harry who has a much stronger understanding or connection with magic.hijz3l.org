not necessarily a powerful Harry but he would have far more control and finesse


** This is kind of the main premise of a story that I've been working on for the last 5 years. It's done, but I can't stop making small edits. I've been toying with posting the first chapter and seeing what the response is. I've read the comments on some fanfictions and woosh, I don't know if I am prepared for that. Honestly that is what I keep editing it for. Trying to find mistakes that someone is going to point out after reading it lol.

Anywhoo, If I get up the courage to post it in the next few days, I'll tag you :)

EDIT:

Ok. I finally took the plunge. The story gets into the nature of magic and stuff like that pretty quick, but this is just the first two chapters. I have the entire thing done, it's like 300k words long, but I don't want to post it all at once.

**** Thank you so much! I have spent a long time working on this fic, I'm really glad you are enjoying it! I'm tweaking a few things in Chapter 4 to do some of the final polish on it, but I am hoping I'll have it posted by the end of the weekend.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
