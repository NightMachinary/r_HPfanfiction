Whenever someone uses fictionbot to share or link a story, the link is not clickable on my iPhone. My reddit app is up to date as is the software on my iPhone 7 plus. I can click the link on the Reddit app in my note 5(work phone)


** Reddit's official app incorrectly parses Markdown. Consider using an alternative Reddit application.

** This is a problem with the app. The markdown is correct. What app are you using, the official one?
