I am looking for fics that depict accurately the depression people go through after having been forced to do things against their will. For example Pius would feel pretty bad knowing that he was forced for almost a year to be the puppet leader of Voldemort's magical nazi regime. Not to mention the social stigma, especially that it's a known fact that during the first war several people escaped prosecution by claiming they were under the Imperius curse. So not only would lead this to self hatred but also to no one supporting you. My headcanon is that he committed suicide immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Or maybe Tom Riddle Sr is unable to trust another woman ever again and acts like a rape victim would. His self-esteem is at an all time low and he can't stand when people touch him or show signs of affection. He even becomes so paranoid that whenever he begins feeling attracted to a woman he wonders whether he'd been dosed again with love potion. Also the rumors from the village that he ran away with the crazy man's daughter and then left her don't really help.

Anything of the sorts?


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617/chapters/32648763#workskin][An Hour of Wolves]] Harry gets raped by Romilda Vane via love potion and struggles with the trauma afterwards. The story's mostly about him coming to terms with what happened and his friends trying to help him through it. It's really well-written, if incomplete.

*** While I can't see Romilda Vane, a vapid girl a year or two below Harry actually /raping/ him, I could easily see this sort of fallout as being very plausible after being enslaved with a powerful love potion like /amortentia/ (same deal with Tom Riddle Sr. from Merope doing this to him, too/)./

See, this is where rape, as repugnant and /wrong/ as it is in reality, would make a logical and disturbing plot catalyst/device in fiction, not just the "rape porn" stories people write (yes, they exist: It's mostly just a 'kink' thing to them than the actual horrors of rape, the violation of mind and body, though).

It's canon that she attempted to dose him with love potions though. I'm not sure the vapidity plays into the unlikelihood of it; in some ways I think that makes it more likely, since it means she's thoughtless enough to not care about the effects of her actions on Harry.

And I think it's a bit more believable when love potions are involved - that kind of thing might not even be seen as rape in the wizarding world. I mean even in our society a lot of people still don't immediately equate coerced consent with outright rape, even though the former can be just as damaging to the psyche as the latter. Naturally something like that could be magnified in the wizarding world, given that love potions actually make you want to perform the act while under the influence.

***** I could see her parading him around as her "boyfriend", maybe even force him to snog her and do other things, but /outright/ rape? I can't see that, sorry.

** It penetrates whole series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][“Holly at Hogwarts”]] by Forest_of_Holly with another mind-altering crap. Highly recommended!

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13815055/1/Fractured-Fairytale]])

This one is sort of goes with your second example. Tom Riddle Sr. does go through quite a bit of self-loathing period and is very wary of witches and magic. It's more of a sub-plot thing I think, though I could be putting it lightly.

** Could you imagine how Harry would feel if a desperate character, such as a Ginny seen in a shitty Indie-Harry story or if another girl in his year, such as Daphne Greengrass or even someone like Susan Bones, did this? He'd wake up from a living nightmare to find himself having been with the girl for a year...

And she can't understand why he "hadn't fallen in love with her" by then, much like how it was implied as an explanation to why Merope stopped feeding him (Riddle Sr.) the love potion.

Harry being rehabilitated by his friends while his "wife" tries to desperately get him back via various means e.g. emotional blackmail, legally, et cetera, could be a thrilling read.

Especially if children were created. Holy shit.

** I wrote one about the problematic nature of love potions, even in established relationships. Hermione apprentices under Master Slughorn and makes her project all about a universal theory of love potions after Ron doses her with one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]]. There's also a bunch of war-related trauma recovery for both Hermione and Snape. Nightmares, fight-flight-freeze responses, searching for meaning and control, relationship fallout, self-doubt, and more. Post-war SSHG romance complete at 27k words. Marked with a noncon warning due to the dubious nature of a surreptitious love potion.
