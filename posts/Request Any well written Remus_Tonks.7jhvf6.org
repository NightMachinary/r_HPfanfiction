No character bashing, no making Harry super smart or super powerful if he's in the story. A little smarter or a little more powerful then he was in canon is okay just don't make it unbelievable.

Any rating is fine, for side pairings am fine with het/slash/femslash.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairings are fine.

** It's really old, but I really like [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1][Shifts]] by Fernwithy. You have to go to the Sugar Quill to read it. Written pre HBP I think. It is about how Tonks and Remus are at Smeltings during the events of OOTP.

** linkffn(4809356)

When Teddy is about 11 years old, he finds some journals in Andromeda's attic that were written by Remus during the events of OotP - DH. The narrative is mostly from Remus' point of view, but it does shift back to Teddy in "current day" and how he is dealing with what he's reading.

The story is meant to be canon compliant. It's basically a telling of what specifically went on between Remus and Tonks during books 5-7, told from Remus' POV.

** I remembered this post you made and figured I'd let you know that I stumbled on a REALLY good Remus/Tonks.

It's incomplete. The author just started publishing. The only flaw is that the most recent chapter -- which happens to be the chapter where Sirius dies -- is kinda rough. Seems like they posted that one in way more of a rush than they've written the previous chapters.
