He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

*** I read the story from start to where it is now in one sitting. I would highly recommend this story. I just hope it is continued to be updated.

** I know too many of these. Sorry if they're not sorted or described in detail but I'm just going through my alerts and favourites to see if I can find you some nice reads.

There are some rather good Bleach crossovers with Harry being Ulquiorra. The best by far are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6833957/1/Deathly-Hollowed][Deathly Hollowed]] which is still ongoing and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6165374/1/Waiting-in-Sin][Waiting in Sin]] which is complete, hilarious, spans the whole of the Harry Potter books and is about 200,000 words long.

Then there are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077400/1/Window][Window]] A Naruto/Harry Potter oneshot that is quite nice.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8649900/1/Sephiroth-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix][Sephiroth Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]] Ongoing. Harry is Sephiroth reborn. Actually, there is another of these:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8313759/1/The-REBORN-SOLDIER][The REBORN SOLIDER]] Same theme, and also still ongoing and very much worth it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9278903/1/The-Doctor-The-Desert-and-Death][The Doctor, The Desert, and Death]] Ongoing. A crossover with BBC Sherlock and a Harry-is-John-Watson-fic with a bit of master of death thrown in.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7482263/1/Antlers-and-Fangs][Antlers and Fangs]] Ongoing. A crossover with Game of Thrones where Harry is the lost son of Cersei Lanister and Robert Baretheon.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145758/1/Toshiro-Potter][Toshio Potter]] Ongoing. Crossover with Bleach. Harry died and became Toshiro Hitsugaya.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629290/1/Sasuke-Potter][Sasuke Potter]] Ongoing. Crossover with Naruto. Harry died and became Sasuke Uchiha.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6953581/1/Continuing-the-Cycle][Continuing the Cycle]] Ongoing. Crossover with Naruto. I'm not sure what to call it but if you like dark and/or insane Harry, you will like this.

Annnd I think that's it for now. There should be something in there to keep you busy for a while. I hope this helped!
