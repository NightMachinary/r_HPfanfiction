Does any one know of some good stories where Harry becomes a necromancer or unites the hallows and becomes the master of death?


** The only real "Master of Death" ones that I've read have been Avengers crossovers.

*** No kidding right? I don't think I've read one that was of considerable length and wasn't an Avengers cross over.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]] is pretty good.

I can't remember anymore right now, but if I find something again I'll let you know.

****** That's the only example I can remember, but if you just sort Harry Potter/Avengers crossovers by favorites theres a couple that should show up pretty quick.

**** Funny you should say that, because the only two I could remember were both Avengers crossovers.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/586020][All Hallow's Eve - New York]] by Whispering Darkness is a fairly amusing oneshot. I'd recommend some of her other works, she does good crossovers. They're all short, though.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21311][Wanderer]] series by cywsaphyre. This one is a bit longer, but it's a WIP that hasn't been updated since 2012. Still good, though.

EDIT: For the Wanderer series, I actually read part 2 first and think that was the better way. Looking over part 1 again, it just kind of jumps right in without giving any of the background info that part 2 starts out with.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1446455/Perspicacity][Perspicacity]] comes immediately to mind.

A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

*** His one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/17/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Whispers]] also qualifies. Supposedly, this is the first chapter and he has a continuation in the works.

Lulu42's complete, novel-length (244k words) effort [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]] has this as a central feature - Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover.

** Those are very often crossovers. I will add that with the exception of Avengers I hadn't seen any of the other media when I read the stories, so I don't think that's a huge barrier. Don't know what you're looking for, but some ideas.

Wand and Shield (Avengers), Illusions of Grandeur (Supernatural), Raison d'Etre (Hitman Reborn), Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black (Naruto), Crestfallen (Avengers), All the Worlds a Stage (Prince of Tennis), Wanderer (Avengers), Irreperable (Avengers), all feature a Harry whose been Master of Death for a while - usually very cynical Harry, sometimes less so. Quality is variable, I put them in very rough quality order but I'm very tired (it's very late/early morning where I am) and I haven't read a few of those in a long long while.

It's a Mad, Mad World (One Piece) also has a Harry whose been Master of Death for a while, I pulled out because the Harry and feel of the story is very different. And One Bright Moment Is All I Ask all (Supernatural) I put as well, not my favorite but it's at least original so I decided to leave it in.

I might come back to this and add a few if I think of it, I probably missed a few. Also, this post is a month old, so this is more for future readers than the original poster.

*** The only thing I can remember reading is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]. Its an Avengers cross over and its pretty good.

Other than that I haven't really read any stories that were of substantial length that I can think of.

I have no idea if this is good or not. I just saw it on on of my followers favorite list, and thought it sounded like something you would like. I hope it is good.
