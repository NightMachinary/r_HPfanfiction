I would like a "Harry drugs the Dursleys" fic. Note: NOT a 'drug-addict Harry`; A /'Harry has a stash that he uses on the Dursleys so he can enjoy a holiday or escape punishment'/.

(I admit that I am halfway confused by the differences between the 'Request' and 'Prompt' tags. And Reddit won't let me edit the title or tag to switch it.)


** Request is for trying to find fics that you believe exist, including vague topics that you want to get recommendations for.

Prompt is for encouraging people to fan-theorize, write mini scenes in the comments, or maybe even be inspired to start their own fics. It's more like "I've just had this idea"

Unfortunately I can't think of fics like this off the top of my head.

** I can't remember any pre-Hogwarts stories with Harry purposely drugging the Dursleys, but I do have some similar ones.

Digitalis by Atsurekino_Kurome. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/941938]])

This deals with poisoning, not drugging. Not pre-Hogwarts, but this is a darker one-shot about Harry's desire to live with Sirius

Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance by Watermelonsmellinfellon ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021]])

This one is much longer, and Harry uses food poisoning to inflict horror on the Dursleys all in the name of malicious compliance.

  Digitalis. Dead Man's Bells. Witch's Gloves. Foxglove. No one would ever guess that it had been him all along. And now they would have to let him live with Sirius.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)
