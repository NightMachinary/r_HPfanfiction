I'm looking for stories where healing plays a prominent role and to gather other people's thoughts on healing in canon.

I think there are a few telling incidents that reveal a lot about healing in Harry Potter.

Let's look at wizards first.

#+begin_quote
  “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal!

  *PS*

  “Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!” roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it. A blinding, sickening pain...a flash of light...distant screams...and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel...

  *HBP*
#+end_quote

Along with Newt's comments on muggles, this seems to prove that wizards are more resilient than muggles. A car crash is not dangerous and a heavy metal object slams into Harry, cracking his skull, compounded by a fall. The fact that both are survivable seems to be a testament to wizarding anatomy. Wizards also enjoy a longer lifespan (Dippet lived to 300!), which may be a byproduct of resiliency or from superior wizarding healing. I suspect a combination of both factors.

#+begin_quote
  October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire.

  *CS*

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening.

  *JKR*
#+end_quote

From these we know that magic overrides the mundane, though the mundane still occurs. Wizards still get colds, though mundane illnesses are easily treated. They probably develop disorders like cancer, get sick with the flu, and other maladies that befall people in real life. The difference is that they're easily treated and curable. You cannot cure the cold in real life.

So what do wizards have to deal with? Magical diseases, injuries, and accidents. How are they treated?

#+begin_quote
  He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood. . . .

  /There seems to be a lot of bleeding; Nagini almost certainly fractured ribs and opened arteries./

  “Well --- now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea. . . . He's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on --- on Muggle wounds ---”

  /Arthur tries suturing for wound closure. Note that Arthur is bandaged before they tried the remedy, hence how Molly found out./

  “It was just --- just something Pye and I thought we'd try --- only, most unfortunately --- well, with these particular kinds of wounds --- it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped ---”

  /Stitches do not work./

  “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake's fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They're sure they'll find an antidote, though, they say they've had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,

  “If they could only take the bandages off, I'd be fit to go home.” “Why can't they take them off, Dad?” asked Fred. “Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr. Weasley cheerfully

  /This seems a bit contradictory. The best explanation I came up with is that the healers were able to control the bleeding, though wound closure proved impossible because of Nagini's venom. As such, the wound continues to bleed a bit (like mad would be an exaggeration). It does, however, bleed to an extent that Mr. Weasley needs to replenish his blood. This isn't exactly an indication that he would die without them. Transfusions are used in actual medicine prophylactically, in the event that bleeding becomes worse (source: personal experience). This also explains why the healers are trying stitches, primarily used for wound closure./

  *OoTp*
#+end_quote

This seems to be what one would expect. This is a magical injury, because of Nagini's nature of being a magical creature (or cursed human if you consider that canon). As such, muggle remedies do not work. However, wizarding remedies are only partially effective as a result of dark magic. Dark magic seems to be the malady that cannot truly be cured.

#+begin_quote
  There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood. They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.

#+end_quote

Again, magic is what is primarily treated by healers. There isn't even a floor dedicated to treating mundane diseases and injuries, suggesting that it may even be expected for people to treat themselves to an extent.

#+begin_quote
  “Episkey” said Tonks. Harry's nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended. “Thanks a lot!”

  his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth. “It was an accident, I'm sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. “I just ---” “Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!” “I can fix that,”

  Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion on the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upwards and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. ‘Wow,' said Harry. ‘It's all I feel safe doing,' said Hermione shakily. ‘There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren't try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage ... he's lost so much blood already ...'

  *HBP*
#+end_quote

Basic healing spells seem to do well sealing wounds, stopping bleeding, and even mending bones. Potions that are readily available can treat serious injuries. It seems that the average wizard should be able to handle injuries with their wand, if they're skilled enough (Harry and Tonks are both above-average wizards) or by using potions.

Along with the sectumsempra incident, I believe the evidence indicates that learning how to heal is primarily training in magic. Anatomy and physiology seem important only for identifying illnesses and injuries, but take a backseat to learning magic. After all, spells that can mend bones, regrow flesh, and control bleeding can be cast by a 6th year. These spells don't seem to require anatomical knowledge. Harry heals a split lip and it's unlikely that Tonks studied the anatomy of a nose during her auror training.

Dark magic seems to complicate things. Bleeding can be controlled with spells and potions but wound closure can be resisted by dark magic. George's ear cannot be reattached because of it but Draco's wound can be healed, and the scars can even be treated with dittany. It does seem that spells are used to mitigate or delay the worst of dark magic and potions are used to treat it, though it may prove impossible to fully heal it. This is in contrast to other magical injuries where spells can usually fix it completely ("There are spells that would put him completely right"). Dumbledore's hand is consistent with this.

#+begin_quote
  “The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been --- forgive me the lack of seemly modesty --- for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale.

  *HBP*

  Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore's throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore's eyelids fluttered and opened.

  *DH*
#+end_quote

Dumbledore implies that he cast spells to delay the curse himself and Snape appears to do the same. It's the potion which Dumbledore drinks that seems to stabilize him and treat him. Dark magic is often incurable, however, and the curse remains fatal, if delayed. Potions seem to be the more consistent, if more time-consuming and inconvenient, method of treating magical illnesses as well. Dragon-pox is cured by a potion.

Healing seems reliant on three branches of magic - charms, transfiguration, and potions.

Charms are used to control bleeding and heal. They may compete with potions for effectiveness when it comes to wound repair (Hermione claims Ron's injury would be better served with spells), but require skill to cast. Charms are also used to treat mental illness, with a course of shock spells being recommended to Harry (OoTP).

Transfiguration is used to reverse spell-damage. They may overlap with charms for wound repairs (Hermione says spells, not charms), but charms seem to play the larger role in healing. I would postulate as well that human transfiguration may be used in extreme cases to stabilize someone where there may not be the resources to save them. Human transfiguration seems permanent (people can be stuck in an inanimate state + Dudley's pig tail), but the existence of untransfiguration suggests that the fundamental nature of the injury or illness may not be one that people want to walk around with. It may be more difficult to heal injuries, or bordering on the near-impossible, with transfiguration given the difficulty of human transfiguration. This is an aspect that fics can take many directions in. Vanishing, however, is also used to remove foreign bodies (Anapneo - HBP). Those poor healers in Artifact Accidents.

Potions are used to treat and heal. Potions seem more time-consuming, requiring preparation before-hand, but offer the benefits of consistency and more unique effects. They are more consistent because they require little skill to administer and work, even if the wound is tainted by dark magic.

I think a thematically consistent system of healing explored in a fic will not simply parallel muggle medicine and slap magical names on it. There isn't surgery in the wizarding world. I doubt wizards need to know about the competition between molecules for cell receptors. One of the best healing I've seen in a story didn't even focus on healing. It mentioned the four humors as being real in healing, which is something thematically consistent with Harry Potter.

What are your thoughts with healing in canon? What ideas do you have for healing in fics? Do you have any fics where healing is explored?

Edit: Totally forgot to touch on magical diseases. From Ron's fake illness and dragon pox, we know that they do exist and that treatment of them ranges from curable (dragonpox) to incurable. Oh, and Nundu's breath is basically the magical version of a bioweapon.


** Yeah, I always got a strong "Theme Hospital" vibe from St Mungo's - weird illnesses, even weirder cures. I feel like magical healing should consist of stuff like standing on a hilltop on the full moon with a frog on your head.

The moment healers start talking about cells etc. is the moment I lose interest. Just as I expect transfiguration to describe matter in a way that is completely different to chemistry, I expect healers to describe the workings of the human body in a way that is completely different to biology.

As for the nature of a wizard's constitution, I agree that it is different to a Muggle's. Not only are we explicitly told so in FB1, but it's the only possible way that wizards can survive e.g. being hit in the head by a metal cannonball flying at over 100mph. If that happened to a Muggle their head would just explode.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula.

#+end_quote

In addition to wizards having a general physical hardiness, this quote indicates to me that there are three categories of things:

- Non-magical threats which wizards are immune to.

- Non-magical threats which wizards are not immune to, but which they can cure easily.

- Magical threats, which cannot be cured easily.

The given example of immunity is a non-magical venom that might kill a Muggle - wizards are said to be able to comfortably survive it. This suggests an innate immunity/resistance to some things, perhaps as a part of wizards' general physical hardiness.

Meanwhile, the example of non-magical threats that wizards are not immune to but can cure easily is a contagious disease.

Initially I had thought that maybe the distinction could be internal/external e.g. wizards would be immune to Muggle illnesses which derive from internal factors (e.g. genetics, developmental disorders, etc.) whereas they would be able to catch (but able to cure) Muggle problems which come from external factors like pathogens. But that doesn't quite work - a venom is an external source.

I think I prefer to phrase it like this: wizards will have an innate resistance to maladies whose medium of attack is largely physical or chemical rather than biological. Injuries, venom, corrosive substances, toxic metals, radiation etc. would fall into the former category. Pathogens would fall into the latter.

** Aww, fuck. I think you just made me accept the whole "wizards are sturdy, quidditch isn't dangerous" schtick I've been fighting so hard against all these years.

This can also excuse all kinds of miracle medicines existing in the wizarding world. Like a better treatment for cancer.

it totally makes sense for magical injuries to simply be the "level 2" of getting hurt in the HP universe.

*** Hermione posits that the venom dissolves the stitches, but no conclusive answer is ever provided. That said, it's really not that difficult to learn how to suture wounds. Worst comes to worst, you put a needle through the wrong type of tissue (and these are cuts that go down to the spinal cord) and the stitch tears free (source: spinal surgeon and the fact that I learned some basic subcutaneous stitches). That seems unlikely, given wizarding resiliency and the extreme interest of Augustus Pye. Arthur also implies the magical nature of the injury prevents muggle remedies from working.

** This makes me want a HP crossover with House, where House diagnoses and treats magical mysteries and maladies at St. Mungo's, with his leg pain being incurable due to a ridiculously dark curse.

Or House replacing Madam Pomfrey as Hogwarts's nurse; I can just imagine how hilarious he would be having to deal with all of the Hogwarts students.

Hell, it could even have Harry becoming like House, with Voldemort's Killing Curse hitting Harry's leg and causing permanent damage that caused him pain as he limps around being a sarcastic, cynical ass, but with his own mix of kindness and gentleness every now and again. Bonus points if Harry and Snape still hate each other but have a grudging respect for each other, as Harry has to acknowledge Snape's skill in Potions and knowledge of the Dark Arts, and Snape has to acknowledge Harry's ability to diagnose and treat magical injuries and illnesses.
