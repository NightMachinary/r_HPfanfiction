After finishing "The Granger Principle", I've started a new story, "Stranded". It's set in an alternate universe where the Potters survived and Voldemort died for good in 1981.


** Sounds like a HP version of the Blue Lagoon movies at first glance. Neat

I've yet to be disappointed by one of your fics and can't wait to start reading

*** Well, without explicit stuff, and a little more action - it's a magical deserted island, after all. The environment isn't the only or even the major danger for a wizard and witch with their wands.

  Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. The star Seeker and the swotty muggleborn have been at each other's throats since their first year at Hogwarts. Their feud has cost Gryffindor more points than the Weasley twins and has now resulted in the two of them being stranded on a deserted island.
