Must he/she geet permission form you to use your character in their story?

Also, to what limit would you allow this(if you did) ie

froma scale of

just a mention,talks with the protagonist, to Spin off story


** I mean, isn't that sort of what we are doing in fanfiction anyways? Taking characters from a story and putting them in different situations with (sometimes) different personalities? I think it's cool, as long as someone doesn't use a character in the /exact/ same way, as in same discussions, same actions, same everything. If someone takes a name and uses them completely differently, its just fanfiction.

I agree. If you weren't using someone else's characters you'd just call it "Fiction."

** I'm rather pleased that I've cornered the market on my unique character such that others using the name end up having to disclaim association. If someone wanted to use her as written, I'd be intrigued as well as flattered.

** I'm pretty sure I'd be fine with it, as long as the author gave me a hat tip in acknowledgement. Most of the OCs I've created have played such minor parts that I can't imagine anyone wanting to borrow them. But even if I'd produced a bunch of fully fleshed-out protagonists with complex backstories and novel-length character arcs, I can't imagine objecting to another writer doing to them what I'm already doing to JKR's world and characters. It would be hypocritical of me.

** My fictions are remixes in the first place. I never asked Rowling about it and I don't expect anyone to ask me.

I'd be cool with whole storylines just being reused. Its the Internet, after all.

** If its an OC character, you should definitely ask the author if you can use it -- and probably tell the author how much of an extent you're going to use that OC. If the author doesn't respond don't use their OC.

However, if its just a take on a canon character (maybe someone did a Hermione with a terminal illness and you liked that) then I don't believe you need permission. Maybe a nod in an AN about inspiration but it's not necessary.

*** I wouldn't go so far as to say "don't use it" unless they specifically ask you not to. I'm sure JKR would rather us not write many many things we've written: the point of fanfic is taking existing characters and other bits of canon and juxtaposing them with your ideas. The author doesn't get a say because no one's profiting. You're just making fanfic fanfic. Lol. Now, what you are allowed to do is different from what makes you a jerk to do...

**** It's about respect. JK explicitly allows us to use her character to make fanfiction -- however that OC you want to use doesn't belong to JK, it belongs to the author that created it. Also, you never know what that author will end up doing with OCs; sometimes fanfic authors will start writing original fiction, maybe even one heavily influenced by their fanfic, and they pull their fanfic from the site, but your story is still up there with the character in there, and they don't even know because you never told them. What's the point of not telling them? If someone used your OC in their own fic, wouldn't you want to know, if not just purely so you can see their take on it?

*** Isn't it not highly hypocritical that a fanfiction author would start making trouble about someone else using his characters though??

I'd say that, when properly given credit, you are free to use someone else's OCs. Or did you personally ask permission from Rowling for every fic you did?

**** No? JK Rowling explicitly said that fanfiction using her characters was alright. OCs can be personal -- some fanfiction authors end up writing original fiction and can end up using those OCs. It's a respect thing. If you respect the author you're borrowing an OC from, you wouldn't repurpose their original character without asking. This is just my opinion however. I don't write fanfiction for ASOIAF because GRRM doesn't approve of it, and I respect that.

***** I'm pointing out that that "respect" is a choice, not a rule. You won't get in trouble for doing it, even if people might think you're a jerk.

It's hard to tell if OP is concerned with respect or legality, so I think it's only proper to clarify the difference. It's still perfectly legal to write ASOIAF fanfiction, just not respectful of the original author. Same with using an OC from a fic, with or without permission.

I absolutely agree with the way you decide to respect them, I just feel it's necessary to point out that acting so considerately is our choice.

****** Yes of course. This is just my opinion, I can't control anyone else. I'm basing this on if I had an OC that someone wanted to use, having them ask me for permission is what I would like for them to do.

As for rules... we all know that its tough time getting the admins/mods over at FFnet to take down pure plagiarism already. They won't bother with grey area like OCs. I'm aware that it's someone's choice to show respect, and I'm merely just asking them to be courteous and tell the author. If they don't, what can I do? Nothing. But I also believe in doing my part to make this world a slightly less assholish place, and since OP asked for opinions, why not give mine.
