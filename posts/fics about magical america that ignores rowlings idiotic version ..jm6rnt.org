** linkffn(3964606) Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle (and its sequels). Set in an OC magic school in America, the events of the canon books barely even factor in - and Inverarity's version of Wizarding America is a lot more fleshed-out than J.K. Rowling's.

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

** Starfox5's multi-fic verse has a different and pretty interesting America, but there's no fic set there. Only a single chapter in The Granger Principle and small bits of information mentioned here and there across other Starfox5 fics. There's a lot of relatively small magical countries scattered across North America with Magical Quebec currently/recently at war. Jamaica is full of zombie magic and there's sections in several Starfox5 fics about fighting those. The worldbuilding is A+.
