Here's mine:

The first fanfiction I read was a PJO one set in high school. I never got far into it because I thought the original books were better.

Fast forward years later, I read a hilarious story on Twitter about a guy who accidentally stumbled upon this really weird Harry Potter fanfiction disguised as the original book. The plot seemed really interesting and different so the following summer I went back and started reading it.

- It was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent)

I was initially only interested in the Harry/Hermione pairing, so I skimmed through quite a bit of the beginning part, but as I went on, I became hooked. The story was great, and several sleepless nights later I was onto the second part of the series---then the third one. Before I knew it, I was reading fanfic for the rest of the summer.

I still do now from time to time. I'm currently following two ongoing fics, and when I have free time I'd read a short story here and there. I also started writing my own fanfics around December, but I'm still very inexperienced.

What's your story?


** I stumbled across HPMoR, then half a year later I realized that there was more, read The Arithmancer and since then I've Alm constantly been reading something

** I was 12 when OOTP came out and couldn't wait to read what happened next. So I wrote my own sixth-year story, “Harry Potter and the Green Flamed Torch” (remember those rumors that this was going to be the name for book 6??). Anyways. It was pretty terrible. There was another Yule Ball, Harry continued dating Cho...

Shortly after starting that, I stumbled across MNFF and started reading stories there. Then branched out to other sites. I eventually started writing again, they were still terrible (Keep in mind I would've been 13-14 at this point) but much better than my first. I wrote two novel length stories and a handful of one shots in the span of a couple of years.

In middle school, I went on to be a mod at SIYE for a bit, and worked as a graphics designer on TDA (HPFF sister's site which made all of the banners for story summaries). I was a self taught graphics “designer” with a bootlegged copy of photoshop lol.

By high school I was getting into a slump. I was still reading lots of stories but had a very hard time completing my own stories. I had multiple ones that I started, completely planned out, and couldn't finish. Major writers block. So I kind of stepped away from it for a bit.

A couple of years after I graduated high school I started writing one story that I had had the idea for for a long time. It took me 8 years (during which time I went to university and got my degree in Nursing) but I did finish it!! I haven't posted it online anywhere but I'm very proud of it and continue tweaking it every so often. I would eventually like to write multiple stories revolving around my OC so we'll see how that pans out.

A nice relaxing night to me is honestly sitting at home alone, a warm drink in hand, reading and writing fan fiction. My husband knows about it but when he goes out for the evening I love cuddling up on the couch with my laptop and start typing away.

** I heard about fanfiction years ago. It always seemed to be Star Trek stuff about Kirk and Spock getting off together and rather coloured the whole genre for me.

It wasn't until years later when I was trapped on TV Tropes for some reason and stumbled across the HP Fanfiction list. I had no idea people were still doing fanfics at all, let alone of HP so I read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

As the first piece of HPFF I read it seemed incredible: I had no idea people could actually do this - fitting their own stories into the existing narrative framework. I'd assumed it was all like the Star Trek stuff, where the monster-of-the-week style of that series meant people could just write whatever stuff they wanted.

I read a /lot/ of stuff that year - 2013. My standards were a lot lower simply because I didn't know what was available. I've done a bit of pruning since then but even so my favourites list has 41 stories from 2013 and only 56 since then.

For me the turning point was when I read Letters by [[/u/Te7]] - and this isn't me just winding him up for once, it really was the first story of his I read. With hindsight even that one isn't great but it led me on to Vitam Paramus, which definitely is.

And that's where I am now. It takes excellent, original stories to get me going. [[/u/Te7]], [[/u/Starfox5]], [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] and maybe one or two others.

** Someone on the main site recommended linkffn(Not From Others) as a Canon compliant Ginny POV story. Absolutely loved the story and just got drawn into fanfiction from that! Continued mostly with Canon compliant stories like linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Halfblood Prince). Then went through a Robst phase unfortunately. From there got into slight AUs. Then went through a crack fix phase. Now I'm solidly in a dimension/time travel phase.

** My 50 y/o mom actually got me started. She reads a ton of Pride and Prejudice ffn, and I was really intrigued by the fact that she seemed to have endless reading material right at her fingertips. In an attempt to enable my well-hidden HP obsession, she encouraged me to take a look to see what was out there. I've never looked back. I think some of the first fics I read were Dramione stories, but since then I've planted myself firmly in the Harry/Hermione camp (with a few minor dalliances). After that it was a short hop, skip, and jump to writing my own stories.

** Mine's a tad convoluted. There was this webcomic I read (Which I found from another webcomic which I found from Deviantart). Someone on the forums uploaded a gallery of edits of the comic, one of which was tagged as an HPMOR gag (in this case, they took the opening note Harry found about The Game), and I was bored enough to be looking through the forum, so I looked up HPMOR.

Now, I was an arrogant almost-adult, and ate that shit up. I look back on MoR with a more critical eye now, but I still think the story has redeeming points.

Anyways, from there, I looked at the TVTropes page for the work, and then when I looked at one of the trope pages, I saw Oh God Not Again listed as an example, and, well, it was all downhill from there.

I was an idle fanfiction reader until recently, when a friend recommended DP&SW to me, which I read after MUCH convincing. Fun fact: I have an addictive personality and reading stories gives me a rush. After finishing that fic, I needed a fix. And thus, my life was ruined.

** For fanfiction itself, I used to watch this show back in the day that only aired once every few weeks and I got tired of waiting so I started looking online for stuff about it and found fanfiction. (Best day ever.)

For Harry Potter, I loved the books and as soon as I finished one I'd read fics to finish what was left out of the story. Different interpretations. Never imagined how much I was going to love this fandom.

** When I was 10 we got our first home computer and the internet. I didn't really know what to do with it besides play games, but I figured out how to look things up online and found a site with people talking about Harry Potter. So I went around there a lot, talking about theories and easter eggs. Eventually the discussions of what might happen morphed into stories.

** I remember my first fic, but not the name of it. Only some vague plot points. It was about Harry going to Durmstrang, meeting a creepy boy who wanted to dedicate his life to Necromancy. Much, /much/ later in the story Harry finds out he's some sort of reincarnation of a Dark angel of evilness and falls in love with his Light counterpart. It was a slash story. Horribly cliched but if it's your first fic it all seems so original and fresh!

That was way back in 2010. How I even found the story in the first place is a mystery for me, I think I clicked a link on a forum somewhere that took me to the story directly. After that I made my account on FF.net and never looked back.

** I discovered nifty.org (very NSFW) as a teen on the recommendation of an acquaintance - it's basically original gay stories. Many of them are porn and badly written, but I was there for the stories which normalised gay relationships, having grown up more gay than straight in a very repressive household. These were literally some of the first stories I read that involved gay characters at all, let alone in a positive manner. A year or so later I was at TAFE (similar to community college) and a classmate was reading fan fiction in class (she ended up failing the semester lol). I was curious and she told me what it was. She was reading Kingdom of Hearts slash fanfic which I'd never played so I wasn't really interested in the fandom but the concept of slash fanfiction was like a revelation. I could read about my favourite characters in positive gay relationships! I was sold. I looked for Harry Potter fanfic first and I still love that fandom. My classmate was happy to help me navigate past the badly spelt and poorly plotted stuff right to the good stuff. That was 12 years ago and I never looked back.

** I've known about the existence of fanfictions pretty much since I was a kid but I never really started reading them. When I was about 12 I read a fic about Total Drama Island but that was all. This year (I'm 21) I decided to start reading fluffy fanfictions to quit watching hardcore porn. Now I'm in a transition phase between the two. Reading romantic stuff about HP characters is something I've never experienced before. Now I feel that I'm becoming an adult as I'm getting more interested in this kind of stuff. That's about it.

** I started reading manga and watching anime in 1991, and when the Internet started in my country in the mid-90s, looking up anime and manga led to stumbling upon fanfiction. Started to browse through my favourite fandoms, joined the Fanfiction Mailing List, and I've been reading fanfiction off and on since then. I started writing in 2014 after finding one too many "Marriage Law" stories where the same people who just defeated Voldemort and his army meekly let the new Ministry force them to marry strangers.
