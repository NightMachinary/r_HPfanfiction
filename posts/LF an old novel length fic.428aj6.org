I am looking for an old novel length fic i read a couple years ago, i think it was a 2 fic arc, both novel length, but the second was unfinished at the time. i am pretty sure it was a h/hr, but with heavy ginny presence (non-romantic). i remember both harry and hermione got hurt quite often, and each was pissed off when the other got hurt, and healing spells didn't work like canon, so they often had to use crutches for injured leg(s). one line i remember was a quiddich match with draco & slytherin team, where harry got hurt, and hermione was screaming "who broke my harry" or something similar. mostly took place in hogwarts, but i think they discovered/purchased a property (potter manor?) where they lived. i believe it started in 3rd-4th year, and went thru to adulthood?, or at least 7th year. it had somewhat mary-sue characters, but that was counteracted by the slower healing times limiting their risk-taking and abilities (hard to do certain things when injured). i don't think there was any bashing, but don't remember for sure... i think that the first fic was 500k+ words, maybe closer to 800k, unsure of the second. possibly on ff.net or portkey, but again, not sure.

On a completely different note, does anybody have an archived copy of the harmony sheppard series? went to re-read the other day, and it was taken down. :(


** The first thing I think of is the duology "Sunset Over Britain" and "Sunrise Over Britain" by Bobmin. The first revolves around Voldemort taking over Britain (magical and muggle), forcing Harry (and supporters) to flee to Ireland where he has an estate left to him by Sirius. Sunrise involves the long retaking of Britain (with allied help).

Harry is seriously injured in the first and in a way that can't be magically healed, so he's partially disabled through the rest of the fics (a counter-balanced to being massively overpowered otherwise). It's Harry/Hermione, Neville/Ginny, Draco/Luna, Susan/Terry Boot, Remus/Tonks.

Total word count is over 1 million words and, I think, a bit longer than JKR's canon series.

It's got some really, really, REALLY dark stuff coming from Voldemort. That's not including the nasty muggle concentration camps, too. But it's a very big, very epic story.

Bashing? Dumbledore is super-controlling then goes a bit insane, so... yeah, some bashing there. Ron and Molly don't come off well, but mostly due to Dumbledore influencing them.

It was never on FF.net. It's posted on fanficauthors.net - search for the titles and you'll find them.

Unfortunately, Bob was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this month, so there won't be any new fics from him and his wife and their incomplete material won't be completed.

I'm afraid I don't know what you mean by Harmon Sheppard. Is that the one with a female Sheppard who's a descendant of Harry Potter and thrown back in time?

** i have read the sunset series, but unfortunately, that is not the one i am thinking of... thanks for the suggestion though. and sfjoellen is correct, i was referring to guardian54's series. maybe someone has a epub they saved of them?
