Not too picky about tropes (though a couple of my favourites are Time-Travel to Mauraders Era and Marriage Law AUs)

Ship-wise I like Dramione or Hermione/any Maurauder, I also don't mind Harmony but overall I'm not super picky as long as it's well written (though please no Romione or Tomione).

I've got a lot of time to kill at the moment so long fics are preferred - preferably 50+ chapters.

And in terms of writing style as I said, well-written is a must, but I don't want anything too crazy complex to read or understand (think original books style if possible).

Hit me with your faves!

** Before/During the Hogwarts [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] Where Hermione is a math genius. Wonderful fanfiction with good character development, explores the arithmancy idea in depth. Its also very long and has two sequels! Hermione/George

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12783124/1/][Rewriting Destiny]] Dramione. They go back in time and are reborn as siblings to the marauder generation to change things for the better

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11210783/1/][Alternate History]] Dramione. After her first day of defense, Hermione wakes up in an alternate dimension that's similar to her own with a few jarring differences

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] Hermione goes back in time 169 days before Halloween to save James and Lily as well as end the war early. Hermione/Sirius

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]] A lonely Hermione summons demons in order to have real friends. Very cute but very serious

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/][The Green Girl]] Dramione. Hermione is sorted into slytherin...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] Harmony. Hermione sends her consciousness back in time to save Harry and others.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4130385/1/][Another Life]] Dramione. After a potions incident, Hermione and Draco live out one of their past lives in WW2 Paris.

After the War: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5498748/1/Simply-Irresistible][Simply Irresistible]] Dramione. Ron cheats on Hermione, and Draco gives her a makeover. Better than I made it sound I promise

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12720584/1/][The Smurg]] Hermione/Grindelwald. Hermione goes back in time and falls in love with Grindelwald as a side product of taking tom in to prevent the whole war.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12005496/1/][The Elvenqueen]] Hermione/Legolas. Where Hermione ends up in Middle Earth and becomes the precursor of magic. You don't really need any LoTR knowledge.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12168521/1/][Apple Pies and other Amends]] Dramione Hermione bakes everyone affected by the war some sort of pastry, and saves the Malfoys for last. Very cute.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8192178/1/][My Amnesia Girl]] Dramione. Years ago, he left her on the altar, and now that she's seen him again, she pretends she has amnesia to avoid the confrontation.

(I actually don't know if all of them are as long as you want, but I'm hoping the number of them make up for it!) Ok I honestly might have more, so if you enjoyed any/all of the recommendations just message me!!

*** Just finished the Arithmancer series! Had me totally hooked and had I not had other commitments on I probably would have finished in inside a week (took me 10 days with not a lot of sleep as it was lol). Probably one of the best fics I've read to date and I will most definitely be looking into your other recommendations very soon!

**** Oh my goodness I agree!! It's so good at making Hermione powerful but also make mistakes and own up to them. The romance is awesome and I just love her characterization of pretty much everyone. I'm so happy you enjoyed it!!:)

*** Just finished Alternate History! I loved it! My only complaint would be that the ending felt kind of incomplete, but that may just be that I've gotten really used to these kind of fics having a time jump to an epilogue and this one didn't

** My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel. It might fall into the too complex realm... but it is so good, I can't resist.

**** I'm so glad you liked them! I really love her stuff! Pretty edgy and complex. I hope she writes a third. I thought so, too, about the ending of the second one. I've subscribed to all of her stories.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3434417/1/The-Purple-Potion]]

There's a conspiracy surrounding a purple potion that can grant squibs magic for a short time, but the makers think that only Hermione can perfect it for some reason.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/968343]] Just finished these two. It's a supernatural crossover but you don't need to know anything about supernatural (I only have the vaguest of knowledge and I loved it.). No romance yet.
