:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, i've been looking for this fic that I remember and it's been driving me crazy.

Here are some details I remember: - One of those Pro-muggle fics, that focuses on the "muggle way" of doing things - Harry somehow ends up in an orphanage after his brother is declared the boy-who-lived. - Harry goes by James - The story starts when Harry is already an adult (or close to it), when Dumbledore decides that he might actually be the BWL and brings James and Lily to meet him - Doesn't bash Dumbledore or the brother, I think Harry ended up not liking James, but Lily was supportive of him - Harry had a job as a lab tech (I think), and was a serious work-o-holic - Harry had a muggle best friend, and they were both geniuses and complete nerds - At some point in his past Harry put all the bibles in a library in the fiction section - The author's name was something like "squirreloncrack" or something close to that

If you could help me find this fic I would appreciate it, this is seriously bothering me. Thanks in advance.
