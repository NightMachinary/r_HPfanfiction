** Learn to use commas and capitalization properly. Sweet Jesus.

Bad grammar and punctuation aside, while not unreadable, this fic is nowhere near good. You're using heaps of bland dialogue to try and explain to us a set of non-canon circumstances instead of telling us a story about the characters that exist within those circumstances.

Put simply, it was boring and failed to convey the emotion of the situation.

In the future, whether you're writing a new story or editing this one, you should try and place yourself inside the minds of your characters. Try and see the world through their eyes. Your dialogue will have a more realistic flow.

EDIT: Also...

Writers Law: You should never EVER use personal nicknames in exposition. An author's narration exists outside of personal relationships between the characters. AKA no 'Siri' or 'Sev' or 'Lils' or 'Mione' or 'Gin' unless a character is talking / thinking / describing the situation from a first person point of view.

AKA DO NOT DO THIS: [ "Blah blah blah," said Sev. ]

*** I would argue that personal nicknames might work if that's how the character thinks of themselves, or perhaps if used in a scene meant specifically to show how close the character in question is to the person who gave them the name. Of course, you're right that it shouldn't be done as a general rule. You'd have to be very careful about how and where you might do such a thing.

**** /-I would argue that personal nicknames might work if that's how the character thinks of themselves-/

Obviously not what I was referring to. If a character thinks of himself as, for example, 'Ron' instead of 'Ronald', then that name exists outside of a relationship between characters and can be freely used in exposition.

/-or perhaps if used in a scene meant specifically to show how close the character in question is to the person who gave them the name.-/

If you find yourself tempted to do this, take a sharp pencil and jam it into your eye-socket repeatedly. A Pavlovian response should kick in after the second or third time.

** It was okay in my opinion. You need to reduce dialogues and write a story. Where is the background information? What are the settings in the environment? You'll need to introduce us to your story first like we never read Harry Potter.

Like jittedtepmlar said.

Also there are no drama or conflict situation.

It is my opinion, though.
