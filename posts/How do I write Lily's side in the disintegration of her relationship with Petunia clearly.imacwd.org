So, I'm writing a Marauders Era fic (AU, not canon-compliant, but the Lily-Petunia thing will still happen. Stuff only starts to change at Hogwarts), and a major arc is going to be the disintegration of Lily and Petunia's relationship. We already know where Petunia's resentment began to grow, but Lily must have also had some fault in it.

The traits I've picked up for Lily is that she was naive, stubborn and righteous, based off of the (little) dialogue we get in the books.

So I guess my question is- how do I accurately portray Lily and Petunia's relationship and Lily's side specifically?


** Try not to make Lily a Mary Sue.

I don't have much experience as this but try make Lily both sad and angry about it. Sad that the bond she once shared with Petunia was fading and angry that she couldn't just accept Lily.

Im pretty sure you already know this but im going to say it anyway. Petunia will squash the jealousy she feels in favor for hatred

Yeah, people do write her as perfect, don't they? I'll make sure to keep in mind the rest of your advice too. As another Redditor pointed out, sibling dynamics are complicated, and I'm going to have to try to put myself in their shoes quite a bit while writing.

** Don't make Lily just a victim, she can feel like it at times, but let there be moments when the reader is allowed to feel bad for Petunia...

Lily was the one that stayed friends with someone that had hurt Petunia and let that someone she didn't like look through her stuff, before she called Lily a freak. Lily was the one to break the trust first and there is a good chance that to Petunia her apologize just never seemed honest has long as she stayed friends with Snape. Maybe she never said this part out loud or Lily just didn't feel that it was fair for Petunia to force her to choose. Maybe it was a reason why Lily and Snape's friendship got worse, because Lily always had in the back of her head that she gave up her sister for this, whenever Snape and her fought or he did something she didn't like. But this made her bitter towards Petunia at the same time, like Petunia is in a way destroying both those relationships by making her choose.

Or you could make Lily as jealous of Petunia as the other way round. I mean there is a war going on in the magical world for her right to exist. Lily doesn't really has a place in either the muggle or magical world, while Petunia never had to doubt her place. And while Petunia says that their parents dot on Lily when she is home, Lily isn't around for most of the time and she spends her time in a world her parents don't understand and Lily is losing her connection to the muggle world at the same time. It can be small things that Lily feels left out. A song or movie or show that their father tried to describe but forgot the name about and Lily is just clueless and Petunia just hears a little bit of it and knows what he is talking about or that her mother needs something from the store and Lily offers to get it, but her mother still sends Petunisa, because she knows the right brand.... Things like that

*** This is super good advice, thanks. I'll make sure to pay attention to the little things.

**** In what way is your story AU? Because that can be very important for that relationship as well.

I write a (mostly) canon-compliant story out of Lily's pov about her Hogwarts years and have Lily and Petunia dance around each other for a long time, but it turns more and more bitter with time.

At one point Petunia repeats a nasty rumor she heard in the neighborhood that could be about Snape and Lily gets angry in a fight to defend him (mostly because she is really frustrated that she always has to defend him at Hogwarts against her other friends and at home against her family), so much that she makes the silverware rattle on the table and Petunia just pulls away from the argument because she is afraid. So Lily just won that argument by intimating her sister and breaks something in Petunia and Lily just didn't notice at that moment.

So let there be moments when the reader can feel for Petunia, maybe even let her reach out to Lily in some way, that Lily didn't realize at that moment or is something Lily can't appreciate

** I think I disagree with your traits for Lily. But that aside, the most pertinent advice is to remember that you at the same time can love /and/ hate your sister.

Sibling dynamics are full of contradictions; if you have one yourself, you'll know.

*** Yeah. My relationship with my sister is one of the most beautiful yet fucked up things I have experienced. I'll be sure to keep this in mind when writing Lily and Petunia, as well as Sirius and Regulus. I'm actually SUPER excited to explore their relationship because it's similar to my family dynamic in some ways, though way more extreme, obviously. Also, I'm super obsessed with the Blacks- that is one /messed up/ family.

** A dash of embarrassment would be good. Was reading one awhile ago where Dumbledore pointed out that contrary to popular belief, he is not omniscient. Lily always said everything was 'fine' with Petunia. Why wouldn't he assume she wouldn't abuse her nephew.

** Establish if you think it was an active thing or passive. Did they grow apart through circumstance and that caused bitterness or were there moments where they fought. It is possible that Lily never noticed Petunia didn't like her until it was too late, or that Petunia would grow out of it.

Well if you're just going to make her Hermione you can look to how poor Hermione was socially. Lily didn't understand why Petunia should be bothered so didn't bother herself with Petunia's issues.

*** I mean, she can share traits with Hermione and not *be* Hermione. Hermione was also righteous and stubborn, but I imagine Lily as more carefree and a people person. We don't really know much about her, so I've had to rely on my imagination (and as I said, this is an AU, so she'll be different than canon Lily by the end), and I certainly don't imagine her as the original Hermione.

Hermione doesn't do well socially because she's uptight and corrects people, and kids don't typically like that. Also, she's nerdy. I imagine Lily as quite popular and carefree, but someone who stands up for what she believes in. I think she's quite trusting and naive, and is a "give people a chance" kind of person. Just because people have similarities doesn't mean that they are the exact same.
