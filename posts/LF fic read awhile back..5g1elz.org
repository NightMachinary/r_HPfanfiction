Sadly I've read too many fic's to keep most apart in my mind if it's been more than a few months read. The fic I'm looking for. I think is set after Albus has died and Harry has involved others in the quest to destroy the horcrux's. Two of the group I think remus was one of them head to Egypt to look for information on them. There they find the keepers of the library of Alexandria. And with there knowledge they remove the one from Harry. Sorry I know that's not alot to go on! Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!


** I definitely read this one and I think it is in my followed stories, but I have no idea which one. I'm going through them but I doubt I'll pick out the exact right one. See if one of these jogs your memory.

linkffn(barefoot by zaraxamas; a different professor by asphodelwolf15; Grief's wisdom by poetheather1; gathering storm by wh157l3r; ignition by the modern sorcerer)

Edit: it might be older than any of these. I sorted my follows by updated but I've got so damn many I'm sure I couldn't pick it out. It's not likely to be the first two since Dumbledore is alive.

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor?

  What would happen if a certain pink hair Auror was introduced to Harry a little sooner? What if Voldemort was less concerned about secrecy and had built up his forces while he was without a body? A storm would gather and like always Harry will find himself in the middle. Takes place during Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. HarryxTonksxFleur.

  Harry Potter's temper has always been rather dangerous, but it's not until things start bursting into flames that people realise exactly how fiery it is. And now that the fire's been lit, Harry isn't all that willing to let it be smothered again, in fact he's all for letting it burn. And should the Ministry or Voldemort stand in his way? Well... fire solves everything.

  Harry is not feeling very good about life. His godfather has just died and he almost got his friends killed. How could he be so stupid? There had to be some sort of way to get better... right? His grief and guilt lead him to question what he knows and try to find a better way. An Alternate HBP. Lunar Harmony maybe?

*** It's not Cartographer's Craft, is it? I'm only halfway through it but I could definitely see Remus going to Egypt, since there's been some hints dropped about it.

edit: It's the one where Sirius pops out of the map as a teenager.
