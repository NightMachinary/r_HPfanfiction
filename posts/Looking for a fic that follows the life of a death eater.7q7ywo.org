I wonder if there are any fanfiction that follows a pureblood that grew up in a pureblood supremacist family, that sees the decline of power of purebloods and sees voldemorts cause as honorable? Basically what i am trying to say that a conflict has two sides. I want the death eaters to be seen as troubled or misguided persons instead of being evil just for the sake of it. Preferably marauders era because many death eaters joined then.


** Well, in my story "Divided and Entwined", POV characters join Voldemort for a variety of reasons, but it doesn't show them growing up - it's set in an AU starting at year 5. "Let's be evil" isn't one of the reasons, though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11240489/1/A-Tale-of-Two-Sides][A Tale of Two Sides]] by Emiliya Wolfe is a really good character analysis of Death Eaters even though the story is mainly from a OC POV.

I also suggest reading the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809115][renascentia]] series by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi. The two co-writers did extensive background accounts and characters study on the life of the Black brothers when they are growing up. So we get the perspective of why Regulus join the â€˜Dark Lord' and what led him to make the choices he made.

  James and Emma Potter are twins - inseparable. They have their Hogwarts years planned out from the start, including the House: "Gryffindor, where the brave dwell at heart!" But what happens when the impossible comes true? Standing on opposite sides of the war, the twins realise that not everything is as black and white as it seems... Thank you summersaults16 for your amazing cover!

** You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki64

Graces Malfoy is portrayed incredibly Well, shows an unwilling 5th year swept into the service of the Dark Lord. Neville/OC Highly recommend.
