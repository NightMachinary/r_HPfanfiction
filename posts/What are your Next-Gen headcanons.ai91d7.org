I know most people prefer pretending the Epilogue doesn't exist, but just humor me :)


** - James Sirius Potter is an arrogant toe-rag, though not completely a bad sort.

- Albus Severus Potter despises his name but other than that he does not posses any of his characterization from /Cursed Child./ He's terrified of failure, but he doesn't resent the successful.

- Lily Luna Potter loves her name and her namesakes and is always experimenting with charms and potions and plants and animals. She has the most visits to the Hospital Wing out of any of her siblings. She also "inherited" Luna's barefoot habits.

- Rose Weasley has a special bond with Neville and Herbology is her favorite subject. She's somewhat distant from her mother, who is heavily involved in the Ministry, while Rose despises government. She has a habit of falling asleep in the library, and carries around both schoolbooks and storybooks constantly.

- Lucy Weasley, Percy's second daughter, I must confess I hadn't given any thought to until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][/The Noticing of Lucy Weasley/]]. So yeah, a girl who idolizes her daddy and acknowledges the importance of pencil pushers.

- Fred Weasley, despite being fascinated by pranks, spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think he's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot.

- Scorpius Malfoy was sorted into Hufflepuff. He yearns to become a Healer. A quiet sort, he is utterly baffled by the antics of the Everyone Else. Being an only child and having no cousins close to his age, the way Albus and Rose and Lily can argue to the point of screaming one day and the next save one another favorite deserts is among the strangest thing he's ever seen.

Edit: Oy! I forgot Hugo! And several others! Silly me!

- Hugo Weasley is fascinated by story and myth. He carries a copy of /Les Miserables/ with his schoolbooks. The tome is so thick that nobody notices it isn't a course book. He also gets a kick out of pushing all of Rose's buttons, to his own amusement, and despite being two years younger learned how to beat her at rough housing by the time he was six.

- Victoria Weasley speaks French and English interchangeably. She is the only one of her family who doesn't use an Ollivander wand, but got hers from a French wand-maker. When she and Dominique want to discuss things privately, the converse in French.

- Molly, Percy's oldest daughter, is every bit a mother hen as her grandmother. She also favors some Muggle tools, taking after her mother. She wears glasses like her father.

*** Your Potter kids are what you'd find in every fanfiction. That isn't /bad/, but I don't care for clones. If James is just like his namesakes then it's because Harry and Ginny pressured him into it.

**** While I understand your complaint--and I agree with it, I have to keep in mind, Lucy's characterization from /The Noticing/ affects how I see James.

I reckon James Sirius is arrogant, but he's also more connected. While James Sr. was popular, James Sirius has connections.

He knows all the best people to get something because he helped them do it. He collects favors, but doesn't collect of them, preferring long-term alliances, but not in a political sense.

If he pulls a prank, he is adamant that it cannot hurt someone badly enough that they cry. Screaming is fine--he has a habit of jinxing Lily's hair to turn pink and hexing Rose to speak in foreign languages that nobody else speaks--but he won't make someone cry.

As for his studies, I reckon he's brilliant, but fakes not knowing things because he favors the old ways of Master and Apprentice rather than multi-subject schooling. He gets perfect marks on his OWLs and NEWTs solely for the opportunity to see the looks on everyone's faces.

The way I figure, halfway between T.J. Detweiler and The Great Brain, but with magic.

** I had a lot of fun putting some of my headcanons into a humour one shot a while ago. I took some of the most annoying traits of Hermione and Ron and smashed them together in tribute to Adrian mole, writing Hugo as an obnoxious, angst filled, oblivious teenage boy. Thankfully most people saw the humour and enjoyed it for it's ridiculousness but plenty of people thought he was appalling and couldn't understand why I had written him. But i just find it really funny to headcanon Rose as Hermione with the best bits of Ron and then a second sibling just desperately trying to compete and being filled with righteous indignation. It's also fun to make fun of teenagers sometimes.

I also headcanon Teddy as becoming a sensitivs writer/poet type. He gets Victoire pregnant not long after she graduates and has a bit of a panic regarding money and fatherhood, but thankfully has a big support system around him so is ok I think. I like to imagine he ultimately finds success as a writer.

** James is in Gryffindor only because it's expected of him. Unlike Albus, he wasn't ever told he had other options. He was raised from infancy hearing things like, "Oh, he'll be a Gryffindor for sure! Just like his namesakes, that one." As a result he strives to do exactly what's expected of him. Eventually he gets tired of this and realizes that no matter what he does, Harry will still prefer Albus over him. Later he dissociates from his family and leaves the country.

Albus is very entitled. He insists he's put in Slytherin even though the Hat points out he lacks traits for the House (edit: because he thinks that's what Harry wants). He often gives up before trying because he can't deal with failure. Eventually he admits that he and James ought to have switched Houses. Albus would be better off in Gryffindor, while James is better suited for Slytherin. They both try to be people they're not.

Lily is the only one happy with her life - at least, that's how it appears from the outside. She can't really stand Albus, but she supports James and makes sure he feels like he has a place in the family.

Rose tries to remain friends with Albus but eventually grows tired of his attitude. Scorpius, one of Albus' fellow Slytherins, sympathizes with her.

** (All of this assumes no ASP and no Malfoy offspring since the males of that family rot in prison)

- Andromeda found Delphi and passes her off as Nymphadora's daughter. Delphi knows about her parentage, as do Teddy, Harry and Ginny.

- Andromeda has a very bad opinion of Remus Lupin and makes no secret out of that. Harry feels bad whenever she mentions anything about his father to Teddy, but he did not know Lupin outside of the DADA and can therefore not refute her statements. And the worst is that she uses him as a positive example.

- Delphi and Teddy were raised as siblings, Delphi constantly tries to set-up Teddy and Victorie all the time but sucks at matchmaking.

- Delphi and Teddy fill the "big sibling" role for James Sirius and Lily Luna

- Ron and Hermione split amicably after a week, Ron became a womanizer, Hermione a kickass lawyer. Both spoil the children of Harry as well as his godchild(ren).

- Harry and Hermione went to Australia to fetch her parents while the Weasleys were grieving. Upon their return, Ginny immediately joined them at Grimmauld because she couldn't take the atmosphere at the Burrow anymore. Ginny still needed to deal with her brother's death, but needed to do it without everyone hovering around her. During that time, Harry and Ginny got together and all three shared a bed (in a platonic way) because they all had demons to fight. They grew closer through that experience and came out stronger in the end.

- Harry's family are regular guests at Shell Cottage once Ginny let go of her grudge against Fleur.

- A lot of couples who married during or straight after the war got divorced eventually, leaving a lot of single parents and shared custody cases.

***** According to HP Lexicon's timeline, the Manor incident happened in March. If Bellatrix and Voldemort "celebrated" Dumbledore's death (June 30), then Delphi would be born between March 8 - April 5. Teddy was born between April 19 - 30. Just stuff to keep in mind if you ever write the story ;)

This is assuming, of course, that Voldemort is Delphi's father. Personally I don't think he has the right equipment to procreate, nor would he be interested in creating an heir through magic. I'd just make it a rumor and Rodolphus is her actual father.

****** I actually wrote something very similar but scrapped it because it was too dark and angsty. I'm thinking about ways to rewrite it, but the best way to make this whole thing not depressingly grim would be either Harry/Tonks or Hermione/Tonks as background, with her obviously surviving. And while I'm partial to those pairings (having written both), I also want to write something with Ginny in it.

And I'd definitely go for Voldemort as a father, simply because it makes the whole thing so much sweeter. His ideology defeated, his followers executed or imprisoned, his heir calls Harry "dad" and is a normal teenager, not some weird girl trying to create a "magical Hitler won" timeline.

******** That would fit with the idea of a poly relationship born out of the need for comfort after the war. Like, they started sleeping together to keep their demons at bay, then there were a few cases of mistaken body parts, some awkwardness before they decide to try dating. Admittedly, I originally came up with that for Harry/Hermione/Lavender, but it could certainly work for Harry/Ginny/Tonks. Certainly not a pairing you'll find often (or at all).

It could be fun to play around with non conventional family types, maybe have some kids out of a Hermione/Lavender relationship in the mix (with Harry as sperm donor). And the final moral would be something along the lines that the Potter family is unconventional, but it prevailed while many other failed.

Maybe even slightly hilarious with either everyone believing that Harry is the biological father of Delphi and Teddy and the whole Lupin involvement was just a ruse. Or everyone thinking that Tonks is not romantically involved with Harry and Ginny and all romantic clues are dismissed as "well, they are cousins" (technically, Harry is a distant uncle, but whatever) or "how generous of Harry to take such good care of a family friend. The poor thing, married to a werewolf and then widowed just as her children were born".

For H/Hr/G, Harry and Hermione are such good friends that they'd end up excluding Ginny. Hermione and Ginny are firmly platonic, though. Their only source of commonality is Harry, which isn't enough to make into a believable relationship.

If you choose to make it a triad, I'd say you have three options:

- Harry/Ginny/Tonks
- Harry/Ginny/Lavender
- Harry/Hermione/Tonks

Hermione/Lavender is far-fetched, but if you want to give Hermione a pairing, maybe Terry Boot? She doesn't really need one, though. And if she did end up with someone /not/ Harry or Ron, it would be later in life.

I can also see Ginny/Luna as a side pairing if you go with Option 3. Just make sure you don't have /all/ of the women bi/lesbian. Less than 5% of people are LGBT.

I don't really see Hermione with a Hufflepuff, either. Harry or Ron work because they've been through so much together. Otherwise she's someone who values intelligence in her partner. I /suppose/ Justin could work, but he's supposed to come from a high-end family and I don't think Hermione would dig that. I like the idea of Terry Boot because 1) he's a half-blood, so he'd be able to interact with the Muggle world and 2) in OotP, he compliments her intelligence.

I don't think Hermione and Harry would've slept together, he was too obsessed with Ginny, but I might be able to see some experimentation.

That's because she wrote them so horribly. If you disregard HBP & DH, then they still have potential. Hermione and Ron have shared a lot of experiences. However I think they would get married later in life, post-2008. Otherwise they'd have a messy divorce.

That's the difference between HG and RHr. Harry and Ginny /have/ to get married immediately or he'd realize it was just an infatuation. They wouldn't get together later on in life. However, if Ron and Hermione got married immediately, then the marriage would fall apart. But they have the potential to find each other later on.

*** If you're going to change that much of canon, then why even keep Harry and Ginny together? Or are you ignoring her HBP characterization?

I wholeheartedly believe that Andromeda disliked Remus, so I think she'd avoid talking about him in general. She wouldn't /explicitly/ tell Teddy anything, but he'd be aware of it anyway. Kids pick up on those things.

Nevertheless, I'd probably read it. I enjoy more realistic takes instead of the 'everything is perfect' idea.

Ginny went from fierce fighter and loyal friend to Quidditch playing love interest who suddenly loses the touch to reality, Hermione has so many idiot balls up her arse that you might as well call them idiot beads and Tonks went from "the only cheerful person despite Voldemort" to "moping mess" and pushover. OotP was the pinnacle of the series, the last two books are full of stupidity for the sake of drama and "forgive thy Nazis".

I keep H/G because I think Ginny has a lot of potential if you do NOT go down the Big Weasley family route. Mollys actions are unforgivable (victim blaming Sirius, telling Harry that she is worried about his home life but never informing the authorities, the whole love potion thing), so I cannot stand any story where she is sold as perfect mother figure for Harry. Even Hermione fits that job better. And to be honest, I find most of the Weasleys boring, static and pretty one dimensional characters. They all have two or three things and the only real development we see is Percy and Ginny (before HBP voids that again).

Tl;dr: I like the idea of a postwar canon, I wouldn't even use what Rowling wrote as toilet paper.

I agree with what the other poster said, make it Harry/Ginny/Tonks or Harry/Tonks and Andromeda can be the mother figure. We don't know much about her from canon, but she opened up her house to the Order, raised Tonks to be an awesome woman, and turned her back on her family, so she must be a pretty good person (with possibly questionable morals, she is a Black after all).

I actually like the idea of Scorpius' character, though. Maybe Draco gets a girl pregnant right before the end of the war and Narcissa raises Scorpius overseas. His age wasn't actually mentioned in the epilogue, so he could just be a year younger than Teddy and Delphi.

** 1. James is the only Potter to inherit black hair. With his dark hair and eyes, he reminds Harry and Ginny of Tom Riddle and they avoid looking at him (hence why we know nothing about his appearance). He's often ignored in favor of his younger brother (canon). As a result he's closer to Teddy and Andromeda, neither of whom are surprised when he's sorted into Slytherin. To give James time to adjust to the House, Teddy leaks erroneous information to the newspaper, which announces James a Gryffindor. Canon fact: none of his cousins are the same age as him.
2. Albus insists on being called Al starting in his first year. After seeing how James was treated, Al's absolutely petrified of being sorted into Slytherin, and not even Harry's assurance can assuage that fear. He's in either Gryffindor or Hufflepuff. Although he resembles Harry through his thin face and green eyes, his auburn hair is close to the fiery color typical of a Weasley. After suffering much ridicule, he changes his middle name to Rubeus. Canon fact: He's close to Rose.
3. Rose has red hair but otherwise resembles Hermione. She's in either Gryffindor or Ravenclaw.
4. Scorpius is either in Slytherin or Gryffindor. In the beginning he only tolerates Al so he can get close to Rose, but over time they become friends.
5. Lily has dark red, unruly hair and hazel eyes. Snape's portrait hates her because she looks like a combination of Harry's parents. When she's younger, she's a romantic, but by the time she reaches Hogwarts she realizes her life isn't as perfect as Harry and Ginny pretend. She's in either Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Canon fact: She's close to Hugo.
6. Hugo is in either Gryffindor or Ravenclaw.
7. Percy's daughter, Molly II, goes by Mary. She and Lucy are the brunt of many drug-related jokes. They're also twins.
8. George's son, Fred, looks very little like his namesake due to his mixed heritage. He has a lot of identity issues (more so than the Potter kids, even).
9. All three of Bill and Fleur's children have blond hair, but unlike his sisters, Louis doesn't have the Veela allure.

I use the original timeline instead of the rectified one, so in the Epilogue Teddy has just graduated (he's only lived on his own for about a month and still doesn't know how to feed himself, hence why he eats dinner with the Potters so often), James is 12, Al, Rose, and Scorpius are 11, and Lily and Hugo are 9.

*** Hmm, I've never seen James as a Slytherin. It makes sense, though, now that I think about it. Out of the three kids, he's the only one to exhibit any traits for the House. And the reminder of Tom Riddle... I can see it happening, I doubt Harry and Ginny ever got therapy and are, as you said, pretending everything is perfect even though they're still suffering from unresolved PTSD. I also never noticed the Molly/Lucy reference! Mary/Lucy is just as bad, too.

Out of curiosity, what ages do you use for all of the kids?

**** Teddy (1998), Victoire (2000), Dominique (2003), Louis (2006), Mary and Lucy (2002), Fred (2006), Roxanne (2008), Rose (2005), Hugo (2007), James (2004), Al (2005), Lily (2007), and Scorpius (2005). Luna's kids, Lorcan and Lysander, were born ~2010.

George isn't mentioned as being at the station, so I figured his kids are younger.

**** Yeah, I don't understand why people think it's all happy-happy. There's a bunch of small nuances that are kind of unsettling (Harry doesn't talk to Hermione, Ron's hexing Muggles, their negligence and belittling of James, Draco isn't in prison, /Albus Severus/, the House system is still in place...).

What really gets me is a single line from Ginny: "You are so like Ron." I don't think JKR realized what she was implying. Ron is messed up because of how his family treats him. Ginny was especially rude to him, which makes me wonder about her treatment of James. Favoring one child is all that Harry knows, too. Cycle of abuse and all that. In my mind, James is a mixture of Ron (crushing insecurities as a result of constant belittlement) and Sirius (the less favored brother who can't do anything right).

***** That's pretty much how I imagine James, too. He's jealous of Albus, who Harry and Ginny favor, and that's why he's often mean to his brother. At the same time he's protective of Albus, who doesn't appreciate the gesture for what it is and further mocks him. That's why Lily doesn't really like Albus, in fact few people do. Rose tries to put up with him but eventually realizes he's not worth the effort. Albus thinks it's a betrayal when she befriends James instead. In the end, however, he realizes it's all because of his own attitude and decides to change himself (i.e., what Snape never achieved).

** James Sirius Potter - has messy, dark reddish brown hair and glasses. Takes after Harry in appearance. James has always been a little wild. Ginny and Harry laughed off a lot of it when he was a kid and when the owls first came from Hogwarts. James was a spirited and energetic child and really he was no worse than Harry or the twins at that age. They stopped laughing as it got more serious. As a teen and young adult he and his friends were the type to throw crazy parties with heavy drinking and drugs. He started getting into more trouble with the ministry and risking exposure of the magical world with stupid stunts. After being seriously injured and losing his girlfriend in an accident, James straightens out in his mid 20s. James was a Gryffindor and played as a beater in Quidditch. Born November 2004 so while he's almost two years older then Al, he's only in the year ahead of him at Hogwarts. He's good friends with Fred Weasley, Leah Hart-Finnigan and Owen Wood. James runs the Hogsmeade branch of Weasley Wizard Wheezes.

Albus Severus Potter - Al pretty much looks like a clone of Harry. Sorted into Slytherin. He plays seeker on his house team and then later professionally. Al can be a bit cheeky. He mostly keeps to his small group of friends. I have the least Al headcanons.

Lily Luna Potter - Lily favours Ginny in appearance, she's a ginger with freckles and hazel eyes. Lily is the youngest of the Weasley cousins and hates being left out because of it. She's very much a tomboy and loves flying. Lily can be cheeky and reckless. She does have a little bit of a manipulative streak - honed by years of being the baby of the family and the girl. She's sorted into Gryffindor, although had the choice between Gryffindor and Slytherin and plays keeper on the house Quidditch team. good friends with Hugo and Colin Longbottom.

Rose Weasley - Rose has very tight curly red hair and takes after Hermione in appearance. Rose is very much a type A personality. She has excellent grades, plays Quidditch, was made a prefect and in a member of various clubs and societies at Hogwarts. She often stresses herself out with a need to be perfect. Rose was a Ravenclaw in school. Her best friend is Brianna Macmillan. She relaxes more once she finishes school and begins working for the Ministry in the Dept of Magical Games and Sports.

Hugo Weasley - Hugo takes after Ron in appearance. He's tall, has curly red hair and is very freckled. He's a type B personality to Rose's Type A. Hugo is more laid back. He still does well in school, but doesn't put much effort in. Hugo is incredibly intelligent and is that “bored genius” child in class. Neville came up with a plan to have him do some advanced projects to keep him challenged and out of mischief. He also made him prefect to push Hugo into taking on more responsibilities. Hugo is interested in muggle technology and likes Wizarding rock bands. He's a Gryffindor. Hugo was born sometime in April 2008 and is close friends with his cousin, Lily, who is three weeks younger than him and Colin Longbottom.

Colin Longbottom - the eldest of Neville and Hannah's children. He was born in October 2007 putting him in the same year as lily and Hugo. Gryffindor. Colin has curly blonde hair and blue eyes and favours his mothers side in appearance. He is often the voice of reason in the Colin-Lily-Hugo trio and keeps the group out of too much trouble. Colins the type to over analyze every social interaction and thinks he's lame, however he's fairly well liked among his peers. He has a huge crush on Lily. Interested in Herbology and care of magical creatures.

*** As I was reading this (which is all great, btw), I was thinking to myself, "Oh, is Colin Longbottom canon? I always assumed the author of 'How to Charm a Witch' made up the character of Colin Longbottom." Then I looked at your username and realized, oh, you ARE the author of How to Charm a Witch, lmao! I loved your story, your headcanon has become my headcanon because of your story.

** 1.  James Sirius, while a fun-loving prankster, isn't a carbon copy of his namesake(s). May or may not be less than straight and have a crush/in love with Teddy. And even if that's not the case, he still shares a special closeness with each other.

2.  Albus Severus Potter goes by Al or some other nickname, and doesn't like his full name being mentioned because while he has great respect for his namesakes, talk about big shoes to fill on top of being Harry Potter's son already. Gets sorted into neither Gryffindor /nor/ Slytherin. He's also the only 100% straight one out of his siblings.

3.  Lily Luna Potter can be said to be the only one of her siblings to really resemble her namesakes. Both of them.

4.  Scorpius Malfoy ends up in Hufflepuff. Draco is completely okay with it (after he got over the initial shock).

5.  Dudley ends up with magical children and is actually a great parent to them. He and Harry, while never bosom friends, do mend bridges later and keep in contact.

6.  George may have pursued Angelina, Fred's ex, in his grief, but either she sets him straight right away or they break up not long afterwards, as both came to their senses and realize what they have isn't healthy at all.

7.  Charlie is asexual, and that's why he never married or had children.

8.  Once you get to know Rose, you start to realize she's a lot more like Ron than she would seem from the outset, and perhaps more like Ron than Hermione deep down.

9.  Luna and Neville never dated, thank you very much, no matter what the rumor mill might say.

10. One of Percy's daughters end up being the most mischievous out of all of the next-gen Weasleys (or Potters), to everybody's surprise and George's infinite glee. Percy is secretly pleased, but good luck trying to get him to admit that.
