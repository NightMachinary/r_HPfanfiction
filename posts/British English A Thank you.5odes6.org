I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the thread on this topic, especially for the way strong opinions were expressed and no one threw their toys out the pram.


** I enjoyed it too, and would love to help with the guide [[/u/SouthernVices]] suggested.

In the meantime, I'm happy to Brit pick any work. :)

**** Me three. Always happy to Britpick - do it enough for my English students, at least fanfiction is more entertaining than why Othello is a flawed hero for the thirtieth time...

** Except for all the downvotes being thrown around. Downvotes are for irrelevance, people, not disagreement.

Not that saying this will change anything, though.

Cheers, OP.

** True. I did expect a bunch of downvotes and angry comments when I posted the thread, so it was surprising how good the discussion and the back and forth between everyone was.

You did good [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]. Have a cake.

** I was surprised too, I was expecting a bunch of butthurt yanks complaining about "language policing" and other such tripe. Glad to see the community here is rather mature!
