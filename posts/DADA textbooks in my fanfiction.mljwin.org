So, I have a fanfiction (which is for some time in my notes) where Harry becomes a teacher at Hogwarts in 1942 after he gets send into the past after an accident in the time chamber during the Order of the Phoenix (essentially, a spell hits Harry and throws him into a display case with time turners and time “shatters” around him. Which resulted in his “unnatural” existence and abilities, getting thrown into the past, becoming an unspeakable... But anyway...

Because Harry will be a teacher and there isn't much known about the textbooks in 1940s, I decided to create my own. And I want to know if the names make sense (they are quite straightforward- some less...) or if I should change them. Also, all the authors are original characters and don't appear in HP universe (some last names are from the canon though).

Harry takes his duty as a teacher quite seriously but the textbooks he put into the requirements aren't really “required”. Some of them are only, useful and practical, recommendations.

List of textbooks:

FIRST YEAR:

• Understanding of the basic principle of counter and defensive spells by Silvain Avery (published in 1934)

• Magical creatures: Identification and other insight by Juliana Morigalt (published in 1940)

SECOND YEAR:

• Deeper clarification of defensive magic by Silvain Avery (published in 1939)

THIRD YEAR:

• Magical creatures: Identification and other insight by Juliana Morigalt (published in 1940)

• Introduction to immobilization spells and binding magic by Allen Withers (published in 1922)

FOURTH YEAR:

• Parallels between Offense and Defense by Antonus Mikhail Valentinovich (published in 1929)

• Rules and principles of dueling by Nemain Drachia (published in 1925)

FIFTH YEAR:

• Effectivity of area awareness and spells by Oliver Tremblay (published in 1933)

SIXTH YEAR:

• Dark arts: Effects on wizard's body and psyche by Ludmilla Deverill (published in 1934)

• Dilemma of the Unforgivable by Ephraim (published in 1893, updated version in 1941)

• Foundations of nonverbal spells by Lucretius Galamain (published in 1929)

SEVENTH YEAR:

• Theory of the constant counter by Francesca Lestrange (published in 1917)

• Obscure branches of magic by Ephraim (published in 1876, updated version in 1930)

To be honest, it took me longer than I want to admit. Making up names for magical books is quite a difficult work lol.


** The names seem sound, whimsy and wizardry, so that's good. But I see you wrote down Juliana Morigalt's book for both 1st and 3rd years. Also, in the books, Harry is required to buy /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ by Newton Scamander in first year most likely for his DADA class (I checked and Newt was commissioned for the book in 1918, so it fits). Harry could either use this book instead of Morigalt's or he could use Scamander's book for first-years (since it would be more about identifying and advice on how to avoid and not anger creatures) while he uses Morigalt's book for third-years (which I assume would have more of a defensive aspect to it).

Another thing, /The Standard Book of Spells/ by Miranda Goshawk would be, in my opinion, a more appropriate repertoire of spells for first and second-years since they wouldn't have much experience with magic (basing myself on the books, which, admittedly, we don't see much about what they learn). The way I see it, first-year DADA would be learning a few spells and learn how to defend yourself with them (and some others they would have learnt in Charms) but the central objective for the first-years would be more fleeing and quick incapacity (say of a Muggle or mundane animal) so as to flee and then the curriculum for the later years adds on that and expends on other areas (such as creatures or curses and dark spells).

Sorry for the long rant, especially if this is unwanted advice. Still, I hope this helps.

*** I will definitely swap Morigalt's to Scamander's in the first year, thx. Honestly, I forgot about that book or assumed it was published later and didn't bother to check at all xD

I looked into Miranda after you mentioned her but I don't think it really fits into my time period. She was born in 1921 (according to fandom, but who cares). And if she graduated from Hogwarts somewhere around 1939 then I don't think the book would be published almost immediately after that. Yeah, it could, but the chances are quite low.

** I disagree with the other commenter. These names do sound like textbook names, but I don't think they're whimsical enough for the magical world.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Shopping_List][Here]] is the best list I can find for canon textbooks. Most of them have either an alliterative or otherwise whimsical name (/Spellman's Syllabary/, /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/, /Unfogging the Future/, all of Lockhart's books, etc), an author whose name is a pun or otherwise relates to the subject (Newt Scamander, Emeric Switch, Phyllida Spore, etc), or something whimsical about the books themselves (/The Monster Book of Monsters/, /The Invisible Book of Invisibility/). There are a few books that don't fall into any of those categories, so it's fine to have some like that, but I feel like all of your books are lacking in whimsy.

I suppose you could intentionally use the lack of whimsy to show that Harry is 100% serious business, but it still doesn't really fit the setting.

Also, do you really intend to list out every one of these books in the story? I can understand a few of them coming up occasionally, but if you're planning to list them all out at some point, that seems like entirely unnecessary detail. But if you're just using this as a reference material in case you need Harry to mention a specific book at some point, that's fine.

*** The main point of those textbooks, as you already said, is a reference to what will Harry be teaching in different years (like the basic outline). I only decided to write ones for every year if I ever had a chapter with that particular year.

Originally, I needed only fourth and fifth year at the time but then I realized that if a similar problem comes up with a different Harry's class then I will need to come up with something again. So I just wrote it all down together. When I was creating the names I mainly stuck up with DADA books which already exist (completely ignoring the ones from Lockhart). Apart from the Confronting the Faceless they all sound pretty much similar to my ones (at least for me they sound similar). But yeah, I will keep your advise in mind - like making an author's name the pun, I like that idea.
