  YouTube mom Machelle Hobson, who was accused of 30 counts of kidnapping and child abuse, died Tuesday morning in Scottsdale, Arizona, Maricopa police spokesman Ricardo Alvarado said. Alvarado was unable to say how she died. Hobson ran the "Fantastic Adventures" YouTube channel, which racked up more than 250 million views and featured her seven adopted children. With titles like "The FLOOR IS LAVA!" and "Escape The Babysitter!" each of the episodes featured the children in lightsaber battles, turning into superheroes or attempting to steal cookies.

  But a March welfare check found the home was a den of abuse. Hobson would withhold food and water from the children for days, pepper-spray them, force them to take ice baths and lock them in a barren closet, according to a statement of probable cause. In the same month, Hobson pleaded not guilty to the charges against her, CNN has reached out to the Pinal County Attorney's Office for more information. CNN's Eric Levenson and Mel Alonso contributed to this report.

"Withold food and water for days. Lock in a closet."

These are things that happened to Harry in canon, or at least in the fanon fics that just take it to a tweaked, more realistic interpretation. So yes, here you go, stop saying the Dursleys are cartoons or their actions are cartoonish and nobody would ever do them. It's just trying to dismiss or pretend like people like this don't exist in the world. Maybe because you think it is too horrible and you cannot cope with the thought, but that is your issue not everyone else's. Denying that this happens is incorrect, and you are incorrect for it. Yes thank you.


** Are people saying the abuse is cartoonish, or the Dursleys are cartoonish? Comically fat, walrus-mustached, incoherently angry man obsessed with being normal, who's married to a rail-thin, horse-faced gossip who's snippy and snooty and judgmental of others despite her own family's many shortcomings, and their enormous, portly bully son? Each of them absolutely convinced that they're the definition of normal, and that people who collect for causes are abnormal troublemakers?

That actually does sound like a cartoon, doesn't it? Like a one-episode antagonist family for the Simpsons who show up for the occasional gag. I can already see Homer bonding with Vernon until he does something too over the top, while Petunia snipes at Lisa and Nelson and Dudley bond over bullying Milhouse and Bart.

*** Yes, but Rowling is writing for children here (the books got more mature as the audience aged) so she is exaggerating the Dursleys (kids aren't good with subtlety).

The abuse itself was never written like that! So yeah, the Dursleys were really abusive pieces of shit who should all rot in Dementor town for a few decades (except Duddley, who should be sent to a military academy IMHO to drill him till he isn't an abusive tub of lard anymore!)

** Some fics do crack up the abuse to cartoonish levels, but people who dismiss the Dursleys' canon abuse as unrealistic or try to gloss over it are in denial about real life. And also proving the Dursleys' point, because people wouldn't doubt that some poor addicts are abusing their kids. But "normal" middle-class class family in a good neighbourhood? No way!

Also there's this popular idea that it's only realistic when abuse victims are depicted as "broken", and it's pretty offensive.

***** I'll give some basic behavioural cues I'd look for, but I'll stress that I'm relatively amateur.

Cupboard stuff - would generally trigger a lot of kids with claustrophobia and dislike of small spaces (this is when it's used as punishment or as a place you're forced to go when you have high emotions.

Food- as another user mentioned you'd expect him to hoard or steal food if there's a child that's had lack of food when those around him have had excess

Physical - it's unclear to a large extent what degree Harry has been physically abused but you generally see one of two behaviours depending on the severity. Kids are generally overly skiddish around adults when they've been abused and body posture is always defensive. Once they trust you though it's like having a leech attached to you. They've been so starved of attention and positive touch that literally just want to be hugged or held constantly.

Attention - kids who've been largely ignored tend to be attention seeking, loud and obnoxious. No one likes being ignored and they don't know how to get attention in a positive way so they generally garner negative attention because it's easier. Draco actually probably exhibits this behaviour most. In Harry, I would assume he would lean into the fame massively because he's attention starved and ‘love being loved' and important. Even if it was shallow. Later in life this could turn into objectification of women because the thing he may crave most is positive female attention which he lacked from a young age. But that stage is more conjecture and based on surroundings, culture, and personality.

Boundary testing - when children are abused by angry parental figures about arbitrary behaviours they become overly cautious and tend not act out around them much. Depending on the severity they almost become catatonic where they don't respond to anything for fear of punishment. When they are coming out of this with adult figures they trust they tend to ‘act out' and push boundaries in what seems like ridiculous ways in comparison to their usual behaviours. It is also to test if the adults ‘really love them' or are just hiding their own true feelings about the child.

Relationships - this is an interesting one as it varies widely. There were a couple different behaviours that I saw from the kids I worked with. The most severely abused ones often only befriended children younger and smaller than them as a method of control. They felt safe because they were the senior in the relationship and could protect themselves if need be. This was particularly worrying in children who'd been sexually abused because these ‘friendships' often turned more sinister even at young ages.

Other, less abused children often struggled to express themselves healthily when conflict arises. I one time saw a child stab his best friend with pen over a small argument because conflict resolution in his family had always been violent. They struggle to adjust to normal behaviours like talking. On the other side when someone may try to talk to them about conflict they just lock up and stop talking because they don't know how to express what they're feeling. No ones ever listened .

That's just some of the more overt stuff, but there's loads more subtle stuff that other experts could tell you about.

Edit: to put it even more simply. Look at Tom Riddle's behaviour. That's more normal for someone with their background.

****** Not necessarily. Those are just stereotypes - if every abused child acted like Tom Riddle we wouldn't have kids slipping under the radar at the rate we do. Any safeguarding training will tell you that you might never see a sign. It also doesn't correlate that neatly onto each type of abuse - neglected children often 'act out' too.

Nor does it directly correlate on the most or least abused children. However, when you are looking at the most extreme abuse, even then, you find children who are explosive and children who struggle to attach.

More generically, becoming withdrawn, quiet, tendency to run away, perfectionism, mental health difficulties.

Likewise, the VAST majority of children who are sexually abused don't go on to abuse anyone else.

Tom Riddle's behaviour isn't normal, even for abused children though negative life experiences can cause propensity. This sort of outlook causes people to unwittingly discriminate against abused people who are first and foremost victims.

I do think Harry could have had more obvious signs, though. Really, what you would be expecting would be his 5th year behaviour.

Although it is a children's book, we do actually see some evidence:

- Even at 11, Harry has frequent nightmares. He remarks on them being different to usual re: Voldemort happenings.

- Harry runs away with a stranger he doesn't know and then runs away again in the 3rd book.

- Harry doesn't go to adults for help unless forced.

- Harry doesn't seek comfort from other adults - he has at best a loose relationship with Lupin, turns down open door offers from his head of house.

- The exception to the points above are Hagrid and Sirius, both of whom he feels responsible for helping and keeping safe (the dragon, Buckbeak, Grawp) and Sirius from getting caught.

- Harry functions best in crisis fight/flight/freeze because he is constantly running on it. (Some go the other way and have panic or dissociative issues).

- Harry is known to horde sweet treats in his trunk for when he goes hungry.

- Harry immediately agrees to live with a recently escaped convict, despite Sirius seeming unstable to Ron and Hermione.

- Harry shows little value for his own life over that of others.

- Harry doesn't really connect well with most people outside a couple of friends.

- Harry reacts poorly when he feels adults make decisions for him, as he is used to making his own decisions.

- Harry asks Dumbledore not to go back, but does not expand on why nor does he talk about the bars or cupboard with the Weasleys or even his friends.

- He's got a bit of a temper, despite pretty much everything being toned down.

In Cursed Child, I would say it is more obvious that he has ongoing Dursley nightmares and also struggles to connect with his kids. It is evident he never managed to switch off and settle into a peaceful life.

Children's books that do cover this sort of thing more are 'Max Kowalski Didn't Mean It' (Susie Day) and The Star Outside My Window (Onjali Rauf). None of the children in the books are like Tom Riddle.

** The abuse itself is not cartoonish, of course. However, in the context of the first (or the early) books, it's also not written to be taken literally/seriously. It's using some of the tropes from children's books - just like how all the tasks in the first book are easy enough for the kids to figure out, and all the adults are incompetent.

I don't think it's a good thing, and looking back I'd prefer it if the abuse had been painted as much less in scale than it was - but it appears to me to have (at least originally) not been meant to be taken seriously. Of /course/ his 'step-parent' equivalent has to be evil/mean, that's just how it goes in those stories before he finds out he's actually someone rich, famous, and important! It's the same as a million fairy tales and other children books.

The big issue is that, like for a lot of the plot holes and incongruities in the early books, the series got more serious/mature in the later books. And at that point, the abuse that's portrayed as more cartoonish in the earlier books can't come across in the same way when it's being played straight.

*** I believe you're right. If you compare it to a book like Mathilda, you can see a parallel of the abuse being so over the top that the child reading it doesn't necessarily take it seriously. But Mathilda stays pretty over the top and we don't have to consider what lasting consequences her parents' treatment would have on her as she grows older. This is not the case with the Harry Potter series.

** Meh. Depends on how it is written. In cannon the Dursleys are definitely abusive- there is no doubt about that. But it can be done very badly in fics. Just yesterday I followed a recommendation from here about a mute female Harry. The reason she was mute? Vernon cut out her voice box with a pair of scissors. Just read that again. How does someone in a sales department even know where to find the voice box, let alone perform a surgery to remove it without killing the victim? Presumably while in a fit of rage or under the influence. It could have been written as Vernon hitting Harry and Harry hitting his head on the floor and losing his voice or something. Or even as Vernon cutting of his tongue. But noo, let's have the evil uncle perform amateur surgery with a pair of scissors without nicking an artery or other organs, infecting Harry with unsanitized instruments or leaving him to bleed to death. Another one I remember had Vernon straight-up owning whips, chains and other medieval torture devices and torturing poor Harry so much that a grown-ass man would have died several times over. It was both disgusting and funny at the same time. Shit like this is why Dursley abuse can sometimes be cartoonish. Vernon having fits of rage or being drunk and beating Harry with his hands or belt is plausible and can be written well. Vernon being a surgeon on the side or owning torture devices is cartoonish.

​

Just not to be completely negative, here's a good example. (By "good" I mean well- written and not cartoonish.)

*** Interesting thing about all of those stories? they are old as hell and abuse was much more common and socially acceptable back then. What happens in them is not some trope, it was just life.

Hell blatant infanticide was not at all uncommon until ~100-150 years ago and still happens an appalling amount today.

For abuse in general i was beat with a belt once in the 1980s in a family considered old fashioned and not really acceptable in its behavior (which i found out in school, good times that).

Both of my parents were beat much worse when they were children. My grandfather beat my mother with his fists many times and kicked her down the stairs once leading to a doctors visit and broken collar bone. She was hit countless times with a belt or switch to say nothing at all of spankings with a hand. She was born in 1949 in newyork and her parents were from the same general region born in 1919/1920.

Dad was from oklahoma born in 1946 and his family was what is called dirt floor poor. He was whipped once (the scars were still visible 50 years later and beaten with all the "normal" things.

So talking about abuse in huck finn, matilda, and oliver twist isnt a literature trope, it was a fact of life that was very common. Cinderella and snow white have origins much further back so it just depends on the version you use as to what was common then.

**** I'd say it is a trope so far as its a very simple way to make us feel sympathy for a character without much effort on the author's behalf. People cheer for underdogs. People want to believe in Cinderella, not the Brothers Grimm version though, because the idea a hard done by person can rise above it all and become special appeals to most of us. That doesn't mean its not real, it doesn't mean it wasn't more common but I would call it a trope in that its a device for quickly establishing characterisation. Calling it a trope might be a bit extreme but I don't think unfair.

Edit: There are plenty of modern examples too. Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars was literally a slave, that's not on his parent/carer but it is an abused child. Percy Jackson, one of the biggest book series to have come out since HP, the title character has a less than pleasant step-father who beats Percy's mother and Matilda, the Roald Dahl book features neglectful parents as just a few examples of mistreated kids in mordern(ish) media.

** I wanted to touch on something implicit in what some of what the other's said, in that a lot of fanfic treats the (first three) books as if they are your standard fantasy novels and not children's literature*, which is actually how we end up with so much fanon.

Take the first book where Hagrid gets sent to give Harry his letter. It makes perfect sense in a children's novel, that the first contact our MC has with the magical world is a lovable goofy giant. In a fantasy novel, though? It smacks of either incompetence or evil plots. The same goes for the defenses for the Philosopher's Stone. They are so flimsy a first year student can get through them. What does it mean? That must mean it was a plot by a Manipulative Dumbledore to get Harry to fight Quirrelmort, of course!

Its this kind of context that we need to keep in mind when we are talking about the Dursleys and their abuse of Harry. The level of abuse that the Dursleys enact is a function of them being in a kid's book, and not because they are actually that despicable.

In the same way that a lot of fics ignore the plot holes and inconsistencies, we can add the abuse on top of it. We can take the emotional truth (that Harry had a family that despised having to raise him and he suffered for that) without the literal truth of what they Dursleys did in canon.

I think it is the juxtaposition of the horrific emotional and physical abuse Harry endures (which unfortunately happens all the time in real life with devastating effects) with the complete lack of physical/psychological/legal consequences in canon that makes the Dursleys' actions seem “cartoonish” and unrealistic within the context of the Harry Potter books.

When Wile E Coyote is injured by something that Road Runner does, no one says "oh, it's cartoonish, you won't really be injured if you fall off a cliff in real life" or whatever. We all know you can fall of cliffs in real life and it has very serious consequences. People die from falling off cliffs all the time, and those are immense tragedies for them and their families. But the situation is cartoonish because it is exaggerated and played for laughs.

** I think what people mean with cartoonish is how it is framed (often with a slight of humor) in the books and how other characters react to it. That and how open they were with it. it was so obvious for people so concerned about what people think. Harry didn't have a room, even for alibi. He has ill taken care of, with his clothes and the broken glasses, they didn't bother to replace, while shower Dudley with expensive presents. They didn't make sense in their motivation.

and additional, it is in such a stark contrast to how you feel people should react and that means one of those things has to be but perspective. either all the other characters actions or the Dursley's behavior.
