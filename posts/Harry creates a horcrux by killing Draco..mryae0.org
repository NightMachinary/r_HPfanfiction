:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think this was after his escape from Malfoy Manor. So he kills draco and creates a horcrux using the golden snitch. And at one point uses the resurrection stone to get Sirius and regulas to possess people and help him get into the black townhouse. Another thing I remember about the fic was the somewhat detailed process of horcrux creation, which included self cannibalism, where Harry eats part of his liver(eww). Lastly he digs up Moody's artificial eye and fixes it in the snitch so that it can see too. The snitch horcrux can communicate by lines appearing on it, like in the movie. Please does anyone know what this fic was called? Thanks.

  Ron and Hermione died due to the events at Malfoy Manor and Harry was on track to join them. Alone and beaten, Harry resorts to the most horrendous magic to try and save his own life and continue the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxi. An act that would start him on the path to becoming a monster so much greater and more terrible than the one he had set out to destroy.

I searched for 'snitch horcrux' here on Reddit and found two other search-posts about it.

There is one 8 months back: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i1k2ts/harry_creates_a_horcrux_out_of_the_golden_snitch/]]

Earlier one 2 years ago (with the answer): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ayk4d9/fic_search_a_fic_that_i_mistook_for_the_final/]]

*** This is not it. The story was more recent. Probably between 2016-2018. I'll try to post more details as I remember, but this is definitely not it. Thanks though.!!

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
