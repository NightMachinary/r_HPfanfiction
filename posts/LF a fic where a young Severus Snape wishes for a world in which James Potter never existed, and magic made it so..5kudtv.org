It could start out when he is escaping the shrieking shack with werewolf moony after him. He sees James running toward the womping willow to save him, but in his mind he think James wants to kill him off. They fight and James knocks his wand away. In that moment thinking of all the years of torment and the hate and humiliation his one focus is wishing James never existed. He wakes up to a Hogwarts where there are no mauraders where Sirius is in Slytherin and claiming to be Severus' best friend. That idea just popped into my head the other day, and I didn't know if it has been written or not.

** Oh my god, what if instead of James Potter disappearing, it's a re-imagining of "It's a Wonderful Life"?

Severus hates his childhood and adulthood and feels like his life is worthless and nobody cares about him (except Dumbledore cares what he can get out of Snape), so he wishes he'd never been born.

Insert him seeing how Harry's life, the war, Lily, etc. would have gone without him.

*** So... he'd see a world where Harry, James and Lily, and probably some extra siblings live happy lives? That would be interesting.

**** *Live potentially happy lives.

There is nothing that indicates that Voldemort actually loses the first war. I would go as far as to say that Voldemort knowing the prophecy actually led to his downfall. Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't excuse was Snape did and they could still have had happy lives if they fled England.

***** How about a multiple-turning-point version? First Snape is shown a reality where he never heard the prophecy, so Voldemort just plain wins. He objects that someone else could have overheard it, so there's a second take where Generic Deatheater tells Voldemort but doesn't ask to spare Lily, so Harry never gets her blood protection. And continue down the timeline: Quirrelmort successfully kills or maims Harry in his first year because Snape doesn't cast the countercurse on his broom, for instance.

****** This is exactly what I was thinking. Without Snape, even if Harry was born and survived the Avada Kedavra, the war wouldn't have gone well against Voldemort. Quirrel would kill Harry first year. Or the Order wouldn't have gone to Harry and the DA's rescue in the Dept. of Mysteries without Snape's floo call. Or Draco would have killed Dumbledore and effed everything up. Harry wouldn't get the Sword of Gryffindore, etc.

So initially in Snape's journey, he's like "See? I told you everybody would be better off without me!" When he sees how happy James and Lily are together so much earlier in their time at Hogwarts...until he sees the real ramifications.

** Based on both personalities I don't see Snape ever be friend with Sirius.

** linkffn(the world as we knew it) has harry, severus, and a third wishing for the prophecy to have never happened and magic goes and makes it happen. However, thats the only similarity it has with your idea.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
