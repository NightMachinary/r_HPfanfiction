Not angsty (please I'm sad enough already)

Fic where our two main couples move into Grimmauld place after the war


** Not all of them meet the third point, but for the first two try FloreatCastellum, little0bird, HalfaSlug, and Northumbrian.

There are a lot of these types of fics in SIYE's Post-DH section. Not all are great, but the archive is generally higher quality than FFN or AO3.
