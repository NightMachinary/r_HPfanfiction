Hey all, I know that [[/u/ThePianoProdigy][u/ThePianoProdigy]] is running this project. I was actually wondering how many people are actually listening to it. You see, Over two years ago I talked to my wife about doing this, but decided not to due to time constraints. Now, with my new job I dont have an hour and thirty minute commute, so this is back on the table. I do have a good reading voice with a mind for pacing as my wife has told me and an understanding on audio editing from splicing multiple sound channels together.

So the following questions I would love some feedback upon:

1. Who would listen?

2. What kind of delivery system do you want for them. (stream, download, etc.)

3. Do you want deadpan reading, complete audiobook style, or would you like more personality in it (no promises on voices, I'm no Stephen Fry)

4. Story reccomendations?

Thanks All

EDIT: No insult was meant to be directed towards anyone by this post. I have not heard [[/u/ThePianoProdigy][u/ThePianoProdigy]] 's work. I am just gauging interest in another project.

Did... did you insult ThePanoProdigy? It came off as so.

*** Hmmm...I haven't even heard his audio stuff, so if I have insulted anyone than I apologize. I was trying to refer to comments made to me when I have read aloud, and referring to my experience editing multiple sound channels together for a DnD session I did with friends and spliced together for a podcast for us to share. I will edit the main post to try and clear that up

**** Ahhh, the two things I mentioned above are things ThePianoProdigy probably should learn, so that's why it seemed so.

**** Don't worry, I'm not offended, and yes, those are things I probably should learn. I tried to incorporate voices throughout my work but I found that editing the individual lines in was incredibly time consuming, so I'm just going to read it myself, with the dialogue in my original voice, which I'm aware can sometimes steal from the immersion factor, due to my American accent.

Yes, I am working on learning audio editing, the pacing (by "pacing" I assume you're talking about the incredibly long pauses) was completely my fault, and I apologize for that.

I wish you the best of luck in your project, Laika.

***** I honestly have not listened to your work yet. I definitely know how long it can take to edit multiple channels together. When I was working on a podcast it would take me hours to edit out the empty sounds, or removing people talking over each other...or removing language I didn't want in it. It could take me up to 8 hours to edit only 1-1.5 hours of recording. What audio editing software are you using and what mic are you using?

****** I'm using a Yeti microphone and the audio editing software I'm using is Audacity. What fics are you thinking of doing?
