I'm almost scared to ask, what's the darkest fics you've read? Most violent or scariest or insane?

Which fic and why was it so dark?

Bonus points if its dark and revolves around Snape, Hermione, Harry, my favorite characters.


** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853), is very dark: he murdered his way through Hogwarts, incited many deadly fights, corrupted all the good guys, and exterminated most Muggles in the end, without anyone realizing that he was the culprit.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Mudbloods at hogwarts. Not sure how to link it here cause it's on adultfanfiction.com but it is fucked. Basically after voldy was defeated in 81 there was this big compromise between the pure bloods and everyone else and now muggles borns have no real rights and every year 2 first years are chose to be 'Receptacles' which basically makes them fuck toys for the whole school. The writer,who admits he didnt like writing it but was challenged or something, keeps finding worse and worse "fetishes" to subject hermione and a recently feminized harry to.
