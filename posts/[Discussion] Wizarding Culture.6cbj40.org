Something I have noticed in my time as a reader is that there are many authors who don't really mesh well with the culture of the Wizarding World, saying that they are behind the times, need to modernize, even integrate with modern society and use all kinds of technologyâ€‹ like phones, internet, automation etc.

I feel this is fundamentally wrong, and those authors don't have the right perspective.

So, first let's assume that the Wizarding World did not undergo the Dark Ages. This is headcanon for me, so just bear that in mind.

There are three main factors which make the Wizarding World look archaic. Their isolationism, their population statistics, and their culture creation.

First of all, their isolationism keeps cultural influence fairly low. While Muggleborns may contribute some influence, it isn't some massive driving force.

Secondly, think about the population. The population lives much longer than muggles, averaging about 120-150, with instances of much longer lived individuals. That, combined with the small population means that typically you will have older individuals, tending to be more conservative, and with less new ideas to pop up.

Thirdly, think about how their culture is made. They do not have a large population, so any books and media created would be fairly low, maybe a couple hundred a year at most. They also would not have experienced the Dark Ages, so any books they do make would also be competing with books from the last couple centuries, meaning that their ideas and cultural progression would be much slower. Imagine our own society if half our population was regularly reading Victorian era literature. It would certainly skew societal values.

Now, to address those authors who support integration, and talk about dragging the Wizarding World kicking and screaming into the modern era and making them work for our society. You know who you are.

First of all, given the extremely small population, and unique cultural quirks, fully integrating the Wizarding World would essentially destroy their culture. Let's assume that destroying the culture of minorities is bad. Because historically speaking, it usually is.

Now, what makes any of you think that modern society would be good and at all useful for wizards. Many modern societies would restrict their magic, likening it to guns, when in reality, it is much more like electricity and petroleum products in terms of usefulness. There is nothing that Muggles have that wizards would want. Transportation is useless for a society which can teleport. Wizards have instantaneous communication with the protean charm and charmed mirrors, so cell phones are useless. Computing could be maybe useful, but since computers don't actually work around magic, it is a moot point. The internet is pretty much useless as well. They can communicate instantly in the first place, and there simply aren't enough wizards to put in the time to make the internet infrastructure and actually make content for it. Automation is wholly useless, because it is a small population which can make most items with a wave of their wand. And while some financial concepts might have use, stuff like the stock market just wouldn't work that well in a small population (probably, I am not great at finance).

The bottom line is that for most of Wizarding history, they have enjoyed a better quality of life as a (sort of) post scarcity society, with consistently high amounts of literacy. They didn't get affected by the Dark Ages, nor were they overly influenced by the Renaissance. They don't have the population that has allowed technology and culture explosions, nor do they particularly need it. I also wouldn't be surprised if for the majority of the time, Wizards have been better at science than Muggles up until the last couple decades. How much can you learn if you can engorgio chemicals until the atoms are visible to the naked eye? Or biology? I doubt magic could learn all that much of quantum mechanics, but I could definitely see general relativity, especially considering their ability to time travel and teleport.

So those are just my thoughts. Feel free to give your insights. Don't hestitate to correct me if I am factually wrong.


** the thing about technology is even worse considering that the story takes place in the 90s and except television there were no technological devices available to the average person that the wizarding world didn't have a substitute for. And wizards are obviously able to recognize if a device is useful and necessary to integrate into society as we see with the ministry having access to cars and the daily prophet mentioning them without explaining what a car is. the knights bus is also showing how they can not only adopt new technology but also adapt it to become vastly superior to its original version

** I always feel the need to point out the implementation of the statue of Secrecy in threads like this. Before it wizards and witches likely lived amongst muggles but enjoying a better quality of life. When, at the beginning of the 1700s they diverged then that was before most of the major developments that make up everyday life today. When they separated they had solved problems for thousands of years that muggles were still struggling with. The quality of life must have been beyond compare, is it any wonder really if they looked down on muggles and anything to do with them?

*** I mean, compared to the 1990s wizarding Britain was not far behind.

- no television as far as we know, true.
- however, radio is available
- video-telephony is there (floo)
- instantaneous travel
- big, international events are organized
- charms that automate a lot of stuff (See MACUSA scenes in the FB movies)

The internet was only just getting popular back then, and it is the hardest to replace with magic, although not impossible probably. Before the internet, I'd say wizards were ahead.

** So, your argument is essentially "Wizards are fine, leave them alone." I would be inclined to agree, if you will admit that first world countries should immediately cease all foreign aide to the developing world. This includes medical supplies, education, food, and infrastructure. They can continue to extract resources from developing nations of course, they just have to use their impressive armies and media skills from letting most of the populations of those developing countries know that they are being exploited. Oh, and rich people all have a right to their enormous wealth, even if they inherited it or got it through a windfall. They should never use their time or money to help those less fortunate. Instead, they should work to create a Utopian society just for rich people, keeping all those who are not as lucky as they are out in the cold.

See how stupid and selfish that sounds? The wizarding world is literally holding the cure to dozens of life threatening illnesses in their hands. They have the ability to end reliance on fossil fuels, reverse climate change, and create sustainable food sources. They even have the power necessary to help humanity advance beyond our own world and into the rest of the galaxy. They have a moral imperative to share their gifts with the rest of the world instead of staying in their ivory towers and looking down their noses at the rest of humanity.

Sure, destroying a people's culture is a sad thing, but what about say, the culture of Russia in the 17th century? Slavery, progroms, genocide, those were all parts of the Rus' civilization. And yet most people would agree that Peter the Great and Catherine the Great and their reforms were a GOOD thing, despite massively overhauling the culture of their country to get ride of many of its old culture aspects because they were outdated and wrong. The wizarding world is massively prejudiced against those of non-human or non-magical blood. Look at their treatment of centaurs, house elves, and in some cases muggleborns. They have restricted centaurs to reservations, enslaved house elves, and there were literal pogroms against muggleborns. This is a culture that needs MASSIVE reform. It is not "fine as it is."

I would even disagree that wizards have little to gain from integrating with muggle culture. They have everything to gain. With muggles on board, you don't need to devote wizards to mindless bureaucracy. They can get out and do far more productive things that earn them more wealth or even just have more free time. The wizarding world also lacks automation, and while in the case of a lot of magical products this may be impossible, for things like the building of houses, growing of food, and manufacture of common items they could outsource all of this to the muggles and get a huge return on their investment. Even from a purely selfish standpoint, do you really think there would be any poor wizards if they had even a halfway decent work ethic? People would be lining up to throw money at them for everything from curing their child's Type 1 Diabetes to making toys like flying cars.

And of course, not being isolated could very well lead to a cultural renaissance for the wizarding world. With more free time and wealth, they would have the chance to produce more works of art. Just like in Italy in the 14th century (driven in large part by more trade with the outside world) they could create a vibrant and vivid culture even as they are more immersed in outside cultural influences. Instead of the atrophying of the wizarding world and the death of their greatest minds in pointless bloody wars, they could focus their energies in positive and creative directions.

In short: no, hiding your light under a bushel is not the best course. You starve your flame of oxygen, and deprive the world of its light. Let your magic shine.

*** You make good points, but you are also looking at such things from a positive point of view. Neither our society, nor WIzarding society is at a place where they can successfully implement such things. There was another thread which I commented on a couple weeks ago that was talking about integration, and I listed a number of reasons why it wouldn't work.

For one, the economy would collapse. Completely. Power companies and all their employees would basically be permanantly put out of work. Anything which requires automation could be replicated by enchanted objects. Item duplication is also a problem. What happens if some wizard thinks its funny to duplicate precious metals and crash the economy, assuming that the goblins don't do it first.

Next, you are proposing to take a nonviolent, fairly progressive and advanced minority group, and completely destroy their culture and force them to work for our society. Yes I am sure it would be great for our civilization to rely on magic, just like the American South relied on slavery and forced work.

Not to mention that Muggle society would basically require heavy limits of magic, and have it only working for societal benefit. Wands aren't guns. They are the equivalent to technology, and taking that from wizards is essentially dragging them into the stone age, as if we had banned electricity and all petroleum products such as oil, gas and plastic.

So just to summarize before proceeding, this is exploiting a historically persecuted minority group, destroying their culture and society for the benefit of who? The first entreprenuers to get them as fast as possible?

So next, the backlash against such a thing would be horrific. Wizards aren't stupid, and unless you can provide a really really good reason why on earth they should voluntarily destroy themselves, then you will most certainly see wizards engaging in a wave of terrorism and guerilla warfare worst than anyone could imagine. They can turn invisible, silent, and teleport, and magic cannot be stopped by muggles. They do after all have what amounts to weapons of mass destruction, such as fiendfyre, basilisks, nundus, and the like. That is without even considering what the Department of Mysteries might think up when under existential threat.

While wizards and muggles reuniting may be a potential utopia, I would argue that it would be a global catastrophe, worse than anything anyone has ever seen.

**** I'm not sure that I can agree with "nonviolent". Maybe it's just because they're Weasleys but both Ron and Ginny, two central, "good" characters, reacted violently to their peers because of words.

Ron hexed Malfoy for calling Hermione a mudblood. Ginny hexed Zacharias Smith for badgering her about the Department of Mysteries.

Can these teenagers who would otherwise be okay to be out and about in the non-magical world (I mean, 16 and 15 years old) be trusted not to whip out their wands and start up another round of witch hunts just because they're annoyed at muggle curiosity and rudeness?

**** What's wrong with a positive point of view? There is no reason we couldn't decide to work together, especially if wizards decided to itegrate on their own terms and did so in a fashion that endeared them to the public. Heck, a charismatic and intelligent wizards could easily get themselves into office with a few good will gestures and start stearing their country in the right direction.

The economy would take a hit in various sectors as new "technologies" obsoleted parts of it, but other parts would boom as magic opened up new and previously unexplored sectors. The same thing has happened with the introduction of plenty of technologies in the past, and people thought the economy would collapse as jobs were destroyed. Instead, it simply created new, different jobs. Also, power wouldn't be free. Current power companies would be in a prime position to use their existing infrastructure to capture new sources of power that magic could supply, but they would still charge for it. Maybe it would be cheaper, but it certainly wouldn't be free.

In some regions, yes, the backlash would be awful. Being a wizardin saudi arabia would be a bad deal. So, why not offer free, no questions asked immigration to a country where they don't have that attitude? Since wizards would be a massive economic asset, that would make sense. countries that embrace magic and technology would experience a golden age. If wizards don't want to ingrate, let them have some islands or remote lands somewhere they can do their own thing. Eventually, such communities would atrophy and die, but that would be their own choice.

Sure wizards have enormous destructive potential, but they pale in comparison to what we can do now with magic if only because they are so few in number. I also don't buy the whole "magic can't be stopped by muggles." If muggles were no threat, why go underground? Why fear them at all? Just take over and enforce your will or don't bother hiding at all since you're not in any danger. Clearly, muggles represent some threat, or there would be no need for such measures.

***** Historically speaking, we haven't had the best track record with taking over other countries to get their resources. Yes, everyone said that imperialism was great for building infrastructure and enlightening people who were not deemed to be as civilized, but capitalism and human greed made it fail, and Africa still has problems.

The economy would fail. Full stop. If a wizard can buy a generator, duplicate it a couple times, and then stuff Gubraithian Fire everywhere, then he has just made a company with basically no employees, or maintenance costs, and is free to completely under cut all the other power companies. Don't get me wrong, most powr companies we have now are scum, but they do still give back to the economy in some ways, such as paying their employees. A wizarding entrepreneur would basically become a billionaire, without need to do anything else. He may be in turn undercut by other wizards, but Muggles would be incapable of competing. A wizarding monopoly essentially.

Frankly, the fact of the matter is that capitalism is wholly unequipped to deal with magic. If your country isn't prepped to jump over to communism or something similar, then a large part of your society loses their jobs all at once. We are already seeing issues with that on the horizon with automation, and magic would be orders of magnitude worse.

And most wizards wouldn't want to integrate. Why should they? Is there any reason at all for them? Yes, you may attract some Muggleborns. But the rest of them? Why would they want to work for what is in their minds an inferior society, which has historically hated them and prosecuted them, and now wants to exploit their powers. It is like aid workers in Africa. Yes, they exist, but only small portion of the population would do that.

I doubt that wizards feared Muggles, but being continually persecuted and hated may well have something to do with it. Sure, adult wizards can cast Flame-Freezing charms, and be immune to burning, but those caught without a wand? Children? Muggle-born children? Arson and vandalism?

As for destructive power, I would imagine Fiendfyre being quite nasty. Since it is sentient malicious fire, setting it loose in a city center would inflict a huge death toll, and I have not seen any evidence that it stops without magical intervention. Alternatively, using a modified Geminio curse on C4 for instance makes dozens of duplicates per second canonically. I would be wiling to bet that it can be modified even more. What if you charmed dry ice to duplicate by ten every second. Imagine it evaporating and still duplicating, asphyxiating a city. That is simply speculation, but canon does not say it cannot happen.

****** Can wizards duplicate advanced mechanical items and have them still work? The books made it seem like that sort of thing eventually would wear off or break, and the more complex it was the faster it would break down and/or return to its natural state. It's clear there is some sort of limit to being able to duplicate things, because wizards do still have an economy and certain items are extremely valuable. Since this is the case, there is no reason to think that it would destroy the entire muggle economy as there is some sort of limit. Even if it was just an inability to duplicate electronics, things now rely on integrated circuits so much only very basic items would be able to be duplicated ad nauseam, and those might break down rapidly enough that there would be little point.

Most wizards will want to integrate as soon as they figure out they can get fantastically wealthy by doing so. Sure, you'll have a few diehards who won't want to, but history has proven that people will take the wealth and power over the security and comfort.

So, exactly, wizards feared muggles. They were not invincible. Even an adult wizard with a wand has to rest, and since wizards are so heavily outnumber, they had reason to worry.

White phosphorous, napalm, fuel air bombs, and of course, nuclear weapons all laugh. Findfyre is dangerous sure, but its not any more dangerous or destructive than any number of things we can do and have a whole lot more control over. We can already gas or blow up entire countries, the wizards wouldn't be bringing anything new to the table there. Sure, the wizards could do stuff like that, but so can muggles. Since that is the case, why do it? Why not integrate peacefully? Especially since in the end, continued hiding of the wizarding world is doomed to failure. With cell phones, the internet, and live broadcasts, it would only be a matter of time. Back when information only traveled as fast as a man and you didn't have vivid proof in moving picture, it was a lot easier to hide a secret society. Now? Forget it. Once something like that ends up on youtube, instrgram, or any streaming service, its simply a short countdown to people figuring it out.

******* Regarding duplication, the wiki seems to indicate that it makes exact copies, but those copies are more prone to rot and tarnish. Chemically speaking, it is actually quite interesting. They aren't disintegrating, they are more reactive for some reason. My point still stands however. If you have just one regular generator, transfigured perhaps, and then Geminio that whenever one generator breaks down, you still have the same effect.

I wager that the limiting factor on duplication aside from the tarnish is the lack of magic. Magical items could not be duplicated, probably because the process of magical duplication messes up the charms.

Think about what is sold. For the most part, all of it is magical. Your quills are self inking or auto correcting. Brooms sweep themselves or fly, and trunks can have all kinds of neat properties. Of course, this would not exactly matter in the Muggle world. If you duplicate items, and then magically seal them with an Impervious charm, then they would be unable to react, assuming you vanished all the air and chemicals around it.

Wealth is only useful if you intend to buy things. What would a wizard buy? What could the Muggle world make and do that the Wizarding World couldn't?

Yes, Wizards feared Muggles in general and were paranoid. Somewhat like how we fear terrorists. The odds are better that we will be eaten by a shark, but we are still far more terrified of terrorists than sharks. I am also pretty convinced that Wizards would have a lot more to fear from muggles. Being an elite society which is far more advanced, and destroying the economy would not much endear wizards to muggles. Russia's economy is heavily based on oil and energy production. Having a population appear which destroys that would not exactly endear wizards to a government such as that, and I could easily see them being restricted and persecuted.

Fiendfyre as the easy example is quite nasty. Because the other weapons you listed have bad properties of their own, but they don't go out of their way to hunt you down. You can still run from white phospherous and be reasonably certain that it isn't going after you specifically. And similarly, we don't actually know what stops Fiendfyre. We have some indication that magic and incantations can stop it, but we haven't seen it burn out on it's own, and I frankly doubt it would. If it has a degree of sentience, which there is a lot of evidence for that being the case, then it would actively go after fuel to keep itself alive. Drop that in a city, and it jumps from car to car, attacking gas stations. It is magical fire as well, and the amount of fuel it gets does not necessarily correlate to the intensity of the flame. We saw in the Room of Requirement that there were flames covering everything, burning it, melting it, and twisting it into ash. The Diadem Horcrux touched it for a couple seconds at absolute most, and was rendered a charred blackened chunk of metal which broke apart seconds later.

That, combined with things like Basilisks, and Nundus would be absolutely devastating.

Inevitability is not the argument here. The books took place in 1990s, and didn't have those problems. I would fully expect the world to be heading towards apocalypse though if Wizards get exposed, unless they all fuck off to Mars, where they can be safe. Maybe leaving a couple people behind to catch Muggleborns.

However, those two countries have such an intricate economic link that any hostile moves on the political level are quickly moderated by business communities and their horde of lobbyists.

For examples, Muggle Britain might depend on wizard support in terms of national security (defense against both foreign magical and mundane threats), healthcare, R&D, and country's overall competitiveness. Magical Britain would then get strong economic benefits and Muggle collaborations in maintaining the SoS from the general public.

** I have a few thoughts. Firstly, could you show me evidence that magicals live to 120-150 on average? Cause I'm pretty sure that's not true. I'm sure that the average is 100, since magicals have much better medicine than us, but that doesn't mean their body doesn't break down or suffer from mental problems like alzheimers.

Two, I think you're way off on muggle society integrating with magical society. Why would we muggles restrict magic, when it can instantly create things out of thin air, or maybe even cure diseases like cancer. Everything about magical society is a benefit to muggles. They have incredible abilties which can extend and make better the lives of every human on earth.

Three, you have some misconceptions about wizarding abilities. Instant communication isn't possible for everyone. The two way mirror is a unique device, and unless someone can figure out how they work, and mass produce them, then it will remain a unique item. Protean charms aren't this extensive communication device that you think it is. It alerts you when someone uses the other charmed item, but it can't send very detailed messages. Transportation is also a problem, since appartion can literally cause you to lose parts of your body. Apparition is also very difficult, and most wizards and witches prefer floo or broom, both of which require an object.

Speaking of requiring an object, 99.9% of spells require the caster to use a wand, and only very skilled individuals have been shown to use wandless magic. That means that without their wand, they're pretty much just regular humans. If the methods for creating wands disappeared, then the wizarding world would disappear.

And finally. The wizarding world is incredibly stagnant. Exactly eleven spells were invented in the 1900s, six of them by a single person. In the 1800s, only one. In the 1700s, only three. Spells can only be created by very powerful and intelligent magicals, and even then it very rarely happens. But look at the muggle world. Technology is constantly changing, advancing. The muggle world outperforms the magical world in terms of advancements, and I'm sure that eventually, we'll be able to replicate many spells and charms.

I'm ranting, I'm sorry. But I completely believe that it's in the wizarding world's best interests to unite with the muggle world.

*** This is more anecdotal for lifespan, simply because Rowling is annoying with not providing such information. But Dumbledore lived to about 120. We also know that Bathilda Bagshot, Grindlewald's aunt was still kicking around the time frame of the seventh book, which would make her at least 150. Possibly more. Griselda Marchbanks was the one who examined Dumbledore for his NEWT exams putting her at a similar age. Beyond that, we also can consider how old people acted in HP. Dumbledore and Slughorn were both of similar ages(give of take a couple decades) and were fairly active while we saw them, even dueling Voldemort, who was 60-70s himself. Grindlewald was the same age as Dumbledore, and lived in a dark dank corner of Nurmengard Prison, until being murdered, so it is obvious that he perservered through the unsafe health conditions.

Voldemort, Hagrid, and McGonagal were all of similar age, and quite active, without any signs of weakness, physically or mentally. I reckon that the life expectancies may be skewed by the fact that there was a couple major wars.

As for magic, how can you argue that Muggle's wouldn't restrict it, given our track record? Yes,it is a great tool to create utopias. It also can create weapons of mass destruction and control people's minds. With guns, most countries either ban them, or heavily restrict use, and force users to have licenses and background checks(in general, I know America has issues but that isn't relevent).

Next, I doubt that the mirror is that unique. If it wasn't bought, then chances are the Marauders made them, likely with the protean charm. The protean charm is able to send information, whenever the master item is changed. Galleons were inefficient because they needed to be inconspicuous, but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that they could not be scaled up, nor that the charm couldn't be modifed to do other things, such as Voldemort did when he uses the Dark Mark to give his location to Death Eaters so they know where to Apparate.

I am not sure the point you are attempting to make regarding wands. If the wizarding world disappears, then you have destroyed a society and tossed all wizards into a lower standerd of living, who are incapable of controlling their powers. Not only that, but I sincerely doubt that wandless magic is that rare. Quirrel, Snape, Voldemort, Harry, Dumbledore and Lupin(debatable) have all demonstrated some wandless magic. If you count the Animagus transformations, you also get McGonagall, Sirius, James, Peter, and Skeeter.

They Wizarding World may well be stagnent, but you have to question why. Snape invented a spell. Sectumsempra. It cuts things, and is basically no different from Diffindo, other than being dark magic and a bitch to heal. So if Wizards in general made all of their advancements around the time of the roman empire, then there isn't much need to make new spells if they are redundent. Muggles need to innovate, because we like to do new things, we like to improve things, and we like to make them more efficient. The wizarding world on the other hand, has no need for efficiency, because there isn't any energy cost. Anything new would need to be something esoteric which hasn't already been created.

On the other hand, Muggles, for advancements, have a much bigger population, and therefore have more technology explosion. Up until quite recently, we were playing catch up to overcome the influence of the Dark Ages. Rome after all, had engineering, math, and science on par with 1600's-1700's society (imo, I am no historian). There was even evidence to suggest that they used toys run by steam power, which could very well have kicked off the Industrial Revolution.

But in any case, what does the Muggle World provide? Communication in the Muggle world isn't superior, it is simply more complicated. As I explained, the internet is more or less useless for Wizards, and transportation is already covered much more nicely with Floo, Apparation, Portkeys, and enchanted objects. Could they potentially go to the moon? Yes, easily I would argue. Is there anything that is on the moon which they would want? No, I doubt it. Given the ability to expand space, and the small population, what kind of motivations would the Wizarding World have? They aren't imperialist, they are zenophobic and isolationist. They don't need land, they don't need resources, they don't have an economy which would benefit that much from either of those things, and scientifically, I would wager that they are ahead in some areas, and behind in others. Notably, they are ahead in the more applicable areas, such as time travel, and less so in genetics and quantum mechanics which they would have no particular use for.

And what would Muggles be able to contribute to the Wizarding World? I am not overly convinced that we could help them make new spells. Maybe give ideas for new spells, like a laser spell, but aside from things like that, I really doubt there is any real benefit to integration, and I would more expect genocide, exploitation and societal collapse on both sides if there was integration.

Utopias are great, but they are more or less impossible, and thinking they can be made with such a volatile situation is just asking to be burned.

  There are three main factors which make the Wizarding World look archaic. Their isolationism, their population statistics, and their culture creation.
#+end_quote

Wait, why don't you address the real archaic issues of the Wizarding World: Apparent despotism, lack of an effective constitution, lack of liberty, rights and protection of minors, social services, etc. The way the Government of Magical Britain operates makes this very clear in the books (attempted trial against a minor without representation, unilateral executions by head of state, incarceration without trial, Wizengamot acting as both judicative and legislative body + close ties to executive funtions...).

I mean, you make some decent points, but they seem very superficial and ignore the glaringly obvious fact that the enlightenment seems to have completely passed by the Wizarding World. Their culture works on entirely pre-enlightenment principles.

#+begin_quote
  so any books they do make would also be competing with books from the last couple centuries, meaning that their ideas and cultural progression would be much slower. Imagine our own society if half our population was regularly reading Victorian era literature. It would certainly skew societal values.
#+end_quote

Okay, here you give an explanation on why they are culturally stagnant. That's possible, I agree. It's still really sad and pathetic though, isn't it? I mean, muggle philosophy/economy/political books are available to them, you know? They are wilfully ignorant...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Hermione (a muggleborn!) is the only one we see who uses the protean charm in such a fashion. Wizards stick their heads into fireplaces or send owls (!!!) in order to communicate. Your argument is without merit.

#+begin_quote
  The internet is pretty much useless as well. They can communicate instantly in the first place, and there simply aren't enough wizards to put in the time to make the internet infrastructure and actually make content for it.
#+end_quote

Your argument seems to be missing an important point. Yes, they could do all that. Magic is absolutely magical and they should have the most amazing abilities. But they don't. There's no equivalent to the internet that we can see. No message-boards, no free press (except for one nutcase conspiracy magazine that no-one reads), no discussions, nothing. The fact that we can easily imagine all the great things that magic should enable them do is the reason why their world seems so sad and pathetic.

Oh, and don't forget you're defending a society that ostracizes squibs. Just imagine a culture that dehumanizes people with genetic defects and doesn't grant them basic rights: Oh right, you don't have to imagine, you just have to look at the worst atrocities of human history.

*** It is an interesting point you make in the beginning, and I won't deny that the government is certainly shady. However, is that a result of being filled with corruption, or was it because the government was set up wrong in the first place. Ministry employees seem to be a typical bureaucracy, not elected positions, but more based on merit. The Minister is elected, though we do not know by whom, though I would be willing to guess by popular vote. This is simply because we see the Minister being obsessed with public opinion, and heavily dependent on it. They have the papers spewing out propaganda, discrediting others such as Dumbledore and Harry, and give the impression that their grasp on power is really quite tenuous and dependent on their constituents. "We have to be seen going something". This does not give the image of a tyrannical government who can do what it wants, excepting of course the time it was taken over by a tyrant.

Enlightenment ideals have worked very well for Muggle society. However, the fact that they didn't magically jump over to the Wizarding World should not used as an excuse to destroy their culture.

Next, the Wizarding World knowingly practiced a policy of extreme isolationism and xenophobia. Since they had been historically persecuted, I would argue that it is really pretty natural to do this, and avoid literature which not only doesn't take the nuances of the Wizarding World into account, but also doesn't particularly add anything to Wizarding Culture.

Protean charms are instantaneous. We see Hermione and Volemort use them to great effect. Patronouses are instantaneos as well, or are close to it anyways, though that is limited by difficulty. Floo is also instantaneous, and since you can just Apparate to a place that you can use it, the effect is the same. I think your main argument against it is that you don't particularly like it, which is your prerogative, but doesn't exactly change utility and effectiveness.

As far as communication like that, they have multiple newspapers and radio, and really, that is sufficient. Don't forget the culture. Just as our society is moving towards globalism, theirs has done perfectly well with self-sufficiancy and being insular.

Automation is made wholly useless by the Duplication Charm. Since the only side effect of it is that it seems to make duplicated items more chemically reactive, Wizards could easily have a small vegetable garden, and live off of that. Or even just keep some food in the pantry and duplicate it every time you want to eat.

There is no indication that Wizards are not aware of atoms. Do you seriously think that given a thousand years, nobody didn't think to themselves, "Hey lets enlarge this and cut it in half. And keep doing it until we can't."

As far as electricity, why on earth would they bother doing experiements with it if they weren't useful? Or even make it common knowledge?

We don't exactly have the moral high ground regarding discrimination. Basically everyone has done it, and for less reasons than the wizards did. Racism and homophobia? Their culture is different than ours, so lets enslave them and christianize them. A book some dude wrote thousands of years ago says that gays are evil and of the devil? Lets go ahead and persecute them.

Comparatively speaking, their brand of discrimination makes more sense then our own. Not that it is right, but trying to argue that their side is evil is the pot calling the kettle black.

I'm not using them as an excuse.

There's nothing wrong with isolationism. You can have a perfectly acceptable society that's isolated from everyone else. Magical Britain is a banana republic. The isolationism is clearly to their own detriment if they can't figure out a decent system on their own (and don't tell me what they have is a working system, it is at the brink of hostile takeover all the time).

Electricity is a basic natural force. Wizards still interact with nature in various ways and we already know that Magic and Electricity do influence each other in some way. Electricity seems extremely relevant to Magic. Not to mention that they probably want to protect their houses from lightning strikes, no? Understanding electricity might be a good idea...

***** I do want to preface by saying that I made some assumptions about your arguments which were unwarrented. Several other commenters were talking about integration, so I thought that was where you were going.

I worded that first part badly. As far as we know, the Minister is elected democratically, and I am willing to bet that it is heavily beholden to the civilian populous. Indeed, the wiki indicates the the Minister is democractically elected through a public vote.

source ([[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Minister_for_Magic]])

Furthermore, my point is not really whether or not the government is bad, because we know it is. My point is whether the system is bad, and I don't think it is. Filled with corruption, yes, but the actual laws and structuring don't seem like a dictatorship.

As far as idiocy of a population, by which metric are you judging? The Enlightenment did not stop the World Wars, nor did they stop the Cold War. Technology, Philosophy and Reason are all well and good, but I am not seeing much evidence that the WIzarding World did all that much better than the Muggle wars.

As far as literature goes, maybe you are right. Perhaps instead of no communication, it was simply a one-way influence. Small amounts of Muggle books coming in, not overly popular but still having some influence. Given how the attitudes of the historical Wizarding Society seem to mirror some of the Muggle attitudes, it does make a certain amount of sense that it is possible for them to come in. However, even with that I would say they would be unpopular, simply because Wizards would not see much use in reading philosophy books from a society they deem to be inferior.

They have at least the Daily Prophet, Witch Weekly and the Quibbler. Given that their community is really quite small, I think that it is a fairly proportional amount of press.

Isolationism in the Wizarding world is the root of their insular ways and they cultural avoidance of Muggles. Corruption in the government is a different issue. It is like the United States. We have a cultural love of freedom and personal rights, but corrupt practices in the government are only slightly related to that.

Electricity that is used for devices. A lightning bolt and a light bulb run off the same fundemental force, but aren't anywhere similar in their effects. Why would the Wizarding World spend time trying to make Muggle technology common knowledge, when it is seen as a replacement for magic, a way to do the same things. How much of the population today knows how steam power works? I would argue that it is entirely possible that everyone knows the basic principles, but not how it is practically used.

I am pointing out that there is a double standard here, regarding morality of various nations. Judging the Wizarding World as worse than the Muggle one because they did discrimination is slightly ridiculous. Obviously, all countries should change and be better, and reforms are always good. But saying that I am defending a society which is evil is laughable when the one you defend is guilty of much the same.

And besides, where are you getting that Squibs don't have rights in the first place? We know they likely didn't around the 50's, since there was a Squib Rights movement around the 60's. But where is your evidence for them not being given similar rights by the government?

Yes slavery is evil. I am unsure of why that might be in question.

** I totally agree with your theory. I also think that in addition to not needing most of the muggle inventions (e.g. who needs pencils when you have self-refilling, erasable quills?) the magical world were set back during the last few decades by an extra world war. While the muggles were inventing computers, space travel, internet etc. after world war II, the wizards were still busy getting harassed by Voldemort. The magical society's technological "stagnancy" is not so much an attitude problem, but rather because they haven't had time to pursue peacetime development yet.

If they were to conduct their own scientific research, of course, I think the tech they come up with would be tailored for their own needs rather than just a variation of muggle inventions.

But for wizards and magical creatures in general, I seriously doubt DNA is actually how their inheritance works, given that we have seen many crossbreeds between species which shouldn't be able to do so, Flitwick, Hagrid, Blast-Ended Skrewts etc.

** I think there are two major flaws with this.

First, computers and computer networking would certainly /not/ be useless to the magical world. The Hogwarts library, from the size we see in the movies, is enough space to fit enough storage to fit every book ever written, every piece of music, every movie, /everything./ Make that accessible remotely, anywhere in the world, and you'll have revolutionized the magical world. You might be able to replicate video calling with magic, but there is no magical equivalent to the internet.

Which brings me to my second point: You're assuming the entire magical world is capable of performing magical feats which put them on the same level as the muggle world. I don't think that's the case. Of course, none of us are capable of creating a smartphone. That's not a problem for us, because we have global trade and mass production. They might be capable of producing food and water with extreme ease, or curing most mundane illnesses, but that's not the same thing as being advanced.

Just as an example, let's look at instantaneous communication at any (reasonable) distance. There's no reason the magical world shouldn't have it. None at all. Yet, somehow, they seem to lack it. If there weren't enough cultural forces to feed its development in peace, there should have been in the /multiple wars/ we know occurred. If they were at all capable of easily producing artifacts capable of instantaneous communications, we would see it. Since we don't, it suggests either they lack the capacity to produce such artifacts, or they lack the necessary mindset to even conceive of them. Either way, this is the lack of adaptability and advancement the wizarding world is known for.

So, it seems to me that the wizarding world /isn't/ advanced, and in some ways, they could benefit massively from advancement. The introduction of technologies and ideas from the muggle world could easily revolutionize both.

As a side note,

I really couldn't feel bad if the magical world lost their cultures. If you have the means to easily save the tens of millions who die needlessly every year, and instead decide to hole up in little secret clubs and design silly hats for fun, either because you can't or won't consider doing anything even remotely meaningful with your existence, your culture deserves it.

Yes, having cookies delivered to your door is great, but if there is a bakery next door, it isn't really that much better, and certainly not revolutionary.

Secondly, what metric would you use to judge the advancement of a civilization? They live with a high standard of living, in good health, long life, and without societal problems which plague us. Technological acheivements are only useful, if you can actually use them with any degree of efficiency. Regarding mass production, would it be at all feasible to place a factory in a town of 500, which is capable of producing a million pencils a day?
