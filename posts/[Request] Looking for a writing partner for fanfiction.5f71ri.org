Forgive me if I messed up the tags, it's wonky posting from a phone.

Anyhoo, I've been writing a fanfiction of sorts in my free time at work, and I'm starting to think I need at least one partner to write with me, bounce ideas off of, etc. Two people would be the limit, and I would need to chat with you on some sort of IM before deciding.

Without going into too much detail (suspense is good!) I can tell you that the story deals with themes of loss, fitting it, family, multiverse, and reprocussions of knowing something before it happens. There will eventually be a sort of bad guy to it, but it will start more of a slice of life/drama. The year it starts is right before the 1999-2000 school year.

I'd prefer female writers, as I'm not nearly as good at portraying female characters as I could be. That being said, don't let that discourage you from asking if you're a guy.


** You might have better luck finding a collaborator if you posted links to stories you'd already posted.

**** I'm in a similar boat! I've been thinking and planning and downright scheming, but I feel like in order to do it justice I need either a partner or a really good beta.

***** I've been slowly writing it down in a notebook. I have two parts done, each about two pages (back and front) college ruled paper. I have character ideas as well but they evolve by the time I put them into paper.

****** You are in better shape than me! I am more of a visual person, so I will likely be publishing my piece in a form of mix media. I've created a pinterest board for my thoughts/visual environments, and I have literally just finished my first draft of the prologue. I already know where I want it to go, I just don't have the points between A and E. ;)

******* I have to put it down since the bulk of the story just uses the world, not the characters. Most of the main characters from the books are secondary or even tertiary characters, with teachers being more of the former.

** Hi! I'm currently writing a bunch of fics, but I'd love to help with brainstorming/sound boards/ideas if you'd like!

I'm not so much into collaborating on a story--I don't think I'm very good at working with someone on a story that closely. But I love having people to talk to about stories so if you want, feel free to send me a PM and maybe we can chat!

*** Do you have Kik or some sort of messenger? It's easier to chat that way than logging into Reddit every other minute lol

**** Hi! I usually use google hangouts or discord, does that work for you? I totally agree logging into reddit to keep checking for messages is super annoying.
