Edit : Instead if must read fanfics is there any highly recommended Hp fanfics

  Must read
#+end_quote

No.

Taste is too subjective to have universally accepted must reads. I couldn't get through most of the popular fics around here. I couldn't stand Methods of Rationality for ten chapters. At the same time many stories I consider top-tier are niche picks. Quite a few of those are only good if you have read a lot of other stories and want a breath of fresh air, like Call Me, which is the antithesis to the average "Summer after 5th year" story.

*** I hate those â€˜summer after 5th/6th year stories'. They pretend to be edgy and give Harry thousands of powers but all they manage to do is fall face first into a pool of cliches and spit out an overpowered, out of character, mean and bigoted Harry. They are eventually abandoned because there isn't much you can do with a Deus Ex Machina character.

**** Then read Call Me by Wrexscar. It's a nice summer romance, if a little fast paced and it does not start terribly romantic (they are horny teenagers and have sex early on, before really establishing a relationship) . At the same time it is very refreshing after that edgy shit. There's no powerwank, no bashing, no politics and no inheritances, just a sweet, character focused story. Teenagers act like teenagers, they are quick to have sex, drink, try weed, stuff like that.

The biggest flaws are two chapters where everyone acts a little too rational (Roofies and Church) and Hermione is more in line with her 11year old characterisation than her canon 16 year one, but she is only in two scenes either way.

  What's up with your obsession with teenagers and sex
#+end_quote

I am merely annoyed how most stories are either pure smut or completely ignore that it happens. Especially at Hogwarts (no supervision, countless private places, nothing else to do in the evenings/at night). Most teenagers are horny bastards, and yet most authors depict them as angles with little to none "inappropriate" thoughts. Kinda makes the whole romance arc feel incomplete.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like every time I see you in a thread you are mentioning it somewhere.
#+end_quote

Considering that my last few posts here dealt mostly with Death Eater war crimes and the criminal process, you are getting the wrong picture.

#+begin_quote
  Do you mostly read romance
#+end_quote

Nope, if anything I am sick of pure romances. Pretty much any trope like the big emphasis on the girl's virginity, declarations of love way too early, jealous admirer/protective father as the antagonist, people dicking around and plot driven by misunderstandings.

I prefer romantic sideplots which are not resolved at the end but rather focus on the "us vs the world" aspect.

******* I also found Harry's characterization as almost asexual in canon to be lacking.

That being said, Call Me has almost no magic whatsoever. If I wanted to read about teenagers smoking pot, drinking, and partying, I wouldn't be reading Harry Potter fanfiction.

******** There are three or four times potions are used around the middle and the classic "let's use an orgasm to fuel a Patronus" as well as general charm use in the last chapter.

That being said, you can't really expect a lot of magic in a summer fic which follows the canon restrictions for underage magic.

** To answer your question, there are a none you must have read.

I would suggest you take note of what type of story you want to read and then systematically work your way down the top reviewed stories on [[https://FF.net][F]]anfiction.net. The recommendations here on the Subreddit are quite often repetitive, pointing out always the same stories, over and over again.

Alot of those stories are attempts to get away from the poor and sullen boy that Harry in their opinion is, in canon.Though, I have yet to find a story that does not depict Harry as someone of questionable moral integrity, - I mean those stories that think they point him in a "grey" area, when in truth they are anything but subtle in their attempt to establish a dominion of power that he holds reign supreme in whereas others are at his whims.

To cut the chase: I cannot make you any recommendations without knowing what you enjoy. Do you like powerplays? Do you enjoy a retelling of canon with a slight different touch? Maybe a different angle? Or do you enjoy Crossovers?

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
