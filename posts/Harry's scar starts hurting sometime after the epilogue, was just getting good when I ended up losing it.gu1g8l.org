Think someone can find it for me


** Cursed Child? Seriously we need more info than his scar hurting. It was too general to search or remember.

*** Forgive me, I wanted to put more but I was being nagged to go shopping and just wanted to put it out there and hoped I got lucky.

Anyway, I remember it involving Harry shopping in the Alley when he gets a pain spike and he whips around only to find no one there at all, Alleys completely empty and then he hears a whisper over his shoulder and wakes up from a dream. He just puts it down as an over active imagination but then when hes at work it happens again and this time catches a glimpse of someone only to chase after them and end up at a dead end. I remember him teaming up with Malfoy for a bit because Ron and Hermione are being a bit to skeptic about it because it happened in a dream first. I also remember that he was finally able to prove it to them when he suddenly started hearing an annoyed voice in the garden and when he replied back at it it was a random garden snake and Ron and Hermione where like 'oh shit its true!'

That's all I can remember, its not as well written as most high quality fics but it was\\
pulling my interest something fierce.
