Somebody, I think Harry, finds a photo album in Grimmauld place with pictures of a girl hanging out with the marauders. She has facial scars from Moony (I think) attacking her. The story is told through a series of flashbacks relating to the photos. She may have had an animagus form but I don't remember what it is.

*** I'm pretty sure it was linkffn(The Real Us) where pod people claiming to be Harry and Hermione give a long lecture of what really happened during the Hogwarts years. In my opinion, it's a terrible fic not only for its extreme Weasley-bashing, but for a variety of other reasons.
