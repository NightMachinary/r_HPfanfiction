I'm looking for a fic where Harry is friends with mental hospital patients and regularly visits them. He marries R-something and adopts a boy who struggles with self harm. Any help would be greatly appreciated üòä


** This sounds pretty awesome, and I have pretty much all day to look for it. Do you recall where it was posted? FFN, AO3, somewhere else?

As payment for the evil remindme bot, here's a fic rec where Harry adopts an abused child... A three part story by Paganaidd, beginning with Dudley's Memories: linkffn(6142629)

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** I can kinda remember something about a fic where the Order was under some kind of memory spell to protect each other, and when the war ended nobody knew how to lift the spell. Harry had hooked up with someone (maybe in a broom closet?) but didn't know/couldn't remember who it was, I think. I feel like that fic had a character Harry thought of as "Red" (who might have been Ginny) and some scenes in a hospital. No idea if it's the same fic, but does that sound familiar to anyone else?
