Malfoy is an incredibly minor character in canon. I kinda forgot that after going through all fan fiction, but looking back on his actual importance, /Neville/ is more important, and /the dursleys/ likely had more of an impact on Harry as personal antagonists


** How is Neville more important throughout the books? Malfoy is his main rival throughout the first 5 books and becomes a more important character in book 6 with his mission. Neville plays an incredibly minor role (most people even forget that Neville played a role the night they rescued the stone). I think he only has a couple major contributions later in the story (DoM and seventh year which was mostly off screen).

In terms of characterisation and developing the story Malfoy was way more important and Neville negligible.

*** Malfoys a bully in the first few books. He just makes life for Harry harder. Sometimes he's the red herring.

For example, what did he do during the goblet of fire? Prisoner of Azkaban?

Later on, it's like worrying about a skinhead during a Nazi invasion. Even his later gained importance as Dumbledore's assassin is quickly taken over by Snape and his whole family gets a reduced role by Voldemort for failing

In contrast, Neville lead the Hogwarts resistance and destroys the final horcrux.

  Goblet of Fire
#+end_quote

Orchestrated a massive PR campaign that targeted Harry, proving that he'd throw his lot in even with the likes of Cedric Diggory /and openly praise him/ if it meant antagonizing Harry? So widespread was it that Harry was surprised when Ron didn't wear one during their fight.

Plus, Draco got buddy-buddy with Krum early on, providing a red-herring or foreshadowing, depending on how you think of Krum's role in the end.

Dresses up like a Dementor and provides Harry the opportunity to cast his first public Patronus charm? Gets Buckbeak condemned to death, providing the framing of the entire climax?

After smuggling Death Eaters into Hogwarts, without telling Snape anything about his plans. His family also allowed Harry the chance to live in the first place.

He shakes hands with Krum when they're introduced. That just means that Krum has better manners than an 11 year old Harry Potter, which shouldn't be that surprising.

******* Krum sits with the rest of the contingent from Durmstrang. And quite a lot of quidditch fans wanted Krum to sit next to them.

Fleur invites Krum to her wedding - I'd say that's a decent enough proof of his character. Believe it or not, shaking hands with a 14 yo Draco isn't reason to call anyone a Dark wizard or a Voldemort sympathiser.

****** A character does not have to be likable or help the protagonist to be important. They just have to contribute to the story in a literary sense.

In essence, you aren't really separating the story from the literature.

**** You're confusing the importance of Neville from a plot perspective with his character in a literary perspective I think. If that makes sense.

Neville isn't really important at all (compared to Malfoy) until the7^{th} book. Though I guess you could argue for him in the 5^{th.} Malfoy appears often, and consistently affects the protagonists in meaningful ways. Neville does not with a couple exceptions. I also am fairly sure that Malfoy appears more than Neville does.

**** He's only important in book 7 (mostly offscreen) and plays a minor role in book 5.

DMalfoy was a consistent factor throughout with more importance in book 6. You are confusing the fact that Neville played a more important part in actually ending the war with actual value in terms of story and character development. Neville was not important for things getting to the point where he actually did something relevant, if for instance Seamus or Dean had taken up the role of Neville in book 7 the story could be exactly the same without any raised eyebrows.

If you are actually referring to the roles both played in the war then I agree with you. But story wise Malfoy was a far more relevant and important character.

If He hadn't bested Dumbledore Harry wouldn't have beat Voldermort, since it all came down to the allegiance of the Elder wand, not to mention the importance of his survival in Narcissa's actions right at the end.

** Neville may have mattered more in the end in some ways, particularly in universe, (slaying Nagini and leading the resistance in Hogwarts in 7th year), but he did next to nothing for the first 4 years (his biggest role was getting body bound by Hermione when they went after the stone).\\
Malfoy was relevant every year, as a minor antagonist with plenty of 'screen time' then in 6th year he's the one who lets death eaters in and is behind the botched assassination attempts, in 7th he's less important, though it's noteable that without his minor role Narcissa wouldn't have lied for Harry.

Edit: just realised, without Malfoy's involvement in Dumbledore's death Harry wouldn't have the allegiance of the elder wand and would likely have lost to Voldermort (and who knows how that would go, his sacrifice would probably still work to save people, so Voldie might still lose)
