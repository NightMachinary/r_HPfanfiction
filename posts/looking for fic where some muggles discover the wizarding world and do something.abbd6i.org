I am looking for a harry potter fanfiction where a muggle or group of muggles realize they have been obliviated after some incident, and take precautions with hidden recordings or something and investigate just what is going on. I don't really care what direction it goes in after that. any ideas internet?

â€‹

I have already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]] and am hoping for something like what happens in the later chapters, because it does not appear to be updating


** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]]

Fic hasn't updated in a few years, but the author is still active and is supposedly going to start updating again now that another fic is finished.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

** linkffnet(10681543) Not sure if this is something you are looking for, but there is an association of Anti-Magic users that actively hunt Witches/Wizards. I also recommend skipping the last chapter

  Being forced to attend a school full of muggles had never been in Harry's plan for Fifth year. Having to hide his secret along with protecting his new-found muggle friends from the return of You-Know-Who was proving to one of the most difficult tasks the Boy Who Lived would face. Will he be able to maintain his secret? Or is this the end of it all?
