I'm looking for good fics where Harry navigates politics. Preferably mostly in the courtroom, and I'd prefer he use any social event as a means of politicking rather than for romance or fun.

I'm fine with slash, bashing and OP and/or Dark!Harry. Please no romance/smut centric stories, plot regurgitation, harems, genderbending, pottercest or mpreg. Thanks!

** Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

Starting during the summer between PoA and GoF, Sirius uses a disguise to meet with Harry during the summer and teach him about his family history. It has some "Lord Potter" tropes but that seems like something you wouldn't mind. It's also a fem!Harry fic, with an interesting twist. The political stuff becomes more pronounced after Harry discovers his female counterpart. Hasn't been updated since 2017 but the author claims to still be working on it.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change)

This one isn't politics-heavy, it's more of a cloak-and-daggers type fic (one of my favorite kinds), but it has some political manueverings sprinkled throughout the story that you might enjoy.

Edit: Welp, sorry, but I didn't read the last line about things you don't enjoy until after I wrote this. The first fic obviously has some gender-bending, but it's more like two separate people within one body rather than Harry just turning into a woman. They're two different people and can switch between Harry and Melody (the woman) at will, so it's not so much genderbent!Harry as it is Harry having a second personality and body. Kinda. And the second fic is romance-heavy. Ah well, I'll leave them up in case anyone else is interested in them.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11699844][Made of Common Clay]] linkao3(11699844) - not so much "Harry navigates politics" as "Harry burns the political system to the ground," but close enough maybe?

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9408516/1][Hit the Ground Running]] - not really focused on politics, but it does crop up some and it's a fun fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6522208][The Price of Redemption]] linkao3(6522208) - oneshot, and Harry's a rather reluctant at the politicking

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

  Even with the war over and Voldemort defeated, many wrongs remained to be set right. After nearly fifty years of paying for Tom Riddle's crimes, Hagrid is finally ready to clear his name. But there are still those who are not ready to hear the truth.
