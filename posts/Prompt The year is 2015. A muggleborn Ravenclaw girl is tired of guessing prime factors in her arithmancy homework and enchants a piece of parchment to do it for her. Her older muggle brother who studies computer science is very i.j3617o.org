**** IKR

I'm more interested in theoretical applications, myself - like, does magic somehow grant access to unlimited computing power this way, thereby letting us brute-force around every NP-hard problem in trivial time?

***** Hmm, haven't read it in like a decade (fuck, has it really been out that long?), but didn't HPMOR have him try something like this, with time travel, and the result he got back was his own writing saying 'DON'T FUCK WITH TIME', or something?

****** Yeah, he tried to generalize this by using a time turner.

However, IIRC he noted that specific spells like the Packing Spell solved their specific NP hard problems in fixed small time.

***** maybe it acts a bit like a quantum computer but available for a much wider range of problems - rather than instantly bruteforcing a solution, it just collapses into the correct answer

***** I personally like the interpretation that, in general, magic fucks with probability and entropy. Like the Improbability Drive and related technologies from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

IDK how that would tie to computing power, though.

**** Honestly, so long as the person keeps the "magic" in the result, I don't mind.

My issue with nitpicking the Harry Potter universe to the extreme for logical solutions to problems is that it takes away from the themes and any sort of suspense.

Still, I've always wanted to read a fic that subverts the "arithmancy is useful" trope.

***** yeah. I hear you. like some are cool but the whole savant!Harry thing tends to be fairly insufferable.

My favourite use of arithmancy is in Naidhe's coven linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15234645/chapters/35334750]]) where one of the support characters, a really great OC has a tick or OCD preoccupation with the number seven, to the point of it affecting her life negatively, but she's also great at arithmancy, better than Hermione, which is refreshing. But it sort of drives everyone at around her to frustration even as it solves problems

There is also a Hermione/Severus fic that has Professor Vector is the order's (Dumbledore's) pet arithmancer; using arithmancy as a predictive/divination tool. but it doesn't really help things, so much as Dumbledore uses her ‘predictions' to try and fix things and keeps almost ruining it.

I think any fic that picks one particular form of magic and centres everything on that is going to suck. I can see why people write them that way though. It's fun to get into the world building and dream up the things magic can do

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

** I would for sure hope that the parchment works instantly--and that there is no delay (like rune connections/spell connections having delays analagous to wiring delays) and try to prove/disprove NP-Hard problems.

I would imagine that it would be trivial to test infinite solutions in a finite set of time with magic (i hope) otherwise it would just be as useful as a highly abstracted small ALU--which is useful, but not as cool.
