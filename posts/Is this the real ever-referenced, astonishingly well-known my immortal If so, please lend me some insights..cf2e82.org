Scrolling through this subreddit, it's impossible not to notice references to my immortal.

I've seen that fic mentioned an unignorable (not a real word, I know) amount. And finally out of curiosity, I looked it up. I found this page on FF and what seems like the same thing on Fandom.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/2/][My immortal?]]

So I guess my question is twofold:

1) For those who were there to witness it's release: Is this the real “My Immortal” as was published back then? Or has this been exaggerated for effect as happens sometimes.

2) What made this fic so popular as to become this notorious? That's to say, what sets it apart from other terribly written pieces out there? What's the history and development of it form the POV of someone who's seen the development of this story (not just the tale but it's reputation)?

I was so thrown off by the quality of what I read that I felt the need to create an account just to ask the question. I'd love to find out a little bit more about the life and development of this fic's status as seen by fandom.


** I can't answer #1.

As for #2, I think it's just how /terrible/ it is.

It's not just bad, it's impressively bad. Literally every paragraph has something cringe-worthy! The authors notes say "fangz" instead of 'thanks' because the author is "goffic". That's hilarious.

On top of this: it seems to take itself seriously, too. Which just makes things worse.

** 1. It's not the original My Immortal but it looks similar
2. The absolute awful writing and the fact that no one knows whether its a huge crack fanfic or just a badly written fanfic

** 1. Close enough, maybe a few small changes but nothing that fundamentally alters it from its original form.

2. It's so perfectly badly written. It's on the perfect cusp where you have to repeatedly ask yourself "am I being trolled?" but where you can't just be certain it's a crackfic. It's like a parody of every bad trope from Mary Sue to overdescription of outfits, to weird "goffic" stuff like every character having black hair and Harry's scar being a pentagram instead of a lightning bolt, and yet it takes itself one hundred percent seriously, to the point of the ANs all being diatribes against "preps" and "haters". It's like a perfect storm.

*** Yeah, I can see that. I wasn't able to make it through the whole thing but I absolutely kept going for a while.

All the while thinking “this cannot be serious.”
