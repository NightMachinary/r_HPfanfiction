****** Because there's a huge power difference between the two. Snape is only in his 30s and Dumbledore has been in a position of authority over him since he was only 11 years old, both as his teacher and now his work boss and leader of their resistance movement. That's more than half of Snape's life.

******** Dumbledore still has an immense amount of power and influence over Snape's life. Like he could literally get Snape killed, or thrown in Azkaban, or destroy his livelihood if he decided to withdraw his support over a relationship issue. If Snape wanted to break up, it would be really hard for him to get out of the relationship in a peaceful way without risking his safety.

Just because two people are adults doesn't make a relationship healthy or okay. That's why doctors are not allowed to date their patients, even when their patients are adults. And why it's frowned upon for college professors to date their adult students. Or bosses to date their underlings.

****** Well age matter for two reasons. First because usually men that are 30yo like Snape are not attracted to men aged 100yo+ (even if we qssume that adumbledore looks.like a 80yo the point still stands). Second because of the power dinamic. Dumbledore is not only Snapes boss but he was also his teacher and headmaster when he was a kid. It is weird.

About Snape I wont enter indetail because I am tired of the Snape is good/bad debate but his views about live and relations are certainly quite abusive imo.

** Not friends. First, there is a huge age-gap between the two, it would be impossible to be on equal footing. I think they had a mentor-mentee or a father-son relationship. Even though Albus used him, I think he did really care about Snape. They did care about each other but their relationship couldn't be described as 'friends.'

** I don't think Dumbledore knows how to have friends... I feel like people respect Dumbledore but don't necessarily like him. I feel like Dumbledore views 'friends' as "people who have use/value".

I think Dumbledore is 'friends' with Snape, as much as someone can be. Friends in that he uses Snape as a close advisor and is pleased when Snape complies. And to Dumbledore, that is what a 'friend' is.

But Snape (imo and it's just how I read it) is indebted to Dumbledore, is forced to obey him, enslaved by him in a way. He does not like Dumbledore but is obliged by the necessity of a vow ("what will you give me Severus? Anything") to be a servant. But no, he does not like him.

**** I always got the feeling that that promise Snape made to Dumbledore was essentially an unbreakable vow. Or at the very least, a promise that Snape is now ensnared by.

He gave himself to Dumbledore in the desperate hope of saving Lily.

But Lily died anyway? So why on Earth does Snape stay? Dumbledore promised to save them and he didn't? Why trust a liar? Snape barely cares for Harry, he does so out of duty to Lily's memory, not because he likes Harry.

I just feel like that promise Snape made was more than a troth, it feels more binding. It's Dumbledore or orders him to go back and spy after Voldemorts return. Dumbledore who commands him to leak the day of Harry's removal from Privet Drive. Dumbledore who puts Snape into a position where he is hated by both Voldemorts followers and all of Hogwarts by being headmaster.

If Snape could have, he would have just ran. Hidden far away from all the nightmare and mourned Lily somewhere. But he doesn't. Why the hell does he stay?? What is motivating him to stay?? What does Snape have to gain by staying at Hogwarts and working for Dumbledore?? Nothing. To protect Harry? A boy he doesn't like, he has no attachment to only for Lily? That's not love, that's an obligation. He hates Harry, that's clear throughout the books. If Dumbledore hadn't made him stay, Snape would be long gone.

Enslaved is a strong word but I can't think of a better one... Trapped?

That's my view of it anyway.

****** Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard of the age. He promised to protect Lily. He has a whole organisation of people who should be able to protect this one woman. And still he fails?

Snape begged voldemort to not hurt Lily, and in all fairness to Voldy, Voldy asked Lily to "step aside girl" three times. Which is a hell of a lot more chances than most people get.

Fair enough he shouldn't go back to Voldemrt, but why on earth would he stick by Dumbledore instead?? Why not screw them both and just run away to France?

What is motivating him to stay with Dumbledore? What does he have to gain? Dumbledore broke his promise. Why does Snape have to keep his?

***** he stayed because regardless that Dumbledore broke his promise, he still felt guilty (although, I don't think he should since he did try his best and Lily and James would have lived if not for Pettigrew) for Lily's death. Also, he'd have seen running as cowardly, and we know he's not a coward and he despises being called one.

** No.

I don't think Dumbledore really has very many friends. Snape is most definitely not a friend, because Dumbledore doesn't consider him an equal. He is is boss: in the school, in the Order, and for the Light.

The only people I recall that Dumbledore calls friend are Flamel and Moody. Fudge is not a friend, although Dumbledore is not his boss. Everybody else, he sees himself in a position of authority of them, and that makes them ineligible as true friends.
