I m just curious. I don't see anything wrong with it as long as it makes sense.


** I didn't really understand why people hated it either... And then I read an otherwise fascinating wbwl fic, and after about ten chapters, Hermionie came. After that, it was basically /fifteen chapters/ of Harry and Hermionie agonising over their relationship. I gave up. It destroyed the fanfiction for me.

** It's because in most AU fics the story is supposed to be different. Harry is raised by someone else, Harry is in another house, Harry is trained by Unspeakables, Harry is secretly the lovechild of Umbridge and Lockhart, I could go on. The point of an AU is that a different Harry is thrust into a situation different from canon. Making him friends with Hermione completely ruins the point because A completely different Harry still ends up making the same choices and befriends Hermione.

** I think it's an issue of over-saturation and poor characterisation.

It feels as though 80% of stories written have Hermione as the main friend or love interest. Eventually, people get bored of her character voice and the know-it-all character is fairly grating to begin with. Boredom breeds contempt. The fact that she is one of the main figures of the original novels does not help matters either.

As with regards to poor characterisation, most writers wish for their character to simple, as clear characterisation is easier to write. However, that causes Hermione to be infallible more often than not, and perfection is hateful to read. Harry, in Indie fics, suffers the same fate, and listening to two perfect characters agree and then curbstomp is not fun.

I think people look to fanfiction as something different from the original series, and Harry and Hermione's friendship is never going to be written better than it was in the books. As a result, we as readers want something different. We all already know the formula for Harry and Hermione to solve a problem. It's:

1. Harry encounters problem.
2. Hermione researches the problem/ becomes a plot device
3. Harry fights the problem and wins easily.

I think what we really want is something other than Hermione, rather than not Hermione.

** Even in the original books Hermione is a know it all, who always spouts off random facts about everything and really not that tactfully. She is somtimes spiteful, and her constant nagging is really annoying, she is also book smart, has a bunch of facts crammed in her brain but she lacks basic common sense a lot of times, not to mention that she can be very judgmental and hars with people who doesn't fit her world (for example: Luna Lovegood). So in AU its little hard to imagine for example a slytherin harry or intelligent harry to have a meaningful friendship with someone like that. Also its really annoying when they try to portray her as some kind of infallible well of wisdom, who knows everything and perfect in everything. Of course there are some really good fics for Hermione lovers and she has great potential, it really depends on the writer's approach and talent.

******* To quote what someone else on this thread has said, there is a paradigm shift underway, and I would argue not just on this forum, but in the wider fandom as a whole. Ron is definitely more popular now, than, say, during the year after the Wonderland interview. And I think this is due to people rereading and the influence of the movies diminishing as the years go by. The movies do not show any of the instances quoted here which show Hermione in a negative light, only Ron's comment. And also Harry agreeing with Ron about Hermione's attitude, no, instead Hermione takes him to see his father's quidditch trophies.

One example was Marietta. She could have done something to the parchment to prevent information leaks instead of what she really did. Marietta was just trying to protect her mothers job. She had to choose between her friends and her family, that isn't really even a choice. They can't all be like Hermione 'obliviate my parents and send them off to Australia' Granger.

As far as we know, she was never able to remove the boils and had to let them fade into permanent scars.

Bellatrix carving 'Mudblood' into Hermione's arm is seen as an unforgivable branding, when Hermione is essentially guilty of the same thing, in a far more visible location.

Hermione knew the Ministry had already attempted to have Harry /kissed/ and Umbridge had already caused permanent scarring to Harry's hand which no one did anything about. I believe Lee Jordan also was scarred, leading me to believe the blood quill was used on quite a few students.

Regarding Marietta, if was that worried about her mother, she never should have signed the contract in the first place. If you want people to be responsible for their decisions, start with her. It's not about deterrent. It's about saying you'll keep a potentially deadly secret and then betraying your friends. Cho's name was on that list too.

****** Firsthand I will admit that I have grown tired of Hermione.

Comparing the scaring incidents was probably in poor taste.

How was she to know about the attempted murder? All the national media was saying that everything was fine and that 'Harry was a nasty liar probably influenced by that Dumbledore who had designs on the Ministry'. She only joined because Cho dragged her, and maybe because she was concerned for her grades? That was one of the reasons Hermione suggested the club in the first place. The other being so students won't be sitting ducks when Death Eaters come along.

Also I would like to point out, it wasn't a 'contract' per se. Hermione cast the jinx in secret. This was 'apparently' just to give everyone a sense of commitment.

Another point, at the time of joining, this wasn't an illegal thing at all. It wasn't high treason when they joined, it became so later. At no point did she say she will keep a deadly secret.

Nor did she completely willingly betray them. Umbridge and her goons probably identified her as a member or a likely one and then laid on the pressure using her mothers job as leverage.

******* Edit: I changed my original comment to make things more clear to future readers. The point is still the same, just less confusing wording.

I was actually pointing at Hermione knowing the stakes, since she's the one who decided the punishment. The jinx has nothing to do with Marietta's decisions because she didn't know about it. The potency of the spell is Hermione being vindictive, to which I was putting forth the idea that it's understandable that she would see discovery as expulsion or Azkaban, on top of allowing Umbridge to take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore intervened and the second one still happened, with Fudge prepared to do the first without Dumbledore's intervention.

Different people will have different opinions about whether permanent scarring is justified, but it's not anything like Bella.

As for Marietta, she did willingly betray them. She marched up to Umbridge's office during a DA meeting. I suppose there is the exceedingly unlikely circumstance that Umbridge happened to wrangle her into her office at the exact right time, but if she was dosed with Veritaserum, why wouldn't she tell Cho? Cho would have immediately told Harry that information to assuage her own guilt about indirectly dragging the snitch to meetings.

Beyond all of the above, she signed her name when her parents had expressly told her not to do anything to cross Umbridge. Even after she signed her name, she continued to hold her coin from October until Easter. She had a half-year to think about it and then, instead of destroying the coin and forgetting about the DA, she decided to betray them to get on Umbridge's good side.

It'd be a little unfair to judge Marietta as a terrible person based on what happened, but she should still be responsible for her decisions.

Offtopic: I'm tired of fanon!Hermione too. For whatever reason she's either a saint or demonspawn in every story or review and that gets really old. I'm indifferent about canon!Hermione, but she's an exceedingly rare sighting these days. I just read a story where she got splatted by the troll and it was kind of nice not having glorification or bashing.

Right now I have two fics I'm in first draft on in which she's supposed to befriend Harry. In one, she's acting AU according to the books, because fond recollection softened her worst traits, so I have to go back to her being a whole lot less likeable. In the other, she's more true to the books and Harry absolutely wants as little to do with her as possible.

In most stories it doesn't make sense.

Very often their friendship or relationship are stated but not shown. Harry and Hermione are best friends. That's all. Without any interactions that support such statement. Often it goes to the point when one of them clearly abuses the "friendship" it with no consequences to himself/herself.

Also it doesn't add likes when an author loves his/her hero so much that he/she justifies and instantly forgives any wrongs of the hero. At some point it becomes so annoying that all you wish is to see when the hero is actually punished for the actions.

They are supposed to be average (hence the common name Harry Potter) so keep them that way.

I mean, Tonks is one of the main characters in both of my fics and even the love interest in one. She can look absolutely flawless if she wants to. Pretty much your walking wet dream in three seconds. And yet you don't see me forcing down her "hotness" down the audience's throats.

** Hermione is (for some reason) one of the most popular characters in the franchise. So most of the time it doesn't actually make sense for her to be involved, but people do it anyway because there's no way a story can work without their beloved Hermione-Sue-Totally-Not-Self-Insert

*** Well, she's one of the three main characters so you'd expect her to be popular.

Say that Daphne Greengrass is inexplicably popular and you'd have a point, but Hermione Granger was /always/ going to feature heavily in HP fanfiction.

**** She's also smart, courageous, does what she thinks is right no matter how many disagree with her, and she has a drive to help others. She's not the most beautiful girl either.

She appeals to a lot of people who are fed up with eye/arm candy girls or damsels in distress.

Of course a lot of people hate girls like that - girls who don't listen to men, who don't bow to peer pressure, and who aren't nice to everyone.

***** Nah most people just dislike people doing what they think is right. Its quite the annoying habit because it gives people the idea that they have a right to stick their noses in other peoples bussiness. I'm not a big fan of her character nor in the books nor in a lot of fics not because she is too smart or not pretty enough but because she sticks her nose were it doesnt belong. While forcing her morals trough other peoples throats all the time.

******* Indeed if she would have been an abolitionist in the North of the USA she would have probably made a lot of friends with that. In the south she would have been shunned. As she is by bascially everyone in the books not because she is smart not because she isn't pretty. But because she sticks her nose where it doesnt belong.

************* And you are talking like a vegan telling me eating meat is murder. As we see in the books nobody takes Hermione seriously. Nobody. Why? there is the option that nobody cares or nobody is smart as Hermione and sees it as the slavery that she says it is. Or and bare with me here she is just an over reacting 14 yr old screaming about what she believes is right while having no idea. Once again Nobody in the books takes what she says seriously. And ofcourse now yo uare gonna say that magicals are all idiots that dont think. Still not a single other muggleborn seems to see the problem. Even the house elves (who you probably believe are indocterinated or stockholmed) want anything to do with her. Why not? Because they arent human. You like to go with the Hermione is just smarter than everyone else and is ofcourse totally correct. I prefer to go with 14 yr old overreacting vegan version.

************** If you truly don't see that this is slavery and wrong, even after the very first house-elf we see in the series is suffering and getting abused because he is a slave, then you need to educate yourself. Your "argument" is on the same level as "The majority of the White Southerners thought slavery was OK, so the minority who disagreed was wrong".

*************** haha you keep using quite weird arguments here. You are comparing house elves to people. They are not human and quite clearly so. They are a magical race that is very clearly non human they have non human ideas and non human behaviors. Nothing in the books supports Hermione theories which is why nobody supports here. Actually there is this one exception which is all you go on but exceptions arent the rule nor are they any form of proof. That is why Hermione is so clearly like the screaming 14 yr old vegan calling eating meat murder. She is comparing things that should not be compared while making unfounded accusations.

The second most important house-elf character, Kreacher, also is forced to serve a master he hates - two, actually, if we include Harry.
