I suppose that, if Voldemort hadn't decided to mark his followers, we wouldn't have the same HP canon AT ALL. But what if his followers had had enough sense to consider the implications and consequences of taking Voldemort's Dark Mark? I believe that, if enough of them had gotten together and had a conversation about it, they would have concluded that taking the Mark was a stupid thing to do.

The Dark Mark is an obvious ‘tell' that you're a Death Eater. Getting arrested will result in getting outed. And likely, time in Azkaban, as we see in canon. Consider careers, or even a simple job. If your employer sees your Dark Mark, will you get hired, or advance in your field? Will you be trusted with positions of responsibility? Snape is the only Hogwarts professor who has a Dark Mark, probably for good reason. Presumably, Dumbledore had to adjust the school wards so that Snape could even enter the castle.

I'm guessing that having a Dark Mark has few perks, and a thousand disadvantages. Voldemort is able to torture his followers through it; he perhaps can kill them through it. He can possibly siphon power, or magic, through the Mark. The Death Eaters are essentially enslaved through their Dark Marks.

Are there any benefits at all? Because I can't see any. If a large enough group of Voldemort's followers got together and told him that they would follow his tenets, but they would not take the Mark, what would Voldemort's choices be?

JKR came up with an effective plot device in the Dark Mark, that I will concede. If any of his followers gave thoughtful consideration of exactly what it meant to have one, however, I would suggest that most would have refused the Mark.

Any thoughts?


** Firstly, the dark mark was a status symbol- having one meant you were part of the inner circle, and should Voldemort have won the war as he very nearly did being a marked follower during his rise would have been a very prestigious thing- they were to be the elite of the Wizarding World, after all, and would wield power in his name. We see the consequences of the gamble- we don't see the pay off. Risking your ass for Voldemort now might get you a manor a few years down the line. Plenty of real life gang members also have tattoos displaying their allegiance or crimes despite the consequences.

Secondly he recruited in waves. A few of his most impressionable or invaluable followers first, then a few more. Some people might have taken the mark not knowing anything about it, and if you were interested in joining the only people you could ask were already marked. Perhaps if they had unionized and negotiated they wouldn't have come to an agreement. But the only people to know much about the mark had the mark and the air of secrecy and hierarchy was almost certainly part of the pitch.

Thirdly we never spend much time on the mark from the perspective of a user- there could be other magical benefits we don't know about. It allowed for direct communication with Voldemort- talk about being able to call in the cavalry. It was so efficient at it that Hermione copied it in a less gruesome fashion with the DA Galleons. If Death Eaters could sync up with their peers in some sort of evil peer-to-peer network that's a powerful perk. If as a side effect that allows the Dark Lord to channel magic into your body or weakens your mental shields... well, no take-backsies.

TL;DR They wanted to look cool and be rewarded, they were deliberately never informed of all details until it was too late, and it probably comes with some considerable perks.

It's probably because your employer is a muggle. Witches and wizards would be better able to recognize the dark mark.

** First of all, the Dark Mark isn't a tattoo; it's a brand made by searing the flesh. For another, it doesn't show most of the time. Someone with the Mark can make it visible so that his followers would always know if the person were trusted. It also was used in canon to allow bearers to pass through certain barriers, so getting one was literally a key to Voldemort's inner circle.

Voldemort never used the Mark to torment his followers- the Cruciatus was effective enough. He also couldn't force them to come just by summoning them- Karkaroff resisted his summons for months before he was tracked down and killed.

Not even Sirius knows what a Dark Mark is, so that's highly unlikely.

All of the problems you mention are made trivial if the Dark Mark is just secret enough. Presumably, it's hidden when Voldemort isn't actively willing it to appear.

** Also, weird thought but wouldn't it be cool if Voldemort could use the connection afforded by the Mark to possess one of his Death Eaters in the field with no risk to himself- a la [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvbCgnCJoA]['assuming direct control']]? It could be overused but it would add some tension to Death Eater encounters. Maybe even have it come with recoil to emphasize how dark it is, with lesser Death Eaters deteriorating more rapidly because they can't handle hosting the Dark Lord's magic.

I'm too busy/lazy to employ that one properly so I'm throwing it out there as a freebie.

*** I'm surprised I've never seen anyone do this before; it seems like exactly the sort of thing Voldemort would do. You could even hand wave the question of why he didn't try it after losing his body by saying his connection would be too unstable, which is why he had to settle for the weird abomination that was Quirrelmort.

** Well, I'd argue that Voldemort granted the Mark as either a "reward" for loyal service, or in Draco's case, punishment to ensure loyal service.

In any event, I doubt he'd tolerate someone saying "No, thank you."

** Because he is the dark lord, he's not going to tell them all the down sodes of the mark. He leaves the mark over a few raides to first make it his mark. Next he rewards it to someone, making the mark something to be earned. Usually the death eaters think the mark is an honour and not a branding. These people are devoted to him and confident he will win, they didn't think they had anything to fear of being directly marked as a follower of the dark lord. I bet there would be a few people who have a swastika tattoo from WWII. At the time the death eaters took the mark they didn't even consider what would happen if they lost. Most probably thought they would die if they lost the war or go to Azkaban, its only because Malfoy payed off the imperious curse plee that allowed others to do the same.
