Have you seen cooking recipes? Almost all of then are like "add some X, then some Y, then some Z, stir it into a mass, bake it until it's prepared...". And the ones with proper quantities are still flawed because of the differences between cookware and microwave's and stove's power and such. There's nothing precise about cooking recipes. If you want to cook a new dish with a recipe, you have to try it, to fail it, to adapt it to your conditions. Harry was accustomed to it, it's just how human life is. It's this hard.

And here Harry gets his Hogwarts things, sees a cauldron (/can I make a giant serving of potatoes in it?),/ then opens a +textbook+ cookbook and is amazed by all those recipes. They are very precise. Precise ingredient quantities, precise temperatures (with a guide on how to set them), precise sizes of slices, precise cauldrons and rods and things. That's just perfect, finally, some intelligent people started writing recipes. And he doesn't even need to use magic to cook magically!

Don't know how it would get from there but I imagine Harry revolutionizing magical cooking and potions. He can even be rivals with Snape with their different views on potions, ingredients, utensils and the purpose of it all. Imagine Harry adapting usual recipes to the magical way of cooking. Add X of water, Y of macaroni, Z of salt, stir clockwise (with default technique) 5 times and anti-clockwise 2 times, repeat it for N times, after that add C of cheese and H of cubed (size S) ham, stir anti-clockwise 3 times and you have dinner ready under 5 minutes.

After his first successes (studying Arithmancy and Potions a bit ahead certainly helped), house-elves want to learn from him. Harry becomes an unofficial chef of Hogwarts and now has many willing sets of hands, all ready to help him cook.

Remember Dobby from Year 2? He wanted to save the great Harry Potter not only because of he's BWL but because he's a cooking hero to the elves. Every elf wants to be just as great a cook as Harry Potter (humans still don't know how much larger his fan-base has become).

By Year 4 he's writing books which are bestsellers across the whole magical world. When asked about what he would do after Hogwarts, he answers that he will travel the world, learning new cuisines from muggles and wizards alike and adapt them to his way of cooking. Maybe he will open a restaurant. Create new magical dishes with magical tastes and magical effects.

Snape has never got so much interest in his classes before. His usual number of NEWT students doubled (and he took only those with an O!). Even Gryffindors have started to pay attention and follow his clear instructions, what a miracle. And why is that? Well, if Ron Weasley is told that he can create a delicious feast all for himself following simple instructions, he would be highly interested. And seeing that it's really that simple, he would notice that instructions in their potions class are not much difficult, it's just like Harry's recipes, only ingredients are more strange and not edible.

When Lord Voldemort returns, Lucius Malfoy suggests a celebratory feast. He claims to have hired an amazing cook for it, the same one who delivered them this dinner they are having right now, and haven't Lord Voldemort tasted anything better than this in his whole life? Voldemort agrees.

After the feast Lord Voldemort goes to sleep peacefully to never wake up again. ^{no other Horcruxes, yeah}

Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter shake hands and part ways. Thus Harry Potter has defeated Voldemort with a power he knew not.

___________________________________________________________________________

I really want to see Harry enjoy cooking for his friends, lol. And that rivalry with Snape over potions and cooking is just great. I just imagine them loudly arguing about some trivia and Dumbledore just watches them with a happy smile, says sth like "I'm so happy to see you getting along so marvellously. You are so much alike!" and they turn to him and deny it vehemently with the same phrase.

Successfully killing Voldemort with a feast is what you get if this Harry and Snape cooperate, lol.

During Year 4 I can't imagine anyone wearing "Potter Stinks" badges. "Guys, you are aware that Potter has access to all of our food, right?" nips the whole thing in the bud. And just look at Potter. All he ever does is sit in the kitchens with his friends and sit in the library with his friends. He wants to become a cook and is already very famous for his books and BWL status. Something with his championship just doesn't sit right.

** Well, there's linkao3(Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce), which... starts off sounding like a crackfic, but then develops into....not? Somehow. And I'm a bit squeamish about fics involving real life people and their real life problems - including Ramsey Sr. I wish they'd invented a new character that was just loosely based on Gordon - wouldn't be hard, since they made up fictional parts of his life.

But it's not really exactly what you're asking for, but it does have that element. I especially liked that it took the more likely of the trio to cook - Harry really wasn't interested in cooking in canon, and he also did little more than turn the bacon. Ron had the potential there to be a cook, and I'm sad JK missed that opportunity.

*** It started off with a /really/ good premise. I liked the original (?) characters. The long, drawn out chapters about each contestant's back stories/motivations were cool, if you're into that sort of thing (I'm not; I prefer to let things come out organically over the course of the story, rather than bash me over the head with it), because they were thoughtful, and you could see genuine motivations behind each of them.

To be honest, if we had stuck with the Professor Ramsay situation, I'd have been more than happy. If we'd stuck with the diversion that Ramsay used to distract everyone for a good long chunk of the beginning, I'd have been cool with that. If it had been Ramsay in the HP world, his motivations, and the rest of cannon slotting into place neatly, albeit through a different set of journeys, I'd still have been cool with that.

This one kind of did all the things, and I couldn't keep up with it.

Would you guys review the section that i wrote just to to see if it is worth developing? I based it from a section in the book, so it might be fimiliar initially.

*** ‘Up! Get up! Now!'

Harry woke up with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

‘Up!' she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the cooker. He rolled on his back and tried to remember the dream that he has been having. It has been a good one. There had been a flying motorbike in it. He had a funny feeling that he'd had the same dream before.

His aunt was back at the door.

‘Are you up yet?' she demanded.

‘Nearly' said Harry.

‘Well, get a move on. I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn. I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday. I let out the cake and it looks like the crumb coat has set already. Finish the cake before Duddykin wakes up.'

Harry groaned.

‘What did you say?' his aunt snapped through the door.

‘Nothing... Nothing...'

Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten. He managed to make about 3 batches of chocolate cake yesterday. It didn't help with the recipes being pasted on blogs that talks on and on and on before posting recipes. He does not want to know about the neighbor requesting the exact ganache recipes after tasting it once, thank you very much. Just tell him how much chocolate chip and how much milk he needed please.

And here comes another trouble. Why can't the recipes give the amount in metric measurement? For god sake, which cup are supposed to be used? A tea cup, a sippy cup, disposable cup, which one? Thank goodness that Vernon want the cake to be perfect and do not mind the waste of the ingredient for a perfect cake texture on his son's birthday.

Harry get up slowly from bed and went down the hall after getting dressed. Going straight to the cooker tending to the bacon, Harry check on the tempered chocolate decoration for the truffle chocolate cake that Dudley asked for. With all tempering he had done for Dursley, it is no wonder that his tampering skill are so good. Practice makes perfect.

He finishes the chocolate frosting and the ganache drip decoration for the cake, topping it with multiple chocolate candy and an impressive chocolate shards arrangement. Now he is left to assemble the breakfast and bake snickerdoodle for evening tea later.

Again, he reverently wishes for the cup measuring thing is going to stop. One can only hope for metric system domination. He likes cooking and baking, but with the trial and error method that has been going on, his uncle's patient can only go so far.
