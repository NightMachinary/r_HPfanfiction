*** Given that Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while Grindelwald had the wand, and given that Dumbledore was only "a shade more skillful", I think the natural conclusion is that the benefit which the Elder wand provides becomes less relevant the more powerful you are.

Like, the Elder wand functions by making sure your spells are always as powerful as they can be. But if you're Dumbledore, your spells were already as powerful as they could be. You were already butting your head against the ceiling of what a given spell can do, so the Elder wand adds little.

Whereas in the hands of a lesser wizard, it's a complete game changer.

**** An alternative explanation is that Dumbledore was significantly more powerful/skilled than Grindelwald and he was just being humble when referencing to the difference as just being a shade more skilled.

** It goes author by author, for me, it gives a flat bonus to offensive spells, perhaps the more deadly the bigger the bonus.

While also allowing spells that shouldn't be possible to work. Or boosting normal spells to a certain extent(less than offensive ones).

Like repairing a wand, or casting a powerful confundus.

I toy with the idea in my stories that the Elder Wand is a weapon, and prefers to be a weapon, meaning it can perform non-offensive spells perfectly and even boost some of them.

But offensive spells are where it makes them considerably more powerful.

I also like the idea it affects the user, increasing the bloodlust, and trying to make them choose conflict rather than diplomacy.

I also don't think it should make one invincible, just have then cast more powerful spells, they can still be outsmarted or outmaneuvered.

** It's up to you as a fic author, of course. Orders of Magnitude talks about the Elder Wand a fair amount. It is powerful but specialized there. In Significant Digits it's maybe less powerful, but less specialized.

  New calculations were made, scenarios simulated, probabilities weighed. This child was seeking to incapacitate, to plunder her mind for secrets, rather than to kill. Nell had charged, wand raised, already casting. Baba Yaga sneered, raising her own hands, and lighting surged between them.

  The Elder Wand took it from the air.

  The song of the Wand was a hymn of worship in reverent supplication to the holy purity of battle, purging the wrongs from the world and extracting the rights by force, if necessary. It led her to that one singular goal: close the distance.

  The battle was a storm without wind. Nell would have been dismantled in an instant, if not for the protection of the Elder Wand, augmented by the knowledge provided by the Spirit Stone. An important lesson of Battle Magic was that even the greatest artifact can be defeated by a counter-artifact that is lesser, but specialized. And indeed, that was the purpose of the Deathly Hallows, specialized tools designed to neutralize, overpower, and overcome the anchors of the Old Gods, those last remaining representatives of Death that needed to be cleansed from this world in order for it to be saved.

** Canon is not very clear about the effects of the Elder Wand. According to the legend, it is supposed to make a wizard stronger (since the 1st brother boasted that he killed his enemy thanks to the wand), but we don't know "how" the wand make a wizard stronger or by "how much". All we know is that thanks to the wand, Harry managed to repair his Holly wand with a simple Reparo Charm, even though Ollivander himself had said that nothing more could be done to repair it.

Also, despite Grinderwald possessing the Elder Wand, he was defeated by Albus Dumbledore during a duel in 1945, which made Dumbledore the new master of the wand. So at the very least, we know that the wand does not assure victory but only raise your chances.

** The Elder Wand changes hands by it's wielder being defeated, so no. The one with the wand does not always win.

I see it as a booster, maybe in D&D terms spells act as +2 levels higher or something like that. Noticeable, but not an 'I Win' button if some 6th year gets lucky and disarms it's owner. Let's get real, if Voldemort knew that had happened, Narcissa would be scraping Draco off the walls. Elder Wand or no.

I saw one fic (I think it was Stepping Back) where the Elder Wand was straight up a 'weapon' and boosted combat spells, but was kinda lackluster as a 'tool', Harry continues to use his holly wand for general use.

I also kinda like the idea that ancient, powerful magical artifacts begin to develop a bit of a personality. Maybe the Sword of Gryffindor wasn't enchanted to appear to courageous students in need, maybe it decided to do that all on it's own. Perhaps the Goblet saw right through Crouch's cunfundus charm, but figured Harry was Champion material anyway so it just went with it. Maybe after Harry snaps the Elder Wand it just starts popping up, whole, whenever Harry needs a wand. Think, Mercy Thompson's Walking Stick.

** I think that it basically makes it to where magic is the literal best you could ever do and removes some of the arbitraritenesss of magic, like you on liquid luck levels of performance and no BS needing the right amount of concentration/power/intent. This however does nothing to make tactics/spell-usage good so in the hands of transfiguration users a master would see no real benefit unless they were inebriated or otherwise debilitated. It removes the magical power level of someone being a factor which we see be relevant in cases of spell connection, which uses that and intent/concentration as the deciding factors. Outside of that I don't think it would really be a huge benefit still considering how often some of those duels can get the ability to basically make it to where someone has to fight you a specific way or they lose is something nice but it doesn't make the user suddenly able to go toe to toe with Voldemort or something. Its a boost in ability I guess but only if the user applies it correctly, its a real benefit in that it makes life simpler for its user but with that comes a temptation which has gotten quite a number of its wielders killed over the years.

I think that its a really useful tool but someone on Dumbledore's level really doesn't see any difference between it and their first wand. Someone who was on their xth wand at his level might love how great it is as there is supposed to be no match quite like their first I believe. A neat thing about my interpretation is that if you were to have a squib kill someone who was the master of the wand, then they could preform magic as it doesn't take amount into consideration.

** Gellert lost to Dumbledore with the wand, and Albus himself said they were near equals, so it's hard to say.
