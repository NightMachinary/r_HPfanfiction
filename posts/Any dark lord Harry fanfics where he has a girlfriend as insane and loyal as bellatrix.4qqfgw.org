It doesn't matter to me who the girl is, as long Harry is on the evil slide.


** linkffn(Adorable Violence)

Less Dark!Harry than you requested, but the best Bellatrix counterpart I've seen. Also amusing.

*** Ughh, can't get past the first chapter. Smirking, Slytherin God Harry with all the girls dropping their panties for him. The worst parts of the neglected Harry trope also with a James who thinks Harry is a fucking retard and poor, annoying Lily who just wants to reconcile. IMO, not even good enough writing to be a guilty pleasure.

**** First off.. thanks for the spoiler... /s

Secondly, I had not read it, as I clearly stated. As such I could just link it as an option, based upon the description, and the fact it was once linked by someone for me as a "dark harry with a dark G/F".

And finally, your not even the OP, and as such, may have different tastes. Why even reply?

****** Alright. But again... what you might see as flaws, others might not. Ive read plenty of things others have trashed but I have enjoyed, and things that others enjoyed, that I hated. It happens.

But also, if you want to give opinions thats fine, but since I said I had "not read it", you should of at least put a spoiler tag or notice in your reply.

** I made a thread like this a few months ago, but the only thing which came up was a Tom Riddle/OC fic called linkffn(Tom Riddle and Belinda Corbin the Dark couple)

This isn't even in Harry's timeline, but still quite a good DarkLord/Lady fic.
