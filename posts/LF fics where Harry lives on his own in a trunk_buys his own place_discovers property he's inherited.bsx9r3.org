As the title suggest, I'm looking for fics where Harry goes off to live on his own. This could be a magical trunk, he discovers some castle he's inherited, lives in the RoR during summer breaks, buys his own apartment, lives at the Leaky -- anything like that.


** Linkffn(The Best Revenge)

Harry/Snape mentorship fic. With Snape and McGonagall's help, he expands his room in the Dursley's house to be a place he can live in, without having to deal with their crap. I never got around to finishing it, but it seems like it's focused more on his first year than anything.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** And then Harry moves to a cottage some elderly witch willed to him, with a pond and cute pygmy goats.

BTW, I never understood why this is the only fic that deals with the Dursleys problem that way, it always seemed like the obvious solution to me. If Harry cannot be moved from Privet Drive, surely his living conditions can be magically improved.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

It doesn't happen until later down the line, but Harry starts to live in a magical trunk, but still attends Hogwarts. There's a running joke where people he knows advises him against doing so, because they've known people who died that way due to the trunk collapsing.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
