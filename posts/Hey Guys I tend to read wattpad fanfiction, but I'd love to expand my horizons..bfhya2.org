Agree there, I have only read 2 amazing fics... others not so much. In all honesty I use Wattpad for actual fiction.

** These two are better than the books:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

Is a series, they are on book 4 now, but Harry's not in Hogwarts on the first one.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1746629/chapters/3731000]]

Also a series, book 5 has been completed and it has a one-shot prequel ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1577144]]), I recommend reading it after chapter 4, though.

Both are super well-written and when the plot deviates from the books, it only gets better.

Happy reading!

** You're going to have to be more specific. You want romance? Adventure? Comedy? Angst? Which are your favorite characters?

You'll either love or hate this one:

Or I could tell you to go read all of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheLoud/works][my stories]] . They're mostly about people being snarky while their lives are falling apart.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
