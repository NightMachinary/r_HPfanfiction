  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Just gonna drop this here.

*Philosopher's Stone:*

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\
"So-after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating-"\\
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.\\
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul-"\\
"Jordan, I'm warning you-"\\
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure..."

"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. "When they hear what you did this year?"\\
"Proud?" said Harry. "Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious..."

*- Chamber of Secrets:*

Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, "Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through..."

Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead. "Harry -- I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!" And she sprinted away, up the stairs.\\
"What does she understand?" said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\\
"Loads more than I do." said Ron, shaking his head.\\
"But why's she got to go to the library?"\\
"Because that's what Hermione does," said Ron, shrugging. "When in doubt, go to the library."

*- Prisoner of Azkaban:*

As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map. "Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."\\
Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.\\
"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git."\\
It would have been funny if the situation hadn't been so serious. And there was more...\\
"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor."\\
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had its last word.\\
"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball."

"Well...when we were in our first year, Harry-young, carefree, and innocent-"\\
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent.

Trelawney: "Would anyone like me to help interpret the shadowy realms within their orb?"\\
Ron: "I don't need help, it's obvious what this means: there's going to be loads of fog tonight."

*- Goblet of Fire:*

"OH NO YOU DON'T, LADDIE!"\\
Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret.\\
"I want to fix that in my memory forever," said Ron, his closed and an uplifted expression on his face. "Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret..."

"Enjoying it?" said Ron darkly. "I don't reckon he'd come home if Dad didn't make him. He's obsessed. Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss. 'According to Mr. Crouch...as I was saying to Mr. Crouch...Mr. Crouch is of the opinion...Mr. Crouch was telling me...' They'll be announcing their engagement any day now."

Ron: "Who're you going with then?"\\
Fred: "Angelina."\\
Ron: "What? You've already asked her?"\\
Fred: "Good point. Oi, Angelina! Want to come to the ball with me?"

*- Order of the Phoenix*

"Who's Kreacher?"\\
"The house-elf who lives here," said Ron. "Nutter. Never met one like him."\\
"He is /not/ a nutter," said Hermione.\\
"His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque like his mother," said Ron. "Is that normal, Hermione?"

"Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge's speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?"\\
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah...she said...progress will be prohibited or...well, it meant that...that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts."\\
"Well, I'm glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate."

Dudley: "Mark Evans cheeked me."\\
Harry: "Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true."

Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione's.\\
"I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"\\
"What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.

"Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice.\\
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\\
"Listening to the news! /Again?/"\\
"Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.

"Excellent." said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. "We've got about a minute, I think. We should get out into the garden so we're ready. Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry -"\\
"They won't," said Harry.\\
"That you're safe -"\\
"That'll just depress them."\\
"- and you'll see them next summer."\\
"Do I have to?"

*- Half-Blood Prince:*

"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?"\\
"Yes," said Harry stiffly.\\
"Yes, /sir/."\\
"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor."

"And that's Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle," said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. "He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he's playing them - oh, look, he's lost the Quaffle. Ginny took it from him. I do like her, she's very nice..."

Talking about Inferi in DADA... "When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if it's solid, aren't we? We're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'"

*- Deathly Hallows:*

“I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house.”\\
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”\\
“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you're going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and---“\\
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”

"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn't hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and ‘Cinderella'---“\\
“What's that, an illness?” asked Ron

Now as an adult, after rereading it, I am amazed at the fact that Malfoy wasn't seriously injured or even killed. Ferrets have horribly fragile backs and Moody was bouncing him up and down the halls. And it's even mentioned that Malfoy was in pain afterwards.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** For me, it's an entire paragraph:

"So the first thing you need to learn about Egypt is that basically everything is cursed. You see that bit of pottery? Cursed. Those empty tombs? Cursed. That camel? Definitely cursed. Also, the locals are all barmy, and will literally try to sell you sand. Don't buy it, it's probably cursed."

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** So, i think there might still be one or two that are from Hero Academia, Teen Wolf or OC California, but they aren't recognizable as such, so...

Also, the one with Clark/Superman is actually a HP story.

(*****

"With great power comes great mental instability."

(*****

“... Are all serial killers closet fashion experts?“

(*****

"We drag Clark back to Asgard, have our way with him using his altered time and then get back so someone else can ravish him." Kyla explained with all the seduction and romance of a computer manual.

(*****

Then he whipped his hand back, impaling another demon with the still beating heart of the demon that he just killed. Physics wise, he wasn't sure how that worked but magic wise, it made perfect sense, and as people knew, physics was the bitch of any kind of magic.

(*****

Of course, the difference between fiction and reality was that fiction had to make sense.

(*****

Huh, was he leaking quantum mechanics? Cool.

(*****

And really now, what parents would? 'Now honey, your father and I discussed it and since you just killed someone, we'd feel a lot better if we hung around you, at least until our own problems overshadow yours again.' I am very, very, meticulously, very careful, about not saying any of that out loud.

(*****

Finally he started to look more calm and less like a wild deer thrown on stage and commanded to sing opera at gunpoint... that simile may have gotten away from her.

(*****

“Makeup's for when you want to look pretty,” Uraraka had said. “Contouring's for when you want to commit a murder and throw off the police sketches.”

(*****

Snape eyed him like he was some strange species of dog, who had one day decided he was done with the status quo, and so started walking on two legs, wearing clothes and got a job as an accountant. He had a very expressive face.

(*****

Hermione turned slightly green at the thought of watching a bunch of goblins hacking people apart with all the barbaric weapons they'd just grabbed, but she was more afraid of missing any part of what was going on than she was about seeing bloodshed.
