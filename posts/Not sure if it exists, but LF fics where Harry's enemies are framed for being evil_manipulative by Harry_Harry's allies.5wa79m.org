Either Harry knowingly lies and makes everyone think Dumbledore is setting him up to die, or makes everyone think Molly Weasley is emptying his vault. I've never seen it before and I'm curious if it's been done.

Bashing, slash, dark!Harry and crossovers are fine. Please no harems, mpreg, pottercest, genderbending or romance/smut-driven plot.


** It might not be exactly what you are looking for, but in two of my stories Dumbledore sets up false-flag operations to frame the Death Eaters in order to erode their support among purebloods.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
