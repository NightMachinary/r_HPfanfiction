**** Good crazy, in my opinion, but it's not everyone's cup of tea.

It's a really polarising story because the author has some good ideas and is decent writer but has a fascination with sex. I don't find the sex obtrusive and I think he works it into the story decently but some people just want to get on with the story.

I've been reading the author for years though, well before he got into Harry Potter stories, so I'm a bit biased.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Not an orphanage but Gabriel was a good story though unfinished. There was one story about Harry being picked up by Malfoy and Bellatrix and taken in as Voldemort's son that I found intriguing but I'm blanking on the story name. I think the story is Shadowed Malice but I could be wrong.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
