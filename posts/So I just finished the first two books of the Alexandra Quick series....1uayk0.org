I've seen this series recommended here and elsewhere multiple times, and figured I'd give it a try. I just finished the second one, and there are certainly many things that are great about the stories, most importantly the writing and storytelling abilities of the author.

The reason I'm hesitating starting the third, though, is that I'm having a hard time actually /liking/ the main character, Alexandra. I get that she's a preteen/teenager in these stories, and we're all obnoxious at that age. I'm just having a hard time getting on her side, and it may be a flaw of mine as a reader, but it's hard for me to get into a story if I can't root for the character. It's not that I actively /dislike/ Alexandra or want her to fail or suffer. I just can't muster up much positive emotion.

Does she get better? Should I keep reading, or do her character flaws never improve as she ages and (hopefully) matures?


** Its funny, that's how i felt reading hp. Could not stand Harry for the majority of the books. The way I feel is that for a story to work it /has/ to be the right protagonist (traits, nature, past etc) to carry you through it and they feel and act like real people. Harry works in Harry Potter, and Alexandra works for Alexandra Quick. In my case I liked Harry in the first three, and disliked the person he grew into later. For Alexandra (for now) its the opposite. I think as the story progresses (and if you reread it) she shows herself to be a very vulnerable and resilient person shelled in stubbornness. The story starts with her best-friend (only friend) abandoning her when he finds out shes a witch (and her life doesn't get better from there).

But to answer your question, she does improve significantly in the 3rd but not until about 2/3 of the way through. The ending of which i felt was particularly good.

** She's a well rounded character. Powerful, smart, steadfast and resourceful. Now imagine a character like that, but without the character flaws that you have a problem with. See the problem? Inverarity really went out of his way to make a strong, independent protagonist without creating just another Mary-Sue.

Besides, if you keep reading, you'd find out that there are /reasons/ Alex is the way she is...
