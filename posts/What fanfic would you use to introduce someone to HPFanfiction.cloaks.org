Basicially, what is your favorite fanfiction that isn't over the top. /(I'm lookin' at you Drapple)/

A Fic that you would put on the front cover of this subreddit and say, "yeah, we've peaked at that fic right there"

No discriminating, give us your cliched BWL, Super, Dark, Harem'd, edge-lord Harry, as long as you genuinely think it's good. /Unironically./


** Linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday) is a great, hilarious canon-compliant fic. It's fun, novel length, complete, and an easy read. So the perfect starter fic.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** I would have to pick A Black Comedy, or On the Way to Greatness, for very different reasons.

ABC is perfect for a reader who is a blank slate, isn't jaded after X years of reading HP stuff. It's over the top and cringy at some times, but it's still a silly adventure story with plot progression with a different look at magic than canon. It's the kind of story that opens your mind to see what you can do within the HP universe and still have it feel like an HP story.

OTWTG is the kind of story that you can slowly feel the momentum building, with each chapter building on the previous and working towards something /big/. It explores facets of canon that are quintessential what if questions, and it answers them fairly well. It's also very well written, which is often the killer when it comes to first fic recs.

** If the person plays any form of DnD, Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is a perfect fit. I've used it to success 3 times. It has all the main cast there and fairly in character, it tells a story that can really only be told well with fanfiction, and it is well written. Fanfiction is a unique genre that allows a lot of different stories to be told that can't be told in standard fiction mediums, and natural 20 is a good example of that. Without having a background in Harry Potter, the DnD character would be in a whole new magic world that would have to be explained to the reader, and the original world would also have to be explained. This would be a ton of description and explanation that would prove to become excessive, which is why hybrid fiction like this isn't super common. It's extremely prevalent in fanfiction though, due to the need for constant explanation going down.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]]

If they don't like DnD, I'd ask what other media they like, and recommend a crossover fic that's appropriate. Examples would be:

Firefly:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]]

Lord of the Rings:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/]]

linkffn(11115934; 2857962; 8096183; 12125300)

I'd also recommend a humorous fic if I knew their humor style. Or a good drama if I know they like romance. Frankly, introducing someone to fanfiction requires an approach based on the individual. So picking one would be super hard. But if I had to, I'd probably pick something like Black Luminary, to give an example of how different you can get with fanfiction, while still feeling like the same universe.

  "I don't like it any more than you. But this one got sent to a Member of Wizengamot, and it's suddenly my problem."

Two Weeks in the Alley by BajaB - a joyful romp, also complete.

Resistance by Lorien829 - Dark fic, Harmony without bashing Weasleys (though they all suffer), complete story with an excellent high-tension climax, since by then you're really not sure if any particular character will survive.

*** Cauterize is the correct answer. It's better written than canon, has nothing AU about it to confuse readers, and hits you right in the emotions.

But, most important of all, it's /short/. I think most of us forget how bad of a reputation fanfiction has and we're willing to sift through the bad parts of a fic to find the good bits. A new reader isn't going to be willing to do that, they'll see shitty editing, a story that takes 10 chapters to get going, or flat characters and nope out of fanfiction all together. I've never seen anyone on this sub criticize Cauterize (please do so below if you have valid criticism, I'd love to hear it), so it's always what I recommend to new readers first. If they like it, then I've laid the groundwork for suggesting more AU fanfics. If they don't like it or can't get through it (?), they won't enjoy any other fics, imo

**** Cauterize is a pet peeve of mine. Not because the fic itself is bad - it's perfectly serviceable - but because I consider it vastly overrated. It's the perfect example of what I think of as "Livejournal fics" (these days, AO3 fics), which possess the following traits:

- Limited word count.

- Highly stylised prose.

- Introspective focus which does not pay much attention to establishing setting.

- "Snapshot" narrative which dips in and out of scenes over time without fully developing any given scene.

- No real plot.

These fics represent fanfic on easy mode. Their limited ambition is what makes them appear artistic: you could never tell a complete story in such a manner, which essentially glosses over the hard work of character, world and plot development.

But that limited ambition is exactly why I think they are overrated. They are not fully realised stories. They are like trailers for stories. Now, trailers can be very well crafted. Some trailers are actually a lot better than the movies they advertise. But nonetheless it's not a complete work.

Ultimately, these fics don't take anywhere near the same level of craft as it takes to tell a novel-length story, nor do they provide the reader with that sense of satisfaction from having read a narratively complete tale. There's nothing to dig your teeth into. It's all just superficial - atmosphere and tone without substance.

***** Just wondering, do you feel that way about reading a poem? Because a lot of what you described could fit about poetry as well.

I think short fics, like poems, have their own place and aren't overrated at all. Of course there are a lot of bad short fic just like there are bad long fic but ultimately both are trying to accomplish different things.

Condensing a lot into a little also takes skill, and I'd argue that short prose gives the reader the freedom to imagine and fill in the world themselves rather than being dictated exactly what they should expect, which is its own merit.

***** I can totally see this perspective for a fanfiction writer - I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to put hours upon hours into your story only to see it ignored in favor of vignettes someone knocked out in a couple days. However, as a reader, I don't need my fanfiction to be entirely standalone - the established universe, characters, plot, etc are WHY I'm reading fanfiction, so if an author just wants to dance in and around canon scenes and provide a new perspective to it, I'm all for it (if it's well written and doesn't just repeat canon). I'm not necessarily here for a standalone story in the universe, I just want an experience featuring the universe/characters/etc, even if it's disjoint and doesn't have a story arc :/

I think of it as the difference between Captain America: Civil War and There Will Be Blood. TWBB is undeniably the better story, but way more people have seen and are willing to watch Civil War, because even though it's not high art, it's really damn good at what it does and it has a lower barrier to entry.

Edit: Drarry, practically book length, where Harry is married to Ginny and gets a glimpse of an alternate timeline where he made different choices. It forces him to re-evaluate pretty much his whole life. Amazingly written, excellent characterization, and one of the best fanfics I've seen for showing the characters as actual adults.

*** Yuuup. Kmbell92 was actually my introduction to the world of HP fanfiction. Grammer issues occasionally, a bit tropey, and I sometimes feel like her stories exist in a kinder universe, but they're also really quite clever and addicting. I've never seen her fics talked about on this Reddit before (probably because they're posted on Wattpad and, like I said, kinder than I think this reddit's users generally look for) but I really am glad they were my introduction to this community.

Tightly Knit is a pretty good introduction because it starts simple but you'll fall in love with the characters and get swept into the massive universe she's created.

And THAT TWIST in The Haunting of Judith Wagner!! Soooo good.

** If your friend likes a continuation of stuff in canon such as the Harry and Ginny pairing and if they wanted to see how the war survivors' relationships would grow and how they would raise their kids, I'd recommend Northumbrian's stories, starting with this one-shot:

linkffn(Now and Forever by Northumbrian)

And this series of drabbles:

linkffn(Centuries by Northumbrian)

And then if they found those to their liking, they could go on to read the other one shots before reading Northumbrian's multi-chaptered stories.

Northumbrian has always tried to stick to canon as much as possible even with JK Rowling making post-Book 7 changes. "Cursed Child" seems to have ruined the continuity but if your friend hasn't read or watched that, they would appreciate the internal consistency running through the stories. Here's his bio on FFN.net which tries to list down his stories in chronological order:

  The centenary of the Battle of Hogwarts is less than a year away, and the Wizarding world continues to move forward.

** Most of these have already been mentioned but depending on what I think they would like, any of these would be pretty good first fics, depending on the person.

Alexandra Quick series, or maybe Hogwarts Houses Divided if I think they would want a non canon story or a post canon story.

Either of White Squirrel's fics would be decent intro fics. They are both decent examples of canon divergence fics that still stick fairly close to canon plot, and have a similar tone to canon imo, where even when bad stuff is happening they aren't overly grimdark, edgy, or serious, like fanfics sometimes are.

The Boy Who Lived by Santi, simply because it is amazing, and would show them the harsh reality that lots of really good fics never get finished.

If I think they would like a Slytherin fic, then either On The Way To Greatness or Applied Cultural Anthology

If I think they would like time travel then either Nightmares of Future Past, yes it's cliched now, but it wasn't back in the day, and if it's their first fic they won't notice, or Backwards With Purpose

If I think they would like humor then A Black Comedy or Seventh Horcrux, or Maybe A Handbook on House Elf Psychology. The author of that last one has another good fic, Magical Relations, which isn't a humor fic, but could also be a good first fic.

The first fic I read was HPMOR. Yes it has issues that I see now, but it was very entertaining, and for some readers might be a good choice, though it also appeals to some people that would never read other hp fanfic, so maybe not.

If they like DnD then Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

There are maybe sort of out there for a first fic, but if I think they would like a fem!Harry, maybe Lilly and The Art Of Being Sisyphus or The Pureblood Pretense could work.

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff would also actually probably be a decent choice

Harry Potter et al and the Keystone Council would as well if they find the premise intriguing.

Either that or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** Linkffn(Dear Order) is a hilarious, light hearted story which I absolutely love.

Linkffn(Oh God Not Again!) is also great.

The first long fanfiction I read and enjoyed was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time by Vance McGill) but I'm not sure I'd enjoy it nowadays. Coming straight off of canon it was nice though. Really long.

My favourite from early on was linkffn(A Champion's New Hope). It was the first one I ever re read and I've read it three times now. It's really good, and a believable powerful Harry.

Honourable Mentions: linkffn(Earl of the North; Help of a Seer; Harry Potter and the Worth of the Soul).

Finally, if the person wants a completely different take on the Harry Potter universe, the AU of linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy) and its sequels is amazing.

** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) f they're into dark humor (which my whole circle of friends is).

While it is crack, it also has a pretty good plot. I personally couldn't stop reading it and was always waiting for the next tearful laugh. 230k may seem like much to a newcomer, but it won't be. They'll be anxious to read the next chapter.

This fic has multiple tropes such as: WBWL, AU, OP Harry, Political Harry (although he rarely tales that job seriously), and Sirius Lives.

It has a bunch of running jokes, which I will not mention, as it willl ruin the initial hilarity and sense of surprise. Some of these running jokes are my favorite parts of the fic.

If this sounds interesting to you, give it a read. If you've already read it... Give it a re-read!

** Just a question for the community. Prior to having smartphones, did you guys just read on the computer? Did you print pages out? Do you still do that, or do you prefer reading on a tablet/phone?

I've always been a little curious about fanfic but the reading experience has never been like reading a book and I immerse myself differently. Idk if I'm the only one or if this is common.

Then I got a Nook one year, and started using that as well. But I still used my laptop a lot too. It was actually only a few years ago I started using my phone. It just seemed to small too read on at first lol. But now it's all I use

** Hmmm.... let's see. I'm relatively new to the scene, but I really like:

The Contract, by stellastark on Archive of Our Own (fucked up as hell. Sevmione and Lumione).

Father Mine, by Emmaficready on Archive of Our Own (Serious Ron-bashing in this one. Lots of trigger warnings too. Sevmione.)

An Innocent Obsession by Elle_Morgan_Black on Archive of Our Own (A little OOC, and a little messed up due to age difference and a few other factors, but otherwise, not as bad as the first 2)

All of these are weird as shit, and I genuinely don't know how the fuck I got into them, but I really enjoyed them. If you have a thing for fucked up shit and stories about trauma, I'm your guy.
