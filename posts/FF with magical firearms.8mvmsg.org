Looking for inspiration on a story and wanted to incorporate a firearms that shoot out magic spells. Any stories out there? Preferably would like Harry being the one using them but all ff is welcome. (As I am writing this, the scene from the Matrix comes to mind when Neo enters the lobby fully stocked but instead insert Harry coming into the corrupt Ministry of Magic). Thanks!


** I muse on magical firearms as an alternative to wands now and then.

What I keep coming back to is that they have the big downside of not having the versatility of a wand; no transfiguration, no charms, just enchanted bullets or possibly some lasers.

But on the plus side, they don't require magic words, concentration or focus, or any major gestures; just point and fire. Which means they could be used in conjunction with a wand, or used by beings untrained with wands.

So, imagine if you would, Harry walks into the Death-Eater-controlled Ministry, his wand in his right hand, a laser-pistol of sorts in his left, and a couple more varying weapons on his belt.

When the fight starts, he evades to the side, raising an earthen barrier with a wave of his wand; with his other hand, he fires a volley of piercing hexes at oncoming foes, with a magic cape displacing his image and making him harder to target.

Bell-like chimes ring out, the hexes being reflected by Shield Charms, while returning Blasting Charms chip away at his earthen barrier. Outnumbered, Harry stows his piercing-hex-gun and pulls out a handful of statuettes from his pouch, tossing them with a brief command 'fly'; the statuettes instantly turn into a gang of giant birds, ordinarily time-consuming and distracting to summon with a wand, and swoop down on his foes to draw their attention.

With a crash, Harry's barrier is finally blown apart, but he's already raising his wand again; casting a powerful shine charm, he shields his eyes as a massive sphere of light blinds his foes and blocks their view of him. Ducking down and scuttling for cover amidst a volley of blindly thrown spells, he pulls his next trick out of his belt, magma grenades, and tosses them.

Within seconds, half of the floor of the Atrium has been transfigured into red-hot lava, ensnaring and painfully burning the Death Eaters there; several of them manage to reverse the transfigured floor around them, but several more are rammed and knocked over by the surviving birds, being horribly scorched by the lava, and throughout it all everyone has lost track of Harry Potter, who has re-drawn his piercing-hex gun and is silently sniping at those still-standing Death Eaters whilst they're distracted by burns, birds and blinding light...

*** Great writeup! I imagine a major advantage a wand-gun would have in combat is fire rate; even if it can only shoot /Stupefys/, it could likely do so at a speed much higher than one could say/think the spell and do the accompanying wand motion. Imagine a wand-machine gun...

*** I like it. What if said firearm was from Judge Dredd? Can you imagine Harry with the red X helmet?

Harry going through his rounds, taking shelter while bogged down by Death Eaters:

"Expelliarmus!" (Empty)

"Stupefy!" (Empty)

"Petrificus Totalus!" (Empty)

"Incarcerous!" (Empty)

He sighs then tries one more.

"Reducto?" (Fully loaded)

Harry goes on a spree.

Haha. Possibilities are endless.

** The linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) series has such an idea, but it is in the second book though.

Personally, I feel a wizard has much more utility with a wand, or their own magic, so wizarding firearms, as it is, would not be quite useful.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

*** so you think but imagine someone with some sort of automatic riffle with a 500 round drum of enchanted bullets charmed to reduce weight until impact and explode maybe even some sort of runed shrinking charm that releases on impact and is loaded with 500 kg worth of TNT in an explosive of your choice how long do you think a wizard could hold up to non stop explosions on their shield probably 100 times faster than usual casting no need for superiority when you have overwhelming firepower just keep a wand in hand and apparate around with gun of doom

**** Well, sure, if you want to kill stuff, it'd work pretty amazingly, but wizards would be used to the sheer 'I can do anything with a wand' to spend the time it'd take to create one. It's just the difference in the mindset of muggles and wizards, where wizards don't have the drive of necessity, as they have an easier way to do things, if not as good a way.

If you talk about some fic more muggle based, I think it'd be plausible, and I think it's been done well in some fics by DobbyElfLord, so maybe check it out.

Also, I have no idea why, but I'm thinking of linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle). Did it have such a concept?

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** If you want inspiration on how it could be done:

Casters:

Magazine in the gun handle is the spell rod.

Bullets are all the same, a cheap material with a simplified runic inscription that links a target to the gun.

When a link is made the effect of the spell rod is applied to the target.

Lobbers:

Basically airsoft guns with potions in the balls.

Blink Guns:

Teleports the projectile forward in time. Mostly an assassination tool.

Painters:

Puts a temporary runic tattoo on the target. Mostly a police weapon to paint magic blocking runes and tracking runes on targets.
