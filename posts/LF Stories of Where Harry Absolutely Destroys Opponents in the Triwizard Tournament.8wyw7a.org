First Task

#+begin_quote
  I stormed towards the castle, Hermione and Ron at my heels like proper minions. "This is so unfair. How could I possibly have the worst score? I'm the only one who killed his dragon!"
#+end_quote

--------------

Second Task:

#+begin_quote
  "While that does explain Mr. Krum's unfortunate injury and your decision to take all three hostages -- destroying a merperson relic in the process -- I'm afraid I still don't understand what you did afterwards," Dumbledore said, looking very tired.

  This was a small improvement over the rest of the judges, who appeared livid.

  "It was a perfectly logical decision," I insisted. "The mermen were using their environmental advantage against me. So I took it from them."

  "You banished all the water in the lake. You truly don't consider that excessive?" Dumbledore asked.

Third Task:

#+begin_quote
  After a few more minor skirmishes with the wildlife, I found it. The Triwizard Cup gleamed in the center of the maze. I took a moment to straighten my robes and smooth down my hair so that I would look properly impressive when I emerged victoriously outside of Hogwarts. After a moment's thought, I rumpled my clothes and tousled my hair again. That way I would look more heroic.

Finally:

#+begin_quote
  We bowed, raised our wands, and began. "Avada Kedavra!"

  The following fight can best be described as very green. Avada Kedavras flew wildly through the air. His were weaker than mine as he was still cheerful after gaining a new body while I was carrying a grudge over his sabotaging my time in the tournament.

  We effortlessly dodged each other's spells. But they found targets easily enough.

  One by one, Death Eaters fell. A few realized what was going on. Lucius, for instance, was using Crabbe as a human shield. Yet their numbers kept thinning.

  Voldemort's spells took out more of his people than mine did, which was surprising because I was actually aiming.

  Eventually, I maneuvered myself close to a wide gap in the ring of my former and apparently current followers. With one last Avada Kedavra in Voldemort's direction, I sprinted away, headed towards the graveyard's gates.

  However, I took a small detour to grab the Cup because it was mine. As I snatched its handle, something tugged at my navel and the world began to spin, eventually solidifying into the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.

  Greeted by the surprised faces of my teachers and classmates, I knew immediately that I had to tell them. After all, I knew something incredibly important, something that mattered. I could not allow them to wallow in ignorance for a moment longer.

  I held my trophy aloft and shouted, "I declare victory!‚Äù

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
