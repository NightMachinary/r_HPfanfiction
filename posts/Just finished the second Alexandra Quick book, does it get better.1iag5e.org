I was recommended the series by a bunch of people so I figured it was going to be pretty good and I jumped right into reading it. I enjoyed the first book although the only character I ended up liking was Mr. Journey but after finishing the second book I'm not sure if I should keep reading. The whole lands below thing was just completely uninteresting to me and I now strongly dislike most of the characters including Alexandra.

So before I decide whether to continue the series or find something else to read I wanted to know if the story changes direction at all. Do the lands below continue to be a major theme and was the second book a bad fluke or am I just reading the wrong story?

Thanks for your help.


** The Lands Below and the creatures in them do continue to play a big role (more in the third book than in the fourth book, if I'm remembering correctly; it's been a little while since I've read them). Alexandra gets to be less of an annoying character, although she's still not exactly someone I'd want to spend time with in real life - but she starts to grow up. Most of the other characters, I'd say, develop/change less than Alexandra, so if you don't like them now I wouldn't expect that to change in most cases.

It sounds like, from your description, you might just be reading the wrong story. I wasn't a huge fan of the lands below either, FWIW (I prefer more canon-like things rather than these entirely new worlds) but I still enjoyed the series, but that may have been because I liked the characters and the other world-building, which it sounds like you may not be as into as I was.

** I think if you don't like it at that point it doesn't change enough for your opinion to chnge

** I didn't love the first book, but I really got into the second. If you didn't like the second, I don't know if you'd like the others. But in my opinion, each book is better than the last (I'm halfway through Stars Above.)

*** First book was merely good imo, second book was probably the best. That said I love the series, and book 5 looks like it is going to be very different.
