Not quite sure how to explain it without examples.

​

When I read Blindness, I really liked all the crazy bits about the Veil and the Hallows and where they come from or what they're doing. It's like a grand ancient mystery that they are trying to solve. Unfortunately, it sort of trails off and falls short in Blindness.

​

Another good example would be like in Brandon Sanderson's Elantris or Mistborn. Where the characters are kind of dealing with ancient or devastating events, learning more as they go.

​

I know there are quite a few mystery fanfics, but most of the ones I've found in that category are either auror crime stories or straight up dramas with mystery as a main plot device. Can anyone suggest something similar to what I'm looking for?


** Hey, I just finished Blindess as well. It was a ride that I wasnt prepared for. Totally out of this world. And now I am sad because I dont think I will be able to find a story about the Hallows so well written. Have you had any luck in finding such fanfics? If yes, can you please mention them here or PM me. I'll forever be grateful. :)
