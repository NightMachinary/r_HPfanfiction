I'm looking for Harry Potter fanfics that read like continuations of Harry Potter. Or fics that fill time missing from the books, like what Dumbledore's Army under Neville, Luna and Ginny experienced during DH. (I know there's /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/, and I have heard it is very good, but it seems a little too dark for me.)

This could be anything from direct war aftermath fics like what HalfASlug writes, rebuilding the wizarding world and reforming the ministry, or a new threat (a believable one, please!) ten years down the road, or a fic about one or several of the next generation kids going to Hogwarts.

It should feel as close to canon as possible. I know we don't really know a lot about the children of Harry & Co., but at least the adults should be in character here. I also like my pairings canon, so Harry X Ginny and Ron X Hermione, please.

My favourite characters apart from the trio are Luna (who almost no fanfic writer seems to get right) and Neville - not necessarily as a couple, although I wouldn't mind to see them dating prior to Luna X Rolf and Neville X Hannah. It can just be one of them in the fic, or a friendship story.

Stories about the lives of Lily and the Marauders would be interesting as well, if they're well-written and fit with the books.

I have read the first of Lippert's James Potter "books" and hated it. I'm sorry if you liked it, this is completely based on taste, but to give you an idea what I'm not looking for: I hated it because I felt like the author did not do his research properly, gratuiously changed canon details, had characters like McGonagall out of character and shoved American Stus down our throats with no real purpose to the story. Plus, the villains annoyed me.

I also read the first volume in the Albus Potter series by Vekin87 and was disappointed by the writing and weak story. (Sorry again if you like that story!)

I am also super picky about grammar etc. because I do not want to pick up bad English from a story (I'm not a native speaker.)

On my reading list are Cursed by Myth and Legend, Harry Potter and the Next Great Battle by pokecharm, Harry Potter and the Return to Hogwarts by VanceMcGill, Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity and Rebuilding Life by Kezzabear. Have you read any of these, did you like them and do you know similar stories?

Thanks in advance!

She has her own 'verse which encompasses all of her 23 stories. The First Day (set right after DH) is finished, but the rest hasn't been updated in over a year. Questions and Answers (the last fic chronologically, set in James/Albus/Lily's time) was updated pretty recently though, and there is 3 or 4 more chapters than there was when I read it a year ago

*** I think you misunderstood me. I wasn't too lazy to google these stories myself. They are on my reading list, which means I know that they exist and also where to find them.

I was looking for either similar stories or for your opinions on them.
