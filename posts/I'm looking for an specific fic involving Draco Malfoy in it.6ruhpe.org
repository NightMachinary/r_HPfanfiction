Is there a fanfiction where Draco join Harry and his friends when they escaped with Dobby from the Malfoy manor or any fic were Draco joins the Order of the Phoenix and he is "present" as in "useful" in the story leading into the final war. I don't care about pairings involving the fic. Thanks for reading, and please let me know below!


** There's a bunch like this with a Drarry pairing and Dramione pairing.

** Mostly Canon Wartime Drarry**

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/41961][Paradox Series]] - Draco travels back in time and switches sides.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2088468/chapters/4545474][For the Sake of Grades]] - not one of my favorites, but the main plot is 6th Year Draco turning on his family and joining the Order.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2752127/chapters/6169592][Consequences of Redemption]] - iirc this is pretty much exactly what you requested - Draco rescues Harry from the manor and joins the light side. However I thought it was rushed and not that well written.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594][Temptation on the Warfront]] - the classic Drarry horcrux hunt fic. Very well done and one that's most commonly recommended for this prompt.

*Really AU Drarry*

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/28580][A Thousand Beautiful Things series]] - 5th year Draco trains with Snape to spy for the Order. I think this was written pre-DH, so it's canon divergent but really well done.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/external_works/187426][Secrets]] - This is a famous fanfic AU for the 7th year and the search for horcruxes. It's very AU but the plotting is well done. A Fan Favorite to be sure but I didn't think the writing was that great.

*Draco/Hermione fics*

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] - a Draco/Hermione set during 7th year where Draco is at first neutral but then joins the light side.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] - a wartime Draco/Hermione AU that's really gritty and depressing. Great writing though.
