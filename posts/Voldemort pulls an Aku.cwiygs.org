Are there any fics where voldemort for one reason or another (maybe hearing the full prophecy) decides to throw harry into the distant future? Bonus points if humankind went extinct due to voldemort's actions. If no similar setup exists, I might try using it.


** There was a one shot where the twist was that Harry was captured in the Battle of Hogwarts, and this allows Voldemort to reign supreme.

When Harry wakes up and manages to escape, centuries have passed, and he gets recaptured swiftly. Voldemort then implies that this happens every couple of centuries

** Not exactly what you asks, but linkffn(11766210) has Harry sent to the far future while Voldemort is still alive and running.
