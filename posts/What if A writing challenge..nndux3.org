What if Harry wasn‘t raised? What if Harry had run away since young. And finally, after multiple attempts that had failed, Harry either gets dumped by the Dursley's somewhere or escapes successfully.

​

Optional Add-ons:\\
-Harry is lacking mental abilities due to head trauma from an attempt or from the aftermath of one (Can be pretty hard to write due to most people not being able to keep the effects without slipping up by accident).\\
-Harry is a girl (This is also a challenge for some writers)\\
-Harry escaped through either being a Metamorphmagus or an Animagus but, he‘s either stuck in animal form or a form other than his or if you chose Metamorphmagus, stuck in a loop of absorbing qualities from people he's seen, these can be good or bad).\\
-Horcrux is alive? The Horcrux has been ”awakened” And now attempts to either subvert Harry (successfully or not), help him achieve his goal whatever it is or manipulate him in some way.\\
-Harry is apprenticed to some ancient/powerful mentor. Can be Dumbledore or people like Grindelwald. But can also be an OC, Mythical mages and such.\\
- Can tie in with the above: Deities are real, and they're interested in Harry. (This can lead to OP Harry easily and some people just keep escalating the power levels of enemies).\\
-Crossover? Find a crossover with supernatural elements (I feel it fits better but you can choose anything you want) and find away to either insert Harry or mix them properly. (This one can also mix with the upper two, but it is not necessary. The gods in question could be for example the PJO ones or they could be a representation based on your knowledge of the Greek and Roman Mythos.)\\
-A system of some sort? I've found a couple good Gamer!Harry fics. Most people here know of the one by MichaelSuave. I think it has potential but the idea needs to be planned out very well for it to work properly in your writings.\\
That's It for this writing prompt
