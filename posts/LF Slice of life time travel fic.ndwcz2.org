It was pre HPatGOF and James and lily survived, other!harry was a bit of a pray, Sirius had a werewolf son named Orion, Bathsheda Babbling makes Harry, now Hardwin Evans, her apprentice, and there was something in the summary about how he didn't want to intervene, but he would do it anyway and he was sure Fate knew that too, and that's why he was sent back.
