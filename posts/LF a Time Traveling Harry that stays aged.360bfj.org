  AU. Time Travel. Harry Potter knows he is a wizard. He knows he is going to Hogwarts, where he will make friends for the first time in his life. He knows this because the Voice in his head told him so. The Voice says it is Harry from the future but Harry just wishes it would stop trying to take over his body.

The last one isn't exactly "in his older body", but the two Harries interact.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

When I first found out this involved Bellatrix I was skeptical but it turned out to be a really great story. I highly suggest it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team]] This is H/HR and not completed. He does not stay in his older body but does retain his memories.

He goes back to the Marauder time period and becomes Lily and James's DADA teacher.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987160/1/Adrift-in-a-World]]

This is AU travel instead of time travel, but the characters are the same and he retains his memories.

** I was waiting to see if anyone was going to suggest this little gem. Nobody did, so here it is.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8639269/1/Harry-Potter-the-Ritual-of-Merlin-s-Choice]]

What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone? What if Harry decided that such an outcome was unacceptable and set out to change things, to re-write the prophesy that had always defined his life? WARNING: not JUST about time-travel.
