Also would like Slytherin!Harry, but no bashing.

You could also rec a Creature!Harry, but the Creature in question has to be dark, with morally questionable requirements for survival.

As for Soul Magic, you can rec Soul bonds, but there have to be negative consequences for it.

Finally, in Ritual Magic, there must be a negative consequence for every gain made from a Ritual.

Generally, Rec things in that vein, if you can.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold)

Miranda Flairgold builds a completely new world outside of England in this, but it has all the elements your looking for and is definitely worth a read I'd say! It covers the defeat of Voldemort in the second part and goes into a third incomplete part.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** You certainly want linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) and its sequels, in which considerable Dark and Black Magic is performed. Although be warned, there are very few characters portrayed therein who aren't morally disgusting human beings, and the protagonist's background as a former child prostitute, while not centre-stage, isn't flinched from either.

Silently Watches has built a world that, frankly, needs the Most Holy Inquisition of the Imperium of Man to come along and declare Exterminatus on the whole fucking boiling of it. It's a brilliant story, though, and recently completed.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
