** So I've yet to read a fic were Harry suddenly has a change of heart and starts being more active in his own destiny and it actually work. And I couldn't figure out why what was. Sure, we've all waded through the crap, but even ones that come highly/often recommended in this subreddit still don't sit well with me. It wasn't until I read this quote from JK about her similarities to the Trio that it clicked.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a curious character. He's not the most popular character in the book for a good reason, because he has to be this questing person. Often that person is slightly less easy to love because their flaws tend not to be run-of-the-mill flaws. *But Harry is often the by-stander -- the eyes onto the world -- and that gives him a particular power. He is slightly detached, which isn't a very lovable quality.* But often people who have that detachment are rather unusual and are able to do things. And most writers have a degree of detachment, so if I stand right back from those three characters, I can say that is the part of me that maybe is in Harry.
#+end_quote

So to me, Harry as a literary device, fundamentally cannot take control of his life. It brings him into conflict with the very nature of the story. His primary function is to act as a vehicle for the reader into this strange world and thus is slave to our needs. He therefore must be passive, because we as readers are passive.

Now that's not to say that Harry doesn't do /anything/, but it seems to me that his action is always *reaction*. Which I think fits, he is after all a child in the books. Children have very little agency, even teenagers have only what they've manage to fight for. On top of all that you have the prophecy which has dictated a large amount of Harry's life.

So to me, these stories of Harry suddenly shifting away from that role just doesn't work.

** Hmm. This is an interesting set of observations. It's odd how few examples of #1 there are, where #2 abounds.

There's a scene in Runemaster wherw Harry into a shouting match with Snape and makes a bet that he'll get 100% on his end if year exam. Harry then Micdrops and saunters out saying "Triwizard champions don't have to take end of year exams" while Snape looks on in shame and horror. Similarly the scene in hpmor where harry confronts dumbledore ("why is there a nazgul in my fellowship?") Is similarly cringeworthy.

But as far as alternatives, my best recommendations are the fics where it's not really Harry. In linkffn(the pureblood pretense) Rigel/harry has better conflict resolution skills than harry but also bears so little resemblance to harry characterwise- that it's almost an apples to oranges comparison. Linkffn(Hogwarts battle school) has similar things going on.

How about fics where harry is raised differently? Are his skills better in the initiate series (where he's raised by Sirius)? Or accidental animagus, where he's raised by Hermione's parents?

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

Not going to lie though, I loved this. By that point I had already identified HPMOR for what it was and I wasn't taking it too seriously (like a well written crack-fic with a bit of heart and a bit too much science), so I found that line in particular amusing.

But it's not really Harry in HPMOR either, you know? I mean, Methods is weird in that it takes itself really seriously sometimes and not-at-all at other times, and I think that the D&D metaphor which keeps coming up is definitely one of those weird-ass elements but I don't think you can argue that Harry bares a ton of resemblance to well, Harry in that fic, nor is he supposed to.

** I'm reading linkffn(Fate's gamble) and it definitely leans on the "insolent little prick" side. I'm just reading it to read at this point. I can agree with your post compeletly.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

** TBVH there are far too many examples of the second kind. And I used to read exclusively from ff.net before I could no longer stand the kneejerk reactive, completely socially unaware responses from these Harry Potters.\\
That's the flaw in 99% of bashing stories.

** Just rereading linkffn(The Greengrass Contract) and Harry in chapter 2 is the living imbodiment of a self important twat. His interactions with Ron and Dumbledore are so ludicrously bad that it just wrecks the story.
