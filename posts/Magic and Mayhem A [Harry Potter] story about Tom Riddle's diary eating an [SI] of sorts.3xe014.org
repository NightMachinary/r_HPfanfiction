** This my new story I just started. It's currently just a prolog over on spacebattles. I like the rate of feedback there better for drafting, so I don't have an FFN link for anyone that prefers them. I'll port it over to FFN once I have a buffer of chapters built up.

** The prologue was well written and enticing! I'm gonna follow this post, please let me Know when you built the buffer enough for FF.net (I read through calibre and sites like you are using don't play nice with it)

What does SI stand for? Haven't seen that shorthand before. Context points to time traveler but I can't figure the acronym...

*** Self Insert.

I say sort of in the title because the "Jack" that merged with Tom in the diary was modified by Drusilla in my other story.

You shouldn't need to read any of Blood and Chaos to enjoy Magic and Mayhem though.

Time traveler is a good summation, which would work too, the point being that Tom Riddle from the diary got a glimpse of a future and a partial personality upgrade.

**** Ahh, got it. That wasn't clear at all from the story, fyi. I did read it rather quickly, but my recollection was that Ginny was a time traveler with future knowledge which Tom stole, then Tom forced her to give the diary over to Lockhart as a "worthless" person to absorb the life force of (instead of killing Ginny).

Are you referring to Lockhart being Jack, who has future knowledge from "reading the books"? (I read a chapter or 2 of your Buffy ffn, enough to get Jack as a SI)

***** It isn't super clear because tom has no idea what exactly happened to him. Not in the prolog anyway.

I haven't decided if Tom ought to care enough to find out or at least look into it. Realistically, I can't think of any way for him to get a conclusive answer.

As the story progresses, the reader ought to be able to puzzle it out by virtue of knowing the title of the story and genre when looking at the stuff Tom thinks and does. If not, I'm missing the mark as the author.

****** Makes sense. Good to know you've given it thought and have reasons for leaving it unclear. Looking forward to the rest of the story even more knowing that!

Have fun with the story, and I wish you many months of blockless writing
