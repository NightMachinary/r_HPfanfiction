There is a fiction I am looking for.

It starts with Harry in Privet Drive, waking up, living the same days over again, broken sink/mirror/blood, finding a perfect series of events to break the loop, wearing an Italian suit, finding Atlantis (Like the legend, but also kind of like Stargate)

Does anyone know what this fic was called and where I can read it?

***** So sad that the second part is abandoned or updated very slowly.

****** Not abandoned. The author updated it about 5 times this year (sorry, last year 2017). Also, he published books 4 and 5 of the original fiction series loosely based ideas from this fic. You should check out The Reminiscent Exile series if you haven't already.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
