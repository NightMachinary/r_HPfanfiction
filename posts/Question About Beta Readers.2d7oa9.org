I'm out of ideas so maybe somebody here can help me out. I'm looking for a beta for a story I've been playing with for a couple of months now. I know that FF.net has a section for finding beta readers, but I've had no responses for several days, and it occurred to me that they more than likely don't monitor their beta's activity, so a lot of the accounts are probably inactive anyways.

So basically my question is, does anybody know anywhere else that I could find an active beta to help me out?

Hell, if you are a beta and would be willing to give what I've got a read through, see if it's your style, I'd be open to that as well.

Thanks guys, anything helps!


** There's a reason I'm not a beta reader.

*** Same here... I used to beta through an independent site that mostly worked with Twilighted authors, but stopped because I couldn't handle that much teen vampire angst while planning a wedding. I never beta'd through FF.net because of the publishing requirement. I can beta and proofread... but I haven't written anything in over a decade, and it was all deleted when FF banned RPF.

** Try hanging out somewhere active on FFN, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/The-Teachers-Lounge/87221/][The Teachers' Lounge]]. That forum has regulars who are adults and write like professionals. Some of them /are/ professional writers.

The TL has a section to introduce yourself, so do that first. After, talk to some people and tell them what your deal is. Post something to the what-you're-writing thread, or the beta request one (which might not be dead). Good luck.

** Back before I had regular betas, I never had any luck with the ff.net beta thing. I had much better luck just posting the first chapter or two a story and asking if anyone was interested in being a beta reader. Since mine was a somewhat popular story for its time (around 1k reviews in the first month of posting), I had quite a few good writers offer to beta.

Depending on what your story is about and whether it aligns with the site's preferences and expectations of quality, you may find value from posting to the DarkLordPotter.net "work by author" subforum. The subforum is visible and open only to DLP members and site rules permit no flames, only constructive (if occasionally blunt) feedback. I've used this service for several stories in the past and it has proved helpful.

I'd also second [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] 's recommendation of The Teachers Lounge. You may not get a beta through them, but if you ask, you'll definitely get people to read and offer constructive feedback, much of which from some very accomplished authors (Christopher and company are pro). It's been awhile since I've haunted the place, but I still get email updates daily and the forum appears quite active.

Nowadays, what fanfiction I write (I've pretty much transitioned to original fiction) is vetted through jbern's Alpha Fight Club (no link), though the site's private, invite-only, and not really geared for novices.

** I'll give it a read.

I'm on the pedantic side for grammar and spelling, probably good at pointing out awkwardness (but not as good at suggesting fixes), and not as good for continuity. I try not to be too sadistic when editing, but you might find a few comments to the effect of "Hva faen er dette?"
