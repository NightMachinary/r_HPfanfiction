Like, there isn't really any other spell he struggles with ever, except the patronus.

I'm mostly asking because I'm writing a fic starting just after the second task, and I want to do a training montage leading up to a modified third task, but I'd like to figure out why he struggled with that charm, compared to others I might train him in.


** GoF is pretty explicit about linking Harry's trouble with the Charm to his mental preoccupation with the tournament:

#+begin_quote
  He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.

  Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum's autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.

  Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework - the only person to get any, apart from Neville.

  “It's really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick's class - she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. “You just weren't concentrating properly -”

  “Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. “Still - never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon...”

And:

#+begin_quote
  Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn't mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.

And:

#+begin_quote
  And so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.

  “Concentrate, Harry, concentrate...”

  “What d'you think I'm trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason... Okay, try again...”

Harry has to work hard to learn magic---just like everyone else. Patronus and Summoning Charm stand out because of their immediate plot-relevance. [[/u/Taure]] makes a compelling case for his troubles with the Summoning Charm being due to stress, but I would caution against making him out to be some sort of a prodigy once the stress is gone. Under ordinary circumstances, magic comes to him a little bit more easily than to Ron, and in the end, he and Ron do about equally well on the OWLs.

** I think there is no reason. Rowling just wanted to make him more miserable and stressing how Hermione was important to him. I mean if he learned how to do the Patronus Charm at 13 why can't he do a stupid summoning Charm at 14?

*** that was essentially the point Harry went from '/kickass third grader/' to '/your average useless freshman put into uncomfortable situation/'

*** If it's just about Hermione and his stress, that will actually play pretty well into my future plans. Thank you!

** It's a charm rather than defense, perhaps?
