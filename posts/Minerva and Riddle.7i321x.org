If we use Pottermore canon and clues from the book, Riddle's years were 1938-1945 whereas McGonagall's were 1947-1954 (+2 in ministry + 39 as teacher = 1995(Umbridge's inspection))

** I've got the perfect fic for you!

Linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita)

It's not complete, but it's an incredible read. There's a romance between the two eventually, but it's not a huge aspect. Also, Riddle remains a pretty dark character despite Minerva's friendship. Both characters are very complex and intricately written.

  How could she sit there, looking at all the innocent children she had sworn to protect, when she belonged to the guilty ones? How could she accuse others when she should be accused? And how could she have ever been so stupid to fall for one Tom Riddle?

**** Pretty much yeah, in that no future changes occur. But it definitely adds a different element to Tom Riddle that makes him much more interesting in my opinion
