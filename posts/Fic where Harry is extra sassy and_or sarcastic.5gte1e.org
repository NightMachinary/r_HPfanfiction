  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

******** The relevant lesson to /Harry Potter/ is that one's private life is theirs and it's no one else's business--especially in the scenes where all of the idiot teenage boys are pressuring Harry to out the gay kid and he tells them to fuck off.

******* What I /do/ remember clearly was them complaining about the "gay kid having a crush on Harry" subplot, saying that it was "preachy" and some got downright vitriolic about it.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** Oh yes. I fucking love this story. Sarcastic and quippy Harry with HK-47 is like a cake with another cake on top of another great cake. He still needs to make a new wand, since he has no backup. If he looses his wand he's fucked.
