Any recs? And I'm not talking about magicals fleeing before the nukes fly, but surviving them like cockroaches.

Also open to magical communities surviving conventional muggle wars like ww2.


** linkffn(Emperor) would be close to what your asking for. It's completely AU, militarized and one of my favorites. It's still a WIP, but got an update just before the new year. I highly recommend it, but it really isn't everyone's cup of tea.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** While this isn't exactly what you're looking for, you didn't get a lot of response so I thought I'd rec it anyway. It's kind of a cracky Voldemort who, growing up during WWII, became uber paranoid about atomic weapons and created a failsafe if anyone where to actually use them again with Harry along for the ride including a couple other wizard and witches from various cultures. It's not finished but I think it's funny and worth the read in any case. linkffn(3542099)

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.
