** The shadowy figure rubbed its hands together gleefully, and barely restrained a cackle. He'd done it! Despite the difficulties of Muggle transportation (he'd nearly lost the Boy Who Lived when the kid got off the train and boarded a Muggle version of the Knight Bus), he was now standing in a disturbingly uniform neighborhood.

This was his big chance! He could finally do something he'd been dreaming of for nearly a decade. Before Potter could enter the house, the man reached into his hopefully-Muggle-looking-transfigured-robe and hurried forward...

Harry Potter nearly dropped Hedwig's cage when he sensed movement behind him. The owl barked alarmingly as her new caretaker whirled around to face the unexpected threat.

Despite only knowing about the wizarding world for a couple of days, Harry could quickly tell this man in the ugliest jacket he'd ever seen was a wizard. Which was saying something, as he'd had plenty of experience with ugly jackets from his time with the Dursleys. However, he didn't have much experience with dealing with wizards without Hagrid.

It was understandable, then, that Harry's reaction wasn't to run into the house or down the street. No, Harry just gaped as the oddly dressed man pulled his hand out of his jacket.

...and presented a rubber duck.

"Tell me," Arthur Weasley asked giddily, "what exactly is the function of one of these?"

*** Dobby didn't mean harm, but still caused it in the belief that he was protecting Harry. So the wards could be gotten around if someone strongly believed that what they were doing wasn't harmful. Which might explain why Harry was able to live with the Dursleys.

**** Oh shit, a Death Eater could have weaponized that if they'd known about it. "Dobby, listen carefully. Harry is under a curse, and he will die. You must take this enchanted goblin dagger, and stab him in the heart. The blade will break the curse instead of inflicting any actual harm. You must put some effort into using the dagger, you will really feel as if you are stabbing Harrys' heart. Do not hesitate. Anything less, and the curse will never be broken. Hurry, Harry only has until the next sunrise."

***** Yeah, the protections don't stop everyone from bypassing them.

Though I've always thought that it would stop Voldemort and anyone who could be tied back to him, knowingly or unknowingly (Death Eaters, anyone Imperiused or under the orders of Death Eaters, etc), since Dumbledore says it's the absolute best protection he could give to Harry, and also the Death Eaters weren't able to get past them in the past book.

‘I hope so,' said Harry, ‘because once I'm seventeen, all of them -- Death Eaters, Dementors, maybe even Inferi, which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard -- will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you'll agree you need help.'

******* That's regarding the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Bond_of_blood_charm][Bond of Blood Charm]] over Privet Drive, not Lily's sacrificial magic, which is a different thing.

That's interesting, though. It kind of confirms [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e8r2zs/prompt_hagrid_shouldnt_have_left_harry_to_get/faej3r4/][my other comment]] that the blood protection over Privet Drive protects from anything that can be traced back to Voldemort --- including Death Eaters, Dementors, and Inferi.

****** the blood sacrifice is implied to protect him from all that harms him spread across #4 private drive and his epidermis and is powered by familial love between Harry and his aunt and cousin which there is none so no matter what it protects from the only thing it protects from is the direct touch of Voldemort on his skin until the graveyard because it most likely pulls on his magic to cause the effect. also after the graveyard, Voldemort had a familial connection also.
