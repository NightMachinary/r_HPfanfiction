While I was browsing through this subforum I stumbled upon a recommendation on a fic featuring the relationship of Petunia and /Arthur Weasley./ I had read the entirety of the story and it's sequels in one sitting because of what I think is fantastic capture of their characteristics especially Arthur's regarding the situation and later parts in the story and it's sequels.

I found the writing to be well done and the scenario itself to be quite refreshing although the last story didn't seem as remarkable as the first two it still is an enjoyment to read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102/chapters/26278335][Petunia's Letter]] and it sequels [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12305793][Petunia's Invitation]] and lastly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13682133/chapters/31427766][Petunia's Family Issues]]

Petunia and Arthur have history with one another in past and when they meet again it can't help but renew the spark they had for each other again.

(not good at explaining however I would recommend it and quite enjoyed it)

15 works on ao3. A good portion of them have Cho/Dudley as the main. If you like fluffy one-shots, many of these are even good.

  Dudley was captivated from the moment he met her, but their relationship won't be easy. After all, how could a Dursley last with someone so un-Dursleyish as Luna Lovegood?

** !linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane)

This was the fic that introduced me to and made me love the Harry/fem!Voldemort pairing. It's an unfortunately rare pairing; Rare enough that I had to start writing my own fic for it, later.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

  Alicia teases Harry incessantly, but when she seems to take it too far she'll have to try and fix it. Warning for sexual innuendo and sexually graphic content.

  From the moment Charlie left Hogwarts, he'd heard about Harry Potter. The longer time goes on, the more their lives become intertwined and the more Charlie can't keep himself away (8 year age gap be damned).This is an AU, but uses as many elements from canon as possible. It follows the order of the books but is mostly from Charlie's perspective. Up until later chapters of the story, this all could feasibly exist within the canon universe.Don't be turned off by the 'Underage' tag, I just wanted to cover my bases. Also note the story is only rated at Teen. That being said, if that's a trigger for you then protect yourself and pass this one by. I hold no grudges :)
