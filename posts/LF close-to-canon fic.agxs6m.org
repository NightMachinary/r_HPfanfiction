Looking for a story where Harry is more pro-active. More like Hermione. He never researched himself or asked questions regarding his past and possible future.

​

- He doesn't have to be a genius, but he should be pro-active regarding himself.

I *just* want the Harry Potter books with a more pro-active Harry. Or as close as possible. Imagine if Harry had the mind of Hermione (except her pushy-ness).

He doesn't have to be a genius who will be the decendant of all houses and clever in all things and all that, just ... more than canon.

​

Must: the fic must be completed. No matter how good a fic may be, if it's not completed I can't read it. I need to know. I need completion xD

​

If you have something similar, yet with some large changes (e.g. Harry is now a Slytherin), then that's fine, too. Point is, Harry is not relying on luck and he's actually taking the threat of V seriously enough to learn.

And while we're at it: any stories where he uses the CoS for his own use?
