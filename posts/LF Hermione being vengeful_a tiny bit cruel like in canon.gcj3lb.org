In canon, Hermione keeps a woman in a jar and blackmails her!

Hermione puts SNEAK across a girl's face!

Depending on who you ask, Hermione sent a woman to be assaulted, maybe sexually, by centaurs!

Hermione uses super cutting words sometimes! I'm looking for this energy!

I don't care what the plot is as long as it's well written; I'll take (basically) any pairing. I'm just looking for a vengeful, even cruel Hermione

*Edit: One shots are great and so are 500k fics hahaha*


** I don't remember what the fic is but in it Hermione follows the rules to the letter because she doesn't understand what an appropriate retaliation response is. Like if she doesn't follow the rules then she goes off the deep end.

*** As with most great quotes in this subreddit, the fanfiction you're looking for is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux). Specifically, Chapter 13. "When Hermione does break rules, however, she has no distinction between stupid ones and basic human decency. Remember when she wanted to kidnap and interrogate those Slytherins? Or when she tortured that reporter?"

Good points, Harrymort. Very good points.

**** It would be nice if people stopped doing this. Yes, canon does often have the things people come here looking for, but the implication of a request being posted on a fanfiction subreddit is that they've already read the official books and want more. I don't even mind it when people are all, “Yeah, that thing you're looking for, it's in this book series called ... /Harry Potter/. Maybe you've heard of it,” so long as they also go on to link at least one fanfic.

** I'm not gonna expand on this but you gave me this idea.

“Unfortunately Doctor, Doctor Granger, your daughter has extremely low empathy levels, she will probably never relate to children her age,” the psychiatrist told her parents.

Those words she would be reminded of, constantly. Hermione knew she had feelings. She could feel glee and depression, but towards her parents? She only felt resentment.

“You're not like other children, Hermione,” said her mother.

“Follow the rules, the rules are your moral compass,” her father said.

So she did. She followed the rules and clinged to them like a lifeline. Toes out of line meant toes chopped off. She tried to stay in line until she could run, because psychopath or not, she could feel pain.

“The teacher said no fighting, mum, dad, so I let her pull my hair. I didn't push her, I swear, a weird wind came and blew her over,” and yet she was still suspended.

She tried, over and over again to never toe out of line. Goody-two shoes Granger, uniform never out of place, confession was useless (she's followed all the rules).

And when she caught another teacher stealing?

It was still wrong, even though authority still did it. That just meant “following authority was ideal, most of the time, until they toe out of line than you don't have to follow /that/ authority anymore.”

What's a girl to do when she gets her Hogwarts letter?

A chance to escape.

  Hermione has been looking forward to attending Hogwarts as a student ever since she first heard of it. Being separated from her god, however, is terrifying. At least her Hogwarts years are filled with the sort of chaos that "Loki" loves (though Gabriel really would prefer it if she managed to stay out of danger more often. And he really does not like this 'Voldemort' character. Those twins are alright, at least, even though they're a bit too fond of his priestess for his liking).

***** The premise is that Hermione is orphaned and grows up in the streets, and is a scrappy badass by the time she gets her Hogwarts letter. She is then sorted into Slytherin. Now, to me, that sounds like a recipe for interesting conflict and adversity as she clashes with those bigoted faux-aristocrats who lack her genius but posses the numbers, the wealth, the connections, and---perhaps more importantly---the social skills to know how to bully someone while getting them in trouble if they retaliate; as well as for growing stakes as Voldemort returns.

Instead, the fic proceeds to hit a bunch of Slytherin-stan cliches, including an inexplicably friendly and supportive Draco (and Snape too, IIRC) and an IneptlyManipulative!Dumbledore. Then, also for no clear reason, Hermione becomes slavishly protective of Harry (also in Slytherin), including making pointless sacrifices of her own freedom of action and power on his behalf.

I dropped the fic around that point, but I am told that later on, the fic turns into porn in which Hermione is a sexual submissive to Diary!Tom.

** I'm shocked Lady of the Lake by Colubrina hasnt been mentioned.

linkffn(10654712)

Holy crazy evil vengeful Hermione, who joins Draco after the war because the Order has become corrupt in the Ministry but at first it's also because of the way Ron, Harry, Ginny, etc. have turned out.

Here's a little longer description and summary.

Theyve all become famous socialite millionaires from nonstop reparations, except for Hermione, and all they do is drink, party and bask in their celebrity that in this story is either waning or not even legitimate. Ron and Harry are drunks, Ron and Hermione had broken up because of something horrible he said to her in response to something that happened when it was his fault and then the way he reacted after. Sorry tgas vague but didnt want to spoil that huge plot piece shared gradually bit by bit. Ginny is married to Harry and does nothing but shop for revealing designer clothes and lunch at expensive restaurants with drinks everyday with Molly and Lavender. The Weasleys cut her out because Ron lied about what went down. She instead works in a small bookshop and has a crappy apartment

Once her and Draco run into each other randomly, watching Ron and Harry act a fool at a book signing and both feeling very similar in their disgust and hatred for anyone connected with the Order they start hatching a plan.

It gets more twisted and more intense, even evil, as the story goes on. Starts with other Slytherins as her inner circle then progresses to characters you wouldnt think would join.

She does horrific things to Ron, Harry, Ginny, Molly, and almost all the rest of the Order while gaining more power by manipulating the masses, exposing fraud and horrificlt poor orphanages used for money laundering, stuff like that.

Half way through something evil happens to Hermione which kickstarted magic taking over and raising the level of evil in her actions, plans and thoughts.

Once her evil empire has completely taken over, the twisted orders climax.... It ends on a somewhat sweet but at the same time haunting note.

The first time I read it I read it straight through at once I coulnt stop. I've cried in parts. I reread it a lot, only if I'm in a mood to handle it. It's so engrossing and so just evil at points itll do a number on you.

Who came up with this? It never even occurred to me when reading the books and it probably never occurred to Rowling while writing them. There is more than one way to scare a person. They could have tied her to a tree and shot arrows really close to her, drag her tied through the forest, dangle her from a tree, etc. Why do people just straight up jump to interspecies rape?

And that "woman" tortured children. I honestly don't know why Harry just put up with it.

**** I always thought it was an under the radar thing to be honest. Rowling drops an astonishing amount of classical references in the books and I figured that here the classical references went weirdly dark. She studied French and Classics at university and you can see that in the books. If you've studied classics then when the centaurs drag a woman off into the woods then that means something.

The example I bring up is Apolloyn Pringle -- a throwaway character who's mentioned once and we know they're bad because of their actions, who they did it to and the fact that their name is the Greek version of the Christian devil.

Especially to people who haven't looked a lot into why and how terrible tropes intersect with ways in which society as a whole works, rape and other forms of violence function as a shortcut to “gritty realism”.

*** The ancient Greeks came up with it. Hercules kills Nessus for attempting to rape Deinara (pretty sure all names are correct, but it's been awhile), and centaurs were almost always male in Greek mythology. Chiron is virtually the only named centaur who doesn't try to rape a bride at her wedding, carry off nymphs, etc., and they're considered symbols of violent masculinity.

Umbridge turns up with leaves in her hair and freaks out at the faint sound of hooves ... sexual assault is not a strange assumption to make, especially for someone familiar with centaurs' role in mythology, as Rowling definitely is.

  Hermione loves her books. Hermione loves her Harry. Get between Hermione and either at your own peril. Series of connected one-shots.

  Mista was not sure who fell in love with the young blond first, him or his stands. Aka, Sex Pistols collectively decided to woo Giorno, and Mista just wanted to strangle them all.

** I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.
