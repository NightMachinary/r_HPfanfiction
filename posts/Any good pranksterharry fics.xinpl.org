** Nonjon's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where_in_the_World_is_Harry_Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]] trilogy. Actually, you should go through nonjon's profile, he's got a lot of hilarious prankster-Harry stories. The DA missions are great, too.

SilverWolf7007's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/][Dear Order]]

Rorschach's Blot's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3621894/1/Absinthe_Makes_the_Heart_Grow_Fonder][Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder]] isn't precisely what you're looking for, but it's a one-shot, and he's a great writer, so give it a try. Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make_A_Wish][Make a Wish]]. In fact, his profile is another one you should skim.

** I don't know of any note-worthy ones, I'm afraid. Would really like to read some, actually.
