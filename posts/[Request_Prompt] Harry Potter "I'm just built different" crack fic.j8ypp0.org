** Rita chewed on the tip of her quill nervously, a habit she picked up from years of living a second life as a literal bug. The boy she dragged into the closet wasn't what she expected at all. "What do you think of your chances going into the tournament? The other competitors are have a lot more experience than you you, after all."

"I think this'll just be another GG, EZ clap to be completely honest." said the boy sitting across from her. His tank top made his frame look impressive. Almost. While he had bulk, and was very muscular for his size, she still stood a head above him.

"They should forfeit fifteen minutes in. I'm just built different, look at me." Said the five foot six fifteen year old boy. "I'm a six foot five alpha male. They don't stand a chance. It's champion difference, height difference, muscle difference, girlfriend difference, brain difference and life difference. It's not even their fault. I'm built different."

"HARRY POTTER ALPHA AS FUCK!" Exclaimed the boy without warning, letting out a primal yell to boot. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" He paused to catch his breath. "Also, tell your readers to order my merch from Madam Malkins. My "Champion Diff" tank tops and sleeveless tees are now on sale, use Harry Potter merch discount code Alpha."

After hurrying Harry out of the closet, Rita slumped into the nearest chair. What on earth was wrong with the boy, and more importantly, how could she turn any of her interview into an article? She supposed she could spin Harry as having delusions of grandeur, but every time he met with the press he'd boasted of his many achievements. He had confidence, and confidence is infectious. Eventually people would start to believe him. He meant trouble. Rita sighed.

*** Nah, dragon Harry is far too quiet and well mannered. Not to mention, he actually knows how to read which seems like it would be an instant disqualification.
