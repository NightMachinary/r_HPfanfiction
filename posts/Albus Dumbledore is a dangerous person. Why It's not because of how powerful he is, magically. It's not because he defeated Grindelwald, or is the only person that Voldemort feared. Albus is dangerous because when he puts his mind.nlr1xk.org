#+TITLE: Albus Dumbledore is a dangerous person. Why? It's not because of how powerful he is, magically. It's not because he defeated Grindelwald, or is the only person that Voldemort feared. Albus is dangerous because when he puts his mind to it, he will play match maker.

** "/Albus!/"

The headmaster sighed, and popped a lemon drop in his mouth as he waited for Minerva to enter his office. He was a bit surprised when the door sprang open without her even having to knock -- it was almost as if Hogwarts itself was on her side. Perhaps twenty years ago he would have found such a notion ridiculous, but after all these years Albus was more certain than ever that he would never know everything about the castle.

Minerva stalked up to his desk. A few strands had come loose from her typically immaculate bun, and her face was pinched. She slapped a slightly crumpled piece of parchment onto his desk.

"What is the meaning of this?" She hissed.

Albus glanced at the missive. He recognized it, having sent it out to all the professors just that morning. Still, he made a show of slipping his spectacles down his nose and holding up the parchment to read it over.

"I believe that this would be the finalized list of the prefects for this upcoming term." He said slowly before setting it back down. "Do you have any problems with the Gryffindor assignments? All of the Prefects were chosen by your recommendation."

The glare she gave him almost made him feel as if he were simply a misbehaving school boy about to get a month of detention. "You know perfectly well that I am not referring to the prefects, Albus! It is the head boy I take issue with!"

He feigned surprise, despite knowing full well that she could see right through him. "I was under the impression that James Potter is one of your favorite students."

"Just because I am fond of him does not mean I think he should have this position! He may have matured a bit this past year, but to put him in charge like this -- the school will become a zoo!" She took a deep breath to collect herself. Albus took the opportunity to start on a new lemon drop, having finished the previous one.

"Well," He said after a moment. "I'm sure Miss Evans will make sure to reign him in when necessary."

"But that shouldn't have to be her responsibility! The head girl can't be worrying about keeping the /head boy/ in line! Really, Albus, this is absurd. She can't even stand the boy, he's been pestering her for --" She abruptly cut off. Her eyes widened, and for a moment Albus could have sworn they flickered to those of a feline. "No, Albus, not again!"

"Minerva --"

"No! No, we've talked about this! You can't play matchmaker for the students! Especially not with the Head positions! That's why you're doing this, isn't it?!"

"I'm afraid it's already done, my dear. The letters have been sent out." He folded his hands on the desk and looked at his deputy serenely. "Besides, Minerva... Let's not pretend that your main objection isn't that Potter can't be Quidditch Captain if he is Head Boy."

The Transfiguration Mistress sputtered indignantly for a moment before spinning on her heel and stalking out. Albus sat back in his chair, contented.

"I would hope you would have learned your lesson after that mess with my granddaughter." One of the portraits above Albus grumbled.

"Now, now, Phineas." He responded without bothering to turn around. "Bellatrix and Sybil made a perfectly fine couple, at least until that unfortunate incident with the bowtruckles. Neither were quite the same after that, I'm afraid."

"And what about Mrs. Norris and Mr. Filch?" The sorting hat chimed in. "She was the best defense professor you had in years, and your meddling got her permanently transfigured into a cat. Or that time with Evangeline Lockhart and Thomas Skeeter? Or..."

Albus tuned it out, choosing instead to select another lemon drop. He was certain that nothing would go tragically wrong this time.

........... *19 years later...*

"Professor, could I ask you something?"

"Of course, Mr. Potter. What is it?"

"I was just wondering... Do you, do you know why my father was made Head Boy? I, mean, it's just, from what I've heard..." Harry trailed off, suddenly certain it was a stupid thing to ask.

To his surprise, McGonagall fixed him with the most serious look he had seen on her yet. "Because," She said pointedly. "Albus Dumbledore is an evil, /evil/ man."
