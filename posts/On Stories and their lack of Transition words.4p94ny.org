Forgive the rant but, it is a pet peeve of mine when people don't use transition words. I've encountered stories where it just shifts into another scene. While I know fanfiction is just for fun, but it jars me that people literally, pardon the pun, substitute lines, the words scene break or any other means of filler to shift into another scene.

I know it is technical, but it breaks the immersion/flow when the author suddenly shifts.

I'm sure that I'm not the only one with this anally retentive pet peeve.


** I think this is just the nature of writing in fanfiction, purely because of the expected length of a chapter. Rarely do most published novels go past 4000 words per chapter, as the entire book is usually published at once, and that's almost the bare minimum for a chapter of any fanfic with a moderate readership, due to the chapter-by-chapter-release nature of fanfiction. Many FF authors even write in excess of 10k words per chapter, which basically never happens with the exception of GRRM-esque epic fantasy, and using transitions in that situation is incredibly difficult to pull off effectively for an amateur writer (and it's probably difficult for a lot of professional writers, too). It's difficult to continue using transitions when you're cramming the equivalent of three or four chapters in a professional novel, into one chapter.

Not to mention, it makes your chapter messy and jumbled. Using proper transition words makes for better prose, especially in novels that use pages, but fanfiction usually involves scrolling through a chapter on one, very long webpage. In this case, I'd argue the use of scene breaks makes the fic cleaner and easier to read, because the scene breaks can be used as a point of reference for readers to tell where they are. That being said, transitions shouldn't be ignored entirely, and probably should still be used even if you do use scene breaks/lines.

*** As I said anally retentive. Lol. However, I do get your point.

I have seen 10k+ fics without transitions like Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast that still flows even without it. Although, that was on a one sitting read per chapter.

Don't you just hate pet peeves?

** It doesn't bother me particularly when authors do that, but I do appreciate it when scenes have actual transitions of some kind. I think a lot of the problem is just amateur writing. Professional editors probably wouldn't allow stuff like that. I could be wrong about that, though. I've been reading fanfiction for so long that it's just normal literature in my eyes, so actually published books are dazzling in comparison, barring certain exceptions (coughtwilightcoughhack).

** I completely agree. Most stories I read are good about keeping one scene per chapter or using page breaks and transitional words when that's not the case but I do occasionally run into stories like you mentioned.

I find no transitions between scenes very confusing because one moment, Harry is out at the pub with the gang and in the very next paragraph, he's at his flat. I'm always like, "Wait - what?" until I realize that the author changed the scene and that something new is going on.

*** Oh god, I recently read one of those and I was horrible! One moment he's in hyperspace talking to a crew member and then he's at Amidala's lake side house sun bathing and talking to Padm√®.

I had the same "Wait, what," moment as you.

** 100% agree. This is why I don't read little0bird. She doesnt even put a line in between scenes. It is almost unreadable for me.
