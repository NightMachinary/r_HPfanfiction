I have some time on my hands and am looking for some long reads. I just want good content that is lengthy, I am down to read anything. I am slightly new to this world of fanfic, so any old or new fics that come to mind would be great for me to try out. I recently read through the black blond series by Rajatarangini; the Alexandra quick series; the Jbern, Jungle in the Bungle series; Harry the Hufflepuff byBajaB; and Annerb The Changeling series -- and I want more!

Much thanks in advance! And I look forward to your suggestions.


** Completed Fics:

- The Firebird Trilogy, linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): a set of three fics about a magical AU where males are much rarer than females among wizards, and focuses on how the society is different from in canon. A dark fic.
- A Cadmean Victory, linkffn(A Cadmean Victory): a decent fic with Harry getting stronger to face Voldemort. It has some problems, but at least its finished and interesting.
- Patron, linkffn(Patron): an AU where muggleborns are much less common than in canon, so the wizarding world is more divergent culturally from the muggle world.
- The Art of Self-Fashioning, linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning): Harry and Neville had their positions reversed essentially, with James and Lily in the hospital. McGonagall becomes something like a mentor as Harry dives head first into transfiguration. This one is 293k, but I think its close enough.

Ongoing Fics:

- Hogwarts Battle School, linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): a cross between Harry Potter and Ender's Game, Hogwarts became focused on training the next generation for battle after the first war.
- Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): this one starts a bit rocky, but when it hits its stride it can be pretty thrilling. Not to mention by the time 2nd year ends the story becomes nearly AU and many of the plotlines are almost unique from what I see (ex. werewolves are actually all as bad as wizards believe except for Lupin).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), very much now. It started out a little bit slow, but is getting better and better AFTER Voldemort's defeat. At 468k words, it's still being updated weekly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927), was completed yesterday after a 12 years long writing process. It's a dimensional travel with some very dark moments. Kudos to [[/u/ello_arry]]!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), is just finished this morning. It's the second installment of a trilogy and comes in at almost 600k words. Its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]], linkffn(10070079), clocks in at 530k words. This series is characterized by deep exploration into magical theories.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her.

********* Sure! I tend to avoid drawing attention to myself lol. Someone shared my book online a couple years ago and I wanted to keep it private, but I'm over that now. It's a Fred and George fanfic about their first year at Hogwarts. Mostly canon, as if their book came out before Harry's side of things was published by JKR. I follow her writing style, make sure everyone is in character, keep with the lore for the most part, etc.

Point of pride: It has almost 500k reads and won a "Watty" which is Wattpad's international writing competition.

I just learned that some of you guys are super opposed to writing on Wattpad, but I have never done this before and didn't really know where else to post my stuff. For now, you can read it online or in the Wattpad app.

"Preceded by rumors of their prophetic birth, pure-blood twins, Fred and George Weasley, follow in the footsteps of their three older brothers by attending a school for witchcraft and wizardry. All should be well... but from the moment they enter Hogwarts Castle, the identical boys are met with high expectations, troublesome situations, a mystery fifty years in the making, and their ever-imminent expulsion. Aided by two classmates and using their newfound aptitude toward mischief-making, the twins are compelled to resolve the mystery in order to avoid being ejected from the school and excluded from practicing magic for the rest of their lives."
