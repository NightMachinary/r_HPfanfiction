:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much else, just vaguely that Harry /might/ have had some minor special power of some sort. And it followed the first-year train ride and other events of first year.\\
I think it was a fairly light-hearted fic, humorous without being cracky. And whenever Draco comes along to mock Harry and his friends, and their retort inevitably drives him away in a huff, Crabbe and Goyle stick around for a few seconds to chat (and sometimes question /why/ Draco is still trying).


** The only one that comes to mind is "Harry the Hufflepuff," but I don't think it works quite right.

*** Hmm, no, it doesn't. It's a nice enough series, though.

I'm fairly sure that with the fic I'm after, the 1st year train ride is fairly significant to the plot.

*** Hmm, no, I'm fairly sure it's not that one. I'm very sure no mass-time-travel or bloody murder was involved.

  You don't like the way this country operates? You think its bureaucrats corrupt, its politicians moronic, its people apathetic sheep? Fine! Go make your own!
