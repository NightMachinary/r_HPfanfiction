I really like Sirius Black during the marauders era fanfics, and many times his relationship with James and Lily is portrayed as very VERY close and even territorial. It made me think that if you add romance to the mix it might be an interesting dynamic.

I'm not looking for a love triangle in which two end up together, I'd like a fic that explores the relationship as a triad, if it exists haha

Thanks! :)


** The best one I've read is Of a Linear Circle but it's just a very small part of a much bigger story so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're desperate.

But searching James Potter/Lily Evans/Sirius Black on Ao3 gives a plethora of results. I haven't read any but OaLC so I don't know which is good.

** Linkao3(To Reach Without) has this as the background pairing. Explored via flashbacks.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** I read one fic where sirius often admits to harry that lily james and him were a triad, but it doesn't take place in the marauders era obv as he was telling harry this.

I think it was harry potter and the soul bond by kiera marcos but I could be wrong.

That's the only time I've even seen the 3 talked about as a tried.

And for the love of god NOONE MAKE HARRY, HERMIONE AND RON a tried. No, just fuckin no. Lol. I'm not against triad fics at all, but ron does not have the damn qualities needed to maintain a 2 person relationship let alone a fuckin triad
