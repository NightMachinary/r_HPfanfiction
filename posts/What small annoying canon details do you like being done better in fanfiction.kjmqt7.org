Now, there's plenty of time that isn't recounted in the books. For all we know, Harry, Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean had an on-going exploding snaps challenge, and since it never was useful to the plot, it was never mentionned.

Secondary to your point about Astronomy; I really wish fanfics would stop making Astronomy useless. I'd like to see some fics where it's useful in some fashion. Hell it's part of the core curriculum there has to be something useful about it, maybe explore how renaissance science influences magic. If there was ever a magical maths class, of the type I see fanfic, describe Arithmancy as, it would probably be in Astronomy. If Runes and Arithmancy can get an upgrade from what they canonically are, why not Astronomy?

Pre statute of secrecy you've got; Kepler's Laws (1609-1619) Euclidean Geometry Arithmetic Newton's Principia (First Published 1687) The work of Leibniz Sine and Cosine fuctions Copernicus' Mathematical model of Heliocentricity Logarithms (John Napier: Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (1614)) Algebra The work of Descartes.

The Baghdad House of Wisdom

And much much more.

Wizarding Scholars likely took note of these things too and I refuse to believe, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Hogwarts Pupils spend 5 years of compulsory Astronomy just stargazing. They can't know a lot of the stuff they do in canon without the relevant maths, and at the very least knowledge of Galileo's work and so on.

****** I personally support the fanon Arithmancy being the bulk of their mathematics studies. However my head canon does like the idea of Astronomy overlapping with Arithmancy quite often, mostly for ritual work and other more primal magic. I believe Arithmancy is behind the analysis of spells and spellcrafting, but the calculations for these require a solid Astronomy background and knowledge.

I believe Astronomy isn't maths on its own, rather a subject that covers multiple magical disciplines and subjects, thus its requirement as a core class for 5 years. In Herbology, I believe that Astronomy knowledge is required, for knowing when and how to care for certain plants best, as well as how to plant them, harvest them, etc. Potions I believe is similar. At an advanced level it requires Herbology knowledge to procure the best ingredients or even harvest them yourself for optimal quality. For Potions specifically, I believe there's Astronomy required in regards to how to make potions, especially in regards to when certain potions can be started, need certain steps done and/or need to be finished by, etc. In Advanced Transfiguration and Charms, I believe that's where Arithmancy and Astrology come in together for spell analysis, creation, development and advanced theory of these two wand based subjects.

For those reasons, in my head canon, that's why it's a core subject for so long. It goes for beyond just looking at stars, Harry doesn't mention Astronomy class almost at all after first year. He certainty doesn't mention having to have a class at midnight twice a week for five years. You'd think if that's how the class was conducted for all years there'd be at least one mention of his midnight class interfering with Quidditch or detention or whatever. In addition there's 7 years at Hogwarts. Even assuming Astronomy NEWTS combined 6 and 7th years, that would mean one year would have weekend midnight classes, if again, all they did was look at stars at night. That's likely the first years introduction and after that it likely transitions into class work, with star charts, teaching of theory and the importance it has in other subjects, how to analyze the timing for plants, rituals, spells, etc.

Just the way normal/muggle core classes are used in different subjects. In English you don't just learn the language as a student in an English speaking area. You often know it by the time school starts, you start to expand on the subject. You learn how to write for different subjects. Things like that.

I'm not pro-scientific magic only. I think a mix of that with the mystical is the best, but with a bit more mystic. My head canon for the subjects and classwork and applications started when I was like 9 maybe? I was just a few years behind growing up with the Harry Potter characters at the exact age starting when the the first book was released. I was a bit older and playing HP, complete with a dirty nasty broom my auntie used outside as my "Quidditch" practice and a stick as a wand. I started thinking how I should pretend to be in classes, but from the book and my young mind, it seemed like each class just learned a new spell. So that's all school was, just learned spell after spell, how to make potion after portion. I looked up Arithmancy and saw it was in the dictionary defined as fortune telling using numbers. I was so disappointed that it was no different than Divination apparently.

When I was older I thought how that would be ridiculous because 7 years of schooling seemed the same as just opening a book and learning each spell. When I got back into HP FF when I was an adult I was so STOKED to see how fanon had developed actual subject matter for the classes, things you'd expect to be lectured on and learn and struggle with that advanced over time. It makes sense! Each subject has it's own unique and also important and overlapping with other subjects, core and material. Fanon scholastic development healed younger me who felt the magic so to speak leak out when I started thinking that how her world I loved didn't make sense at face value. Thank you greatly HP lovers and FF writers for bringing that magic back!

******* I'm not pro ‘scientific' magic either. I'm pro folk magic and when you read some of the ancient research treatises, there is very little distinction made between what is ‘science' and what is magic, it just /is/. In terms of the tools used they are one and the same. That's my major justification. Canonically, they talk about one of Jupiter's moons being covered in ice. You can't really know that without Maths or reading Galileo's work, which is coated in maths. In Divination as well, in canon it's explicitly mentioned that something ‘required many calculations of angles'. Unless they are calculating mechanically by drawing and measuring with a protractor, then that requires the use of the Sine, Cosine and tangent functions at least. Rowling canonically avoids it because of her hatred of Maths, but if that is being used by Harry and Ron, who never took Arithmancy, then Arithmancy cannot be the Maths class you think it is. Even taking inspiration from my degree, which took us all the way back to the beginning, covered a lot of algebra, arithmetic and geometry before introducing Sine and Cosine again. Though I don't know a single person who was taught Trig in primary school.

I also think a lot of people missed the intended irony with Arithmancy, because they didn't know what it was, but Hermione's favourite subject being Arithmancy is supposed to be ironic given how close to Divination it is, and how she decries Divination for being ‘wooly' when Arithmancy as is, is equally as wooly. When she also says the boys should have taken something much more ‘sensible, like my Arithmancy class' there is irony.

Of course I agree with you that Astronomy will be cross curricular and has a lot of folk magic elements, my example were just what I came up with off the top of my head.

******** All great points! It's funny I have an advanced degree, a masters in social work and am an LCSW (licensed clinical social worker) and I never even took trig in high school. I avoided it by taking all sorts of non-standard math courses, Math Studies, Stats, etc. to cover the 3 years required by my high school. (My mom is originally Canadian and I've lived and worked in Australia and the UK, I even almost married an Aussie, so I get the British/Commonwealth schooling, though I'm half Polynesian/indigenous Hawai'ian and went to school in the US)

Great point about the irony between Hermione being so disdainful of Divination while adoring Arithmancy. I guess another reason I prefer to fanon version of Arithmancy being the "hard maths" of the Wizarding Education system and as such, being mostly used for higher level equations like those needed for advanced spellcrafting are two fold. One, it seems downright silly for there to be two courses just about divination. I would think what the mundane definition of arithmancy covers, would be part of the Divination curriculum, so Arithmancy needs to serve a purpose for another need in the Wizarding world that isn't covered by the known courses. Spellcrafting, although not discussed in canon can be inferred to as existing does this.. Secondly- Arithmancy being seen as incredibly difficult and all the other student biases you hear about it, seems very similar to STEM courses. What are STEM courses then used for? Technology and other high level sciences, which for the wizarding world, creating new spells, new rituals, new enchanted items (with a crossover from Runes, being where the two subjects overlaps) seems to serve that purpose. Spellcrafting, enchantments and then fanon creations like wards, all of which I personally find to be in line with canon, though never specifically mentioned by name, don't seem to be covered under the classes we know of, like Potions, transfiguration, Charms, Herbology, Care of Mahical Creatures, Divination... That would make sense then that they mostly involve the two subjects that are seen as very difficult, that the smartest students take, and that our narrator does not, Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. If it was just a single language that was learned with no magical application and a subset of Divination, students like Hermione wouldn't choose these subjects while other smart students like her, wouldn't see the other electives as being easy courses in comparison.

With the subjects being explained in those ways, it suddenly makes sense needing 5-7 years of study for all of these. It's not just route memorization of existing spells. It makes sense that each subject has enough to learn, but also academic difficulties and applications for each that aren't just memorization or following a recipe for there to be enough difficulty for students like Hermione to do additional study and reading and researching to have to be on top of the rankings and for the entire student body to stress out about writing exams that are equal to O and A levels, or now GSCE and A levels. Each subject being unique, Runes and Arithmancy being seen as particularly difficult electives that are still unique subjects from all the others mentioned and described and depending on the extent of academic understanding and study, there being a very extensive level of differences with magical competency that from the description of Dumbledore and Riddle being on top, gives credence to the fact that it comes from their extensive academic research, intelligence and years of experience and extra study, not some innate power level or requirement of physical strength and development.

Again this whole system that my head canon consists of, does depend on some fanon components for sure. But it results in a system of magic that follows the need to mirror similar non magical academic learning and development. I like the idea that folk magic and other magical cultures, form their own fields and are often seen as more esoteric. I'm Native Hawai'ian and I understand how the current US/Commonwealth?etc. academic fields are based on Western European ideals. There's still fields, values and subjects that are particular to various non Western European backgrounds that are incredibly valuable but have lost widespread knowledge due to Colonialism. So I like that Hogwarts academics are based on these, as fanon explains it, Roman ideologies of wand and spellcrafting magic mostly while witchcraft and cultural magics and rural magics etc. are seen as "lesser" by the powers that be, and as such, aren't the main components of the standard education system for European Wizards and Witches. But they're still known, used and taught in different areas by different people and are just as valuable as what is taught in the top schools, but they require a completely different way of thinking, value set, cultural knowledge, etc. So that means there's endless fields of magic that fall outside that Hogwarts system based on the top Public Schools in the UK, that are the equivalent of knowledge outside Western European influences academia.

********* I'm going to agree to disagree with you on the interpretation of Arithmancy. Astronomy is my fanon Maths class, because It fits better in my mind. One of the reasons of which is, in the Scottish system, it's more difficult to avoid taking Maths directly. I took National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher Maths. My school made National 5 and Higher compulsory, so everyone knew some Algebra and Trig and stuff. Its not split into individual topics like in the States. There is also Life Skills Maths, which is a bit more arithmetical. It used to be used as a shorthand, for those like my poor Mother back in the 70s and 80s, who was deemed ‘too stupid' to be allowed to take proper Maths.

There is one thing I have not seen in fanfic, is how Canonical Arithmancy is used in Curse Breaking. We know that Gringotts asks for their curse breakers to have and OWL in Arithmancy.

Ancient Runes is a funny one come to think of it. There is a whole load of desire to make it much more ‘sexy' than it actually is. I find that idea tends to come from those who didn't have to or didn't have the opportunity to study Latin and Classics in school. I had two years of compulsory Latin and Classics, and then I took it on to Higher level. My school, like most private schools, did it because of the notion that ‘A Classical Education is a good Education'. The funny thing is, it was deemed a difficult subject, not because it was difficult (Personal example I averaged 95% in all my Latin exams, which is a solid 15% higher than my other marks), but because it had a reputation for being stuffy and boring. Entirely undeserved if you ask me. The point is however that there does not /need/ to be any explicit magic in something for it to be /magical/. Ancient Runes could just be the wizarding standard of a ‘good education'. (As an aside, Fanfic writers; Please stop calling every culture's non latin alphabet ‘Runes'. There are no Gaelic runes, that's called Ogham, and is written like a tree. There are no Egyptian Runes, there are Hieroglyphs. There are no Sumerian Runes, that is called Cuneiform. There are no Incan or Aztec Runes. If you want to make it that these writing systems are studied in ‘The Study of Ancient Runes' that's fine, but Runes specifically refers to the Germanic Elder and Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon Futhorc.)

What you say about Indigenous and Folk magic traditions is true. The spectre of Colonialism didn't just affect non Western Cultures though. My own Gàidhlig Native speaking Great-Grandparents had it beaten out of them at school, to the point they refused to speak it much. As a result, Tha beagan Gàidhlig agam, though I'm working back to fluency.

If I had any writing talent, I'd write a story about the magic of the Beul-aithris (Oral tradition). Casting magic through song, and the like.

********** Wonderfully stated! I think we actually do agree with Arithmancy as opposed to disagree. Some of the the people who responded to my original post, seemed to take it in more of the divination related direction and as less of a "hard subject" so to speak. I believe like you it is the equivalent of higher level maths, required for people who continue past GSCEs with high level A levels who want to continue on to difficult university paths such as any of the hard sciences, maths, medicine, etc. Curse breaking, healing and the like needing high NEWTS for Arithmancy I believe is proof of this equivalency, and if I didn't misunderstand what you said, you do too.

Great information about the folk and indigenosu traditions that have been surpressed much like the international indigenous realms by colonization. As a Native Polynesian myself, I know we're barely taught our own history at all in, my case, the American schools we have here now. It's only been my desire to learn more and read that I've even heard of the Gaelic and other pre Anglo Saxon and even pre Celtic traditions of the British Isles, all who suffered a similar fate as my own peoples. I wouldn't have even thought of it in the context of HP until you brought it up. I can imagine in my own head canon the magical knowledge of people like your great grandparents origins, is treated as a "wild, barbaric, uncivilized" sort of magic, just the way American and British magicals treat the indigenous magics of the Pacific Islands, North American tribes, Central American Mesoamericans, etc.

Have you ever thought about whow colonazation would differ with magical peoples? Starting as early as the ancestors of your own ohana (family), to the 16th century and beyond of the Western Hemisphere tribes and peoples. Diseases my ancestors had no immunity to as well as different technologies such as guns and the ever present missionaries baked by large Western economies, took our culture away from us as muggles. I wonder if Western European magicals were even involved in colonizaiton efforts outsside the British Isles. If they were, was the outcome different? I can see in some area, the Roman tradition of Western European wand magic and "wizardry" might dominate over Native magics, which might have more of a ritual, esoteric or "witchcraft" base. Perhaps in some areas though the opposite happened and magical peoples whose muggle contemporaries might not have been able to withstand Western European powers, might have had magics that allowed them to fend them off, or even in some cases defeat them.

Do you have any thoughts on this? At the very list my head canon has a magical map of the world that looks VERY different than a modern muggle map. There's a series of fics that have Petunia Evans as some sort of squib archeologist/curse breaker, who works for Gringotts and in the first fic is partnered with Bill Weasley. She's an Indiana Jones character of sorts but raises Harry. The sequel expands the world building exponentially, and has Harry, Hermione and Ron following in Petunia and Bill's footsteps looking for the ruins of Atlantis. They travel around the world. The Middle East is still predominately domianted by the Magical Ottoman Empire and Magical Constantinople is one of the largest and most amazing magical settlements in the world. In the Caribbean, Haiti is a No Man's Land for magical peoples as it is run by magicals who use voodoo and their equivalent of inferni extensively. The smaller Beys in the areas of Morocco engage in the slave trave and target Veela settlements in southern France and the Mediterranean. Things like that.

Needless to say it paints a detailed and completely feasible and realistic (minus the magic I suppose) picture of what today's world would look like on the magical side of things, with different nations, government styles, international relations, etc.

To me and for my head canon, that only supports further the possibility of colonized areas looking different on the magical side than the mundane. The Alexandra Quick series has an interesting layout for the US. it's comprised of different confederacies and the southwest around the area of the muggle Four Corners and Navajo Nation, is controlled by the indigenous magicals. From there there is a sot of uncontrolled area in the Deep South of Ozark and Appalachian magicals, the area of New England has its own government, as does the Upper Midwest and then on the West Coast there is a small magical Chinese area around San Francisco and other different magical settlements that in no way follow muggle state or country lines.

Any thoughts?

*********** I do tend to think of Arithmancy as a form of Divination, mostly to preserve the irony of it being Hermione's favourite subject. Where Astronomy is wizarding Maths, directly as we muggles would recognise it; Arithmancy is the almost like the Applications of Magical Numbers. Subjects like Statistics, Economics, the infusion of Magic, analysis of Cursed and Enchanted objects etc. Just to clarify National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher are the Scottish Equivalent of GCSE, and A level.

When it comes to colonisation, the nature of Old World Imperialism its effect on the Wizarding World, I believe that this is a very difficult question to answer. Here my biases will come to the fore. I lament the loss of Gaelic as the first language of my family, so I have enormous sympathy and empathy for the indigenous cultures brought to the brink of destruction in the name of Imperialism. As such I like to believe that the indigenous cultures and their folk magics would have been able to resist the imperialists much better than their muggle counterparts. An effect of this, would be that you would find more wizards who speak currently endangered languages e.g. Gaelic, Hawaiian etc and they would have greater visibility in the countries where they belong. However this would not be much and mainly inspired by a quote by my favourite poet, Somhairle MacGill-Eain:

"Ever since I was a boy in Raasay and became aware of the differences between the history I read in books and the oral accounts I heard around me, I have been very sceptical of what might be called received history the million people for instance who died in Ireland in the nineteenth century the million more who had to emigrate the thousands of families forced from their homes in the Highlands and Islands. Why was all that? Famine? Overpopulation? Improvement? The Industrial Revolution? Expansion overseas? You see not many of these people understood such words, they knew only Gaelic. But we know now another set of words: clearance, empire, profit, exploitation, and today we live with the bitter legacy of that kind of history. Our Gaelic language is threatened with extinction, our way of life besieged by the forces of international big business, our countries beggared by bad communication, our culture is vitiated by the sentimentality of those who have gone away. We have, I think, a deep sense of generation and community but this has in so many ways been broken. We have a history of resistance, but now mainly in the songs we sing. Our children are bred for emigration."

I would say that those words have had a profound effect on me. Na Fuadaichean (The Clearances) destroyed entire townships. I would interpret this to mean both Wizard and Muggle alike were cleared from their homes, even if the wizards could have ‘hidden' themselves from it. In Gaelic culture, the concept of kinship, is hugely important. These Kinship groups (Fineachas) or Clann (Children or Descendants) present a ‘legal fiction' of all being descended from a common, usually famous or legendary, ancestor. The way I see it, especially with the context of Highland History (See the Risings of 1715 and 1745) the Highlands have always been notoriously difficult to govern from a central authority, so the Statute of Secrecy is a bit relaxed up there. Combine that with being more superstitious, the Gaelic wizards and witches to my mind, are both seen but unseen. That is the local wizards will still make up a folk ‘remedy' for some ailment for their Muggle neighbours. This means that when those townships were cleared, the wizards left with their muggle counterparts, a bit like the canonical ‘Godric's Hollow' where Wizards and Muggles seem to coexist relatively harmoniously. I'm just going to avoid the topic of religion in the Gaidhealtachd (Highlands) because Celtic Christianity is a ridiculously complicated subject.

Gaelic culture is steeped in not just oral tradition, but the landscape, flora, fauna and the natural world. Scots Pine was planted near dwellings to show that they were friendly to travellers, so its magic may come from Song, Dance, Music,Astronomy and plant lore or Herbology. The songs might cause Trees to grow or die for example. Using ancient henges for rituals, Divination through spirits and the like. See Samhain, Bealltainn, Imbolc and Lughnasadh before they were butchered and appropriated by Wicca.

I have a history book called ‘Glencoe and the Indians' by James Hunter. It tells the story of a Gael of Clan MacDonald of Glencoe, who emigrated to the US and befriended Chief Sitting Bull of the Sioux, who was fascinated by the Gaelic culture. Eventually he had a son with a Sioux woman, so the child had both Sioux and Gaelic languages and heritage. I see, with the better resistance of indigenous wizards, and Na Fuadaichean, that there may be the emergence of creole cultures in settled magical communities. The Bungi Creole in Canada between Gaelic and First Nation Cree was an existing example of such. Perhaps that is just my own wish fulfilment speaking, I have a fascination with First Nation cultures.

With how Anglo-centric canon is, I reckon Anglophone wizards certainly tried to get involved in British Imperialism. No doubt ideals brought in by the Muggleborns which rekindled an old idea in the Anglophone consciousness; The Romans were afraid to invade Britain as they were superstitious and thought the Ancient Britons living there were in fact powerfully magical and that Britain itself was an Island that belonged to the gods. That is an actual Roman superstition.

If we look at wand magic, the Ollivander Family have been ‘makers of fine wands since 382 B.C.' 382 B.C. is an important date for ancient Britain as it is the date that the Greek Explorer, Pytheas, charts the British and Irish Archipelago on a map and returns to Greece, bringing his ‘discovery' into Hellenistic consciousness. Like all good Roman ideas; Roman Wand Magic was stolen from the Greeks. When it comes to defining what is pre Celtic in Britain it gets notoriously difficult as Celtic culture arrived in 700 B.C or thereabouts. The word Druid comes from Old Irish ‘Druad' meaning ‘Knowledge of the Oak' and their limited ‘writing' system, Ogham, is written upwards with markings branching off like a tree, cementing the importance of the natural world. The way I see it where wand magic is precise like a scalpel, indigenous magics are more in tune with Nature, so are raw, unrefined, earth shattering and powerful, though differently depending on the culture. Therefore, it is better at resisting invasion and extermination than wand magic.

I saw some really interesting concepts in a couple of fics. One I can't remember the name of had, Dumbledore invited an Australian Aboriginal wizard called Edward Grayson to Hogwarts. He used the art of the Walkabout to travel long distances by Ley lines.

In ‘The Life He Leads' A loner Harry discovers some ancient Norse Elemental Magic, which brings a the companion Eikthynir, the Stag of Valhalla to him.

Aye, I agree that the map would be different. To me both Byzantium and the HRE still exist in the wizarding world, and the Indigenous cultures have a stronger presence around the world. The Inca and Aztec Empires still exist. Despite being contradicted in canon, as Anglo-centric as it is, although on paper Scotland, Ireland Wales and Cornwall are nominally part of magical Britain as governed by London, in Practice they rule themselves and its kind of just ignored. Everyone knows but no one talks about it. Haiti being no mans land is a cool idea and a lot of what you say matches how I see it.

************ This is such an amazing response, it's going to take me a little to put together my own response at the level your writing, ideas and information deserve when it comes to responding to your specifc cultural practices and history. I've been off trying to read up on the events and topics you brought up. Seriously, I never knew a lot of that stuff about Gaelic culture.

A few short things though in the meantime, I always liked the idea that Roman wand magic kind of Imperialized Native European practices, but in some less populated areas there might be corners where it still exists.

I love the Edward Greyson character, I think that's the "Accidental Animigas" series. Have you read linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) and the even better sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis) The world building there is absolutely amazing. North America is only briefly discussed unlike Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Middle East/North Africa. The world building that exists in Starfox5's stories have a lot of historical and cultural background and support, they're incredibly well thought out.

I'm not an expert about the numerous Native American/First Nations tribes in the US and Canada except for my exposure to the Ute Mountain Ute and Southern Ute tribes in southwest Colorado where I worked last year and we did a lot of consulting and team building with members of the Dine or Navajo nation, so I know WAY more than JK Rowling and many HP fans.

Of course being kanaka maoli/Native Hawai'ian means my expertise is with Polynesian societies. I've been playing with some head canon about how Polynesian kuhunas (our former "spiritual advisors/shaman" of sorts) and kanaka, Samoan, Tahitian, etc. magicals managed to ward of colonization a little bit more than their non magical brethren. I could see some western magicals joining the colonization of the Pacific, out of lack of opportunities, poverty, being muggle born, etc. so there'd definitely be some overlap. And of course with the plantations and having Filipines, Japanese, Korean, Micronesian, Portuguese, Chinese and many other groups to work in the sugar cane and pineapple fields, some magicals from all those backgrounds would come to the islands. So there would be some of the same melting pot of culture that created the unique "local" Hawai'ian culture (Native Hawai'ian means you're ethnically kanaka maoli, local is usually 'mix plate' or 'hapa' which is a mix of two or more backgrounds which is super common here and the culture that came from that, so most Asian, Filipine, Hapa, etc. are local but not Native even if they were born in the state)

Anyway when I get it all put together I'll share it with you as well as giving you a proper response to the entirety of your wonderful post!

******* Well said but I have to disagree. By age 11 and especially with varied backgrounds at home, they probably know basic math. But that's like speaking at the level of a 5 year old and thinking you don't need to be in an English class where you read increasingly difficult literature, learn to write at a higher lvel etc.

There's soooooo much math beyond what even the best tutored 11 year old could show up knowing at Hogwarts. In my head canon math doesnt make an impact on spellcrafting via Arithmancy and it involves calculus, geometry, differential equations, and even higher levels than that.

Even if that's not your head canon, knowing more than the absolute basics of a basic subject is the whole reason require schooling. Saying magic doesn't involve the basics of language and math is like saying oh I don't need to know any math at all beyond very basic sums because I'm not going to be a mathematician. Subjects and tasks overlap and people often need to step out of their singular knowledge base way more than they'd expect.

******** Oh, I'm not disagreeing that they shouldn't have English or math classes, I'm just saying that they likely assume that their students already have a basic understanding of those two subjects and don't need more for some reason. I feel that they should have not only a mandatory two years of math and English, but also Latin. And I say two years because you start new subjects at third year and you'll need those time slots freed up. Math could be replaced by Aritmancy if you want to take that class, and Charms and Transfiguration should be going over at least some Latin so you can understand the spells better, so Latin isn't exactly important past two years of it in the beginning. You don't have to be a master of the language to understand a spell.

Personally, I feel like there should be a wizarding elementary/primary school where they not only teach basic history, math, and English, but also spell theory and Latin in the later years. They could also teach basics on wizarding and Muggle money and how to write with a quill. This ties in with my point-of-view that Muggleborns and their families should be introduced into the magical world as soon as they exhibit signs of magic, instead of when the child is eleven. This will make it so wizarding and Muggleborn children are on the same page for things and teaching doesn't have to aim for a "middle area," so to speak, since both wizarding and Muggleborn children won't be on different levels.

Oh, and if not those, then there should be mandatory "intro to the wizarding world" classes for the Muggle-raised and at least a mandatory year of Muggle Studies for the wizard-raised. This should at least remove some of the prjudice that's based on one portion of students not understanding the world/other portion of students.

I mean the best I can come up with is that certain plants (read potions ingredients) are only possible to harvest at night under the right conditions. Or that maybe there are certain rituals that can only be done with the stars and the planets are aligned in the right way. Which would mean needing to have a class on rituals to find out more (but that's not a canon class).

But honestly neither of these possibilities are all that important as far as we know. I mean we don't really get a good look at rituals in the books. As for the potions ingredients, well that could also just be explained in potions class (thus making it a redundant point).

*** Not much of a fan here, so I never gave this much thought, but what you say make sense. It can be played by those who have no brooms (which is pretty much everyone, as they learn to fly on a school broom and to be honest, students don't really need one at Hogwarts unless they're in the Quidditch team), and the only thing you really need is a ball. Goals can be makeshift, to the point where you can just draw a line in the sand. It's a game that every muggle knows at least a bit about, and if you don't dive too deep into the rules most wizards should be able to understand it easily too.

Violates their privacy, exposes them to ridicule, potentially reveals extremely sensitive information (e.g. abuse).

I've heard the theory about planetary alignment having something to do with high Potions and ritual spells, but that doesn't make a lot of sense.

And I don't think history of magic costs the school anything as you don't pay a ghost (so as fanon has asked where is Binns salary going?) Of course, this very poor teaching of key subjects provides fanon with the "justification" of the intentional "dumbing down" of the magical population.

** There are a number of things. One of them is how Rowling describes every utensil as being gold, even when the use of material would not make sense (golden plates, goblets and cutlery at a school full of teenagers? A fricking GOLDEN STATUE in the ministry of magic?). I like how in fanfics these thing are not described (as being 'of gold' but rather not at all) save for the statue.

Another small thing I dislike about the books that is either fixed or not mentioned at all in fanfics is the numbers. With 5 students in each dorm, 7 dorms per gender per house, 4 houses, is little under 300 students. So at Christmas when most of the students go home (save for GoF) it doesn't make sense if the house elves cook a hundred... Er, I don't know if they were turkeys, geese or chicken, but in either case it would realistically be more than one per student where less than one is more than appropriate, and then there are potatoes, vegetables, side dishes and desserts. Who is gonna eat that stuff?

One thing that isn't fixed by fanfics (not the ones I have read) is the amount of teachers. There are very few of them at Hogwarts, especially in certain subjects where teachers teach each class of each year from 1-5 per house instead of two houses together (like Transfiguration or DADA). Even with magic there are only so many hours per day to teach, and then they have to correct homework and prepare their next class too. These people must be either technically awful teachers or don't sleep ever.

There is 28 classes in hogwarts (1 class per year. 7 years. For 4 house. So 28 classes).

If each students have only 1 hour of the subject per weeks, then there's 28 classes to teach per weeks.

If they teach Monday to Friday, between 5 to 6 hours a day, they can do it.

It leaves about 2 to 3 hours for a normal-working day to prep and grades papers. (And we know that teachers all other the world work way more than 8 hours a day).

Let's take into account that they do not have to commute, to make their own meals, do their own chores at all. They don't have any other responsabilities (ideally).

They're likely overworked, but not too much more than the average teacher.

But more so, all the evenings free to do so, like any other teacher in this world. Even easier than other teachers because she does live at school, with all her needs (meals, cleaning, etc) met by house-elves.

Prep isn't just the first time you run a class- for example it covers things like checking your notes are up to date in your field, that you yourself are familiar with what you are talking about, that any difficult spots from previous years are better explained (and easy spots are given less time), dealing with student questions before (and after) a class, making sure your classes are not covering topics that other classes might have covered (and if they are, working with that teacher) and writing tests (as they can't be reused or cheating would occur).

Teaching in general requires a hell of a lot of work that is never acknowledged. Depending on the school and culture it also can be bogged down in pointless paperwork, have hours of unpaid 'social engagement' such as working bees and club activities, have teachers act as counsellors (to kids and their extended families), and so many other things which extend beyond the school day, and are mentally and emotionally draining.

Most of the staff can teach the topics in their sleep. There doesn't seem to be a lot of allowances made for students falling behind. There's limited overlap between classes, and in any case the curriculum has been the same for years so they don't need to deal with it often. For example, you can see how smoothly Slughorn fitted back in, with barely any notice.

The exception to these is the DADA class, with the teacher changing every year. But it seems like everyone else just leaves the new teacher to do their thing without any interference.

*** Obviously the teachers use time-turners. While that still doesn't explain why there aren't just more teachers it at least explains the how.

I like to think that

- there were more teachers before Voldemort's wars and
- having a time-turner is one of the reasons some of the Hogwarts teachers are teaching at Hogwarts. Like Septima Vector spends most of here week researching advanced arithmancy topics and uses the time-turner to also teach students.

** So mine have to have the disclaimer of when done right.

First up, actual consequences for abuse. Harry is abused and spent the first 11 years of his life sleeping in a cupboard. While not many (none that I can remember) deal with the physical effects of this (it would 100% stunt his growth), there are some that actually make this abuse a non-trivial factor in Harry's character.

Next, any and all romantic relationships. I personally don't feel any canonical relationship really was great (I can't say they were all bad, but most certainly were), so some relationship development is nice.

This is a subsection of the previous, but the whole thing with Lily, James, and Snape. This is rarely addressed in the way I feel decent, mainly because it's normally unaddressed. However, anything is better than canon in this mess.

Voldemort. This is another situation of anything is better than canon. One of two things tends to happen with Voldemort, either the Tom Riddle route or the Voldemort route. The Tom Riddle route is when the author decides to expand his character and motivations beyond being the pure evil villain and attempts to make an interesting villain. The Voldemort route is where the author forgets everything about his back story, doesn't include it, and makes Voldemort the pure evil villain who's bad because he is. Canon tried to do both and successfully made a character that I was completely indifferent about and his death felt like a McGuffin.

*** About Voldemort, it especially annoys me that he was highly intelligent and manipulative as a young man (recruited a private army, stayed under the radar for decades, waged open war against the ministry and almost won) but seems impulsive and unhinged during the canon era... I've seen many explanations for this in fanfic, but canon was pretty much silent.

However, I can't say that fanfic Voldemort is better than canon. I've read a lot of fics that go what you call the Tom Riddle route, and my god. It's often just completely forgotten that Tom clearly has something very wrong with him in the brain chemistry department. Sociopaths are probably very difficult to write, so authors certainly deserve some slack, but a well-written Tom Riddle/Voldemort is definitely elusive

**** I suppose I mentioned my issue in passing, but while that is annoying it's not impossible for me to overcome. My issue is that Voldemort fails as both a character and a villain. I cannot care about Voldemort no matter how hard I try. The issue is that JK tried to have her cake and eat it to. The one rule of making a pure evil villain is that you cannot try to give them depth, and that's exactly what she attempted. This failed spectacularly, especially since Voldemort doesn't actually do anything to the people we care about. Which brings me to a slight amendment to my statement, there is one more non-canon Voldemort, the active Voldemort. This a Voldemort that actually does something, the best example off the top of my head is Uniquenameosaurus's video on making Voldemort hated. [[https://youtu.be/PFHUJ-afS9o]]

Honestly, most poorly written Tom Riddles are just the author trying to write Canon Voldemort. I was pointing out the two ways to make Voldemort a good character (as I do believe that both Tom Riddle and Voldemort would be better characters if they were separate characters). As for the sociopathy thing, I don't really mind if authors exclude that, so long as them make an interesting character. I personally just don't (usually) care about comparing a character to Canon, so long as the development is believable. Especially with Voldemort where I don't care about the canon version at all. Regardless, I'll stand by the statement made earlier that any Voldemort is better than Canon Voldemort.

Since I gave an example. I don't actually have an example of the Voldemort route, but I'm sure you've read a fanfic that just neglected to mention anything about Tom Riddle and still had Voldemort the main baddie. That's essentially it. That being said I do have an example for the Tom Riddle route. The Rigel Black series started with Pureblood Pretence [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/]] is easily the best. It's one of my favorite fanfics and is my favorite fanfic series.

***** I think the best way to write Voldemort is to instead write those around him. He's unhinged, how do they deal with that? Additionally, the best way to explain is the horcruxs made him go mad, because that cannot be good for you, and that does seem to be the inciting incident for turning from mild murder to dark lord. He always came off more unhinged than evil in the canon, and I liked that. The issue was he had the presentation of a pure evil villain. He lacked the depth of story, while having wayyyyy to much character. I think you could write a pretty good insane Voldemort though.

****** For whatever reason your post didn't appear until now.

The insane Voldemort isn't uncommon by any means, it's typically used in Voldemort redemption (where they collect horcrux pieces, I read a letter fic that started like this and I really enjoyed it.) stories and isn't insanely uncommon in father Voldemort's or even books that feature Voldemort as a major character. The specific people used for the effect are normally Snape and the Malfoys.

When well written, I would consider it a Tom Riddle Route. I disagree that it's the best way to write Voldemort, with the poor character and unimportance as a character (his importance is as a McGuffin) that Voldemort has an author can do a lot more with much less justification than with other characters.

Overall I consider insane Voldemort as high risk high reward. It's cool when done right, but done poorly it's propagating a stigma that insane/mentally ill people are violent. Well I know that not everyone will see it in that manner, I'm sick of modern media using insanity and mental illness in such a way.

As for reading Canon Voldemort as insane, I cannot say I've ever come even remotely close to doing that and I can honestly say that I don't think I could. Voldemort is too methodical and planned out for me to read him as insane/unhinged.

Your second and third last sentences are agreeing with my overall points though. He's presented as a pure evil villain and JK tried to add character development, which by its very Natur breaks the pure evil trope. There's also the point that he really doesn't mean much to any of our heroes and he's functionally closer to a McGuffin than an actual character (I'm assuming this is what you meant by story depth).

I definitely agree with your last paragraph. He doesn't mean as much as he should. I think that's probably the main issue. But I still think insane Voldemort is the most useful way to write Voldemort, since it explains his transition from Tom Riddle to Voldemort, and is canon compliant.

** For me on the horcrux hunt my problem was they didn't call for Dobby (or Kreature) who could have kept them fed and comfortable using elf magic. Also, why they didn't get Bill Weasley involved once they found out that a Horcrux was egyptian in origin and Bill had spent years in Egypt being a cursebreaker and may have encountered these things.

The story Hunt by White Angel of Auralon has a great taken on this.

I'm currently writing a time travel fix-it sort of fic where Harry got really into curse-breaking, spellcrafting, and wardcrafting while searching the Library of Alexandria in Egypt for time travel fics. I feel like it's a good way to make Harry believably intelligent and powerful without actually making him study something for a week and suddenly become a master at it. Instead, he was overrun with grief and became obsessed with a way to travel back in time to make sure Remus and Tonks and Sirius and all of them didn't die and he became interested in spellcrafting, wardcrafting, and curse-breaking along the way.

  “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things --- friendship and bravery and --- oh Harry --- be careful!”

Although Hermione is more "magically powerful" in the traditional sense, the whole point of the books is that it doesn't matter. Magical power is already something that Voldemort knows well, but Harry's pure emotions is something scary and foreign to him.

*** They're really short essays for the most part, though. Like... really short. A foot long essay is just slightly longer than a standard sheet of paper, and a handwriting which generally give you fewer words per page than print.

They're generally assigned what are essentially 1-2 page handwritten essays which would take maybe an hour per page at a high estimate for an extremely slow worker. It's not exactly a ton of work, especially since they have a block schedule so have a few days to get everything done between classes.

It much more reasonable then the 50+ math problems people get assigned every day in real life.

** It bothers me that harry spent 10 years of neglect and isolation, and then he got shown a world of magical wonders, but in the books he acts like a normal kid in a normal school.

He was likely small and underfed every time he got to hogwarts, but he ate like any other kid. School nurse never noticed anything wrong. reacted to aggression like a relatively normal kid would. Did (or did not) homework like a regular child would.

​

I mean, even if you don't think he got beaten with a belt every day, spending your entire childhood with relatives who despise you and not a single friend won't result in a sane individual.And after all that, getting almost killed every year multiple times...

** Harry's body. Other than a few passing comments of "You're too skinny, Harry!" from Mrs Weasley, which are all too common from mother hens, Harry's body is rarely mentioned. The poor kid should be tiny, slow, and very skinny. He shouldn't look healthy at all! I won't get into everything, but Harry was malnourished horribly, not to mention that he probably healed horribly wrong. And I wouldn't be surprised if his magic came in to heal him and that's why he seems somewhat healthy. But if that is true, then that means that his magic is all tied up in healing him. It would explain why he an occasional burst in magic and he feels supremely tired right after, if you factor in adrenaline. Fanfiction takes in the after-effects of his abuse better than canon. It's why I prefer fanfiction, other than the tropes I normally prefer to read which would make Rowling's Christian arse yell that I'm going to hell.

** It doesn't annoy me too much because canon Harry is an orphan with abusive guardians who don't care about him, so it's no surprise it gets glossed over - but I like seeing a bit of parent involvement. I know it's a boarding school, but some of these kids are 11 years old - practically babies still. You can't tell me their parents would never come to a quidditch match, take them out to Hogsmeade on a weekend (the 3rd year and up rule is for SCHOOL sponsored trips - no reason immediate family couldn't have different rules), or visit their kid in the hospital wing when they get caught in the crossfire by who- or whatever is trying to kill Harry Potter this year.

*** Been in boarding school since I was 11. Most schools are pretty strict about parents visiting. It really doesn't help the environment.

Each time you visit your parents or they visit you, you get really emotional and unsettled. All the way till 10th grade atleast. It always happens. For kids with close connected families atleast.

Also other kids get really jealous or feel bad if parents are visiting other kids and yours don't visit you. So parental involvement is pretty damn strict with respect to boarding schools.

Only time mine were allowed to visit or I could visit was when the had more than 2 days in a row as holidays.

And back then, as we lived in the hills with bad phone connections, we had only one call a month, rest of the time it was letters.

If you were sick, you get a phone call once a week. But that's it.

As a kid, I didn't care what year the books were set in. Since I read the first book in 1999, I must have automatically assumed that it was set in 1999, too. I only learned later on that they were set in the 1990's due to the HP Lexicon.

**** Reading the books as a nineties child it didn't really register with me either, but seeing the first movie definitely did. It helps if course that I was still in my single digits when I started reading the series, and I wasn't when I first saw the movie. But the images made an impression: The Dursleys, who were very concerned with having the best of the best (as in canon) having the big telly that definitely wasn't a flat screen and the clothes really imprinted on me that Harry Potter was 9 years older than me.

For that matter, I once read a fic where Harry Potter mentions remembering seeing the fall of the Berlin Wall on national television and seeing that as a symbol of hope because nothing lasts for ever - not even Harry living under the Dursleys torment.

That stuck with me and left an impression.

*** I saw one where Harry realized that his upbringing (minimal food, uncomfortable conditions, isolation, etc, for extended periods) made him better prepared for the Horcrux hunt than Ron or Hermione, who had never faced such conditions in their lives.

Even if Ron had gone hungry pre-Hogwarts, he was never/rarely alone; the Burrow was comfortable and seemingly at good temperatures all year if a bit ramshackle. Based on what I've read about Harry's visits there, however, I don't know if the Weasleys were that strapped. But then again, Bill and Charlie and later Percy being gone made enough of a difference by the time Harry visited.

Huh. A thought: if Ron had gone hungry as a child, that might explain why he eats so much at school.
