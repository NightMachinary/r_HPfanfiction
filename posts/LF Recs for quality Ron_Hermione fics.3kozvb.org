I read RogueSugah's Price of Love forever ago and have yet to find anything else that comes close in quality. Any recs are greatly appreciated. Prefer close to cannon and completed.


** Australia by Msbinns and Seven simple years by Halfaslug. If ya head over to a lil site called schnoogle, you'll find a trilogy of fics that detail all of OoTP, HBP and DH from Hermione's point of view. Some creative liberties taken here and there, especially in the OoTP one, but it is still a fantastic read.

** I love "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived". It's a very AU story - no magic, but superscience and Hogwarts is a school for spies, James Bond style - but sticks to canon in unexpected ways, and it has a nice build up for the attraction between them, from year one on. Really has a great Ron too.

** This poor thread. While H/Hr gets a long list of recs, R/Hr struggles for even a couple. Well, I'm not well read when it comes to the pairing, but here you go:

linkffn(Stop all the clocks) and linkffn(Children's crusade by theelderwand1) are both very good stories. Takes place after Harry's death in the final battle, and the hunt is on to capture Ron and Hermione.

Zsenya's and Arabella's linkffn(After the End) is well-known. Post War fic, an all time classic, H/G, R/Hr, with both pairings getting equal focus. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][Hermione: Queen of Witches]] is another excellent read by Arabella. It is an account of Hermione's school years through diary entries.

LavenderBrown's linkffn(The book of Morgan Le fay by Lavenderbrown) and its sequel llinkffn(The Final reckoning by Laverderbrown) are both considered Ron/Hermione classics.

linkffn(Biscuits: A Love story) also comes highly recommended by the two or three R/Hr fans we have on this sub-reddit, so you should probably give it a try.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=364483][Hardboiled]] is a one-shot I feel is a lot of fun.

Hardboiled: /Ron Weasley stars as a hardboiled private eye hired to find the missing husband of a beautiful and mysterious client./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/900634/Solstice-Muse][Solstice Muse]] has a tonne of Ron/Hermione stuff you might like.

A lot of HG fics have RHr as the side-pairing. linkffn(Backwards With Purpose) has a R/Hr subplot, and a smut out-take.

**** Lots of good recs from [[/u/PsychoGeek]]. The only one I haven't finished reading is After the End but I found all the others excellent reading material!

Make sure to check the author pages since they usually have more similar stories. I think Solstice Muse and theelderwand1 have the most Ron/Hermione stories out of every author referenced on this thread.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.
