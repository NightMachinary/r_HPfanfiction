Some nicknames I can understand, e.g. "Prongslet" and "Cub". These nicknames sound cringy and contradictory to certain characterisations; Remus would never call someone "Cub", since he hates being a werewolf and anything associated with his affliction.

But nicknames like "Henry" or "Mia"? These are actual names, and I can see an AU where Hermione goes: "Please, call me 'Mia'." In the Marauders' era, James Potter might be preferred to be called "Jay" by his close friends, for another example.

So long as you don't use names like "Moldyshorts" (shudders), then nicknames shouldn't be so reviled. In real-life, nicknames are commonly used, even ridiculous ones on occasion.

** You basically answered your own question. For the same reason you don't like Prongslet or Cub I don't like Mia, or Mione, or Henry...etc. All of those names are contradictory to the canon personalities and traits of the characters.

For me it's less about reviling nicknames and more rolling of the eyes at their use. 99% of the time they serve no real narrative purpose...they are simply a contrivance for contrivance sake.

** But why would you give them nicknames instead of just calling them by their actual names? Especially James being called Jay just feels cringy... I have several friends called James and I've never heard anyone call them Jay.

I also don't understand why Hermione should be called Mia? Is that a common nickname for Hermione? It doesn't really feel connected to the name at all in my opinion.

Furthermore, I immediately associate this overuse of nicknames with a certain type of fanfics. And it's a type of fanfiction that will make me close the tab. Reminds me of how I imagine emotional teenage girls write fanfiction and that's just not the type of story I'm interested in. That doesn't mean it is bad; it's just not my preference. I'm sure that lots of people enjoy reading this type of story, especially considering how many people actually write like that.

Some nicknames don't really bother me when they are used in the right way. For example, if Lily called Snape Sev while they are still friends I wouldn't necessarily think that out of character. But if someone else called him Sev without being sarcastic it would probably feel unnatural.

You're basically asking why nicknames exist at all.

I've never met anybody named James who goes by Jay, but I have met some who went by Jim, Jimmy, and Jamie.

**** Yeah, those three would be less weird to me than Jay. One of the James I know is sometimes called Jimmy.

It still doesn't make that much sense to me though because neither are they much shorter nor is James a long name in the first place. Maybe I'm the weird one here but I don't think I've ever really had the urge to make up a nickname for anybody without a really long or awkward name.

It's just that these nicknames weren't used in canon so you're just making up nicknames because... why exactly? It just seems to me that authors often make up these nicknames just for the sake of it and it breaks the immersion for me. If there's a good reason like Hermione being a long name then alright I get that but I also don't see a good nickname for her that is shorter. Unless you want to call her Granger.

Because Hermione's name is four syllables long! If you're going to be saying her name a hundred times a day, cutting down even a syllable or two would save you like a year of your life. Not to mention the combat implications. You can say /"Sue, Ron, DUCK!"/ faster than you can say /"Hermione"/ in its entirety.

The biggest problem is that there isn't really an actual nickname to give her. "Mione" is still three syllables so you're not getting far, and everyone seems to despise it anyways. "Herms" and "Hermy" just aren't good names to call someone. What's left? "Mia"? That's just an entirely different name, might as well just stick with "Sue" at that point.

Anyways, Hermione probably should've had a canon nickname, for practicality purposes if nothing else. Almost every name will get informally shortened to one or two syllables somehow, just for ease of communication and/or familiarity, and I think this probably would've happened to Hermione in "real life". But it didn't happen in the story, so inventing one for a fic is always going to be awkward and "out of character".

*** Because people will often use nicknames in real life. From the books, we have a few using them already (Ron, Ginny, Bill, Tonks, Percy are a few examples).

They aren't always appropriate, but people might find it more appropriate than just always using their name

**** Yeah, and I'm all for using those nicknames in the story. But whenever authors just make up new ones it feels weird to me. There might have been a couple of exceptions but I can't think of any right now.

I can understand why you'd want to make nicknames for characters with long names like Hermione but it has to be a good one that still makes her feel like the character. Otherwise it breaks the immersion for me.

** I think Hermione would, in any universe, hate it if you called her anything other than Hermione and I fully agree with the sentiment. I know she did her best with Viktor, but I feel like she tried with Grawp as well. Don't know if that's canon or head-canon.

I don't mind pet names/nicknames. Just make it make sense ex. OOC Snape calling Harry "Brat." I can see Sirius and Remus calling Harry "Dear" and laughing about it. It also fits in nicely with the whole "dear boy" thing the books have going on.

Edit: many of the characters in the books had a pet name/diminutive, so the anti nickname sentiment in this thread is kinda odd.
