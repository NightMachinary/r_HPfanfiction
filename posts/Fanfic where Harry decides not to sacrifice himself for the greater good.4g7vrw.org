I've already read Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia (hilarious fic by the way).


** Many stories do not have horcruxes or have alternate solutions to them. But I don't think that is what you want.

*His Mother's Love*, linkffn(10132530), offers an interesting middle ground: [[/spoiler][Harry basically forced the truth out of Dumbledore during his first 'private lesson' in year 6. He knew he had to take a killing curse from Voldemort, but Dumbledore also told him that he had a good chance to survive, so they were all making plans for that event.]]

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

  What if Harry had someone at the end of the Deathly Hallows to give him a different perspective on things? How might have this affected his decision to go to his death to save the magical world? HP/LL/HG
