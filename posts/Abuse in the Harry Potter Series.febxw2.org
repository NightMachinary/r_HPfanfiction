Anyone ever wonder how JK rowling was so cavalir about abuse? Like Potions that were the same as Date rape, half of the males of any importance being abused by their families... Harry outright naming his kid after two of his abusers...

Like I am good with abuse in stories, it happens in the real world and is a great tool to make your stories more fleshed out especially with motives and charecter history...

But literally no part of her story has resolution of the abuse. It is almost a background noise...

Personally I think that some sort of retribution should have occurred to the Dursley's or at least towards Dumbles or Snape... like some sort of reaction from someone but nothing ever happens.

**** I can totally see Ginny as a cheater. She was coddled by her family her entire life as the first female Weasley in generations. Even the twins didn't dare pick on her. Between being spoiled and her bad temper, she exhibits very little self-control. And, with her mother's example, probably became a screeching harpy as well.

Note I am not a Ginny hater. She really had very little personality in the books. I do happen to think she is a bad match for Harry, because all he ever wanted was somebody to see, "Harry, just Harry," and she only ever saw the hero.

***** She is fairly tabula rasa, which is both a curse and boon in that regard. She has a ton of "baggage" that wasn't part of her character, but has been saddled with from the weight of other fiction, simply because authors over the years have taken small things in the books and extrapolated out from there as their story, and later biases dictated.

Is she the popular kid, and school athlete that's well liked? Is she the school broom? Will she be the second coming of Molly? Does she dislike her mom's method of handling children, and seek to be different? Was she a stalker? Was she just a shy little girl?

The inciting incidents for each of these are in the original text, but weren't the focus of the story, so none of them were fleshed out. When DH came out, JKR had spoken repeatedly about how she didn't want the story to be a grail quest, where Harry finishes the quest so he can get the girl, but in doing so, and by not including Ginny in the year long camping trip, her character is left pretty much with minimal development.

** I don't have any explanation for the in-books abuse from Snappy and Co, but the idea of a child having abuse in his backstory (and then it never really being dealt with) is a trope from older English literature that basically is supposed to show them having 'character'. We used to be really into the idea that beating a child was a way to instil discipline and make them a sound, responsible, productive member of society (think the Pink Floyd 'The Wall'/'We Don't Need No Education' kind of vibes). It's a very Roahl Dahl/Enid Blyton-esque era trope - corporal punishment as a form of child-rearing has been very reasonably disposed of for quite a while now. Legally, at least. Some investigations and such have found little pockets of it here and there, but it's gotten rid of ASAP after it's found.

From exactly the same source you identified for the rest of your response. It has been pointed out again and again that JKR based Hogwarts and the general concept of the setting on the classical boarding school stories and their tropes.

** I think she (understandably) underestimated how popular her stories would be and the real world interpretation especially given that the later books became darker and "grew" with her readers.

The first books were written in what I see as the fairy tale style, but there are many thing where I think you can ask "why would she or he (Harry/Dumbledore/Mr. Weasley/whoever) do that?"

** The abuse that several suffered at the hands of adults is also blatantly ignored by JK Rowling.

What was she thinking making Neville's boggart Snape. Is this supposed make us sympathetic towards Snape because the class laughed when Neville used /ridiculous/ on it. Nothing came of it.

Oh what about that detention in first year where 10 times the points given for saving a student's life is taken for breaking curfew. And then sending 4 11 years(ok 3 11 and 1 12) into the forbidden forest to hunt something that kills unicorns.

What about Umbridge. Contrary popular belief Harry was not the only tortured.. oh sorry punished by her. In the movies the niece of the equivalent of the head of defense was one of them.

What about the deployment of literal soul sucking monsters at school or running multiple smear campaigns against a minor.

People say that JK Rowling shifted from a children's book to young adult's book was the reason for the many plot holes but I don't know how even the first book can be considered a children's book based on the first few chapters. We see abuse, bigotry and attempted murder within the first seven chapter. Here is an extract from seventh chapter of PoS if you don't believe me.

/"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."/

The world JK created was full of questionable stuff that should have not been in a children's book from the start.

*** I think there was severe change of directions somewhere between GoF and OotP, where still PoA was a light fairy-tale childrens books, and then suddenly in GoF one of the good guys really died. Not like, ha ha, it was funny, I haven't died really (like what happens in fairy tales), but he was really dead and Harry was struggling with nightmares for it.

I am not sure what was the reason for it, but my suspicion is that it finally hit her how incredibly successful she was, or perhaps it was the reaction to watching her own story on the silver screen, or both. Remember PS film was 2001, and OoP the book was published on 2003.

When talking about the film and the book versions of some characters (Ron, Hermione, Snape), then we have tendency to forget that in the later books, these are the film versions, then most likely even JKR herself was enchanted by Alan Rickman and Emma Watson, and the disaster which is Hermione and Ron in the latter books could be under the influence of Steve Kloves (one more thing he is guilty of).

*** Children's books have always been full of these kinds of situations. As a child, I read a 100 year old copy of Grimm's fairy tales and that had more going on than HP.

I do think that JKR should have made more effort to guide the reader towards knowing it was wrong, but one of the reasons HP was such a great children's book is that it didn't try to tell children what to think. They were able to draw their own conclusions.

If you look at Enid Blyton's work, the children often dealt with nefarious characters. The authors these days tend to guide children/young people towards knowing its bad these days, however it's not done in an obvious way.

Onjali Rauf has won awards recently for her books - >! The Boy At the Back of the Class features racist abuse and a refugee. The Star Outside My Window is far more hard hitting; the children all go on an adventure (missing from foster care) which results from the mother of the main character being murdered by her dad in an ongoing domestic violence dispute. It's all dealt with at a level suitable for children, but we need to give children more credit. !<

Susie Day's /Max Kowalski Didn't Mean It/ follows the story of a troubled boy and his siblings. Their dad goes into hiding for a few weeks to avoid arrest, leaving the children alone. Someone from his dad's gang shows up and leaves them with a load of money in suitcases, so they run away to Wales with stolen keys for a friend's holiday home.

I should add that the way these stories means that the bulk of the story is the adventure, exciting and understandable to all children with the back story slotting around it through the eyes of children. After all, these sorts of things really do happen to children and there is no harm in building empathy from their peers as long as the topic is handled responsibly.

**** I think it symbolises Harry's filter of the world. His entire life was warped by neglect and war that he never developed proper secure adult relationships and didn't work through those issues to come to the same understanding we have.

Harry came to see Snape as a hero. He idolised Dumbledore. There's an interesting moment in Cursed Child where Harry wants portrait Dumbledore's advice and Hermione, with the air of having gone over it 100 times, tries to point out that he needs to stop putting Dumbledore on a pedestal.

***** Unfortunately that sounds too smart for JKR. I think the real reason is that /she/ saw Snape and Dumbledore as heroes. There's a pretty dramatic shift in Snape's character in the last couple of books, which I think is due to Alan Rickman's portrayal of the character. Don't get me wrong, I love his version of Snape, but that's the problem. Book Snape isn't a snarky, cranky, comedic, attractive teacher with a tragic past who cares deep down, he's a disturbed man-child who abuses children, is completely irrational when his emotions get in the way (ironic considering he's one of the best Occlumens in Britain), who has an unsettling obsession with Harry's mom. Until JKR decided she wanted Alan Rickman's Snape instead of what she actually wrote.

As for Dumbledore, she's always considered him a hero and a grandfather figure to Harry, despite their few interactions up until 6th year and all the negative implications written into his character. I doubt many, if any, of those were intentional, it's just her not realizing the consequences of what she's writing. Which is unfortunately common in the Harry Potter series.
