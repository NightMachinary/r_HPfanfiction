** Well, I never shipped Sirius with anyone before, until I read linkao3(Black Mask). But that's the sequel to the much shorter In the Black.

Colette Battancourt is certainly not any of the listed stereotypes of OC love interests, and she's a solid, well-rounded original character.

Edit: note that the central focus is not the romance, it's more of a reconciliation story, but it's really good and Colette certainly highlights why the author is a very good one.
