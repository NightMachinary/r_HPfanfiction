I've been on the lookout for fics that fit this obscure mold for a while now. The HP fanfic community is huge and there are a ton of fics that feature an SI/OC, but somehow they all seem to fit into two categories. Either a) the OC wants nothing to do with the plot and quietly excels on their own, usually quickly becoming powerful in the process, or b) they involve themselves in the character's lives and do very little to change them. They aren't powerful enough to handle Voldemort on their own, and don't help the cast develop their potential or keep other characters alive. They're just along for the ride.

So, please recommend me some fics, if you have any, featuring an OC/SI that becomes friends with the main cast and pushes them to be their best. Help Ron get over his insecurity, teach Hermione to value her intuition over authority, push Harry to dive into magic and see it for the wonder it is instead of just a means to make friends, or whatever else.

Hopefully, I'd also like to avoid the sociopathic MCs who want to make the cast powerful so they can be used as pawns or bargaining chips. I'm disturbed by how common that one is.


** In both Voleur D'칙me and Greater Than the Sum, the SIs become very close to Harry and proactively help him become a powerful fighter (while also improving their own abilities, too). Action-heavy, no nonsense, progression fantasy.

The Ghost of Privet Drive has the SI become a surrogate father figure for Harry while brute-forcing the Dursleys into a respectable family, and also helping a lot of other characters on the side. Character focused, drama, hurt and comfort kinda elements, very muggle and tech/science--positive, kinda entrepreneurial/uplifting in character. Fix fic.

Evil Overlord List is kinda a border case here, since while the SI /himself/ isn't really a sociopathic or manipulative person, he wholeheartedly dotes on and helps /Tom Riddle/, who /is/ one (neither of them seem to have purely bad intentions, though). Humor, but doesn't really read like pure crack. Interesting worldbuilding, mostly competence porn. Some emotional moments later on.

  As the dementors board the Hogwarts Express, a soul from our world is merged with Neville. Contending with a resurgent Dark Lord and the weight of incomplete future knowledge is the challenge. Now he just has to see if he can rise to it. Neville!SI, Elemental Magic. Now working on the second chapter of OotP.

  A soul from our world is thrown into the body of Ron Weasley in the exact moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Teenage hormones, dark lords, and missing memories is a hell of a combination. SI

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

*** Both *Voleur D'칙me* and *Greater Than the Sum* have the SI's knowledge of the Horcruxes removed... which annoys me.

But both are really good, I just don't enjoy competent!Voldemort nor artificially ensuring he stays the main antagonist^{which I still enjoy more than competent!Voldy}... I myself feel that Voldemort is best when he is an effect of the environment; a rallying point more so than a cause for the problems.

All this being said, thanks for recommending *Greater Than the Sum* as I hadn't read that yet and it was enjoyable.

** Since Ghost of Privet Drive is already here, I'll resort to self promotion... Linkffn(Harry Potter, Self-Insert by 15Redstones)

The whole pushing people to do better will be a major part if it's not already. The plot is already changed a lot and will be beyond recognition after year 2, once I get around to writing those chapters.

** I cant remember the name of the fix, but the OC is Scott Kharan. He's from an alien race that keeps the balance of the world and is tasked with helping Harry. I think it has four parts but it's very good and complete enough to satisfy.
