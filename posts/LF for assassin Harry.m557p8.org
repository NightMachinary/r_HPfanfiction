Hello fellow readers, i would like to know if you can recommend/know a fic where Harry turns into a silent assassin through necessity. Bonus points for detailed/realistic combat writing.


** I don't have the link but i think it was called cloak and dagger or something like that. it has Harry being adopted by Blaise Zabini's mother and they both train to be assassins'.
