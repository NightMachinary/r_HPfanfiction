I'm posting this on a separate account because honestly I've always been too embarrassed to attempt to write anything. This is something I'm working on getting over and posting my writing publicly is a huge step for me.

I had been reading a lot of Draco x Reader fics (Not everyone's favorite I know) and I was never finding anything that I liked so I decided to try my own. I'm trying to stay true to my understanding of the characters, but I'm playing the overall timeline pretty loosely. Criticism would be appreciated. Thank you so much

Also title recs would be GREATLY appreciated.


** Okay just to be upfront, I'm not at all interested in this kind of story, but already the first paragraph has a problem:

#+begin_quote
  Draco didn't bother to say good morning to you as he left the breakfast hall for potions class. Since you had been sorted Griffyndor he figured that everyone had turned you against him by now. He cringed at what stories you must have heard about him up in Gryffindor tower last night. He hurried his pace as if he wanted to leave the thought behind him in the corridor. He really liked you too. If only you had been put in Slytherin.
#+end_quote

[btw: I hate how so many sites try to prevent you from copy and pasting. It's not difficult to get aroudn for someone determined, just annoying... not directed at you, just venting]

This story is written from a limited POV of the reader right? And already in the first paragraph you're breaking the convention by telling me what Draco thinks in his head. I have no idea what Draco thinks or what he cringes about unless he tells me. It's pretty funny how self-absorbed Draco is that he thinks Gryffindor has nothing better to do than discuss him all the time.

This - sort of - continues:

#+begin_quote
  *They had lunch reservations with his mother, and she was not a patient woman*.
#+end_quote

Maybe I'm supposed to infer that they told me that they had reservations and that Narcissa is an impatient woman, but it sounds very much like an omniscient narrator here again.

#+begin_quote
  You were even bold enough to introduce yourself to his father.
#+end_quote

This is an awful lot of telling instead of showing.

Also immediately after the introduction we jump to saying goodbye, this time at least you're giving the actual dialogue, that's good. Why am I introducing myself to the Malfoys? Why do I know them by sight? It's okay if you want to establish some mystique with this, but these kind of questions should be answered sooner rather than later. If no answer comes up at some point I'll just nope out of the fic. (But I get the impression that you're just slowly giving out the information on the background of the main character, that's cool... just needed to be said)

It's a bit weird though to have this whole flashback when the only part of this sequence starts in the present. Maybe give a bit longer introduction in the present?

The original problem seems to continue throughout:

#+begin_quote
  Later that afternoon Draco asked his father about (Y/N)'s mother. Did he say she had died? What happened? Why had mother never mentioned her before?
#+end_quote

Why do I know what Draco and his father talked about later in the afternoon!?

Since I can come across as harsh let me say something nice: It's obvious that you put a lot of care and attention into this. The formatting/paragraphs are good, the speech is decent and there are no glaring grammatical errors that sprang into my eye.

I just have zero interest in "Reader self insert" fics and even less interest in Draco as a romantic partner for myself or - honestly - anyone. So this is already more than I would have normally read.

Is it normal for "Reader insert" fics to have th reader be some kind of god? If not you really should reconsider the POV.

*** Thank you SO much for your feedback, especially considering that this isn't a fic you wouldn't usually read. I can understand how cringey this kind of stuff is if you're not into it.

I wanted to start the fic from draco's perscpective and have been writing back and forth with draco's side and the reader's. All the time in fics I see "**** YOUR POV ****" to mark switches in the point of view which I dislike and I thought that writing it this way would be alright. I'm kind of just going along with the reader insert genre because thats what I see and read most often.

I will go back and flesh out the intro and the flashback moment to include your suggestions and try to clarify the perspective. Thank you for your advice! And I'm glad to hear that there aren't any huge grammatical errors.

**** There's a technique called baton pass in order to shift POV during a scene, but I'm really not sure how you want to handle that when going from 2nd to 3rd person... it sounds awkward as fuck. Personally I'd try to separate such radical POV shifts by chapter in order to be less confusing if you're insistent on having them at all.

***** Thank you! I'm looking up good writing techniques for POV switching now. It wouldn't be so bad if I switched the entire second person "you" to the third person "she" would it? It makes no difference to me if its a true reader insert fic. Maybe switching everything over now would save me a headache in the long run.
