While looking through my old games i stumbled over dungeon keeper, remembered with fondness how much i loved it, and now i just absolutely have a craving for a crossover! Harry having imps and building his own underground lair sounds just like the thing i need ! Any such fics you guys can reccomend?


** I think there is Only a single worthwhile dungeon keeper fic out there and it's a crossover with sailor moon

** I found a single one (in English; there's another in German) on FFN, but I have no idea how good it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12958790/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Dungeon-Heart-2018]]
