Is there any fic that have Harry being incredibly smart in school, and when going to Hogwarts he modified thd simple trunk that Hagrid bought him(with runes/ accidental magic, etc) and he is advanced in his studies and eventually makes his own things( trunks,brooms like that) ?? Any bashing except Harry's...


** There's a recent fic called Potter Broom Company , where Harry starts a broom company with Hermione and Ron during 1st or 2nd year

** I can't think of one one where Harry modifies his first trunk but In linkffn(For The Love Of Magic) there Is a decent amount of enchantment as well as an extremely smart Harry and it gives a lot of depth to the theory behind enchantment and magic in general. Be warned this fic is not for everyone. But try not to nope out at the Zoe bit and stick with it. It gets really good
