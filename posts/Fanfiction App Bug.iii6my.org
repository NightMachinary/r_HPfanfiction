So apparently when I'm on the app and I'm going to go look for a new crossover I scroll down the list and it's a repeat of the same ones over and over again all the way to the bottom but the thing is the ones that are repeated like near the bottom I click on it and it's another one

Ex: It says "Lord Of The Rings (1k)" but when I click on it it changes into "Watch Dogs (6)"

So yeah the list is broken.

Also, is there any way to fix this?
