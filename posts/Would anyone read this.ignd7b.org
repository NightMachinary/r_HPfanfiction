I've been thinking about this idea a lot lately and I think I'm going to write but I don't know if I should post it when I finish. Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor are in love with each other, but after founding Hogwarts together along with Helga and Rowena, their beliefs and views of the world start to clash, causing a drift in their relationship and eventually leading to Salazar leaving. Keep in mind that I am a Slytherin and that I have read the hell out of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling by Annerb]] and probably will do so again many times, so I won't be looking at things in the black and white way that most people do. You know the whole “Slytherin was evil and Gryffindor was an angel” type of characterization. Real people are much more complicated than that. Would there actually be an audience for that??


** Make is nsfw

Just please don't make it about witch hunts. For a good chunk of the Middle Ages, they were actually banned by Papal decree and/or secular law. They only really started taking off in the 15th century and then the reformation, which is a few centuries after Hogwarts was founded.

*** Well, there goes my opening scene. Then again this is an AU, so if I can't figure out a motive for establishing Hogwarts, I can just make them do it a few centuries later. Right???

**** That would work, but probably interferes with the background lore. If you want another motive, there's St Patrick in Irland who liberated the Island from snakes. I've seen a few fics which made him a parselmouth due to that, which would put him in Slytherin's line somewhere. So maybe have a proto SoS argument from that about non interference in the Muggle world with Slytherin saying "fine, we don't interfere. But that means no Muggleborns" because of the issues regarding secrecy and non interference they could cause.
