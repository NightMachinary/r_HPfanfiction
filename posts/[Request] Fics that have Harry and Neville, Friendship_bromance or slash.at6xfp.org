Any fic that has Harry and Neville as major characters. Their relationship is the central of the fic.

POV should either be Harry's or Neville's.

Any kind of relationship will do: Strong friendship or bromance or slash.

In other words, Neville is just as important or more so than Hermoine or Ron or Ginny.

No sane Voldemort and good death eaters, please. No smut.


** Becoming Neville is good I've heard.I believe Neville moves in with Harry or Lupin.The FFN version has no slash but the other does.I'm not sure what website has the slash version.

  A collection of stories that are up for l are rated M. Most are pretty long reads as well. If any of you want to adopt, just PM me. HPSS, HPDT, HPLL, HPNL, het, slash, threesomes, trans, vamp, AU, a little of everything!

** Silly at times, and too serious towards the end for how the story starts, but I think it's a fun story with a good Harry and Neville friendship that's worth a read, especially considering what you're looking for.

** linkffn(12798964)

In /Life is Beautiful/ Harry has a nihilistic worldview as a defence mechanism wherein he cares about nothing and acts as though nothing truly upsets him. He has thoroughly convinced himself that he really is happy and the narration reflects that. It's quite worrying.

Neville, in this, is Harry's only real friend. Everyone else who appears to be his friend is there because he says he doesn't mind either way but he does truly care about Neville and it seems like that the slash referenced in the description will include those two.

  Harry realises something when he is nine years old that changes his life forever. Follow Harry as he drifts through life, simply happy that he can see the sky. Happy!Harry Neglected!Harry (apparently this has turned into my new major fic, who'd have guessed it?). SLASH IN THE FUTURE (fourth year)
