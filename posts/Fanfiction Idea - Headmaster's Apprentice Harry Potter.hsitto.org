Hello, I'm a fanfiction writer, and I don't have as much time as I used to. I'd like it if someone would co-author a fic with me, or I'd be willing to co-author on their fic.

If you're interested, please ask for my discord. (If that doesn't work, we can figure something out.)

---

This idea was brought up by this post: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hs95cr/harry_becomes_headmaster/]]

And I thought...what if instead of being put in houses future headmasters were given to the current headmaster, like an apprenticeship. So Harry was announced as "Headmaster's Apprentice" for his house, everything else is fairly normal, but he's allowed to sit wherever he wants, with the teachers or the houses. Unlike other students, he has classes during the weekend where he learns how to take care of Hogwarts. After he graduates he, would take a teacher's position until the previous headmaster decides he's ready for the role.

You could go a lot of places with this, it would be fun!

I should also mention it's been a little while since I've read the books, and I've just recently started to rewatch the movies. Sorry if anything is incorrect.

EDIT:\\
I would also love to have any suggestions or feedback, even if you don't plan to help write. : )


** I think there was a fic like this a while back but it needed up bashing a lot of characters

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

**** No I don't think so. It was a fairly long fic where Harry gets flitwick as his head and his dorm is a private apartment

** What exactly do you mean by co-authoring? I'm really interested in this but i don't have the time to write a full length fic

*** Neither do I. Updates will probably be slow.

But I'm willing to work with you. That being said, what do you want Co-Authoring to mean? I need someone who can write certain parts that I'm not good at and help me with lore. I don't have the best of memory and would hate to have continuity errors. Maybe even a Beta Reader position if that's all you want to do.

**** Yep. I'm willing to be a beta reader, and will also help you wherever needed if you want me to. If the update frequency is 1 week or more, it would be perfect for me. How do I contact you?
