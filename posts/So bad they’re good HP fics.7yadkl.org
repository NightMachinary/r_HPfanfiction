Any recommendations? I know about My Immortal but I am 100% certain that one is a troll fic. I love reading fics that are so terrible they are hilarious and engaging and HP just adds to the humour cake so any suggestions would be appreciated. :) I don't mind what genre or rating.

Preferably recent and on-going fics...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] By Sarah1281 might be one, but it ended up being so good. Harry just tries to fix everything! In such a calm fashion as well. Plus, Harry acted so ridiculous it became a highly amusing. linkffn(4536005)

The [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071][Switchverse]] series by corvidae9. I am pretty sure the story was suppose to be a crack fic where the Twins simply messed with the Sorting Hat and made it drunk, but the story came out to be absolutely amazing! (All the chapters was not posted in Ao3, however, they are all posted in [[https://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html][LiveJournal]].) linkao3(10621071)

*** i kinda disagree here (could be semantics) because i enjoyed the switchverse series a lot. a slightly cracky starting point doesnt make a fic terrible or even bad. This fic has great character development since the beginning, no overdone tropes or bashing and a decent grasp of orthography.

**** I am not saying either of the fics I listed are at all bad. Actually, it's the opposite. I think what made me recommend them was the fact the authors executed their respective tropes so brilliantly where other fics seems to lack. What the creator of this post asked for was paradoxical, so I infer that they were asking for fics that could have been written badly but ended up being one of the best things they have read.

***** ok i am not sure what exactly the poster wants but i would interpret it completely different, fics that have a lot of badly executed and overdone tropes, bashing and ridiculous twists that makes reading really funny. he says he likes fics that are so terrible that they are hilarious which doesnt fit the switchverse at all.

****** I think can see what you mean. I apologize if I may sound misinformed, but I read the story back in December so my memory might be a but fuzzy. I found my old review I posted, so I think I can see where you are coming from:

#+begin_quote
  “This series is really a brilliant piece of work. I love the chaos from the beginning with the amusing storyline and how it slowly became something more of unique plot. The characters then accepted their house despite what each one is famous for. You don't truly bash anyone specifically either. You let the characters judge others because it's natural as well as part of their personalities and choices.”
#+end_quote

Regardless, if the poster of finds that the story isn't what they are looking for they can disregard it.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
