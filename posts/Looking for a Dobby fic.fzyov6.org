** Huh, is there one where he doesn't? By this point overpowered elf popping is a clich√©. I'm rather tired of seeing Dobby being able to just drop bombs on the middle of Voldemort's meetings.

There's a story who's name I can't remember which made a house elf the choosen one. The prophecy even fit (which admittedly isn't hard to do).
