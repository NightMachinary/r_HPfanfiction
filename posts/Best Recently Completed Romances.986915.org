Looking for any good love story, personal preference is non-slash, but I'll take anything.


** This one is Pansy/Neville but it's fun and well written. It's not exactly finished but it has finished Part 1 so that's 15 chapters

  All Neville wanted to do was make it through the school year without incident; and if fate would allow, marry Hannah Abbott. But it would seem fate has other plans. Slughorn has a Stroke, MacMillan ruins his life, and Parkinson begins teaching at Hogwarts. Neville had given up being an auror for a more quiet life. This year promises to be anything but.
