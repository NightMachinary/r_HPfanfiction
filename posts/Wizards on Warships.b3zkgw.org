I was just thinking (dangerous, that) and the thought crossed my mind that quite literally every single battle/scene in fanfiction is either on land or on a broom/in the air. If a ship is mentioned, it is almost always in passing (the schooner in Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer) or as a more or less stationary set piece that doesn't move or interact with other warships (as in Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool with the SS Goatfucker).

Taking into account that electricity and magic don't get along, what era ships would the magical world use, and would there ever be a naval battle? What would such a battle be like? Would the big guns on these warships be used the muggle way (as a range of ten miles beats the hell out of a wand)?

I could see old wood-hulled ships being used a lot, but fire spells are a thing and wood happens to burn, so in a battle I'm not so sure. On the other hand, US Civil War era ironclads are also available, but are frankly uglier than sin and wizards seem to like pretty things. Perhaps early dreadnoughts with steam turbines?

I mostly just want to see what everyone thinks of my line of thought.

As a quick side note, I'm doing this on mobile so the extent of my formatting options is the return key. I'll probably edit this on my laptop in the future for formatting.

Cheers all, Erebus out.


** Other than the Durmstrang galleon, our only reference to ships is from Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  There is one major exception to the general magical aversion to Muggle technology, and that is the car (and, to a lesser extent, motorbikes and trains). Prior to the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, wizards and Muggles used the same kind of everyday transport: horse-drawn carts and sailing ships among them. The magical community was forced to abandon horse-drawn vehicles when they became glaringly outmoded. It is pointless to deny that wizardkind looked with great envy upon the speedy and comfortable automobiles that began filling the roads in the twentieth century, and eventually even the Ministry of Magic bought a fleet of cars, modifying them with various useful charms and enjoying them very much indeed.

So we know that wizards once used ships. The question is whether they still use them.

I would argue that they probably do. While apparition, portkey etc. is all superior as a means of personal transportation, there remains the question of /freight/. How do you transport a herd of hippogriffs? How do shops and craftspeople in Britain obtain magical materials which are grown in Brazil? These things are (probably) too voluminous to be transported by portkey. So ships seem the most likely means of moving magical freight across large distances.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time.

** It all depends on just how good Portkeys are.

We know from GoF that Portkeys are used for international transportation. If they can be used to easily travel across the ocean in seconds, and if they can also transport freight, then there would be no reason for wizards to use boats except for recreational purposes.

The point of battleships in the first place, apart from defending against enemy battleships, is create blockades to cut off the enemy's supply lines.

Since wizards wouldn't be reliant on boats for supplies, there wouldn't be much gained from controlling the oceans, so there would be no point in naval combat.

If Portkeys are severely limited in their use and wizards still need boats to transport goods around, then blocking enemy ships and thus engaging in naval combat would be viable, but I don't really think that it's the case.

The Wizarding World is just too different from the muggle world. The territory that can be fought over consists of separated enclaves like Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and maybe Godricks Hollow. There are no front lines like in a traditional war. Instead, any wizarding war would mostly consist of surprise raids on enemy locations, like the ministry, a Death Eater hideout or Hogwarts. All battles are relatively short and decisive. Cutting off supply of food is basically impossible since anyone can just steal from a muggle store. Cutting off the supply of wizard goods like wands is accomplished by kidnapping the only wandmaker in the country. Cutting off international travel is impossible since anyone could steal some muggle money and get on an airplane even if all international Portkeys and Floo connections are cut off.

The only reason for wizards to use boats is to show off, as the only ship we actually see getting used for travel is the Durmstrang ship which just teleports to the Hogwarts lake so even it couldn't be stopped by battleships.

The only instances where boats are actually used by wizards to cross the Atlantic Ocean without teleportation are in the Fantastic Beasts series where I assume Portkeys aren't common yet, and both cases (Newt arriving in NY in Fantastic Beasts and the sinking ship in The Crimes of Grindelwald) are muggle ships that wizards couldn't blockade without risking the statute of secrecy.

So, with wizards not reliant on their own ships for travel and trade, there's not really a point in naval battle.

*** Portkeys are noted to be none too pleasant to travel with. I would personally make a guess that more delicate things that take offense at being spun and twirled at high speed would be loaded into a ship. It might not need to be a big ship (expansion charms are a thing after all) but a ship nonetheless.

Now then, the size of ships is also a thing. In poor weather a small ship wouldn't fare overly well, regardless of how unbreakable the hull is, merely because water always finds a way in eventually. Something at least slightly larger therefore makes a bit more sense, not that wizards care, even if they do like their comforts.

As a final thought, during WWII I could absolutely see Grindelwald attempt to sneak a set of his wizards in on a disguised/disillusioned/undetectable cargo ship or something. At the very least a warship may have made an appearance there, however brief, as Britain and Co. tried to stop the thing. Cheers all.

**** I think the use cases for ships in the magical world are too rare to sustain magical shipping businesses so most would probably just buy space on a muggle ship. And a wizard battleship attacking a muggle ship would cause a lot of trouble. Considering the small size of the magical world and the lower importance of naval combat I doubt it would make sense to have battleships when a few broom riders could attack enemy ships just fine.

** We know wizards travelled on ships with early waves of colonisation to new continents, but other than that, there's no indication that they'd need to. Portkeys are a lot easier for intercontinental travel, while apparition or flight would suffice for getting to closer islands (e.g. across the English Channel). So it makes sense that there's not much need for traditional ocean travel, and especially not for naval battles.

We do see one ship, which is the Durmstrang ship, and it resembles a 16th century Spanish galleon. It also travels underwater and can jump from the sea to inland lakes, making it difficult to intercept and avoiding the need for surface battles. Though an underwater magic battle between two ships like that would be really cool.

If they were to have surface naval battles, I do think sailing ships would fit the wizarding aesthetic more than ironclads. Yes, there are fire spells, but there's also plenty of ways to put them out. Potentially you might have a big fleet of small ships rather than a few big ones, since the smaller ships would be easier to shield. On the other hand, a big ship would be better able to resist a sea monster like the Giant Squid.

Given that magic is going to be the main means of propulsion, the sails or steam turbines on such a ship would probably be purely decorative.

The sails would be real, but the conjured wind means that the wizards working them can get away with being completely crap at sailing.

***** That would certainly be logical. However, most wizards haven't an ounce of logic. They need to sail, so they get a ship with sails. Learning to work the sails seems like a frightful bore, so they conjure exactly the wind they need and charm the rudder to steer the right course and spend the voyage on the important stuff, namely figuring out how to get the firewhisky enchantments to work on rum.

** Modern (20th century) warships would be vastly superior due to the fire control. You could easily fight at 5 or more sea miles while a sail ship is limited to a mile max. Casting spells with a wand is way to inaccurate for long range engagements, therefore the primary armament would probably be enchanted naval artillery. Which is where superior fire control and direction would be the deciding factor. Also, many small guns have a smaller effect than a few big ones. Just look at the Battle damages sustained at Jutland (excluding the exploding battle cruisers since that was faulty ammunition handling). The Warspite took an absolute pounding but the German 11 and 12 inch shells caused way less damage than the British 15s in return.

And a modern design would certainly be faster since it's more hydrodynamic (if you can speedboost a sail ship, you can do the same to a destroyer, which therefore keeps its speed advantage). As aesthetically pleasing as sail ships would be, the design is too outdated to be relevant. I mean, why magic a ship of the line when you could magic a light cruiser instead?

*** That is sort of my thought process, but those light cruisers you speak of use a lot of electrical relays and wiring, both for lights and the operation of the turrets (both for aiming/firing and for communicating from fire control where to aim). Wizards, first and foremost, seem to be quite lazy. Instead of ripping all of that out, I would think they would simply use something a bit older. A pre-dreadnought like the USS Olympia comes to mind, as it has little electrically to go wrong and still has fairly heavy weaponry, for a ship built in the 1880s anyways.

**** So? Magic and electricity do not interfere, otherwise there'd be a massive no go area in the middle of London. Arthur uses magic to fix an electrical fire. You only get problems around Hogwarts, and even then anything but the electronic detection systems (radar, maybe sonar) would be fine. Especially the older systems (1930s) would be pretty immune to the kind of interference you can expect from magic since there is no complex circuitry but rather simple electrical engines which drive turrets and ammunition hoists.

** You know what this post reminded me of? I'm really looking forward to future chapters of Invincible by Darth Marrs. It's a HP/Battlestar Galactica crossover, but we haven't gotten to the xover part yet.

The mixing of magic and technology would be even more of a problem in space travel sci-fi crossovers. Are there any stories that explore this topic? There'd be plenty of potential fandoms to explore after all, like Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Battlestar Galactica to name just a few.
