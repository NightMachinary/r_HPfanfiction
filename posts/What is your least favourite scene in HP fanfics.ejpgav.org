I'm not talking about pet peeves, pairing or tropes here, but rather specific scenes. Which one would you say are the worst?


** For me, Dumbledore rushing Harry into his office to discuss something has to be some of the worst writing you can find. You can have a lot of fun if you write a manipulative Dumbledore as long as he's competent. But the whole "Harry gets summoned after acting independently" thing is just bad all around. A good manipulative Dumbledore would never need to confront Harry in such a way and Harry would never notice Dumbledore's nature.

The scene has a predetermined outcome (Harry outwits Dumbledore) and the only variation you get is whether Dumbledore will shout or do the "disappointment" routine and if he will accidentally reveal some dark secret like rape drugging the entire school.

*** A large chunk of those rides on the trope that everyone automatically bows down to Dumbledore (besides fifth year stuff), and Dumbles gets surprised when Harry doesn't automatically bow.

How many times did Harry go to Dumbles' office in fifth year?

And let's face it, a truly manipulative Dumbledore would be wasted on the wizarding world. And he would be in charge anyway. The main part of Manipulative Dumbledore is delusions of Grandeur or he's just flat out crazy.

***** Or Harry is no threat to a manipulative Dumbledore. Remember, Dumbledore's endgame was defeating Voldemort.

Let's say that Harry does something unexpected which goes against Dumbledore's main plan. A good manipulative Dumbledore would either have contingencies in place or simply watch how Harry's "independence" plays out, maybe trying to subtly guide him rather than throw a fit. Harry got emancipated? So what? He's not about to run off to Voldemort and fuck his way through the death Eaters. Let the boy have some fun and only keep an eye on him.

**** The Marauders never seemed to be fond of the style of pranks Fred and George liked. Fred and George were very unconventional and elaborate in their troublemaking- much of their stuff required a lot of work beforehand to set up. The Marauders on the other hand prefered directly humiliating people.

Where Fred and George created various pranking gadgets to use later (extendable ears and canary creams) the Marauders just went for the direct option (levicorpus).

*** Quidditch matches are fun to write if you make liberal use of the commentator. Backiin the day people were glued to radio sets listening to football matches. If you can capture even part of that spirit, such scenes can be very good. If the focus is just on Harry, it gets repetitive and boring very quickly.

Pranks are often just another term for assault, quite often even of the sexual nature (enchanted mistletoes, lust potions, love potions).

*** The Dursleys being abusive is canon though. That being said, I agree that quite a few authors overdo it and end up writing hilarious, over-the-top scenes which were not supposed to be funny.

**** In canon, the Dursley were neglecting Harry. He was only wearing 2nd hand clothes, but he was fed (except that one summer before 4th yezr where the whole family was on diet )and as long as he did his chores, and didn't do anything magic, they were happy to ignore him. Even violence seemed pretty rare (cant remember except the "put by force in the closet " at the start of PS". Honestly, if not for the "sleep in the closet", I'm not even sure his situation was bad enough for social services to intervene with the standard of the 80's.

In fanon, the Dursley are some kind of monsters that beat Harry daily, break his bones weekly and feed him monthly. And the only reason his survived is because "his magic protected him". Even though the Dursley want to appear "normal " and an underfed dead nephew in the closet is really far from normal.

And it is a lot more than just the cupboard. For example, imagine if Petunia's swing with the frying pan connected. Against a child's skull, such an impact can easily cause lasting injuries and even death. So attempted Grivous bodily harm, or even manslaughter.

*** Least favourite to read. A scene you dislike no matter who writes it, so spelling should not matter since different authors are unlikely to make the same mistakes.

**** Oh okay! Well I guess then I don't like scenes where Hermione is like super smart and full grown adults are idiots. Like in one fanfic I read where Hermione was with Unspeakables talking to Fudge about Harry's Horcrux and Hermione kept correcting Fudge and belittling him and he barely even understood the concept or conversation like he was two or something. He also kept sputtering and getting pulled back on track by Hermione.

She was like eleven in that fic I think. It is always so ridiculous. You do not have go to THAT far to make the Ministry seem bad! It is made up of people after all. Not everyone is an extreme moron like that. :( Mr. Weasley works there too.
