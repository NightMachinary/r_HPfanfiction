Things where even having magic and several million people isn't enough.

-Getting people to get along peacefully

-Stable government that isn't corrupt

-Good economic policy

-Intellectual property (books, art, inventions, quality journalism, software) would not be significantly easier produced with magic, population is significantly smaller than the muggle one so less total productivity

-Making certain goods like dragon leather more affordable

-Ultra large scale things like changing the position, rotation or temperature of an entire planet or star (changing the temperature of Earth might be something they should try)

*** Nah, they' could just Arresto Momentum a single part of each moving spaceship and completely wreck it. Destroying fast moving things is really easy with that. But something like the Protomolecule could become very difficult to deal with.

** the internet. The wizarding world can easily be exposed on the internet and it would be so hard for them to track down all the clips and posts exposing them I think. Even more it would be hard to know who to obliviate if something to exposing got out because it can have millions of anonymous views. I bet things like small youtube clips of things like ‚Äúman disappears!‚Äù would go viral where someone caught a wizard disaperating and things like that. They would probably have to get a team of muggleborns to navigate this issue bc it's not like the pure bloods will understand the internet or have spells to magically make all the wizarding world internet leaks disappear
