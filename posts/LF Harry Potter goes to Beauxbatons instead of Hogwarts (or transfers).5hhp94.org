As silly as it may sound, just reading the short little "Prompt Response: What if Dobby worked smarter not harder?" by [[/u/bendertotes]] posted today... (fun stuff), made me realize how much I have been wanting to read some good Harry goes to Beauxbatons stories (while waiting for bendertotes to continue heh).

So I am looking for such stories. He can go from the very start, or transfer at some point from Hogwarts.

I would prefer some Romance involved at some point. I would, of course, prefer a finished story. I prefer more Mature content, but any rating is fine. No slash.

Other then that no real limits... It can be dark or light, funny or serious, cannon related or completely fresh, and so on...

Please suggest and thanks!


** /The Accidental Bond/, linkffn(5604382): Harry and his girls had been preparing to leave Hogwarts after Year 2. There was no easy language translation spells in this story, so they had to learn French the hard way.

/The Dark Lord Never Died/, linkffn(11773877): A very smart Lucy Malfoy kicked Dumbledore and his Order out of Britain in 1981, so Harry and Co went to Beauxbaton instead. The story picks up almost 20 years later when they finally graduated and were combat ready.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** Sadly i have read the first one already, but thanks.

And the second, while on my list to read, doesnt seem to be what I was hoping for. To my understanding it doesn't have much in the way of actual Beauxbatons in it other then they went there in the past. Doesn't nearly the entire thing take place 20 years later as you said?

**** Yes, the main story began in 1999, and their lives at Beauxbaton only appeared in flashbacks.

***** It has Ron/Hermione marked as a pairing but Harry isn't marked at all. Is that just an oversight or does Harry just not play a very big role? I'm not much of a fan of fics that don't have him as a main character and Ron/Hermione isn't really my thing either.

Does the romance play a big role and how important is Harry? (Also who's Harry's love interest if there is one?)

****** Harry plays a big role, he's just not the main character, and he's with Ginny.

This story is extreme AU, so they will be different due to their different upbringings.

The romance between Ron and Hermione is central to the plot, as it forces major change to Dumbledore's original plan.

Overall, I like this story very much. The final battle is one of the best I've seen. Lucius Malfoy, although a seriously bad guy, is actually fun to read.

** I remember reading one 10+ years ago where Harry got expelled at the Dementor trial so he went to Beauxbatons instead. I don't recall much more than that, except that one of the older students was Snape's daughter. (I don't /think/ she was a Mary Sue, or took over the story or anything like that, but as I said it's been a while so I could be wrong.) Unfortunately I don't recall the title or author, but perhaps someone else recognises it.
