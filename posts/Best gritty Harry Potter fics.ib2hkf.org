*** Thank you! I have actually read it -I've been reading OceanBreeze7's work since back when Antithesis was called Shadowed Malice(I am so glad she redid it! It's amazing). She has a few other great stories on ao3 as well. This is an awesome fic though! I've reread it a few times!

***** No but honestly- I think I started reading your work back when you'd write Percy Jackson and Dr Who fics in like 2010 or something. I was so excited when I saw that you were doing Antithesis! Your writing has gotten so good-you're really talented! Even if the ending of Antithesis made me throw some things lol

****** Oh my!! A really old one! That must be so wild for you to have been following me and see me improve. You must have been around for a decade now! I've learned a lot from trial and error, and took some courses. won a few writing contests. It's amazing what you can accomplish when you really try and focus on a special niche that interests you üòÅ

****** Oh god I was so bad!! I can't even read it anymore! The amount of views that thing has is the only reason I won't delete it! It's practically a historical story at this point üòÖ

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
