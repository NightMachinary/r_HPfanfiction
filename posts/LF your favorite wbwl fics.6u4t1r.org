** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived]])

This was one of the first stories I read when first starting out. Also taught me that many good stories, always seem to be unfinished.

My tastes have certainly changed over the years, so I am not entirely sure how it has held up.

At the very least, I hope it gives you something to read if you have exhausted all other options.

*** Same! I loved it at the time, but looking back on it, some of this stuff is some complete bullshit. It was an interesting idea, and I think if the ages are changed, it'll definitely help.

Also, looking back, I can't get behind wbwl fics, mostly because the James and Lily that JKR writes about seem to be family oriented and would never straight abandon a child.

** Both are currently updating:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). I talk about this fic way too much. Super recommended. The author attempts to take all the WBWL clich√©s, as well as a lot of inconsistent parts of canon, and make it all logically fit together.

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches). A good read. It has a lot of issues, but at the end of the day it's pretty fun. It's also the only harem story I know where the girls actually are characters (and not just collectibles).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** WBWL IDEA- One parent survives, both babies survive. Said parent becomes too depressed (after losing their significant other) to take care of both children so said parent gives up the one they believe is not the boy who lives.

The child who is not the boy who lived is given away to a Wizarding family where he is grown up loved and treated well. So is the other child and the remaining parent realizes that their significant other is in that child. The remaining parent, now broken out of their depression, sets on a quest to find their other child.

OPTIONAL- Sadly, the said parent is obliviated and loses their memories of the other child.
