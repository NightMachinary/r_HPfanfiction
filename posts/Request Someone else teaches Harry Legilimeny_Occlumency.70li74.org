Looking for stories where someone other then Snape teaches Harry Legillmany/Occlumency

Any rating is fine. Fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. Would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** In my story "Divided and Entwined", Dumbledore teaches Harry Legilimency. Generally, if Harry learns Occlumency, I'll have it taught by Remus Lupin, such as in "Patron".

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
