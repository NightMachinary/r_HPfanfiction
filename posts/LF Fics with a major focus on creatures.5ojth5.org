I just finished the Queen Who Fell To Earth series, and I enjoyed Harry Crow, long as it was. Are there any other fics like them, which put focus on a non-human species? Creature!Harry, raised by creature!Harry or just Harry interacting with creatures in an indepth way.

Bashing, slash and crossovers are fine. Please no genderbending, mpreg, romance driven plots or pottercest. Thank you!


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has a decent focus on werewolves, if I recall. Probably maybe abandoned?

** linkffn(6769957), "Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone", by NothingPretentious, is pretty good, though unfortunately unfinished. Also, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/]["India"]], which is focused on..owls, and Hedwig, and probably isn't what you're looking for, but I'll link it anyway.
