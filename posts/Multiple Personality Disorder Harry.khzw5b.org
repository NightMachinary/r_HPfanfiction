Not sure if it's been done yet.

Harry has never been very healthy in the mental side of things. Early childhood trauma followed by systematic neglect, abuse and violence didn't help. At the point of turning 11 he already shows the early signs of potential Dissociative Personality Disorder ( sociopath). But then a huge upheaval. Harry is a wizard. In the wizarding world a new side of harry starts to form. He's more brave and outspoken, a Gryffindor if you will. The side of harry that grew up at the Dursley's fades away. At the end of each year a violent confrontation happens. And each time a different part of harry arises. This part is harsher, determined to survive, but still fair. This goes on for a while. A cycle. Dursley's Harry, Hogwarts Harry, Hero Harry and then back again.

But the resurrection of Voldemort was the breaking point. Harry was in full hero mode, and gets hit with the Cruciatus Curse. He is held under for what seems like a short time, but really was much longer than he ever knew. Nearly as long as the Longbottoms. And Harry broke. From that point on there are multiple Harry's. Over the summer another is created Angry Harry. All of these Harry's return to Hogwarts and the introduction of Umbridge. Harry is not aware of his different selves, nor are they self aware.

All throughout his year Harry has various problems with memories, odd thoughts and voices. But he is told they are placed there by Voldemort. And Harry is told to learn Oclumency. Snape can't find the various "Harry's" as they are a masterful form of blocking things out. Partitioned away so.well even Harry still doesn't know of them.

When harry sees Sirius fall through the veil a final break happens. And this one is different. You see it's name is Tom. And he is aware of all the Harry's in his mind. And Tom is very very angry.

Tom was the horcrux in harry. But it was a scrap of what a correct horcrux should have been and as such was only able to be part of a person, a broken piece of Tom among the Harry's.

Voldemort ends up possessing Harry while the Tom peice is in control. And is thrown out by the sheer chaos in Harry/s/Tom's mind. He flees after asking what Harry had done to himself? Dumbledore a shrewd wise wizard uses Legilimency. He is horrified thinking that Harry is now overtaken by the Horcrux. He subdues harry and takes him to St. mungo's in hopes of treating him. The story ends with the Tom part talking to all the other harry parts and promising them everything they ever wanted. Only if he gets control. They slowly break down and agree.

In the early hours of the morning "Harry Potter" broke free of his bonds and killed every one in the secure ward at St Mungo's and disappeared.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381][Broken Mind Fractured Soul]] by sensiblyTainted. Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else. complete.

Fortunately, he didn't want to be a blacksmith. If you don't care about this post enough to re-read it, why should we care enough to read it?
