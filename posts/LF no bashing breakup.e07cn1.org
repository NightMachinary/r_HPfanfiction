** I had a one-shot example where Hermione and Ron behave like a normal human beings and split rather well in linkao3(20141410), but it is really short and no plot whatsoever.

*** I get that making people act in character is kinda hard but it feels a little like a stealth endorsement of Romione when they make Ron OOC to break them up.

Couldn't either of them meet someone who basically respects them? Couldn't they just realize they literally have nothing in common, nothing they'd enjoy doing together, or talking about, once the war is over? Why would you need Ron to become an abusive alcoholic cheater when their relationship was so clearly a mistake from minute one?

**** I actually like canonical pairings (I spent incredible amount of time reading everything by Northumbrian, and he persuaded me that the canonical pairings can be done well), but this was just a reaction to reading linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona), which is just something so incredibly awful, that I was just crying out for somebody behaving like a normal humans.

Concerning Romione. As I am getting older (coming on fifty in couple of years) I saw so many different relationships which work (and ones which don't), that I am hesitant to say what will work and what won't. Opposite attracts could very well be the foundation of a good relationships, when they have enough wisdom to let other complement missing parts of one another.

Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad and I'm definitely not just being insecure about a guilty pleasure of mine. Augurey good.

^{Yeah, the Ron bashing was kinda painful. It's not the worst I've seen, but it was still completely unnecessary.}

***** Contempt is a pretty common theme in relationships that don't work out and is a defining feature of Romione's relationship.

****** That's your interpretation of their relationship not the canonical facts, read couple of Northumbrian stories to see how they could work together (or linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) for that matter).

#+begin_quote
  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.
