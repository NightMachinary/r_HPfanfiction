I don't know yet if the basilisk will be the creature on darkness ascendant or something else like a gorgon hybrid but I just mused on the idea that the basilisk due to being so old has a film overs its eyes causing it to petrify instead of kill or its just magically weak due to old age.


** I haven't read your fic, so I maybe missing context. My first thought was it could work but feels like an unneeded stretch. The basilisk killed Moaning Myrtle like 50 years before CoS. If the basilisk has really been around since nearly the school's founding, 50 years seems like a relatively small time period for old age to set in. Since reflections are the explanation everyone is familiar with, people accept that readily, so you'd have to explain your change well enough to convince people.

*** Perhps Caught by the one clear eye which ended up cataracted over in the next fifty years? Or there was an opening in the cataract of one eye that fully closed over by 92.

The whole thing is the constant "oh, reflection/object in the way saves the day" thing has always bugged me.

Maybe you've already encountered them, but there are explanations.

The first is that Diarymort /purposefully/ had the Basilisk only Petrify people because he remembered that the last time someone died, it nearly closed down Hogwarts. So he'd follow his victim around and only tell the Basilisk to open her eyes when they came in front of a reflective substance.

The second is that Ginny retained a bit of willpower even when Diarymort was possessing her, and she managed to stop him from ordering the Basilisk to kill, blocking his orders except when they were looking at a reflective surface.

The third is that we're actually witnessing those "ancient magical protections" on Hogwarts: not a literal shielf/ward like most fanfictions make them out to be, but a /Felix Felicis/-style field of "good luck" that prevents bad things from happening to the students as much as possible.

** Considering the monster is already 950 years old in the 1940s (causing one confirmed kill), I would highly doubt another 50 years would considerably reduce the killing potential of the creature.

I could see (oh dear) having the film if it had trouble before with additional petrifications, but as far as I know Myrtle was the only victim during that first period

** That sounds very interesting, but also like an unnecessary change when the canon is already there for you to use? :) Do you have yes a reason for wanting to make this change? :) Yes it would need more explanation just to work right when canon already works right. :)
