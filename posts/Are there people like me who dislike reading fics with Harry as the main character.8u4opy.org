** I am more than a little sick of Harry-centric stories where it's all about him, and everyone else is either an enemy, or a minion - or a trophy. Doubly so when he's made more powerful than anyone else.

But I prefer a story with Harry to a story without Harry.

** Complete opposite - it's reached the point that even when reading original fiction, I get frustrated that the main character isn't Harry.

** I suppose it's preference, I've been reading fanfiction for a few years now and in that time very rarely bothered reading fics without Harry as the protagonist

** The only reason I read HP fanfics is because I like seeing Harry as an actually decent protagonist instead of being the passive, reactive idiot. Each has their own preference I suppose as I probably wouldn't bother reading a story where Harry is not the MC.

** I didn't come to fanfiction for stories about Harry anyway. He's not my favourite character; he's pretty passive and just seems to wait for things to happen, but that's the way canon is set up. I do feel he's been rather done to death in fanfiction but I'm not the target audience.

I don't mind him as an adult---I think there is potential for some good characterisation---but I admit I wouldn't read about him as a teenager. That's not because of Harry particularly though, it's because I'm old and don't much want to read about teenagers at all.

** The main issue I have with other characters being the MC is that people tend to over-glorify the characters they use.Hermione is the most intelligentestestestes of them all! SO beautiful! So mega! So uber! So awesome! So cool! So nice! So SJW! - ech. I wanna throw up.

If there were stories that went ahead, took the HP-Universe, its magic and its history and added an OC that creates his own path. That would be nice.Sadly most attempts simply retell the canon-story. WHICH IS BORING!

** Rehashing one of my earlier posts, Harry's problem is that he was designed to have the setting revolve around him, and without that he has little to offer. Take away the Prophecy and the destiny (even if he is still an orphan), and Harry would be content to spend his time hanging out with friends, playing Quiddich, and maybe occasionally standing up for someone being bulled: a wholesome character, but a fairly ordinary one. He is Horatio, not Hamlet, in other words.

There's a reason why fics that do something non-Voldemort-related with him tend to rewrite his character to the point of being unrecognisable.

** I pretty much exclusively read fanfics where Hermione is the main character.
