I remember reading a fanfic a year or two ago where Harry as a young child was transported back to the founders era. The founders found him in the snow, and he was raised there. Older Harry drops by, and it's revealed that he was a sand Phoenix animagus, and could travel through time. Time hopping happens, with Harry going to school in modern Hogwarts. Oh yeah, he also loves and is very good at potions.


** is it Founding of Happiness?
