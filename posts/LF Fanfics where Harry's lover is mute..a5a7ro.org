Are there any fics where Harry's lover is mute (not deaf, one disability does not accompany the other), so she communicate through either sign language or written messages with Harry. and as you've extrapolated, preferably no slash please. I just am not interested in that sort of thing personally.


** A bit OT: i know that being deaf does not automatically mean being mute but i think it might be a lot easier to find a fic with a deaf girl using sign language?

  AU. Harry meets a deaf Hermione in 4th year and comes to realize that part of Growing up is Standing up. Luna, Neville & Hermione become his friends, and he grows more into the thoughtful man he will be as long as she's by his side.[social mess, stigmas]

** I can offer you that idea the other way around:

There is "The Silent world of Cassandra Evans", which is a Fem!Harry story where she is mute after some exaggerated Dursley abuse. It starts out pretty dark and heavy on the exposition (since no one can talk to Harry), but after ~8 chapters it becomes a light-hearted, cracky comedy where Harry kicks ass and chews bubblegum. It is an OP!Harry story without the cringe-worthy parts you usually see in the genre ("I WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED") and in contrast to the first part, it is heartwarming and fluffy. There is also a "Hermione fucks up" arc which ends in a well-executed redemption (which is very rare) and a superb subversion of the WBWL trope.

The main pairing is fem!Harry/Susan Bones.

*** Funny, I had a similar idea, except. you know, with male!Harry, dark but not evil. no bashing, none of that "Potter scion" and "Lord Potter" political stuff.

Umm, for example. Harry's angry at Ron because he turned his back on him during Fourth Year, not because Ron's bribed with money from Harry's education vault to pretend to be his friend.

Not really sold on that reasoning, or to be more percise on the exact cause. "Turning his back" is pretty vague, but "because Ron thought Harry would want more fame due to a single, dick-dictated remark" would be better since it emphasises the exact reason their spat is significant.

To be honest, that would have led to Harry expanding on why he's still angry with Ron. then he says that he's still angry with him because Ron believed that his own friend would suddenly want more fame after several years of stating that he doesn't care about being famous.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

*** Do please step off your high horse, there is a very good explanation for a straight male not wanting to read about a bisexual or homosexual male main character. People try to empathize with the main characters of a story and that is difficult to do when the character has a different sexual orientation. It is the same reason many people don't read stories where the main character is of the opposite gender.

And this isn't limited to sexuality, people will drop stories simply because the MC's forgiving or revenge seeking attitude or any other defining trait goes against their core beliefs.
