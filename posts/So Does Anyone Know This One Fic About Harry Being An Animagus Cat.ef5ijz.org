  He was glad his mother had left him alone because him talking to a cat might push her to start strongly suggesting that he visit a mind healer again. Shrugging his shoulders Draco decided to embrace the madness. There were worse things than attributing human emotions and behaviors to random black alley cats.

** While looking for this you can try linkao3(14078862) ... it is certainly not your story (it is not Drarry, which is a big plus for me), but it fits at least in the title, if not the description.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
