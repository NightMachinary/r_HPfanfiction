We get a little taste of Irish and Scottish accents in the series, but we never really hear the different British accents. People from the North and the Midlands talk differently to people from the South. (For an example of just how lovely a child with a northern accent would sound, just Google Issy Simpson from BGT and be enthralled by her Blackpool accent).

Obviously it would just add another layer of difficulty that would be inaccessible to people outside Britain. Also it's been awhile since I watched the films so forgive me if there were any actors or actresses that really sounded Northern and I just don't remember.

Still, it would have been cool to hear a character or two with a thick Liverpudlian brogue, sounding just like the Beatles right off the plane. And don't get me started on Cockney.


** I think the problem is, there's often very little available to the author to show these accents, beyond stating that they have a specific accent (which might be alienating to non Brits) or trying to write phoenetically (which can also be alienating, difficult and hard to read). I once wrote a short piece on Snape recognising that Harry has glimmers of Lily's accent at times - obviously picked up from his aunt - and specified the short "a" on words like laugh/grass though the rest of his accent is southern, because he's from Surrey. But obviously I had to follow this up with a lengthy explainer to non Brits who couldn't imagine the difference between laff/larf, and I'm not exactly going to start spelling laugh like that in Harry's dialogue.

But I definitely imagine, say, the Patils having a Brummie accent, I like Matthew Lewis's Yorkshire accent so that's stuck for Neville, I've made an OC a geordie - but aside from throwing in the odd "pet" or "champion" there's no elegant way for me to show her accent.

Obviously with someone who has a very distinctive accent like Hagrid it's possible, but I don't think you want too many characters like that.

*** Honestly I need to sit down and watch a good video that shows the different accents found in England. I don't really know any and most things get lumped together as “British” in my head.

I'm from the USA, Kentucky specifically, and even our accents vary greatly within our own communities. Some of us have way more of a drawl than others. So I know it would be the same for the UK. I believe that it's even roughly the same size as the Appalachian mountains and you can hear a dozen or so accents peppered throughout.

I can attest that it's difficult to write in accents, however. It's been a topic of many discussions in my Lit classes.

**** Oh, yeah there are hundreds of accents in the UK, they can shift quite dramatically within ten miles or so. They're also very tied into class, so it can get quite complicated. There are some really fun videos out there though!

** I, for one, am grateful we don't hear different accents. When I read the books in English, Hagrid and Fleur were sometimes difficult to understand. I probably wouldn't be able to read the books if almost every character spoke differently, and besides, that doesn't necessarily translate well.\\
I once started to read a fic, and Mary MacDonald spoke with an accent, and I had to abandon the story because I was constantly trying to guess what she was saying.

*** It's rare, but a Scottish accent (or speaking Scots rather) can be done for comedic effect quite well especially when the other characters can't figure out what they're saying either.

I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple with McGonagall going off in Scots about something and everyone just standing there going "wut???"

It being an everyday thing would be irritating, however.

*** Can confirm on navigating the Forest of apostrophes in Hagrid and Fleur's dialogue. that was really annoying to read. Conveying an accent in the written word isn't easy.

By comparison there's an anime called azumanga daioh which is a slice of life story about a bunch of school girls in Tokyo. They are joined by a girl from Osaka whom they literally nickname 'Osaka'. (it would be kind of like nicknaming the southern person 'Tex' even if they were from Georgia.) For the English dub, Osaka's speaking voice is a generic Southern drawl. Like so many other countries, people from different regions in Japan have a different speaking dialect, and the easiest way to represent that to an English-speaking American audience was to just give her a Southern accent.

** All the Weasleys should be sounding like the cast of /Hot Fuzz/ with Westcountry accents as they were born and live in Devon.

** Agreed on the accessibility. I could talk about the different accents across the American South, but North Carolina vs Georgia is probably lost in most of you.
