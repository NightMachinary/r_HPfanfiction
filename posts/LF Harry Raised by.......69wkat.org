  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871), is one of the better robst fics. James and Lily survived and raised Harry, who had a quite enjoyable childhood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is extreme AU, even in Muggle world. James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and ran off with Harry to the Continent. Harry never went to Hogwarts and made his career in the Muggle military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363), has Harry raised by an OC Muggle who was ex SAS.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), Harry ran away at age 5 and was picked by the Grangers. Dumbledore found out soon and was actually happy about the situation. He also told them about Harry's real deal and brought Tonkses to help them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings and had lots of fun together.

In both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542;10937871), Harry was raised by 'good' Dursleys.

There are lots of 'Harry raised by Sirius' fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] especially likes this theme. However, my favorite here is still [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), where a more cunning and sinister Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore and had ruled magical Britain for almost 20 years. Dumbledore would however make his return after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. He and Sirius prepared Harry extensively for the eventual showdown with Malfoy and Voldemort.

--------------

Finally, the Dursleys had the misfortune of bringing Harrymort into the house in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

#+begin_quote
  I was five years old when Petunia Dursley realized that she would never be rid of me. I know this because she began sobbing while insisting that she would never be rid of me.

  Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of.
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  I stroked the parchment of my Hogwarts letter with fondness.

  The youngest Dursley nearly wet himself at the deranged smile on my face. That was an expression usually reserved for our little "chats" (These usually involved quite a bit more screaming than chatting. Still, I always healed him at the end, so it's not like he has anything to complain about).

  My "loving" relatives were more than happy to ship me off to Hogwarts where I would be far, far away from them. The desire was mutual. Even with training, the three were barely tolerable.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
