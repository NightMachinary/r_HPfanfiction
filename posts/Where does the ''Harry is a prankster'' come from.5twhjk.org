I might have missed a few things here and there since its quite a while, but I can't remember in the movies or in the books where Harry is pranking people. Is it just because his Father/God Father are Pranksters?

Its one of the things in Fanfiction of Harry/Fem Harry where I just don't understand how they suddenly want to prank people.


** In part its authors trying to make harry more like James and Sirius. In another way its a way of showcasing a different attitude.

Harry of canon wouldnt prank someone outside a snide sniping comment.

** Harry always had an evil sense of humor, and that was one key reason he liked Ginny so much. He was enjoying mightily how she mocked Fleur, beat up Zach Smith, and made fun of Ron.

*** You are onto something here. His upbringing conditioned him against standing out and making waves, but there probably is a part of him that enjoys assertiveness. You just made H/G a little more believeable for me.

**** Did you and I read different Harry Potter series? Because the books I'm familiar with feature a little smartass who verbally asserts himself to his abusive relatives on a regular basis whenever he's with them.

***** Hm, I didn't say he doesn't assert himself. However, there is baggage there, rightfully.

There are times in the books where a ton of different people shit on him and he doesn't respond at all.

I see it as something that he struggles with; his place in the world, both muggle and magical is never certain. He constantly faces inconsistent behaviour from strangers, acquaintances and even friends.

So my view is that self-confidence (and self-assurance even) is something he aspires towards, he wants to grow into someone who can master his own self. However, all the shit he's had to grow up with and deal with, frequently makes him lose his footing. And that's perhaps what attracts him to Ginny's easy confidence - she seems to be at a state of self he wants to reach.

**** I always took that one as two stereotypical jocks who get into fights and stand up for other people, getting together. But that does make Harry seem a whole lot more like her now.

** I think a lot of authors want to show how Sirius has an influence on Harry.

But I do dislike it, to be completely honest. Maybe thats just my culture and experience, but I always viewed pranking as thinly veiled bullying. When you do it to friends, from time to time, I can see the humor. But doing it to "teach someone a lesson", as I read so often, is just straight up bullying, hiding behind a thin veneer of humor. Its the easiest way to take away the moral high ground from Harry.

I just can't see Harry doing it. He's a smartass with a snarky tongue and some serious sass, but he's not someone who takes revenge in the form of pranks. While I do think he enjoys a good humored one between friends, I just don't think he's the type to hide behind humor in order to get back at someone.

*** I agree. He has quite a dark sense of humour but I really don't see how that would translate into “pranks”. That is not to say I don't enjoy it occasionally, but that is in stories that are 110% crack, and in stories that are aspiring to seriousness such stuff is just “meh”.
