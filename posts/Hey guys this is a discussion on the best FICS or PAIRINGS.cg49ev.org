So you guys i am going to tell you guys my opinion on Fanfics and pairings and maybe even animagus forms

And please do share your opinions as well

My top 3 fanfics are as follows They are - saviour of magic -angry harry and the seven And finally - the curse (which is def NSFW)

Fav pairing is def harry/Daphne

Fav animagus form is either phoenix or the night's fury

Please do share your opinions i would like to explore more fanfics

Have fun!


** The OPT is obviously Harry/Jimin from BTS. As for fics I haven't found any for this pairing so I can't say yet (what are writers even doing wtf).

*** Probably thinking of how to make harry more OP than in any other fics

Like i have seen a Harry James Potter-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Greengrass-Black With a phoenix animagus and all the frikin power in politics and magic even had impenetrable occlumency naturally along with accidental apparition from the dursleys

Like wth is that

** linkffn(no more games by vaguejester) seems like it would hit a lot of categories you would really enjoy. I actually confuse it with Savior of Magic (and the author's other fic that is almost identical at the start, HP and the Lightning Lord)

** I don't really have a favorite because I can't choose and no one story eclipses the other.

*Complete Stories*: A Cadmean Victory, Blindness, Letters, A Forgotten Contract, Half-Blood Romantic, and Too Young to Die.

*Complete Shorts*: Ruthless and Ice Cream by Andrius are my favorite shorts. The latter being the fluffiest Harry/Daphne shit I have ever seen and enjoyed.

*Incomplete Stories:* I'm Still Here, Deprived, and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived.

I lied, HP and the BWL would easily be my favorite story if it was complete.

â€‹

I would recommend Deprived based on your fic list. It's a guilty pleasure OP Harry trip. A Champions New Hope and Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent are two enjoyable Daphne fics.

** Magical Animagus is just plain unrealistic. What's wrong with a nice and simple cat? Fully capable of sneaking around Hogwarts or Knockturn, can easily escape any situation as long as the form isn't known, and perfectly canon compliant.

As for pairings I don't like Daphne too much as she's really just a blank slate for authors to shoehorn any character they want into. I prefer a more well established character pairing like Harry/Hermione, Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, George/Hermione or Harry/Luna.

Fics I like:

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione main, spellcrafting worldbuilding focused, interesting new inventions and badass battles. Worried about magic nukes? Let's win a magical physics nobel prize equivalent.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Epic revenge against the purebloods who framed her. Capable cat (literally) burglar Hermione vs auror Harry and Ron.

Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)

Interesting political Harry with a furry little secret and an adopted family of dentists.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Openly racist nazi bigoted elitist nazi purebloods, meet our new friends: Semtex plastic explosives, courtesy of the IRA, and SG 550 assault rifles imported from Switzerland. They work beautifully against your outdated wards that haven't been updated in decades. Sincerely, the resisting muggleborns.

  Magical Animagus is just plain unrealistic.
#+end_quote

I think this came about because someone thought it'd make whoever has it (usually Harry) seem super duper ultra special and unique, possibly even with a magical power level that's over 9000 too. And then, because of the nature of fanfic creation where concepts (no matter their quality or lack thereof) get copied ad infinitum, you end up seeing it everywhere, and people become convinced that it must be canon, because everyone else is doing it in their stories too.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
