:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember many details about this ff anymore but I know that at least part of it was a Goblet of Fire Au. Basically Harry got chosen as usual but he like really didn't wanna compete and didn't wanna steal the spotlight from Cedric. So he just didn't take the tournament seriously. Like he took his time fighting the Dragon, same with the 2nd challenge. There he also accidently befriended like some Prince of the merpeople. I'm also pretty sure that he was friends with Draco? Because he like encouraged Draco to make the Potter Stinks Badges and even wore one himself. Anyways it would be great if anyone knows this fanfic and can tell me the name.


** it's 1000000000% this fic. not sure why it took me so long to find but i read it very recently, exactly the one you're looking for, harry flies the dragon to show off in the first task and befriends the prince of the merpeople in the second task. draco makes the potter stinks badges for all the houses because harry endorses them & doesn't think he himself is a real champion. linkao3(12006417)

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** Parts of this request appear in this fic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9406877/1/]] I believe, but it's been awhile since I read it so I could be wrong. It's also an Avengers crossover, so I doubt this is the fic you're looking for.

** Maybe Muggle-Raised Champion linkffn(11610805)

Harry's an artist and figuring he has no chance anyway, just paints a picture of the dragon for the first task.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
