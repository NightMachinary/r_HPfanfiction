I hate to do this again so soon, but after downloading over a hundred ffs to keep them save, I noticed that one seems to be gone. Therefore, it would be really awesome if someone has a copy of it they would share with me.

I think the name of the junior death eaters was Aspis? Harry was the alpha, Draco the beta, they are all children of death eaters, from every house (Katie and Dean from Gryffindor), and were born with special skills (some magic Voldemort did before he died, so that his followers would breed him a powerful army), including being immune to poisons and the like. It's 2 or 3 parts, the last one wasn't complete and during the last one Harry was "dead" but his body was used as a fighter by Dumbledore. Oh and they had codenames.

I'm also pretty certain I read it on potionsandsnitches, but looking through all completed "Severus as Harrys biological father" brought no result.

[also: looking for other FFs where Harry leads junior death eaters, including other normally light characters, because they decide that Voldemort is the lesser evil than Dumbledore]


** Now there's a fic I'd forgotten about. Found it though: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501523/1/Forlorn-Hope][Forlorn Hope]] by Elssha. Have a good time reading, I certainly am.

*** Yes. YESS. Thank you! "Asps" damn it, no wonder I didn't find it via google, with too many letters. Just couldn't remember what they were called.

/throws it into the downloader/ Wow, and now I know why I couldn't find it on potionsandsnitches. The Biological-Father-Snape category doesn't show the stories of the sub category "severitus challenge". I thought it did. ._. So even many more thanks!

***** That's totally enough. Already difficult to find new things to read (which leads to my "I want to reread this - why can't I find it" problems. Never thought I would come to that point of saying "I've read everything")
