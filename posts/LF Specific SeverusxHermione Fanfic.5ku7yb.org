Hello!

I've been searching for this fanfic for awhile now, but my googling hasn't been very helpful. I remember reading it on fanfiction.net (searching didn't go well there either) but it may be on other sites as well.

Here's what I vaguely remember about it: Severus Snape develops a potion where he can meet with Lily in his dreams even though she's passed on. However, instead of meeting with Lily, Hermione keeps popping up instead. They always end up meeting in a bedroom and, if I remember correctly, Hermione notes that there is a garish blanket and the room is a bit sleazy (think leopard print maybe?) Additionally, a specific detail is that there is a flower vase with lilies inside that Snape put there specifically because he assumed he would dream of Lily. I think Hermione might be his potion's apprentice or a fellow teacher as well (and possibly in love with him?)

If this rings a bell with anyone, I greatly appreciate your help!


** I read it, but can't remember the name. I'm going to sleep now, but I'll search for it tomorrow, I might still have it somewhere :)

** I believe it might be Love, Carefully Folded by dressagegrrrl. It looks like she deleted her work everywhere but I found a copy over at the ss/hg exchange. You may need to be a member to see it.
