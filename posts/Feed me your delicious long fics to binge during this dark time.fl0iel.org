#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts Battle School offers nothing but endless challenges for Harry Potter. Headmaster Snape is always looking over his shoulder, watching his progress intently. The enemies are endless, all keen to beat the Boy-Who-Lived. He finds few friends in the Slytherin House, save for Blaise Zabini and Tracey Davis. His fiercest competitor, Hermione Granger of Gryffindor, is a ruthless rival. An unknown darkness lurks in the background. As he starts his Third Year, Harry realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

** I just finished The Cupboard Series by Stargon

It's a full series starting at Philosopher's Stone and working through where Harry meets Hermione at Kings Cross instead of Ron. Definitely worth a read [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][*https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895*]]

I would also highly recommend his story Muggle-Raised Champion, in which the Dursley's ban Harry from going to Hogwarts but his name still comes out of the goblet of fire and he has to compete with little to no magical knowledge. It has a sequel in the works but it hasn't been updated since New Years.

The Debt of Time; Hermione is transported back in time to the marauder era and grows up as James' twin sister. Possibly my favourite fanfic of all time.linkffn(10772496)

The Arithmancer (has two sequels which are also amazing); Rather than Hermione growing up as a book worm she is a math genius.linkffn(10070079)

The Green Girl; Hermione is sorted into Slytherin (Dramione)linkffn(11027125)

One Hundred and Sixty Nine; Hermione goes back in time to 169 days before James and Lily are killed to try to change things (Sirius/Hermione)linkffn(8581093)

Alternate History; Hermione is thrown into a parallel universe where things are very different.linkffn(11210783)

** There's a trilogy by greengecko: resonance(528k), revolution (397k) and resolution (787k)

I really enjoyed reading it and I think it's a pretty unique story: it is one of the few good guy Snape stories I like, there's an interesting added magic system, the story goes through the end of Hogwarts and Auror training and because the writer started in 2005 it's pretty different (though I think he did adapt some things after the last book came out to make most of the story fit canon)

Also, I don't know why but somehow this fic made me want to be a teacher with its version of Snape as a role model.

**** Not the person you asked, but I know the story really well.

The story asks the question how things could have turned out if Harry had reacted differently to seeing Draco crying in Myrtle's bathroom. If instead of drawing wands at each other, Harry had used this to offer protection.

Canon-Harry (married to Ginny with 3 children) gets the chance to visit that alternative universe, only to find himself living with Draco and Ginny being married to Blaise Zabini.

It is really well written, the author is amazing. I personally prefer her other series "Foundationverse" starting with Reparations and continueing with Foundations, but I can definitely see the attraction of Turn/Turnverse.

Reparations is also Draco/Harry; Harry is a healer and has to do a rotation at the rehab centre of St. Mungos. He quickly finds that the centre is run by Draco, who has a complicated history with magically enhanced drugs and potions.

***** Yep this. The first half of the fic is Harry in this alternate universe then the second half is how that affects his life back in the canon (and epilogue compliant) universe

I'd add that rather than being an auror, alt universe Harry has a creative job that I won't spoil and lots of the other characters like Blaise Zabini and Neville have non canon jobs. It's one of the things I love in fics, people expanding the universe and not just sticking to the few jobs we hear about in canon.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

** Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422]]

525k words (= as long as OOTP, GOF and PS/SS together) and IMO one of the best HP fanfics out there.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dune-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems. It goes into what it means to be family and what it means to be a parent and especially what it means to be a good, responsible father. It explores trust issues as well. Lots of funny moments on top.

I also second the rec for "Turn" by Sara's Girl, but personally I prefer "Reparations" and "Foundations" by the same author.

Some of my favourite single long ones are A Better Man, 3 Slytherin Marauders, Harry Potter: Dark Memories (although they are essentially series in one long book)

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** Late to the party so I hope I don't repost some that were already recommended.

​

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

Longest one I know. Ron centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy]])

Harry/Daphne with a very sudden twist

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe]])

Crossover with MCU

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]])

One of the old ones, very AU

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes]])

Another old one going through a re-edit for some reason

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12798308/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-s-Power]])

Another one with a sudden twist (or maybe 3 or 4) but a great AU with an OC character

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/33/His-Angel]])

Sadly abandoned. A Harry/Fleur

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2460400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Burden-of-Becoming]])

One of the reasons I made a FFN account was so I could save this story. Has a sequel

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back]])

One of the few complete time travel stories

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]])

So abandoned the writer deleted their profile and this is a repost, great nonetheless

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]])

Another complete time travel story, that answers the question "Would you kill child Hitler?"

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]])

A classic. Sad and happy at the same time he got in to professional writing

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess]])

The epilogue is a story on its own

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]])

Same author as above

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived]])

My favorite pairing: Harry/FemHarry. So rare, so hard to find

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  The War is won, and Hermione Granger is back at Hogwarts as an “Eighth Year”, feeling reckless and determined to shed her prim bookworm persona. She will do as she pleases, and anyone who doesn't like it will see the business end of her wand. Also returning is Draco Malfoy, universally hated but determined to restore his family's name. Hermione's hopes for a quiet school year are quickly dashed as she contends with mischievous First Years, killer plants, enchanted hair accessories, a totally inappropriate Moaning Myrtle, renegade Death Eaters, a nice vampire, a poorly named study group, a depraved party, and mysterious, threatening blood messages on the castle walls. We have redemption, partial redemption and (sadly or hilariously) no redemption at all. Throw in a snarky, disturbingly attractive Draco with his own secret agenda, and we have a very slow-burn Dramione with a side of who-dun-it. COMPLETE!

** Years 1-6 of Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" (new version). In my opinion, it is the best piece of Harry Potter fanfiction in existence. The depth he goes into with his cast of characters is absolutely staggering. Plus, the writing itself is brilliant. Year 7 is currently being written, so it's a great time to read the first 6 and get caught up. You won't regret it.

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

** Isolation and Hunted by Bex-chan are probably too obvious to mention, but since no one else has, I feel obligated to do so- Isolation is quite simply put the best romance fic on ff.net. A hidden gem that I am disappointed not to see on this thread is The Unwinding of Percy Weasley, which I feel is a delicious slice of low stakes fluff that still manages to tickle the need for substance. The main female character is perhaps /slightly/ too perfect, but the characterization of Percy and Arthur is superb. If you REALLY have an overabundance of time, I recommend checking out ByeByeBirdie's Balcony series, which is honest to God probably the longest work of fiction I've ever finished, with the exception of The Wheel of Time. ByeByeBirdie has a weakness for dramatic monologues, but over such a long story you will build up a tolerance surprisingly quickly. Given it's length and melodrama, some have compared the series to a soap opera, which I feel is inaccurate if only because you actually grow to care about the characters. Mad respect to ByeByeBirdie for her dedication to completing fics- her first was published in 2002, and she just finished another a few months ago. Order of Mercy is a fantastic canon compliant Deathly Hallows fic that focuses on Percy/Fleur/Bill, my only gripe with it is that the author makes Fleur just a wee tad too domestic for my taste- I could be mistaken, as it has been a long while since I read the fic.

** linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg) - Buffy crossover set in the Potterverse, first in a 4-fic series that crosses with Marvel and DC in subsequent fics, mostly light-hearted with an OP Harry, but a lot of fun. Honestly, I'm fond of everything by mjimeyg except their Firefly fics.

linkffn(Harry Crow) - Yes, I went there. It's not perfect, and it definitely bashes Dumbledore and to some degree Ron, but it also does a phenomenal job of letting the characters drive the plot and grow and develop, unlike the canon's "nobody ever changes except to go OOC in service of the plot". Also, it's one of the few written works to get me so emotionally invested that some scenes actually got my heart pounding.

linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) - Harmony, some Dumbledore bashing; Harry and Hermione flee Britain in response to a marriage law.

linkao3(Umino Iruka and the Wizarding World) - Self-promotion. A Naruto crossover set in the Potterverse without nerfing ninjas or letting them run roughshod over everything.
