** I'd give more weight to nonjon or Ruskbyte as All-Stars of the HP fanfiction pantheon, and I happen to love Vera Rozalski's immersive style more than most any other author.

JBern has some good action and inventive plotting. His stories don't languish in emotional turmoil but aren't simple power fantasies. Some of them are difficult to sink into at times, as the main character as a reader avatar occasionally is inaccessible; there are scenes in Inner Eye and The Lie I Lived where you feel like Harry's viewpoint is obscured and you're reminded that you're an observer to the action.

** The Lie I've Lived is one of my all-time favorites, and it surprises me how much this subreddit loves to shit on it.

*** The best are always most heavily criticized. "The Lie I've Lived" is the only fan fic I've re-read(deliberately that is, not because I forgot what the hell it was like so many others).

**** Nope. That was quite a conservative estimate, actually.

** Pacing is nearly perfect. Witty dialogue. Great Original ideas. The best action I've ever read in fan-fiction(that I can recall). Creative spell usage and theory. Author is actually published I think. Good humour. Low filler. All hail the supreme mugwump Jbern!
