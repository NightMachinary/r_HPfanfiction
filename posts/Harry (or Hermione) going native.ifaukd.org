Generally when we see stories where those two impressionable 11 years-olds are sent to a school of magic, make friends there, live there for most of the year and basically move there both unexpectedly still keep ties with the muggle world even though by third year Hermione's only tie would be her parents and Harry would have no tie he would likely wish to keep.

I am looking for the complete opposite of this, stories in which they either deliberately or by happenstance sever ties with that part of their life's and become clueless over how the muggle world works, to the point of sincerely saying: “WHAT! The muggles built a village around Diagon Alley!? Since when? Oh, the poor dears, so heartbroken over the separation between our worlds that they would go so far to just be close to one of our settlements. But there is nothing to be done I guess, it was for the best.”


** ... Diagon Alley is in the middle of London...

**** Except that Harry and Hermione already know about London. I'm pretty sure every wizard knows about London because it was there a thousand years before the SoS.

***** Eh, it was more an example to show what I meant by “going native” could be other things, like forgetting what a computer does or anything like these.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), features a Hermione like that. Lucius Malfoy won the war after Halloween 1981, forcing Dumbledore and his followers into exile. Malfoy closed off Wizarding Britain from Muggle world, kidnapped Muggleborns from their families, murdered their parents, obliviated them of their earliest memories, and brainwashed them into becoming his loyal henchmen.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
