:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello all my fellow Redditors , am looking for a fic called The Weasleys Read Harry Potter Book 6 by TheDeathlyHallows-123 which I have tried searching everywhere even in archives where they save old fics but to no avail. If somebody has it, can they be kind enough to lend it to me . I so badly wanttt to READ it . I have part 4 & 5 but not 6 .It has around 18 chapters as per Fictionhunt but if it remains a completed fic , please redirect me to it . What makes it so special as to make me mad enough to ask for it is the fact that here Harry's fascination for Ginny will be opened up in front of Weasleys ,the reaction to which I always wanted to read .

If somebody has it or someplace where I can reach it , please help me swerve to that bend . I am looking for that fic for a long time so help me my fellow chums. Thanks in advance and Good Day "^{"}

And Yes, I am opening the same story link i.e. 7728348 which is flashing me the above warning .If you open it and see the story, please let me know.

Thanks üòÅ

***** A thousand apologies Mate. It seemed that the trouble was with me or rather my app because I mostly use Reddit through app and no matter how many times I logged in to Fictionhunt through this app, it wouldn't open and though I was logged in on browser, the moment I tried loggin in through app, it logged me out . So finally I logged in and out twice for safety's sake and then , Et Viola , it opened. Though why the same happened when using my laptop is beyond me üòÇ

Thanks again for the help my fellow Redditor . üëç

********* What a coincidence Mate, I have read many of them over past 1.5 years when I was in the phase of reading these "reading the books". Except "In the past to change the future series" which I didn't liked much but thanks all the same, if you don't have any objection , here is one if you would like to try , it's amongst my favourites

Discovering the Legend series - [[https://fictionhunt.com/stories/3y6mrg7/discovering-the-legend-1-read-the-sorcerers-stone/chapters/1]]

If haven't , then do give it a try.

Thanks and Happy reading to you too üòÄ
