:END:
I'm pretty sure it was a one-shot, though not 100%, but I know it was during DH while the Trio was on the Horcrux Hunt.

Luna thought about Harry looking at the Marauder's Map to check on everyone so every day she'd walk to form words of encouragement like "Go Harry" and name every secret passage she found so that they'd appear on the map as "You can do it Passage" or "I believe in you Passage"

At first Harry would think it was just his eyes playing tricks and then, after realising that she was doing it on purpose, he'd start looking for her on the Map everytime he took a peek at it.

It was really sweet and I'd like to read it again.

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood is a strange girl- everyone knows that. But while she is often unconventional, she is a loyal friend who follows her heart and knows her mind. Except, however, when it comes to Harry Potter.

** Ooh, I've read this. My notes have these stories including Luna:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit]]

Out of these, I'm pretty sure it's firebird or ambient.

Edit: Never mind, I'm blind and missed the first non-title sentence. None of these are it, my bad.
