** It's actually entirely possible for this to happen if you follow the films (can't remember if it's in the books too.) But Tonks has fun with Ginny changing her dace into a ducks bill and a pigs snout. Clearly if you had enough skill or power you could do full transformations. What's important is to put reasonable limitations on it such as it only physically chamges him so be can't gain magical abilities by shifting and a limit such as 375% of his mass can be changed so he can't become a rediculously larfe animal.
