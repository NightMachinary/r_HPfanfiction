In this story Harry Potter's brother (who is truly not his brother) Arnold might be his name, is killed. Dumbledore then remembers Harry and searches school records to see he disappeared after his 4th year. Hermione Granger is the muggle studies teacher and is call Madam not Professor, Dumbledore decides she should die for the great good and Snape orchestrates an ambush in Hogsmeade but she kills all the DE that attack her including Greyback. Also Lily is alive and in hiding.

Also it's Harry/Hermione/Luna. I can't remember who Lily was paired with but it's a woman. Somehow all the muggleborn witches were actually lesbians and were trapped into pureblood marriages by Dumbledore(?) using unfair laws. It gets pretty silly, but it's a fun ride. Also, I do love a badass Neville.

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.
