I've read fics before where Harry is sent back in time (by Death usually) with his memories in tact, but that creates the awkward situation of an adult having to live as a child. This is compounded if there is romance. What I'm wondering is if anyone has ever written a time travel story where the soul is sent back, but that consciousness doesn't remain, rather the person who existed at that age merely dreams of all the later memories in a night. In this case say, 11 year old Harry would learn of Hogwarts and get to see everything that would happen later, but still undeniably be an 11 year old.

Has anyone written anything like this before? The idea intrigues me enough that I'll expand the request of any fandom.


** It's a crossover with the Game of Thrones world but loosely follows the premise you've given (Protagonist dreams canon Harry's life) although obvioulsy not a time travel fic. linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne by joen1801)

  When Tywin Lannister crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion everyone in the Kingdoms believed he ended two noble lines. But thanks to one unique infant, one Harrion Reyne called Harry by his parents, some survived.

  Thirty-seven-year old Harry Potter looks back on his life and finds how worse the world has become, thus he goes back in time to save his seven-year-old self from an event that changes his life, to entrust his legacy to himself. May sound cheesy, but a different approach. Minor to major Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. Snape Bashing. Grey Harry, time-travel, A-Universe/A-Reality...
