The reason I ask is that I have recently been contacted by a few friends of mine who are writers on FFN asking if I would support a petition letter that they are going to send to various archive managers that have hosted their deleted works without permission. Since I've seen a few of those archivers frequent this subreddit, I just thought I'd outright ask them if there was any point in that petition at all. There's no way to legally force people to stop hosting their content without permission, so the writers are basically stuck hoping that the archivers will respect their wishes.

Personally I think they'll fail since they don't really have any leverage, but some of these people have real legitimate reasons for deleting their fics so I want to help out.

Hence this post.


** They might be better off asking for their author names to be deleted from the fics if the archives won't take them down.

******** Writer here. Its a bit of a touchy subject, but I'll try to share what I've gained from my experiences the best I can.

There is a certain stigma that comes attached with fanfiction in a lot of publishing houses. To someone who doesn't understand the talent and the creativity that is present in the fanfic writing community(which sadly includes most elderly publishing officials), fanfiction itself is a legal aberration and signals(in the words of a publisher I met early on) that a writer can't 'make his own shit up'. And even if you do come across a publisher who does understand that, as I was lucky enough to, they will be hesitant to publish you. The reason for that is that if the fact that you are a fanfic writer ever becomes public, the lawyers of the IP that you wrote fanfic for will scrutinize your every written word and movement, and the second you make something even as small as a reference to that IP, those lawyers will descend upon you and your publishing house with all their fury.

Being a fanfic writer might not harm you directly, but what it does do is alienate a lot of people and paints a target on your back. That is why its best to separate your fanfic and real life identities rigidly.

********* I can understand that some people just have biases and you can't change that. It just seems odd since --on the subject of not being able to make to your own shit--professional writers write spec scripts for established tv shows all the time. They're also playing in someone else's universe and that's not career poison.

********** The difference is that the script wasn't written with the intent to be shared to thousands of people online. Intent is important, and so is the platform you share your work on, which in this case is FFN, which clearly states that its a platform for publicly sharing transformative work. Another fact that comes into play is readership. There are legal issues that could happen when a writer tries to use fanfic fame to make money off of an original work. This is a similar legal issue to the FFN writers who set up Patreon accounts to profit off of fanfic.

*********** Considering all that, I'd be interested to see how E. L. James jumped through all the various legal hoops for 50 Shades and got a publisher to agree, since outside of relevant name changes for publishing, it is a Twilight fanfiction, that is in itself a ripoff of a different Twilight fanfic. Granted the lawyers for Twilight might not want to sue and associate the two books, but with 50 Shades' success, I'd think they'd almost have to.

***** There's another issue that arises when you want to adapt your own fanfiction for original work. You might get accused of plagarizing if you don't admit to having written the fic (and can prove it). If people can also easily access the fic version of the published work, they're less likely to buy the original work, which could lose the author and publishing company money.

****** I have less sympathy for this than for the "wrote their fics when they were 12" angle. It's fine to get started on fanfiction and then switch to or add in original fiction. (I did, after all.) But I've kept the two separate from the very start, and I've dropped several fanfic ideas because they were too similar to original novels I want to write.

** You can hope that people will oblige the writers' wishes but you can't make them. I can't see that a petition will make any difference - you are relying on goodwill; and this is the internet where that is sometimes in short supply.

I wish there was a way you could be sure something was properly deleted, but there really isn't. The only reason I keep my fics up is so that I can prove they are mine. I regret ever posting them and I wish I could just wipe them away. But it's easy to be wise after the event.
