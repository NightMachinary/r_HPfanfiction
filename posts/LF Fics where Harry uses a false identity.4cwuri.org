This is one of my guilty pleasures: fics where Harry is using some other identity and at some point later on in the fic there's a big reveal.

It can come in a variety of forms:

- Harry among wizards using a different identity.

- Harry living among Muggles without them knowing he's a wizard.

- Harry in a crossover hiding the fact that he's from another world/is a wizard.

Ideally he shouldn't be going around blurting who he really is to every Tom, Dick and Harry he talks to for 5 mins. The reveal should take place later on in the fic and ideally to a limited number people who have earned his trust.

Bonus points for minimal angst regarding his past.

One variation is where the big reveal is not Harry's powers but rather that he's loaded.


** Oh man there was a betrayal story I remember reading a long long time ago where Harry disappears into the muggle world and basically lives his life as a muggle until his daughter turns out to be magical, but he fights tooth and nail not to send her to Hogwarts because he says the magical world only ever brought him pain (but no one knows he's Harry Potter or a wizard).

The story ends with [[/spoiler][his muggle wife falling off the grand staircase because it couldn't sense her since she was a muggle so she falls to her death]]

I can't for the life of my remember the name, or really anything else that happens, but I remember it being pretty good.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]] , Harry lives among the muggles of the Firefly 'verse a couple of years after /Serenity/. The government knows that an old man named Harry Potter exists and might be a mythical wizard, but no one connects it to the young pilot who simply goes by "Harry". The big reveal happens to the main characters maybe a quarter or third of the way through the fic, and a HUGE reveal happens near the end of the story (and may or may not be what you're thinking). Does that count?

In case this affects your opinion one way or the other, it's one of nonjon's few fics that aren't zany sex romps, but maintains a smooth balance between being serious and being lighthearted.

But anyway: [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=2199][Malfoy Flavor]] by Vorabiza. Due to a bunch of changes related to growing up/his birthday, Harry is able to hide in plain sight at Hogwarts under another name. /Much/ angst over lying to his friends.

** There's two that come to mind:

linkffn(3703793). Harry/Ginny. Excellent use of slowly revealing why those two ran away. Incomplete, but still worth the read. Premise is that Harry and Ginny fled and are now living among the muggles.

linkffn(11718442). Harry/Ginny. Very similar to the previous one, but this one's a lot shorter and complete. Overall happy tone and atmosphere, maybe a little less kind to Hermione and Ron. Premise here too is that Harry and Ginny now live as muggles.
