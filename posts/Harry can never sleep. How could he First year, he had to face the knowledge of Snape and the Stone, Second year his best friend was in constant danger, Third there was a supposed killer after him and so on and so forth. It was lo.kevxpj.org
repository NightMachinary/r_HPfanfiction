#+TITLE: Harry can never sleep. How could he? First year, he had to face the knowledge of Snape and the Stone, Second year his best friend was in constant danger, Third there was a supposed killer after him and so on and so forth. It was lonely though... So thank god for the insomniac Slytherin Lily Moon!

Harry has never been a great sleeper. He always had nightmares and usually too much on his mind to sleep anyways. He very rarely got a good nights sleep and that was probably /why/ suffered so much in his grades.

If there was one thing that always helped though, it was a late night stroll under his invisibilty cloak around Hogwarts. One night though, during his usual wanderings, he bumps into something very unexpected. Someone else who also had an invisibility cloak, albeit an inferior and far smaller one then his.

This person? A Slytherin in the same year as him, he knew to be Lily Moon. He wasn't sure what was going to happen when they both uncovered each other, he doubted either expected it was become nighttime wandering buddies and confidants.

Friends that could trust each other when they couldn't trust their other friends....

[Can take place any year]


** I like the idea, but the name has always held me back when trying to switch up from Daphne. I preferred it when I knew her as 'Lilith.' Still not the best, but a huge improvement for me.
