Outside of the main 5/ not tagging at all?

I just read Hermione/Fred fic that just casually has some incest. How is 2021 going for you?


** Came across a fic with an explicit MFM scene where Snape was in there middle of Harry and Hermione.

Honorable mention: Junior Inquisitor. They're there now, but the author had no warning for chapter 20 onwards when she was writing it.

**** Junior Inquisitor? It started off as your typical bumbling, manipulative Dumbledore with stooge Ron and Hermione. Then it became "the bad guys are bad, but the good guys are really effed up."

It's a shame she went the bashing route at all because her concept - Harry having to defend himself at the trial and working with Umbridge - is unique and I haven't seen it done anywhere else.

** It's going well for me. I hope your year improves. Now let me tell you a tale. I believe the fic was called Unspeakable Harry. Don't remember who it's by, or if that's the right name, but if was on FFN. There weren't any relationship tags, and based on the description, I was expecting a slow burn. Essentially, it seemed like WBWL fic but had some pretty good character writing for the brother. That's rare, so I was looking forward to reading more. It turns out that the story was going in a Harry/OC Brother direction. So yeah, we've got twelve-year-old fraternal twins kissing in the Chamber of Secrets. I reloaded the page. Same thing. Then I noped all the way out.

But I'm curious, who was the incest?

*** Oooooh. GAH! No,thank you. You're inventing the OC. Just don't make them siblings. Honestly.

It would be Charlie (who was married to Hermione and they apparently swing). There's some voyeurism so when Charlie stays to watch... eh whatever. You do your cuckold thing.

Then suddenly, Charlie starts giving Fred a blow job and I bailed. Apparently it only got worse from there.

** The worst is not tagging, for some authors who "forget" all kinds of tagging apparently on purpose. If it is a slash or het or harem or incest etc. please put tags (or in the summary). What is almost as bad as missing tags are 30-50 or more tags. The worst thing about missing tags that I had was in GoT (asoiaf) where the story was so far removed from the tags that I had to look to see if I suddenly ended up in another fic.

I've got a fic on there, recently posted, I'll admit I forgot when setting up the summary that there should be warnings for certain events, though I did specify it as an M rating due to said events even if they are late on compared to what's actively posted.

At present I've got /maybe/ 13 characters of around 384 I can change for tags without having to rewrite the summary itself thanks to using an overlong tag for something.
