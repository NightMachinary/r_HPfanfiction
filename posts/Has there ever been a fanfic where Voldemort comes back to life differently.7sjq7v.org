The one thing I've seen consistent in HP Fanfiction is mainly that Voldemort comes back exactly the same way via the graveyard incident and I was just wondering if anyone ever came up with a scenerio where he returns differently like through the philosophers stone or through the diary or just something completely original from what happened in canon. Thoughts?

** linkffn(Weres Harry) Voldemort never learned about the blood protection, and went with a different ritual that ended up catching the attention of the Fae.

linkffn(Rising From the Shadows; A Distant Storm) Lockhart is possessed by the Diadem, Bagnold is possessed by the ring, and Voldemort used a variant of the Horcrux ritual based on Ancient Egyptian dark wizards, which filled the same purpose without splitting his soul.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

One Voldemort possess Grindelwald's body and one is a doll with soul fragments from horcri created by Touko Aozaki.

For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.
