  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.

*** Seconding this one. Also one of my favorite Harry/Fleur fics(plus an awesome Katie Bell).

It has believable character growth, Harry doesn't just start randomly killing people and he's certainly not evil, not even at the end but he makes very questionable decisions but it's perfectly understandable why he makes these decisions.

He gets influenced by someone that maybe shouldn't be allowed to talk to thirteen year olds, which also gives a great reason why Voldemort turned out the way he did.

The beginning is a bit questionable since Harry learns a lot of things really fast but it gets more reasonable later on and i really don't think the ending is /that/ bad. Sure, if felt rushed and just...out of place? I'm not sure how how describe it... It might be better to just skip the last two chapters and make up your own ending but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be.

Edit: okay i just read my post over and it's a real mess... I'm sorry, i'm a little tired. I hope i got my point across.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

  Control
#+end_quote

Really enjoyed this one. I'm not a huge fan of dark!Harry fics, and Control appears to be all angsty and edgy at first. But somehow it turned out to be really good, perhaps the best depiction of dark!Harry I've seen.

I still have a hard time considering Harry evil in this one. Ruthless pragmatism never hurt anyone--except when it needed to.

  Dumbledore thinks he will rescue Harry from his terrible family, setting himself up as Harry's mentor. Unfortunately for him, somebody else got there first. BAMF!Harry, M for violence, language, child abuse/prostitution, drug use, and all around criminal goings on.
