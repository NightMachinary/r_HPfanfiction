  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

** Some of those elements, but not all of them, are in The Pureblood Pretense. Although that Harry does not often /buy/ potions; she just buys ingredients. Anything she can't brew herself, it's probably just because it requires a special licence that she doesn't have.

She doesn't live with the Dursleys, though, because both of her parents are alive, and she's frequently in Knockturn Alley and the Lower Alleys beyond that. And she does frequently conceal her identity, though less so in the Alleys.
