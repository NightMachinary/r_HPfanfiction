Hey all!

I'd love to get some recommendations for fics where Harry is an Auror - the story can be a case!fic where he solves some mystery, or it can involve him being an Auror but focus on life idk. As long as it's an Auror!Harry fic you enjoyed, I'd love to check it out.

I've already read The Aurors by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]], its sequel, and A Stricken Lament by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1156945/Muffliato][Muffliato]].

NOTE: Please /don't/ recommend anything with a) Ron bashing OR b) Drarry fics (I'm just not a Drarry fan)

Thanks in advance guys!!
