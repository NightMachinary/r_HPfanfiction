I was reading the story Mysteries Unraveled and got to thinking to see if anyone else wrote a fic with this idea (which I am fairly positive there has been). The only problem is that I can't find any more and was hoping some of you would be able to point me in the right direction, thanks.

I should probably mention that it goes through the book chapters line for line and has character reacting to the book. In this fic is has way OOC characters and completely hilarious. (not much info but I don't want to spoil it too much)


** For those of us who have not read the fic could you elaborate more on what that fic is about?
