Lecture notes from Magical Theory lesson 3: Spells

Spell categories 1. Draws magic from target, or powered entirely by caster. 2. Lingering or immediate 3. Perform an action or alter a property.

8 total categories.

Caster, immediate, action - charm Caster, immediate, property - charm Caster, lingering, action - charm Caster, lingering, property - charm Target, immediate, action - jinx Target, immediate, property - hex Target, lingering, action - curse Target, lingering, property - curse

Note: there used to be unique names for each, over time, names have blended to cover multiple types and others were lost.

Note: it is almost impossible to properly curse muggle items because they have no power of their own to sustain a spell! Could magical exhaustion be used to save people from unbreakable curses?

"Dark" spells affect the mind or soul, not only the body.

Unforgivable Curses are classified as such because not only do they perform an immoral and illegal action and act beyond the physical plane, but most importantly because of their deeply corrupting potential on even the most resolutely good hearted caster.

Imperius Curse - Repeated use will cause the caster to have difficulty identifying people as having free will and independant personalities. Leads to sociopathic disorders, disassociation of right and wrong, consequences of actions. Most recent of the three, created during the dark ages. See also, pied piper?

Cruciatus Curse - created by order of the Catholic church during Roman empire. Intended to torture the sinfulness out of people. Results varied. Madness, mental withdrawal, animal behavior, vegetative state... Casting caused psychotic disorder. Dulling of emotions and empathy.

Killing Curse - ancient curse, originated in Babylon. Requires caster to believe they are morally right to kill. Popular among fanatics. God complex, be life of superiority and right to kill at will. Originally intended to prevent use as casual murder spell, backfired when people learned to manipulate themselves into the proper mindset.

Note: Crusiatus Curse does not work on werewolves as it does on others. Can cause partial or complete transformation, even without full moon. Effects on animagi are similar. Documented from experiments performed by Grindlewald.

Patronus Charm - technically "dark" magic by formal definition, ignored due to overwhelming "light" connotations.

Note: creation of Patronus charm documented as occurring before known discovery of Azkaban and Dementors. Research later! What was it's original purpose?

Memory Charms - also technically "dark". Ignored due to usefulness to ministry for enforcement of ISS.
