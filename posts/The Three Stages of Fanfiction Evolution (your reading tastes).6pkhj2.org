1. You begin reading canon compliant stories. They are usually different takes on canon points of divergence. You're in awe of the fact there are (as of 7/25/2017 at 8:20PM) 13,096 people who share your interest. You are so excited to be absorbed into this new world!

2. You've seen people insult Albus Dumbledore here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. You hear of an author named Sinyk, as you've heard of the fact he hates Dumbledore. You decide to read Angry Harry and the Seven. The Dumbledore in this story is a disgusting piece of horse cock. He does everything he can to make Harry's life suck, for the "Greater Good" of course. The reader thus enters his or her rebellious phase. During this phase, you /hate/ Albus Dumbledore's guts. You believe he is the lowest form of scum to ever walk the earth. You rail against the fact he is making a child do this shit, you're pissed that Grindelwald took Dumbledore up the ass rather than you, you're horrified that a man believed to be a paragon of good could possibly do such horrible shit. You wish that Dumbledore, had he not been a sentimental old man, would have lived so he could come to heel for his crimes.

3. After a few weeks/months, you're getting tired of all those Indy!Harry Dumbledore and Weasley bashing stories. You're tired of reading about how Ginny's a whore, how Molly brews love potions, how much of a jealous piece of Slytherin hating shit Ron is, you hate how the Slytherins are almost always portrayed as subhuman, inbred mental invalids. All these cliches are grating on your nerves. You decide to put your foot down, and you spend a few days railing here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] about how every fucking story ever written is cliched garbage. You want your suffering to end. You're begging everyone to just kill you already.

We understand your pain. We went through your pain ourselves. We're going to recommend you all sorts of great stories that are actually original, and creative. Your jaw drops in awe as we flood your inbox with all sorts of awesome stories that aren't canon rehashes, and aren't cliched to the depths of hell.

By the time you've reached Stage #3 and stayed there for a while like me, you feel content.

You're successfully ran the gauntlet of the evolution of your reading tastes.

You did it. You did it without pissing off an entire subreddit, your co-workers, or yourself.

Congratulations. You've learned to accept both canon characters, and original characters, and their good qualities, as well well as their flaws, instead of tunnel visioning on just the good or bad sides of them.


** Stage 4: Can't ever find anything good to read because everything is just the same rehashed cliche bullshit, so you start writing it yourself.

There are exceptions though, people who started reading fanfiction with worm. They think the issues in worm fanfiction are bad, they literally have never things like bashing, really shitty romance, or harems because it simply doesn't exist under worm fanfiction.

I pity them as they would need to lower their tastes dramatically to read other fanfiction.

*** I agree. In public school you're never asked if you liked something or how you feel it could be improved upon. No, they ask you what the themes were, the characters and their part in the plot, and then you get told a few anecdotes about the author. In fan fiction the authors are open to feedback and collaboration (ex: translations or relevant geographic idioms) and watching the evolution of their writing can be very fulfilling.

I used to read a lot of romance fiction and my favorite authors always seemed to get worse as they released new books, like they're just churning things out for money. Fanfic is free so I feel like we get better work because the writer's are doing it to get their idea out or challenge themselves.

The other option (which seems to be much rarer than it ought to be) is making Dumbledore an adversary to Harry without putting him on the opposite team. Make him the ultimate Utilitarian, who doesn't give a shit about ruining the life of anyone if it is for the greater good (consistently written!). As long as in the end the balance is only slightly in the overall positive everything goes. There are more than enough people would actually agree with his approach and he doesn't become outright evil. He's just a natural enemy of Harry, because Harry doesn't want to die. There's more interesting conflict here than the one-dimensional caricature that is Voldemort.

I'm not sure I've ever read a Horcrux-hunt fic with Voldemort as a main villain where the "fighting Voldemort" part was actually interesting (it was barely interesting in canon when it was all new). It's sooo boring now: Bla, bla bla, Inferi lake, Horcrux in the Bank, gotta get hit by an Avada Kadavra somehow, limbo, angsty Harry... Very few authors dare to completely ignore Horcruxes, which might be the first step towards doing something worthwhile.

Something like, you find out you like a certain dynamic and voraciously read every great fic for those two characters, and get into fic recs and the most beloved of that sub genre. One shots and series, completed and in-progress. Then you read some... worse... fic, and it's kind of a drag-- your favorite couple are OOC, the plots are repeating, etc. In the end you find something that's not your ship, but it's next door, maybe the dynamic is similar, just one character is changed, or both are.

** This doesn't apply to me at all. I never ever wanted to read canon compliant stories, because I hate book 6&7 with a fiery passion (except for some parts that are somehow great).

I wanted to see a more honest Dumbledore perspective and a more pro-active Harry, that gains some agency about his fate (not a puppet). I never particularly cared for the other extreme: Deranged Dumbledore and a constantly angry Harry.

I could never finish "Angry Harry and the Seven" and don't get me started about Sinyk's current story "Harry the shithead". I think it's the worst of this genre I've ever seen. No one should like this guy. No one should ever try to be friends with him or appease him. People would start to draw up assassination plots. I actually sympathize more with an evil Dumbledore who must have seen through this nacent Dark Lord and decided to manipulate him.

#+begin_quote
  After a few weeks/months, you're getting tired of all those Indy!Harry Dumbledore and Weasley bashing stories. You're tired of reading about how Ginny's a whore, how Molly brews love potions, how much of a jealous piece of Slytherin hating shit Ron is, you hate how the Slytherins are almost always portrayed as subhuman, inbred mental invalids. All these cliches are grating on your nerves.
#+end_quote

Sure, but I find it equally as grating on my nerves when I read canon compliant fics, where Ginny is best girlfriend ever, Molly - who sees Harry for a few weeks in the summer - is somehow his mother, how the Weasleys in general are the ideal family, how good of a friend Ron is and that he must always be forgiven immediately when he messes up... That Snape is a hero and a beacon of the light, that naming a child Albus Severus isn't child abuse, etc.

#+begin_quote
  you hate how the Slytherins are almost always portrayed as subhuman, inbred mental invalids
#+end_quote

Wait wait wait. Hold the phone! I thought you were talking about bashing clichés. I'm pretty sure that's canon. If you look at JKRs portrayal there are no redeeming qualities in Slytherin at all and Ron is 100% in the right about them.

Anyway... I probably still like to read the bashing fics more, because it feels like a little bit of honesty (like realizing that love potions aren't whimsical/endearing, but horrifying) and not just walking the beaten path of canon.

I kinda feel bad for people who have to swing between extremes for a while until they find their "golden middle" (that the golden middle as you present it in your post is always the optimal position is a fallacy anyway - you're just mitigating your average error). I could never fathom why someone can read OotP and still think Dumbledore is a good person. No fanfic indy!Harry stories necessary for that. It's all laid out in canon.

By that time 'good' people were already going to die. It was something like 'cornered cat' viciously using her nails to desperately claw her way through.

Funny thing how "Harry is dead" was (un)official end of resistance. Seriously! Get a backbone retards. Asking a boy that you left at mercy of hateful bunch to save you from darkest lord and giving up when he dies. I would have loved if Voldemort had used a wide area spell to roast some of those useless fodder trash.

I like Luna when shes a seer, or a kind girl with odd hobbies, or when shes interacting with the fae. I like when Harry learns some form of martial or weapon combat which he then mixes with magic or foregoes magic for. I enjoy when Snape, Draco, the ministry, and sometimes Dumbledore are abused. I like it when magic is quantified and made more "real". I regularly enjoy high combat OP harry stories, or plot/MC armor stories.

Hell my favorite kinds of fanfiction for any series is crossovers, and for HP i generally prefer Harry getting some kind of power from another series, seeing how Hogwarts reacts to a Main Character with powers they have never seen, or just harry adventuring in a new world and liking it.

Generally i just like either fluffy romance with a side of pure action, or Pure undadulterated havoc and action with a splash of romance.

And i think i just realized something, Harry Potter is commonly described as a mystery series, I prefer adventure and that is the part of fanfiction that entices me.

  Welcome.

  How long have you been reading fanfic? I ask because you seem to still be in the Dark!Harry, Indy!Harry Ranting!Harry Dumbledore!Bashing phase (judging by the list of authors and specific pick of Bungle) of the fanfiction reading cycle*, which I think most of us have moved on from now (except for Sesc).

  *Goes something like this:

  1. In-canon "Carry on" fics, either the H/G branch or the H/HR branch. E.g. Power of Emotion, Awakening Power.

  2. Lightsided but Dark Harry.

  Anti-Dumbledore, hates Ron and Hermione, suddenly loves Neville and Luna, likes to rant for long periods of time, shop at Knockturn alley, and stay indefinitely in his summer prior to sixth year.

  Indulgence in rare pairings.

  1. Evil Harry.

  Tends to be a bit crazy, be far more powerful than canon for little to no reason, just goes around killing people. Tend to hate whichever female lead you loved in stage 1.

  Harem fics are the order of the day.

  1. Backlash against evil Harry leads to moderation in fic preferences.

  Quality of writing becomes your main desirable trait in a story. The style of the prose, believable characterisation, coherent world building, realistic pacing. You still like your Harry more powerful/capable than canon, but you want him recognisably Harry. You like Dumbledore again. You're indifferent to pairing. You don't mind Ron and Hermione.

  The fanfiction world seems to shrink as fewer and fewer stories meet your ever rising criteria of what counts as a good fic. You >have developed a large selection of pet hates and cliches, but occasionally like to see them pop up again but utilised in an >original way. Novelty becomes ever more important in stories, and you tend to prefer neat, contained stories with a focused plot to sprawling sagas (or, since this is the fanfiction world, sprawling sags which never get finished).
