Please no HP/HG, HP/GW or HP/Adult (Like Minerva, Bellatrix or so, Tonks would still be ok)

So give me all your favorite HP/Daphne, Pansy, Luna, Gabriell, etc. fics! I already read a lot of them, so surprise me with new one. Oh, and no slash. Thanks :)


** You say no Harry/Adults, but would time travel be an exception?

Because Delenda Est is Harry/Teen!Bellatrix, and I quite enjoy it.

** For Harry/Daphne, I've really enjoyed the Second Chances arc. The Legacy is also good, but I feel like it's a dragged a bit in the last couple of chapters.

**** It was actually pretty good for a bit in terms of action - I thought the author had done a brilliant job balancing the action with dialogue and other plot info at the start. It's just that the last maybe five or so chapters seem to be dragging on.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] has a couple of fics with alternative pairings and they have this thing that most of them exist in an alternate universe with slight variations due to the staples of that universe. For example Daphne is always Harry's friend and agent, his character Titus Button is always present and the Ballycastle Bats are always important in Harry's career. So, if you read one of his fics, the others seem like fanfiction of that one fic.

Sometimes Harry meets Daphne in Hogwarts and they up dating ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]]) linkffn(6943436) or Harry handles the end of war badly, then everyone dies in a freak accident and he ends up helping Gabrielle through her grief during that summer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]] linkffn(6943436), or maybe Harry/Ginny ended up not working due to their Quidditch careers and he meets Luna by accident in one of his tours ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup][The Quidditch World Tour]]) linkffn(6862426) but the universe is the same.

--------------

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net][Jeconais]] has written a lot of alternative pairings but YMMV with his characterization (always Super!Harry, the women are not distinct enough) and plotting.

I think the best of his work is [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] (Harry/Gabrielle), where Gabrielle bonds with Harry after the second task and the consequences for her are dire if Harry doesn't confirm the bond before her 17th birthday, but she wants to do it the right way instead of relying on his "saving people" thing. While the Veela bonding is a cliche I suspect this fic was one of the first to use it well.

I wouldn't normally recommend [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] (Harry/Pansy) but fics with that pairing are rare. Sadly, it gets saddled with everything that makes Jeconais' work a bit repetitive: /Of course/ Pansy is beautiful (and hides under a glamour spell), /of course/ Harry is super powerful, etc. Due to its age I think it inspired a lot of the tropes that are used with Daphne after the canon ended up killing the fandom's interest in Pansy.

--------------

Other fics I've read recently and that I can recommend are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/][Protection From Nargles]] (Harry/Luna) ( linkffn(7352166) ) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/1/Harry-and-Luna-Against-the-High-Inquisitor][Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor]] ( linkffn(7725072) ) probably have the best Luna characterization in a novel length fic but the first one has the roughest of beginnings. In these Luna is not a magical creature, or a fairy or a medium, she's just Luna.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985543/1/The-Forgotten-Contract][The Forgotten Contract]] (Harry/Susan) ( linkffn(7985543) ) takes the Marriage Contract trope and plays it straight, although the amount of angst is near zero compared with other fics in that genre. The writing is nothing special (even juvenile) and the last third of the story feels very rushed but there's not a lot of Hufflepuff/Harry out there.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] (Harry/Fleur) ( linkffn(3384712) ) merges Harry's and James's personalities and memories before the Triwizard Tournament. It's a love/hate fic, mostly due to the Hat's new attitude but other than that it makes the pairing work with an interesting Fleur and Harry with his newly found confidence.
