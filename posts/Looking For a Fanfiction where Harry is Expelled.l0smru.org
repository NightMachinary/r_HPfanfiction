:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fan fic where Harry is expelled from Hogwarts during/after First Year because he was getting too many detentions and couldn't keep up with his homework. I think Snape is the one giving him the detentions and the one who pushes for expulsion.

Thanks for your help ðŸ™ƒ

**** The tags are misleading.

The story starts with Dumbledore telling Snape how disappointed he is that Snape gave Harry detention EVERY NIGHT that first term (September through December). Thus he failed all his classes and was expelled. At this point, the story does not show any interaction between Snape and Harry at all. Harry leaves the school and Dumbledore thinks he'll go back to his relatives' house, but he doesn't because he's learned about his inheritance.

The next line says "Seven years later." Everything else takes place with Harry at least 18 years old.

To be fair though, anything where Snape has sex is kinda gross, ("I loved your mom, but you'll do fine") but of course your mileage may vary on that.

** Not Harry but Sirius gets expelled in this one and it's veeery good! There's a chapter on what happens if you get expelled from Hogwarts whicj is just fascinating!!! I love it. Incomplete and updated sporadically but the chapter on "What happens if your expelled from Hogwarts" is worth reading as a standalone if nothing else. The characters analysis are also really good. It's just a good story!

It's chapter 26. It can be read as a oneshot without the fic and I highly recommend it if nothing else.

  After being expelled from Hogwarts for his dangerous prank on Severus Snape, Sirius Black vanished without a trace. The official story was that he ran away from home, but his closest friends always believed something far more sinister must have happened for Sirius to disappear without so much as an owl.Five years later, as Voldemort's attacks grow bolder and more deadly, Remus Lupin spots a familiar face while on a mission for the Order of the Phoenix, the face of a man he believed to be dead. What happened to Sirius Black? Why did he disappear, and, more importantly, why is he back?
