Just realized I should have put character interpretations in question, sorry 'bout that.

Anyway... hey everyone, again. I was looking at some author pages on FF.net, and realized that quite a few actually take the time to write out characters they've written about (canon, most of the time), giving their own interpretation of the character. This includes what they think they're like, why they are the way they are, etc. I've already read three of them for Sirius Black alone.

So, to readers and writers alike, here are my questions:

1. Is this actually helpful?
2. Does anyone actually bother going to the author's profile and reading their theories/ideas on the canon characters, or is it just a waste of time/takes up space?
3. Do you prefer it/does it interest you to read about authors' interpretations?

All in all, was just wondering because I've seen several people doing this. Also, sometimes I feel like a lot of the time my interpretations of a character/certain things they do has to be justified from canon, but am not sure if I'm simply being irrational?

Thanks in advance everyone!


** I mean, if I like the story, and I head to the author page to check out more of their stuff/their favourite list and stumble upon their character deep dives or whatever, I'll probably take the time to read it, unless it's he standard boring rehash stuff.

But I don't think you should put it there with the expectation that it'll be read by a lot of people. If you need to justify or explain something a character did in the story outside of the actual story, that's probably not great writing.

That's what I thought too! I always thought and made a great effort to make sure my characters' actions were well thought out and justified within the story without every having to explain it. But I can see/understand why someone would take it to another level, especially for a character like Sirius Black (maybe not so much for the Golden Trio) where most of the time (when writing in-character/as close to canon as possible) it's based off inferences and theories from what we were given.

But what made me think otherwise is that I've only ever seen the more 'advanced' authors doing this on fanfic.net (actual writers, people who have published 10+ fics with a good amount of reviews/follows/favorites). Ones that have super intense, multi-layered stories, and have taken the time to do full psychological analysis of their characters, which is what led me to ask.

Also, thanks for taking the time to respond!

**** In those cases I can understand and get behind them writing stuff out in further detail, mainly because the further detailed stuff on their profile is probably more ‘nice to know' instead of ‘story literally makes no sense if you don't read it'.

Basically it's just that they want to expand further on the character and possibly the world of their fic beyond what may be possible in the scope of the actual story they're writing, so they take the time to go further on their profile.

Not a writer myself, this is just what I've observed.

And yeah as you said, the extra detailed stuff tend to come from people who've written a lot, /because/ they have a sort of canon of their own within the fics they've written, since the characters/world have developed beyond the actual canon story. It's not something that should ever be necessary to a fic, but it can provide a nice addition.

In those cases it may (I do not know, just guessing) be that the characters have gotten diverse enough that they could count as original characters in the skin of canon characters, in which case the character profiles could be there for the sake of indulging the readers' curiosities. It's hard to say because a review/follow/favourite count does not actually matter all that much and there are people with multiple fics who've only ever written rubbish, but at the very least it's a possibility.

** Re.1: Not really, I say. One could argue that when arguing hypothetical situations the knowledge of a character's personality and motivations is useful, but you generally don't think about hypothetical situations when talking about characters in derivative stories. Outside of that it is useful for any writer to keep notes on their characters, but you very much don't need to place them on a profile page (in fact, if you do and that---keeping notes---is the reason then that's kind of a fail). The only other reason is if the character does not make sense in the context of the story, in which case the solution is not giving the readers a character description but rather fixing your own writing so that you don't have to do this. It's a bit different if the character is a genuine original character, in which case it may be posted to satisfy the readers' curiosity without info-dumping in the story about stuff that probably doesn't matter, but people /very rarely/ do it about original characters.

Re.2: “Anyone”, no doubt about it. Probably not too many people, though, and I've never done it, usually only seeing whatever the author had on their profile page once I either got through one story and wanted to check their other ones or decided to stop reading for the sake of my own sanity and checked what kind of lunatic would write whatever it is that I couldn't get through.

Re.3: As trite as it may sound, my answer to this is “meh”. For me, what matters is that the characters are internally consistent and that the changes to them compared to how they are in canon make sense in the context of the story and its backstory (there's some leniency for comedy stories there). As such, if those requirements are fulfilled then I do not need to read about the author's interpretation because that will be clear from the story and if they aren't then reading about it on the author's profile page won't help me any.

** I very rarely read the bio page on the authors profile page, /especially/ when it's a 10 page wall of text with stupid jokes that would fit in on [[/r/ForwardsFromGrandma]].

I might glance at the top to see if any author updates but that's about it
