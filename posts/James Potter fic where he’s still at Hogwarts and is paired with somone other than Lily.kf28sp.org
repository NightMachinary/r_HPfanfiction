The Life and Times by Jewel5. It is a cult classic yes and but its brilliantly written. Its a Jily fic without the Jily (they both date other people) so you get to watch that whole interaction unfold and conflict arise and honestly I'm not just saying this, but its one of the best written things I've seen. Its witty and funny and breaks the 4th wall on occasions. Just a joy to read and cry at.

Spoiler thats not really a spoiler but the reason why I've recommended it under this question:: James and Lily do not date in this fic

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

*** While I haven't read the fic myself, isn't the fic intended to be canon compilant? So while it fulfills OP's request, it only does so in the technical sense?

**** Tbh I was banking on other people having better suggestions. I commented this pretty soon after it was posted because hey, I'm bored and this was the best story that popped into my head when I read the post ðŸ˜€.

It's probably not what OP is looking for. I dont expect them to read it. But it's the best story I've read where James is dating someone who isn't Lily for the entire story. Yeah it's a heavily implied Jily story so it's expected they get together after the fact which I did warn about in my post. I just think it's brilliant for the writing. It's a genuinely a brilliant story to read.

I dunno... The relationship between James and the girl is truly interesting. if it's not what they're looking for, feel free to downvote and ignore it ðŸ˜€. I was just sharing a good story ðŸ˜€

***** I have no hard feelings, just figured I'd ask since I had seen elsewhere that it was a Jily fic.
