Time traveling is tricky to write about, even the most knowledgeable makes mistakes on it.

But just thinking about it: A character going back into time, changes things just by being there.

So, what are some interesting time travel stories where things change, rather small, medium or large. Maybe Voldemort had moved the Horcruxes, changed some, or maybe something happened to some good guys, or bad guys or just a wide variety.

Not looking for OP Harry or Lord Potter stories.

Not looking for Weasley Bashing or Dumbledore Bashing. If there has to be bashing, then a little bit, otherwise I'd rather it not be there, if possible.

Can be on ANY site, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash, can be any main character, can have any warnings.

Can be completed/regularly updated or not.


** If this is done using time turners, nothing would change because it has already been done since before you even thought about it.

So there should be another method to time travel, a "lucky accident", as some fics call them, are impossible to ever happen.

The only way I can see this happening is if an actual seer would find accurate predictions. A centaur maybe?

** Backwards with a Purpose is the best Time Travelling HP fic, if not the best ff of all.
