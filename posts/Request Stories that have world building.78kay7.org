I love world building development, it's a lot of fun and wish that Rowling had done more world building in the stories. So I'm looking for any well written world building stories.

No character bashing, unless it makes sense for the story. If it doesn't make sense for the story then please no character bashing.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

They can stay in London, or go elsewhere it doesn't matter. As long as the world is expanded on more.

The main character can be Harry or someone else, it can be set in any Era as long as there's world building.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione and no harems. Any other pairing is fine.


** linkffn(3766574) Prince of the Dark Kingdom has the best world building I've ever seen although you've probably already read it.

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home) has excellent world-building. While there is some world-building in the current time period, what is really excellent is the worldbuilding it does in the past.

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) is also excellent in worldbuilding. I haven't seen two universes merged so seamlessly before, and then it still expands on both universes. I definitely recommend it, even if you haven't watched Firefly.

linkffn(Blindness) is something you might like as well if you liked Core Threads. It does have worldbuilding as well, but it suffers from similar problems as that story does.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs World building is for sure met. There is a slight harem but not really as it is essential to the AU built.

The Difference One Man Can Make is a HP/GOT with hands down the best world building I've ever read. Highly recommend.

*** Now, the Firebird Trilogy may contain all sorts of fucked up things, but a harem isn't one of them. If anything, it's an anti-harem story - Harry and the girls get together due to necessity and obligation, not one of them at any point is happy with the arrangement - in fact the whole situation makes everyone miserable. And it dissolves in the end.

It was, for sure, my favorite part of Firebird, the subversion of the usual harem trope. It took guts too, since DM has used harems in his other stories liberally. Props to him for that.

***** Ha! Never said that I disliked it... well actually I did hate it, a lot, when I first read it. That was back when it was still being updated. I think I mainly hated because I had a vision as to how the story should proceed (i.e Harry changing the whole system through extreme amounts of violence) and DM kept going in other directions - in fact I remember leaving DM a review (I think after the Sabbat did something horrible to Luna?) that I couldn't wait to witness Harry garroting coven hags and DM responding with "wtf are you talking about, Harry is not a murderer".

But after the trilogy was completed I read it again, with more clarity. I understand why lots of peope dislike it, really, the state the magical world in /Firebird/ is a *bitter* pill to swallow, but I can appreciate the storytelling more, now. Especially the fact that the whole society was finally altered in non-violent ways. Because one way or another, all the characters were playing their part - the matriachal societies had been established over one thousand years ago - it wasn't like some matriarchs rebelled and started oppressing people. And I definitely appreciated the way divisions were presented in the story - dark vs light, male vs female - and how, although some resolutions were a bit too much of /deus-ex machina/ (think Voldemort butchering the dark matriarchs), it was very interesting to watch how, essentially, the system was ready to collapse. Harry was merely a manufactured catalyst. And he played his part well. Also loved the fact that Lily was so ruthless, her usual portrayal is that of an angel with red hair.

Maybe you misunderstood? I *loved* the fact that the ending was harsh. It was a refreshing bit of deconstruction, in that if you force a boy and four girls to marry, it will be an unmitigated disaster 100% of the time.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
