I'm nearing the end of my longfic and although I have written several battle scenes in it before, I noticed that I'm just not very good at it. Can anyone help me uncover what the secret formula is for a really suspenceful battle? Especially if it is 'the' final battle?

I have already written the final chapter to complete the story and after working on it since 2016, I am really /really/ ready to let it go once and for all.


** If you're looking for battles to model off of, the first chapter of /Realignment/ linkffn(12331839) is a very good battle scene for relatively small scale combat. Both /Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded/ and /Time, Mr Potter?/ linkffn(5269970; 4165301)have some good fight scenes as well. Third Key has some awesome large scale battles, the Durmstrang battle scene in particular (chapter 77, although without reading the rest you'll be horribly confused). Time, Mr Potter? has some good medium scale fights scattered throughout as well as the final battle scene that takes up nearly ten chapters on its own.

Generally speaking, there are a few basic things you need to have planned to write a coherent battle scene.

1. Who is fighting? What do they have to bring to the battle? What is the environment (Weather, location, temperature, clothing, time period, etc.) like, and how will it influence the conflict?
2. Who is going to win? What casualties will there be if any? Will there be any damage to the environment?
3. How is the winner going to win, and the loser lose? Will there be any major events that turn the tide in one way or another?
4. Where does each side start? Do they get reinforcements midway through the battle? When and where will they arrive, and how will they affect things?

From all of the above questions, plan it out. Come up with conflicts within the greater battle that you want to cover, and flesh them out. Twists? Sure, throw a few in if you want. Foreshadowing important elements that will reappear later in the battle is also useful. As you go, try to keep mixing your sentence structure. /Realignment/ especially does a very good job of this, avoiding super choppy sentences while still keeping everything concise.

Once you have the battle done, ask yourself what the aftermath is going to look like. The battle itself is usually fairly brief; the cleanup is what takes forever. How is everyone involved going to react to the outcome?

There are many things that go into a good battle scene. The three fics I noted up there do a good job of answering all of those questions as their respective battles occur, and stand out a bit because of it I think.

Cheers.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

*** Thank you so much for this! :) I've got most of the major happenings planned out but now I know how to flesh it out a bit more to make it less generic. Cheers!

** A trick I've heard of is to decide the outcome of an action a character takes with a d20 dice. The higher the number the more successful whatever the character tried ends up being for instance:

Harry uses Expelliarmus - roll an 12.

Ron dodges but only just barely and shoots a stunner, due to the close shave, it's less accurate than normal. - rolls 2 dice and takes the lowest number: a 6.

Harry easily steps out of the way of the spell and casts a full body bind. - 16.

Ron, unable to dodge has to cast a shield instead. - 15.

Harry's spell is blocked and shoot another disarmer in quick succession. - 2.

Ron is easily able to dodge the spell and casts another stunner. - 20.

Harry is stunned.

Another thing to consider is the use of the environment. What can be used as cover? What can be dropped on the opponent? How can the environment be manipulated to each sides' favour? Are there choke points that can be made advantage of? Are there opportunities for ambush?

** Hi!! I've written a lot of battle scenes, although my style alters between two stylistic choices. I tend to use a reverse mechanism for almost all of my battles to determine how they'll go, and then tidy it up after. For example: In a battle between...I don't know- Draco and Harry. I want the chapter to end with...let's say for this example it's a â€˜Harry exploring dark magic and getting addicted' type thing. So, I want the scene to end with Draco injured due to an unexpected dark spell, and Harry a bit drugged on dark magic. Let's work backwards.

End result is Harry drugged and Draco injured. [how injured?] I'm going to say somewhat bloody. [how did the curse move?] ehh, let's make a cool corkscrew [that implies it was a clear sightline, so they were hiding around obstacles. What setting has a lot of obstacles?] okay so in the forest [how were they fighting off the path] I guess they were in the forest, aka deviated from the path [why would they deviate from the path?] too exposed to fight, so they're throwing a lot of spells at each other and hiding behind trees [what sort of spells are they hiding from?] straight line spells would be easiest to hide behind trees. So fairly close quarters curses

Bam, by working backwards from the end result, I've established that for this scene, the two confront, start flinging quick straightforward curses and seeking cover. After seeking cover, they venture a bit deeper into the forest because trees are getting damaged, and Harry manages to get one good shot using dark magic causing Draco to drop injured, and Harry to get that sweet dark magic headrush.

I know my mechanism doesn't work well for everyone, but if you have any questions please let me know!!
