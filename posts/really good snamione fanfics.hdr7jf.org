any snamione fanfic recommendations?


** These are my favs, and yes I KNOW some of them may be a little out there. I'm sure I'll get downvoted to Hell, but hey, if you're brave enough to ask I'll be 2 seconds of brave to answer. I'm sorry, but I'm unsure how to link.

Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh

Forged in Flames by MsWhich

Saving Your Life by lilmisblack

Before the Dawn by snarkyroxy

**** I just finished Pet Project. I put it off for a long time because I wasn't sure if it was for me. The story and slow build then slown burn enraptured me completely. This is a good one.

Also, have you read any of the others I recommend earlier?

** I have got back into reading fanfiction recently (specifically this ship, it really touches on all the arcs I enjoy so much - slowburn, emotional vulnerability, hurt/comfort, enemies to lovers etc.; probably my daddy issues chipping in for the age difference as well :))). And I realized as before I mostly read fanfics in my mother tongue, I've missed on a lot of classics, so I've been catching up a little during this quarantine. Here's my list of a few long snager|snamione| SS/HG fanfics (bear in mind I only read the ones with happy endings):

​

linkffn(6578435) Post Tenebras Lux by Loten - recently read it, and it immediately became my favourite fanfic ever. It's a perfect characterization of Severus for me, wonderful slowburn, it is less about plot (although I found that nice too) and more about exploring the emotions and thoughts of both characters, how would their relationship develop long term. Very believable reasoning for getting together, nice characters (apart from perhaps slight vilification of Minerva, albeit believable too) and the way Loten made Snape this grungy wizard fit very well with my headcanon. Others also recommend another long work from Lotem Chasing the sun - I am planning to get to it some day, it's even longer than this one.

linkffn( 2290003 ) - Pet project by Caeria, a close to perfect fanfic for me as well. Good world building, AU starting in 6th year; a lot of careful character explorations, Hermione caring for Snape. I dislike some character OOCs (mostly Harry), but otherwise a wonderful work with a lot of careful planning put into it (it had been written over 8 years, and sometimes you see dialogies dragging a bit, but that is a very minor drawback).

linkffn(4661762) - Guilded cage, a nice marriage law type of fic, without too much OOC; I do not agree with all the character decisions, but then again, it's hard to find an author that thinks in exactly the same way as you do, for me it has only been Loten so far, and one Russian author with a short but perfect snager post-hog fanfic. This one has a lot of longing , slow relationship development, hurt/comfort and good reasonings.

linkffn(5041998) - De Profundis/*Out of the Depths,* smutty and nice relationship development on Hermione's last year, post-war (I generally prefer those to AU works in their last school years, because having Voldemort around is too stressful, and I alway feel like i'm too worried about these two).

linkffn(5928118) - A chance in time, a nice time-travelling fanfic if you are concerned about them falling in love woth each other with an almost 20 years age difference; very gentle and touching fic, perhaps a bit too much smut and little action in the end, but the development of the story is worth it.

linkffn(5202994) - Vixen, a cool, althoug at times quite illogical fic, Hermione turns into a Vixen and stays with Snape. I'd say the reasoning for the relationship is quite lazy, but it is still very nice and cozy. Not the best fic, but well worth reading I would say.

linkffn(12096694) - Teaching miss Granger, mostly smut and PWP with some nice slow relationship development (but this is like 85% smut, so if you're not into it - just skip this fic)

​

A few more shorter fics, they're not perfect of course, yet I found them all quiate enjoyable.

linkffn(12866478), linkffn(1569784), Rumour has it ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12839777/1/Rumour-Has-It]] ) (it seems it's not on the origninal website anymore, I only read the translation, but perhaps you could find it with some searching aorund if you're really interested).

​

And some of my faourite fanfics are written in Russian orinigally, sometimes I feel a bit sorry knowing a lot of people would really enjoy them, but I'd be too lazy to translate anything myself, and have no idea whether anyone tried to either.

​

So here's that, I hope you'll find this helpful!
