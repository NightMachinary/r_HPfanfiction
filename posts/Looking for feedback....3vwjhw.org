Hello everyone! Mexican student over here. :D I write quite a lot of short stories and poetry in my free time, and I love the fanfiction community. This is my first time writing in English so I would like some pointers in my grammar, style and flow within the story to make it better. Here we go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653640/1/In-the-eyes-of-a-Wizard]]


** General advice: Take your time to set the scene. When the people clash together at Grimmauld Place I had /no/ idea who was present until I read further down. Thats incredibly off-putting as an introduction scene.

Also, less is often times a lot more. Just in this short strip of 1300 words we have Regulus being /not/ dead, we have the daughter of Regulus and Diana Potter entering the stage and, of course, Harry making an appearance.

Content-wise we have a short discussion about whats dark magic and whats not, why dark magic is banned by the Ministry, the Blacks knowing about the half-blood status of Voldemort, Dumbledore stating that he needs to train Neville, and so on and so forth...

In short: This is way, waaay too much information for 1300 words. Take your time.

*** Thanks! I will make the first chapter longer and maybe eliminate some pieces of information, like I said, this is extremely AU and your advice made me think quite a lot since there is a lot of information.

**** Given how much is in the first chapter, you could easily write 10000 words worth of text for all thats in this first piece.

But your writing is decent and nice enough to read. A bit rough around the edges, but as someone who's native language isn't English either, I know how it is.

** I can't really spot any problems with the flow of your story. Grammar-wise, the most pressing issue would be your run-on sentences.

Finally, there are a couple of small errors which can be fixed with either a careful reread or the help of an editor. Since this is a very small passage, I could do it for you if you'd like.

** For a first attempt at writing in English, this is an impressive piece of work!

To point out issues in grammar, diction, etc. might get tedious here... I'm not sure if there are beta readers who do just that, but it might be your best bet to search for one on FFN, for example. As Vardso said, run-on sentences seem to be the primary issue, so reading up on sentence structure might help.
