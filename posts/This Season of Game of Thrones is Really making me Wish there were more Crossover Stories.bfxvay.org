Not to make too many assumption, but I'd be willing to bet a significant portion of folks who grew up reading Harry Potter make up the audience of Game of Thrones. It'd be so cool if more crossovers were done between the two.

Jon reincarnated as Harry as vice versas would be so damn cool because of their similarities. I think the appeal of Westeros and GOT is how it is an epic story, and lends itself to exploring original ideas and avoiding played out troped that we commonly see in the HP fandom.


** I read a story once where Tywin was reincarnated as harry.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12864872/1/The-Reins-of-Castamere]] Honestly thought this one was lacking.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11959184/1/Hadrian-Lannister-Lion-of-the-Rock]] I really enjoyed this one, though.

*** Feel free to recommend them anyway (or link to your favourites if they are there). Most fanfic readers don't care whether a story is complete or not.

** To be honest, I dislike the idea of GoT characters in the Harry Potter world, and ignore those whenever I can discern that that's what's happening from the summary.

However, Harry Potter characters in the GoT world does something akin to a goddamn explosion in my brain, and I can't get enough of it.

In the spirit of your post, I'll share some of my favorites!

(I'm not going to recommend any fics that I can remember overtly sexualizing children, but given the nature of the GoT universe, I'm not going to link directly to any of these stories simply to be on the safe side.)

--------------

The Difference One Man Can Make

The Black Prince

The Wizard of Harrenhal

The Winter Witch

The Song of Builders

A Discordant Note (Sequel to 'For Love of Magic', by noodlehammer.)

God-Emperor of Essos and beyond (harem-wank, IIRC, but it has a lot of words.)

--------------

Unforuntatly, I don't think any of these stories are complete, but that's just the unfortunate trend for crossover stories, it seems.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

** linkao3(crossover fixits to help westros be less miserably doomed)

No Harry Potter as yet but 8 different fandoms so far, well worth the read. Love the Avengers one and the ff7 and ff15 ones

** I've always wanted a good HP/Mass Effect crossover, but there's only like 5 worth mentioning and they're all abandoned or finished with no sequels

Harry/FemShep or Liara would be extremely fun to read.
