:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Alright, so this fic is set after the war. Pretty much, Voldemort stays as a ghost and his Horcruxes incorporate into him again. There was something about him being in Africa and a tribe that worshipped him, I think. He had to go back to Britain for some reason and he went to Harry. Ge stayed around for like a month until they did a ritual to bring him back. Then, there was smut. I think it was a one shot. And on Adultfanfiction. But I checked on there and it seems like I was wrong. So if you know it, please send me the link.
