#+TITLE: Channeling time magic is bad for your health, but being a seer's near relative is good for your reproductive prospects. So seer magic really does skip three generations. But studying divination resets the clock. Hogwarts teaches divination because the British Seers' Cartel wants to limit supply.

- If the seer gene is active in utero, a person develops special organs for channeling time magic in volume to make prophesies
- In order to maximize the number of close relatives per seer, if you use any divination magic your body methylates the hell out of its seer gene, and it takes 3 generations to strip off all the methyls and reactivate the gene.
- If all the kids study divination in school, then there'll be a big shortage of seers, and any fool (even a drunk fool) can get hired for a high salary, so long as they can make the occasional prophesy
- Dumbledore goes along with this plot because he doesn't want Voldemort to get his hands on a seer and win the war
