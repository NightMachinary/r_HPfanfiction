What is your headcanon on the government of Magical France? We now know from /Pottermore/ that it has a Ministry of Magic, though even that info is questionable (I know some people choose to disregard /Pottermore/ information). In the rather good linkffn(Divided and Entwined), it's posited that Magical France never had a revolution, and it is still ruled by the 'Duc d'Orl√©ans' (this title was actually the King's brother's in real life, and I guess the idea is that in those days, the magical ruler Memory-Charmed his way into the Muggle court by pretending to be the King's brother?), along with a court of noblemen, which the Delacours are a part of (hence their name, which literally means 'from the Court').


** I envision quite the opposite actually. I would see families like the Malfoy's fleeing France during the revolution as both magical and muggles peoples rebelled and threw off their nobel rulers. That's how a half giant and a half veela became so influential in France: no ancient traditions to make pureblooded wizards the top social class, because all of them were killed or exiled in the early 19th century. I would see France as far more libertine, but at the same time less advanced magically because they got rid of all of the people who knew and understood the most advanced magic as being counter revolutionaries.

*** We have no canon evidence men can be veela and she flips her shit when she's called a halfbreed so she's hidden it well most likely.

** I like the idea of magical governments being out of step with 20th century borders and the modern European nation state. So maybe the borders of the French Ministry are not the same as contemporary France. I also have it in my head that Jersey island is some bizarre no-mans land where you can hide from the ministry - not really claimed by either UK or France. It's a fun little way to explain why so-and-so character suddenly transfers in to Hogwarts despite never seeing actual transfers in the books (so maybe HP is already in the Bood of Admittance, but didn't get his letter because he was living in Jersey).

** I once wrote a small compendium of magical governments for a "Grand Tour" type of fic. It included such things as the still intact wizarding Austro-Hungarian Empire with the "Imperator in absentia" ruling over it. The Sultanat Babylon that is basically a citystate located in the obscured Tower of Babel. Or the theocratic nation surrounding Uagadou which is ruled by Voodoo priests.

For the entirety of France I envisioned something akin to the EU, just smaller. Veela and halfgiants are way more accepted there, it seems. I thought along those lines and imagined magical France to be a union of Veela tribes, Centaur herds, Goblin enclaves and Wizard communities. The central council where nation-wide law is made and enforced lies in Nancy, at the north-side of the quartier magique - the central point of the central magical city of France and the Benelux. I envisioned the Ministry of France to be the government of the wizards, alongside the centaur Elders, the Veela Matriarchs and the Goblin Kings, all ruled by the Council of Nancy as the overlying institution.

** I made up a government system for France/Europe for a story I'm writing that is based on the thought that wizards made treaties which ensure that their borders do not change when muggles change theirs (mostly through war). Therefore magical Europe is a picture of medieval Europe because I can't see magical administration change just because the muggles did. England is a special case due to the independence movements that tore apart the empire.

Spain is divided into the administrative states of Cordoba and Asturias, roughly based on the 1000 borders because they were the first who adopted these treaties. Recently (from the 1994 point of view) they began the unification process but fielded a common Quidditch team since 1953.

France is divided in a dozen substates which meet once every year to make the decisions for all of France. It's a little like the European Union. Each of these states has unique government. The Duchy of Burgundy, which is in the eastern part of France, has a hereditary Veela dynasty. The Duke of Normandy still swears fealty to the British Crown while part of magical France. And the Mayor of Paris is considered Lord Protector of France, which honestly is a representative role without any real power.

** My headcanon is that pre-statute, magicals were very close to a singular government for the whole eastern hemisphere save for the asian countries which were a multitude of fiefdoms held by those beholden to an emperor or the like, therefore all the euro countries are basically the same format while asian countries are more feudal in their country's style with actual royalty still.

America is a land of rebellious colonies in the minds of brits still and is a hodgepodge of small democratic communities occasionally working together peppered by aboriginal communities.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
