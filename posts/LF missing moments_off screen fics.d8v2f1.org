What are your favorite missing moments/off “screen”/here's what's happening elsewhere fics? I'd especially love what Ginny (or really anyone) was doing in book 7.

I really liked Order of Mercy and the three chapter one of a day in the life of Professor McGonagall during book 5.


** Maybe not what your looking for, but the closet that comes to my mind is linkffn(I've always wanted to use that spell).

It show moments in the past, both before and during Harry's years at Hogwarts, that McGonagall was close to using the spell that brought the armor and statues to life.

  One-shot. McGonagall finally got to awaken the statues in the Battle of Hogwarts, but she wanted to do it for a long time. Given all the times she missed her chance, it was no wonder she was so eager when the time came.

** I love Calibration and everything else by this author. I always wondered about that boggart lesson, and this story explains it perfectly.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125]])

I'm working on a series called Employee of the Month, about Remus's twelve years of loneliness and poverty between the wars, although there isn't much demand for that sort of thing. I've posted only the first book.

#+begin_quote
  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** I enjoyed this recently posted fic about Ginny writing letters to George, who has gone off alone somewhere in the months after Fred's death. It suffers a little from Americanisms, but it's full of feeling for such a short fic.

** I think it is a proper form here to link to the stories you mentioned so that others may properly enjoy it as well. So, here it goes:

- “Order of Mercy” is linkffn(12181042). I have a technical problem with the story (why couldn't Muggleborns just go to the Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick, or Waterloo, and just leave the Muggle way? Don't tell me that people who cannot pronounce “electricity” correctly, would invest manpower to put an agent to such Muggle environments and that such people would be able to recognize one witch or wizard who is perfectly capable blend-in with the Muggle world amongst the thousands passengers running through the airport/railway station), but ignoring that it is really lovely and a great insight into the life of Bill & Fleur, not mentioning Percy & Audrey relationship is lovely described (although, in my head-canon Audrey should be firmly a Muggle, but that's my problem not the authors' one). Highly recommended.

- “the three chapter one of a day in the life of Professor McGonagall during book 5” is I believe linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday... by Twisted Biscuit), which I agree is truly hilarious story. You will never see penguins same after reading this!

Now my own suggestions:

- It was a long time ago when I read linkffn(The Missing Moments by Ash-and-Vine), which is a complete set of missing moments from all books (and bit after) from the Hermione's point of view. The stress is on “complete”, which has an unfortunate result that some chapters are truly banal, because the author didn't have much more to add than rewrite one sentence from the books into a separate chapter. However, there are some chapters which are truly truly excellent (Ron & Hermione in the Seashell Cottage gives me still shivers whenever I read it; Hermione caring for Harry after the Godric's Hollow inspired me to write my own version, linkao3(11032308)).

- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][“Rows by Anthosha”]] is a small one-shot (two chapters) missing moment, which in my head-canon happened (and surprisingly when thinking about it, it actually doesn't completely contradict the canon, and it is the only good thing for that otherwise completely idiotic decision to put Harry to the Dursleys' house after the Dumbledore's death). Ginny goes to visit Harry in the Little Whinging to clear out the misunderstanding between them.

- Talking about Antosha, his series “The Weasley Family Picnic”, linked from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/581954/Antosha][his profile]] (unfortunately FF.net doesn't allow organizing stories into series, so you have to find it manually from all his stories). It is a bit smutty, but not overly so, and some parts of the series are truly excellent (Ginny and Charlie).

- All stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][TheDivineComedian]], but particularly linkao3(12299451)

- linkao3(Summer of '97 by Northumbrian), linkao3(The Hufflepuff by Northumbrian), and linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) are all still in the books time-frame, so they can be called missing moments stories. All of them are by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] so all of them are excellent.

- Actually, thinking about it, linkffn(12373273) is one big missing moment as well, look from Percy Weasley point of view (the end is a bit AU).

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.
