During a Halloween Ball, Fred and George decide it would be hilarious to cast a spell over the Great Hall that would temporarily turn everyone into their costumes. Naturally this causes problems when those in Werewolf and Vampire costumes suddenly turn into real Werewolves and Vampires and start duking it out in the middle of the hall. Once Midnight arrives, the spell wears off and everyone turns back.

But there was a side effect. Everyone now has left-over powers and abilities from their costumes. Those who wore werewolf costumes can now turn into a wolf form without losing their minds. Those who wore vampire costumes can turn to mist and float off the ground. Those who dressed up as Superman can now fly and have enhanced strength.

Hilarious Hijinks occur.


** So a YAHF genre shifted from Buffy to Harry Potter then.

Edit: the only way I can see that working without it becoming a blood bath is adding some sort of protection enchantment, but that has a whole whale of ramifications for the worldbuilding.

Also, Wizards don't really celebrate Halloween with costumes as far as I can tell.

** Snape now has the ability to fly without a broom. He had turned into a giant overgrown bat during the transformation.
