I don't know where this came from but I keep seeing it in fics. The word "nutters" is the plural of "nutter" and nothing else. The word you are probably looking for is "nuts" which is a perfectly normal way to call someone barmy.


** Round where I'm from (Leicester, England), nutters is a perfectly good adjective - calling someone 'absolutely nutters' is pretty common...

*** Damn!

I asked a bunch of people to try and make sure it wasn't just something that never made it down my way and they all pretty much agreed with my sentiment.

At the very least it's weird to hear Ron saying it seeing as I'm from those parts.

**** Certainly less common than 'nutters' as plural for nutter, and it does sound a little weird without an adverb with it.

If someone said someone was just 'nutters' I probably /would/ think 'Why didn't you just say he's "a nutter"? or he's "nuts"?'

Now I've thought about it too much and everything sounds weird...

***** Hey at least it isn't "I could care less".

Even having heard a perfectly reasonable explanation for it being idiomatic usage in America these are still British characters.

Or people think everyone in the UK has a name from Burke's Peerage

******* Ooh I also find it weird when anyone calls anyone "Ma'am". Teachers were always "miss" or "sir".

** This just reminds me of all the multitude of common grammar or spelling mistakes that I constantly see in fics. I've read enough fanfics to not regret stopping one if it is just badly written.

I've been picky for the last year or so, so I've forgotten many, but one that sticks in my mind is: 'I resemble that', when clearly the author is trying to say 'I resent that'. Grinds my gears every time.

If I can think of any others, I'll comment more.
