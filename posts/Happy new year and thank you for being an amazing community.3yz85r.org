** I devote an embarrassing amount of my life to Harry Potter fan fiction, and none of my real life friends read it. I am so glad this sub exists so that I can actually talk about my incredibly time-consuming hobby.

** Came in search of new fics to read. Frequented due to the many great and varied recs. Started checking every day for the interesting discussions, and then finally made a reddit account so I could join in.

Thanks for being the community that got me into reddit! Best sub I've come across before and since
