I read the first few chapters of Basilisk Eyes, but I really dislike that it doesn't focus on Hogwarts/Magic. Is there another story where Harry ends up blind and still kicks ass?


** Blindness by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/717542/AngelaStarCat][AngelaStarCat]] is the obvious answer and many like it if you haven't read it

** There are better ones:

link[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1235011/6/Go-With-the-Tide][ffn(1235011)]] - a bit of an old one, but probably the best take on blind Harry and what it entails. Also Snape being Snape and not a whitewashed version.

linkffn(6554218) - an unfinished series

  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.
