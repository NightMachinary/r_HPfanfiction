** Canon magic, honestly. Magic was developed for each book rather than having consistency over all of them. Especially if you try to include the movies and smaller canon sources.

Doesn't make the stories less entertaining though. Swiss cheese is still delicious.

Were computers really widely used or known back in 1980's in the UK, especially at home or in elementary schools? I don't imagine the Dursleys would have a personal computer before it was common and normal for most families to have one.

The Dursleys did have a computer in 1991. In Chapter 3 of Philosopher's Stone, there's a mention of a photograph of Dudley playing on a computer with Vernon. Harry also played games on it when the Dursleys left him alone in the house.

And Harry still came back for summers, so he wasn't completely out of the loop. He's even aware of what a Playstation is.
