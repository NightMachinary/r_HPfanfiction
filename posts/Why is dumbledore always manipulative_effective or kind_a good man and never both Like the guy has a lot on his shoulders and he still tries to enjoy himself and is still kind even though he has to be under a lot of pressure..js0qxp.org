As a side note, anyone know any fics where Dumbledore is competent and grandfatherly/good man?


** My favorite good Dumbledores:

linkffn(13230340)

linkffn(13388022)

linkffn(10680240)

As for why, it's because people look at things differently. Taken in setting, Dumbledore made a /LOT/ of mistakes, some of them rather egregious. If you want to look at it as bad, one could.

However, the real answer is a lot simpler. Rowling is a bad writer, plot-wise. Her characters act in whatever way she needed them to have the result she wanted. Kind of sad, her world is cool and fun, and her characters when not warped for plot can be interesting, but...

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I think the manipulative Dumbledore has been so overdone that people are quite sensitive to it. For example, I recommended a fic that described Harry's bank account as modest but not wealthy because James had given so much money to the war front and was too proud to tell Dumbledore they were running out of money. The person who requested the rec said they hated stealing Dumbledore and dropped it immediately when that came up. (This was a pretty minor plot point, too.)

(I'm not against a manipulative Dumbledore, but I am against poorly written characters and it's rare to see a well-done manipulative Dumbledore)

** I don't know if this is frowned upon, but literally just put on a generally well received oneshot on Dumbledore's last summer today that deals with this. The intention is to show he's well meaning, but also to show what he's willing to do, and that he can be callous, while still being worthy of respect and sympathy.

** I think it's never both because that kind of nuance is much too complex for most readers and fic writers. Dumbledore is a good man who made many terrible mistakes in his life - that's a balance that many miss in favor of making him more of a black-and-white character.

** Most don't care to write characters anywhere near what they are in canon. Even those who do try I find they struggle to acknowledge character strengths and weaknesses, especially when it comes to a favorite/hated character.

Dumbledore is also pretty difficult to write. The best and most enjoyable I've come across are linkffn(What you leave behind; Victoria Potter) Taure's The One He Feared also. Kinda?
