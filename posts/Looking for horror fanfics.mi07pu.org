It's been a while since I read a good-quality horror fic, please recommend some. They can be similar to the following ones: The Apple Tree linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14229636/chapters/32807397]]), In the Heart of Time linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7980742]]), We Are Nothing linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6868583/1/We-Are-Nothing]]).

I do not want any sexually explicit themes. Everything else is okay. The length doesn't matter either.

I want /only/ completed fics.

Thanks to everyone in advance!


** I've only really read one horror fanfic, though I highly recommend it

*** Oh, thank you very much ðŸ–¤ I've just finished reading the first chapter, and, I find, that, yes, the atmosphere is to my liking.
