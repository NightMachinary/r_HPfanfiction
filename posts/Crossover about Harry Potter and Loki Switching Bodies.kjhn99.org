Hello. Some time ago, I read a very short but very good crossover of Harry Potter and the Avengers. It was about Harry and Loki exchanging their bodies by accident in a moment when both of them would have died otherwise. Harry, hanged in his room in Privet Drive by his hand. Loki, having let go when the Bifrost was destroyed. Does anybody remeber exactly where it is or who is the author, please?
