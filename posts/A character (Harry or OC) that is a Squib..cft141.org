A squib that works with filch from, say, the age of 14. Filch is nice to them and they get along because maybe Filch is a nice guy, just constantly the target of students, who have magic. Highlighting discrimination against squibs maybe?


** The Second String by Eider_Down has Harry pretending to be a squib for safety reasons (time travel) and he does work for Filch at one point, and the story deals very much with discrimination and prejudice against squibs, even going as far as to create some history of a squibs' rights movement.

Without giving any spoilers away, it's super long, time-travel, eventual slash (but I'm literally like... over 100k in and it's still gen sooo), and really well-written. Slow moving but there's enough small climaxes and sub-plots to keep it from dragging. Not yet complete but pretty regularly updated, so don't worry. Highly recommend!
