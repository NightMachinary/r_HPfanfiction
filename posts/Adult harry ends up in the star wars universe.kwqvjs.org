That's it. As long as he is powerful and resourceful and intelligent.

Or the avengers universe (but i've read all the most popular ones)

Don't care what he does or where he ends up, he just needs to be a badass (I love MoD!Harry)

preferably minimal romance though, it annoys me when stories focus on it.

(Feel free to link any other crossovers that fit the criteria as well provided you don't need prior knowledge before reading them.)

Link as much or as little as you like (i'm in lockdown and need lots reading material!)

Thanks a lot! :)

  Combining the Mirror of Erised, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Killing Curse had some unexpected effects. Clone trooper CT-4387 is left for dead after an attempted ambush on Christophsis and 11-year-old Harry Potter makes himself a family.

It's amazing but incomplete. Keep in mind Harry has already been in this galaxy for years he meets Ahsoka after her trial.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** If you don't mind fem! harry and a WBWL story in flashbacks "A witch in Thrawn's Net" is decent it has the problem where the plot is really stagnant and doesn't move further very much but what happens is pretty good. Also, it's more focused on underground resistance than epic fights.

  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.
