Does anyone have any recommendations where Teddy is a main/major character? I would love post-war stories with Harry raising him, or just being a great godfather to him. Or alternatively - fics with Teddy as an adult, having a career/adventures of his own.

Bonus kudos if it involves time/dimension travel!

Please don't include anything Cursed-child compliant


** Oh sweet I got a great one. Laughing all the way to London.

Harry is baddass, he raises teddy, it's a time travel/dimension shift, and it's got great writing.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** There's an amazing one I read not long ago. Teddy is about 13, maybe younger. Ginny is a biiiiitch from hell and is awful to him and when Harry's out one day she tries to smack him. Teddy is trying to hide and trips over some weird object in Harry's study and gets sent back in time to the canon period where he proceeds to befriend Hogwarts age Harry, along with Remus and Sirius. But his being there changes the timeline, and, well, he's worried he'll disappear because maybe now he's changed everything he'll actually never be born. So he's trying to fix this but not tell anyone who he really is, plus he's caught up in all the stuff that happens in canon.

If anyone can remember what this is called and link OP to it I'd be grateful, I can't remember the title for the life of me.

  "There was just something about this man, though they'd never met before, never seen or spoken to each other before tonight. Maybe it was the bass of the music vibrating down to his bone marrow, the buzz from the whiskey or the crushing loneliness of having no one left. He was cold, and even after twenty-seven years of living, dating, breaking up, Teddy had never seen anything that could rival the honest warmth in Jamie's eyes."Teddy has lived in France with his grandmother for his entire life, living unaware of his past or the significance of his parent's lives, cut short at the end of the war. He lives blissfully ignorant of the life he was meant to have in England, until his grandmother dies shortly after his twenty-seventh birthday, and the discovery of letters written by an estranged godfather he never knew he had leads him back to his families home, searching for answers but in the end finding more than he'd ever expected or hoped.
