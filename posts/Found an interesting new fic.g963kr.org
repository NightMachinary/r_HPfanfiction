  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.
