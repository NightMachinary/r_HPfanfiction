I was thinking today about Dumbledore's comment, and wondering if anyone had thoughts about how Hogwarts would have changed if students were not Sorted right at the beginning of their 1st year.

What exactly is "too soon?" Does sorting after 2nd year give students enough time to develop their characteristics/personalities a bit, or is that still too early? 3rd year? Would 4th year actually be too late? What would dorms look like? How would friendship dynamics change? How would a later sorting affect "house pride," Especially in cases where certain families have ties to a certain House (Malfoys and Slytherin, Weasley and Gryffindor)? How might class structure/coursework or Quidditch change?

Would love to hear your thoughts, on these questions or on others!

(Plus I'd love any fic recommendations you have that turn Sorting on its head.)


** Given that they need to be in a house the whole time, I think it'd be most sensible to sort at the beginning of every year. It'd be interesting to see people who moves house between years. Obviously, the Sorting ceremony would have to be completely reorganised because it would take a hell of a long time to sort the whole school at the start of every year.

*** I like this idea. Each year you are resorted. It's likely that many will stay in the same houses, but some could change. It could even be the Sorting Hat could intentionally put someone into another house to make them grow as a person, like putting Ron in Slytherin for a year or Draco in Hufflepuff.

*** I bet, though, that this would have different results than if they just started sorting in 4th year or something. People would get attached to their house, especially if house points still existed. The values of their house might rub off on them and change them as a person.

** Or just get rid of Sorting and divvy them up like a regular boarding school. Some systems are just no good. The last time the current Hogwarts house system was actually relevant to the times was over a millennium ago.

I think that's an intriguing idea, but could you expand on it? How was Sorting more relevant in the Founder's Era, yet irrelevant in modern times?

**** Well, in the Founder's Era, the Founders were still around, so the Sorting was a way to give them the students with the traits they preferred. Once they were all dead, the types of students they would have wanted to teach become irrelevant, since they are no longer around to teach them.

***** Exactly. There was no reason for it to continue past their deaths/retirements, to talk of lasting this long and becoming this entrenched in wizarding society.

I mean, I went to a boarding school and our house system worked just fine with the administration simply shuffling names into four equal piles.

** I'd love if you could /choose/ to be resorted. Stick with the sorting during first year. Then at 4th and 6th year students are given the opportunity to re-sort.

I think those are ideal years, because they come after some big academic and social changes. 3rd year you add electives, that mix up who you're seeing throughout the day, allowing you more of an opportunity to get to know people and make connections. When 4th year comes around, give students the option to put the Hat back on, to see if their current house is still a good fit for them long term given the growth they've had in the last three years.

5th year is when they start really thinking about the future and careers, it's at the tail end of the 'bad' part of puberty for many, and the test at the end of the year kind of determines what paths they have available. Allowing them another option to re-sort at the beginning of 6th year would mean another two years of growth, as well as a conscious awareness of their impending futures. This would allow them to move into a future-focused environment, since students tend to only really hang out with their age group from what we see in canon.

Things they valued when they were eleven, or even their potential, may no longer be what's true for when they're sixteen. So many things happen, your beliefs and goals change, your way of viewing the world changes.

They might have entered Hogwarts with the childhood dream of being Minister and changing the world, but as they grew and learned what that actually meant, grew to favor the industrious and loyal work ethic of the Hufflepuff. They may have grown up valuing any knowledge they can get, with no real emphasis on /using/ it, simply knowledge for the sake of it, and ended up developing a thirst for actually using and applying that. Why stay a Ravenclaw when Slytherin can suit your long term self better?

That's not to say everyone would change. It wouldn't be like "I want to be in Gryffindor now, please." While you might be able to influence the Hat in first year, there can be an unspoken agreement that the Hat makes the decision on its own past that point (and that it's binding if you choose to do it!) You might just be a Slytherin all 7 years, because it /fits/ that whole time. You might never choose to get re-sorted.

Early on the houses are your family, for development and safety and growth. Later on it's far more about connections and networking and relationships (romantic and non), with how small their world is. Giving them more of an opportunity to thrive is a good thing, instead of sticking them in a mold and expecting it to work for them all.

I do think this would have both good and bad consequences post-Hogwarts. There would be a transition period where an employer might have a bias for or against a certain house, but be conflicted when a student has a history of potentially three houses. Or give preferential treatment to someone who never changed houses. Both of which are unfair and show a misunderstanding of the whole sorting system anyway.

*However* I think it would allow the students to make far more connections and provide them more opportunities for long-term success, instead of only being close with the people they were sorted with at 11, they're now potentially close with those from 2-3 houses. Friends with varying strengths and weaknesses and ideals! A rounded social network instead of like-minds!

It might cause conflict within Hogwarts during the transition period where it's new, before being accepted as something normal. A student might be seen as a 'traitor' for changing, or not a true [House]. I would expect these things to change after maybe one full student generation, once it normalizes.

***** It's from one of the popular fics, I forget exactly which one. Might be The Lie I've Lived or something like that. I agree, because you're pretty much sorted by how you are raised. Like, Ron becomes a Gryffindor, because he grew up in an environment with a family of all Gryffindors, so he develops the same sort of mindset that they have, the same values. Malfoy is pretty much just like his dad, etc. This isn't 100% perfect because we see Padma and Parvati get sorted into different houses.

The sorting happens before the students really know what they want out of life, or they are too heavily influenced by arbitrary events (Harry meeting Draco and not liking how pompous he is). Not to mention, a lot of the House values themselves are mostly meaningless. Like, what is ambition exactly? Most people have some sort of ambition, whether it's to get rich, become Minister, have a large loving Family, become a Quidditch Star, become and Auror... whatever, it's things people strive for in life. Like, a prime example of the meaningless is how Goyle and Crabbe get sorted into Slytherin rather than Hufflepuff - their loyalty to Malfoy and their lack of ambition should have made them a cinch for that house. And, by all counts, Hermione should have ended up in Ravenclaw if it were just based on cleverness.

****** It's pretty desire based as well, I think. Hence Harry choosing Gryffindor. It's likely both Crabbe and Goyle were adamant they become Slytherin. It's also possible Parvati had already made friends with Lavender, and desired to be in a separate house from Padma to establish a separate life.

I think the houses should be abolished myself. The segregation is no good. Just stick kids in dormitories by lot, or name, and give a chance to apply to move each year.

***** I think that, for what it's worth, it's the author of that given story thinking that by that particular age anyone would have /some kind/ of ambition, and that that would be enough to get them sorted into slytherin.

I very much disagree, to be honest.

I mean, it's clear that most people do have traits of all four houses, to some degree at least, and what makes them sorted is either their personal preferences or it's the trait that is the most underlying that marks the house. I mean, if you had someone with a grand ambition but this ambition only existed because of their loyalty towards someone and they worked hard towards getting it, I'm sure they'd count as hufflepuffs rather than slytherins; and likewise with any other combination of houses, just having some kind of ambition doesn't really mark one as an automatic member of the slytherin house.

** I think that sorting is taken too seriously (in the books). Like Dumbledore said, it's not just who you are but also what you value. I'd like for the characters to stop making such a big deal about the house they're in. It's been proven that even if you value the house's traits, it's not guaranteed that you'll fulfill them.

Having students re-sorted every year is too much work. Sorting them later on is pointless. Why have houses if you don't stay with them throughout the entire time at school? Because if you're not sorted, then you'll just sleep in some kind of extra hallway with the others who haven't been sorted yet, and why get sorted instead of just staying in the place you've been sleeping all this time?

If people could overcome their ideas about the other houses, they might be able to all get along without thinking "Sneaky Slytherin!" or something. Also, encouraging the houses to just get along would get them out of their echo-chamber mindset. So I think that you either get rid of houses all together, or encourage them to get along.

** What about sorting them at the end of their first year? The first year, they meet everyone in their class year, develop friendships (presumably cross houses). The muggleborns are introduced to wizarding life, get a feel for the world they've been thrown into. Then at the end of the year feast they get sorted. Not only does this allow for more mingling among the students, but also means that their first introduction to Hogwarts isn't to literally be judged and sorted.
