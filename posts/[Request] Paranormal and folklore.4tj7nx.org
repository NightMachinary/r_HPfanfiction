For a series so steeped in magic I find it a bit sad that the more occult side isn't touched upon. I mean there are ghosts and a literal-ish personification of Death, where are the Demons and Revenant, hell even a Sluagh.

So are there any well written stories where Harry or someone else makes a literal deal with a demon or some such occult or odd stuff happens? Any recs would be amazing.


** linkao3(House Proud by astolat) touches on the paranormal and includes some great folklore. Really well written and has some intense scenes.

** Two that come to mind are Enembee's By the Divining Light and its sequel. Linkffn(5201703).

That said I hope there are others out there, it seems a dreadfully underutilized source for plot and background.

** Self-promoting here! I just recently (like, /really/ recently) published a story in which Remus gets a job working for an Outer God, from the Lovecraftian mythos. I've got the first four chapters written, and am working on the fifth, but have only posted the first two as of now. I'll get the other chapters out soon.

  Remus Lupin vaguely knew what to expect when a being that called itself a god appeared before him. An offer for a paying job wasn't on that list. It wasn't like he was employed at the moment, and the job had good benefits. Too bad he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Pseudo-Lovecraftian AU, with Powerful!Remus. Mild Dumbledore bashing in early chapters.

** Princess of the Blacks is on the third book and features summoning, rituals, some of the Old Gods lifted off of everything from Voodoo and Basque beliefs to old Germanic and Egyptian mythology. I just read through it to steal D&D mythology ideas.

** linkao3(For the Price of a Soul) - Harry makes a demon deal. That's the extent of the occult side of it as far as I remember, though.
