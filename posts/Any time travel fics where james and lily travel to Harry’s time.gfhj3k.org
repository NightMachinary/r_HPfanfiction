the longer the better. I've seen Harry travel to marauder time but it would be cool to see james & lily react to harry's wild life lol


** There is one I remember, it's not time travel, but more of a return from the dead type of situation. linkffn(10382653)

It was the not only Voldemort was resurrected. This should fit the ballpark.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily

** Not time travel, but dimension travel that happens several years post war. It's new and not yet complete but updating regularly. linkffn(13469177)

Edit: Not sure why I can't get the bot to work

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13469177/1/Another-Atmosphere]]

Summary: Harry's world gets turned upside down when he comes face to face with a familiar stranger. Because she couldn't be who she said she was. That was impossible. And weird, impossible things didn't happen to him. Not anymore.

**** Yeah, the pacing is pretty slow. It's very much a character driven fic rather than a plot driven one. Given how recently it was published and the frequency of updates, I'm sure it will continue, but for now it's a WIP, so it's a bit of a gamble to get invested in it.

** linkffn(The Last Casualties by muggledad)

It has a sequel that hasn't been updated in forever, so overall the story just kinda trails off.

*** My biggest complaint in that fic is how it doesn't address Lily at all. Was this version of Lily always just as petty and shallow as her sister, and just hid it better because she was so popular? Did her son's fame gradually corrupt her? Was she just going along with James due to some sort of magical pureblood marriage slavery BS?
