Looking for stories that uses Lily/fem!James pairing and preferably family fluff with little Harry.

Edit: Sorry for the grammar. I just realized it.

Edit 2 : If there are no fanfictions with this pairing, then I'm really hoping any author would see this post and were inspired to write this. Would definitely earn my respect and gratitude.


** Fuck, that's impressively rare and I for one would enjoy reading it. I don't think I've ever even seen a femJames.

I read a femSnape/James which is really really good, but never a femJames.

*** That's the thing, I CAN'T FIND ANY OF THEM! That's why I'm asking you guys that has much more experience than me on finding fanfics. Maybe some of you already found and read it, idk. However, if there really aren't fanfics like that, I'm really hoping any author would see this post and decided to write it.

** How would you get a male child from two female parents? Even a fem!Harry would be impossible to create with late 70's era genetics technology and given that a significant portion of the population thinks genes are in the blood it doesn't look like wizards are much more advanced than muggles when it comes to genomics.

*** Lily gets pregnant. Snape manages to secretly poison James with a permanent gender altering potion mere days after the fact. They eventually discover that lily is pregnant.

The two stay together. The only family Harry ever knows was having two mothers.

So basically what AutumnSouls said. Magic.
