  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura.

  Hermione is home for an Easter barbecue that her parents are hosting. She's brought her boyfriend and is thoroughly regretting that decision. She calls a dear friend to help with the damage control.
