I just read a imagine post from tumblr about the Triwizard champion for Hogwarts being a Slytherin and how that could have developed. Now I'd really like to read a fanfiction where a Slytherin or Slytherin students in general somehow help to defeat Voldemort, not just like the situation with Narcissa. I don't care who and I don't care why. I just want it to develop, not just 'you helped me, now we're best friends' bam! The difficulties when suddenly a Gryffindor starts to talk to a Slytherin or vice versa would be great and Hermione centric would be awesome, but not necessary.


** In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], the Trio had quite a few supporters in the Dragon (Slytherin) house.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), the Trio was generally on friendly terms with Slytherins, especially after that â€˜Slytherin Memorial Service'.
