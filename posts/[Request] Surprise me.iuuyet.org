I have an hour and a half and I want to read and write funny reviews. Send me a fic of yours. No OP/grey/multianimagus/Harry or godness Hermione or bashing. Canon pairings, I have nothing against gay pairings but keep it in canon pairings like Dumbledore and stuff. Single point of divergence is okay, canon stuff is okay. What if AUs are okay as long as there is a clear premise and people are in character or are justified why they aren't. I am more in the mood for humor with plot than smut right now.

Edit: Alternate pairings are ok in whatifa or single point of divergence, but no Harmony or Haphne or Drarry or Dramione... Be more creative.

Edit 2: all this talk about pairings doesn't mean I am looking for romance specifically.
