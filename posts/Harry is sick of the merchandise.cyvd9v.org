I don't believe for one second that there were no t-shirts, posters, duvet covers with Harry's face on them. I mean, if he's actually as famous as he's shown to be, (books about him, Colin Creevey...) is it such a long shot to think that there'd be fans buying little plushies and things like that?

I can see him being mildly creeped out or irritated by things like this, and people picking up on it so buying more...

Probably would be a crack fic or one shot.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor) has a scene where Harry visits Godric's Hollow, only to find that his parents' home has become an amusement park ride where people pay to ride through the house, and the murder of James and Lily is replayed with animatronics. There's also a gift shop at the end.

The fic is obviously pretty crack-ish and pretty smutty, but I find it to be hilarious personally.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** I'm reminded of the bit in Babylon 5 where Sheridan is OK with the new shop selling kitschy merchandise of the station until he is shown the Sheridan teddy bear. "Shut it down."
