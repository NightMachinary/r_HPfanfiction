After reading Full Circle by tetsurashian and To Live Is The Rarest Thing by Maeglin_Yedi, I want to read a fic with same or similar premise, only with the Golden Trio being the ones reincarnated. It's interesting to see how constant reincarnation would have affected their dynamics and what skills they would've picked up. I don't really see it working with Ron/Hermione (it would suck for Harry to be a third wheel for eternity), so I imagine it as Harry/Ron/Hermione, the trio not being in a romantic relationship with each other at all or them having their own partners and/or occasionally being with each other depending on their lives. Imagine how they would mess with Malfoy, Snape, Dumbledore, Umbridge etc when they reincarnate as their original selves! Since I have no experience with writing fanfiction and would probably do a lousy job and inevitably lose inspiration, I'm posting this prompt in hopes that someone will be inspired by it.

** I think so, too! But mine has a bit of a twist, though. Its more like "history repeats inself" kind of concept. I posted an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g2gidb/harry_is_immortal_and_teaches_history_of_magic_at/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][idea]] here some months ago about it

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

  A disastrous trip to a waterpark (thanks, Dudley!) unleashes almost 200 lifetimes worth of memories, and now Harry is stuck as a ten-year-old while his soulmate is a wraith set on killing him. A very old and cynical Harry sets about correcting Tom's poor life-choices while avoiding Dumbledore and his Order's panicked searches for the Boy Who Disappeared. Harry/Tom.
