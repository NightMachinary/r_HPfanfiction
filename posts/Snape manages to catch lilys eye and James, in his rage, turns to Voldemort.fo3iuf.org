Years later, the Marauders are Voldemorts most feared lieutenants


** Hard to imagine that would be enough to turn him towards Voldemort. Sirius hates the death eaters and Remus would be to chicken to disappoint Dumbledore after he let him attend Hogwarts.

You could make Sirius a loyal member of the Black family and follower of Voldemort, Remus accepts the wolf becomes a smarter Greyback, James finds a dark arts book in the Potter library and steals his parents wand to try out some spells, maybe he kills the house elf. They all get sorted into Slytherin except Peter who still goes to Gryfinndor.

James Potter, as a child he was always devious and planing pranks he went into house slytherin for his cunning

Remus lupin, has resentment and wants to change things he goes to slytherin for his ambition.

Petigrew, he made his friends on the train and wants to stick by them he is kinda like grabbe and goyle.

*** Wait, why would Peter of all people go to Gryffindor and not Slytherin? He was nearly a Hatstall between Gryffindor and Slytherin. It's the least unlikely of all the Marauders.

**** Cause I don't like Peter and wanted him gone. The forth marauder will be Regulus in my made up scenario.

** I'll get downvoted for this, but I can see this happening.

James Potter- Rich pure-blood only child who's spoiled by his older parents and used to doing whatever he wants without facing consequences for it- Him losing a girl to a poor, unattractive half-blood would definitely send him into a rage and cause him to seek revenge.

Sirius Black- Another rich pure-blood who's used to doing whatever he wants without being stopped and has shown he's willing to kill without remorse- He sent Severus to be killed by a rabid werewolf at age 15 (and no, it wasn't a prank, it was attempted murder, if James hadn't just "happened" to be there to pull Sev away Black would have gone to Azkaban much earlier than in canon). Plus he's James' best friend and would stick by him no matter what.

Remus Lupin- Has no other friends besides the Marauders due to being a werewolf, is desperate to keep the friends he has, and has shown himself in canon to be willing to let people walk over him to keep the peace.

Peter Pettigrew- A hanger-on who's willing to do anything to keep from being a target of bullies himself, and a coward who goes with whoever seems more powerful.

It's easy for me to see James getting drawn into the Death Eaters and then slowly bringing the others in over time.
