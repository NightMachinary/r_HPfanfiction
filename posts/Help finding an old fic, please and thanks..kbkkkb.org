:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a fic I read long ago before HBP came out but after OotP. In it Harry is being trained to fight and develops a crush on Tonks and I believe even start going out together a couple of times. Then one day he goes into the locker room and finds her and Kingsley having sex. Later she or he claim its an Auror thing to relieve stress, Arthur is supportive and helps Harry get over the heart ache he feels from it.

That is all I recall, it wasn't graphic or anything. But it was heart wrenching for Harry and I remember it being well written and all but again it was long ago. I merely want to find it because its been driving me batty and I don't recall who Harry ended with or what happened and would like to reread it to see if it was as good as I think it may have been or if it was just the first Tonks cheating (in Harry's eyes) story I came across.
