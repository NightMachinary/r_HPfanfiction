/"So it all comes down to this, doesn't it?" whispered Harry. "Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does... I am the true master of the Elder Wand."/\\
/A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort's was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:/\\
/"Avada Kedavra!"/

/"Expelliarmus!"/\\
/The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy's shell./

And then, in the moment of triumph, when all their struggles should have been rewarded with a time of peace and prosperity they have fought, bled and sacrificed for. In that moment when all the combatants realized that Voldemort had fallen, that the war was over...

A scream rent the silence, and all eyes turned to Ronald Weasley who'd fallen over after being hit by a cutting curse earlier and gone unnoticed as the duel between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort moved towards his position. (It mostly consisted of talking and circling around, but with that first - and final - spell exchange it was officially a duel, and would be recorded as such in the history books.) On his forehead, edged in crimson of fresh blood, was a lightning bolt scar.

Unnoticed by anyone, the dark spectre of Voldemort rose from his corpse - once again escaping death.

Is it just me, or does the "Accidental Horcrux via reflected AK" sound a bit forced? Anyway, imagine trying to kill Voldemort if any sufficiently dark spell broke off another silver of his soul and put it in the closest, most convenient receptacle? He'd probably take some serious SAN damage from it, but still. Immortality - achieved? XD


** I've just got this wonderful idea from this, where Riddle keeps making horcruxes but every time he does, he loses more of himself until he ends up a drooling mess, unable to remember how to do anything, unable to split himself any more because he has no concept of "self" anymore. And this is what results:

​

Harry looked at the pile of flesh before him. It could be called human, if you were drunk, high, half blind and you sortof turned your head and squinted. It was the entity that was the result of Riddle's 169th attempt at eternal life. At some point during his many, many, splits, he'd lost whatever shread remained of his sanity, then his human form, his long term and short term memories...

​

Anyway, according to the arithmancy, this would be the last one. At this point it was a mercy killing. The soul can only take so much, and at this point there wasn't much left of him. He'd stopped being a threat around 120 splits ago, having lost that edge of intelligence that allowed for long term planning. The last splits had just been sad. A creature that could only loosely be called human, constantly splitting its soul to remain alive. Splitting its soul was the last instinct that managed to remain, but now that too was gone.

​

Harry raised his wand. The prophesy was misinterpreted, after all. In truth, the dark lord Voldemort had defeated himself. Harry's "power the dark lord knows not" at this point could be basically anything.

​

And with a flash of light, and a soft whimper, the blood wars quietly ended.

*** Splits his soul so many times that pile of flesh becomes a Dalek! Crossover time!
