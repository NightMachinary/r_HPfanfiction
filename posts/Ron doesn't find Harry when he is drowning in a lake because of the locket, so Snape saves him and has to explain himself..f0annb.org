** That's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/13/][chapter 13 of "Force Interrupt"]], an amusing read and a well deserved takedown of this stupidity in DH.

*** Not bad! There's a bit of lambasting a canon character for not acting in accordance with fanon or the writer's headcanon, but not bad at all. (For example, "Warming Charms" aren't a thing; Voldemort doesn't know Dumbledore's messenger Patronus trick; and while one can take or leave WoG about unredeemed Dark wizards being able to cast the Patronus Charm, lambasting a canon character for going with the fanfic author's opinion rather than WoG strikes me as a tad arrogant.)
