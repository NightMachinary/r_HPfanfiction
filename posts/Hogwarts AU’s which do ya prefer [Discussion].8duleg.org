When reading an AU fic that at least begins at Hogwarts, which do you prefer:

• An AU fic that begins at the beginning, aka Harry's first year.

OR

• An AU fic that skips a year or two (or more), with some method of informing the reader what has already occurred/what is different in this AU.


** I prefer the time skip. I'm kind of over reading about 11-year-olds and I prefer more mature thought processes and themes in my fics

** I don't mind whether the story starts in First Year or skips years. If it's an AU, I want to read where things start to divert from cannon, whether that's First Year, before First Year or some other year or even after the whole battle. I already know what happens in cannon, if there's small details about the AU that are important but don't contribute to the main plot I wouldn't want to essentially re-read Harry Potter.

The best AU's, imo weave what we know, what's different about the authors AU seamlessly into (hopefully) a different plot or outcome to that of cannon.

** Two examples that come to mind are linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts]])

The former teases the reader with details of the past, gradually over dozens of chapters revealing each and every major plot point.

Mind Arts, however, throws you straight into the madness of the AU.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Don't think I can be boxed in easily on this, although in general time skips should be used /appropriately/. I prefer the story to stick to the years that matter, and even then to the events that matter. One surprising fact is that the first three canon books are like less than 100K words combined. Large skips can be a bit jarring, however. I probably wouldn't skip an entire year...

Brevity and focus are much appreciated by me.

** I'll read either, for sure.

But honestly, I prefer to read fic where it skips a year or two. I prefer reading about teen-Harry over preteen-Harry. Although, that probably is because of how I like to read ship/pairing-centric fics a lot compared to super plot-driven stuff.

** It really depends. What is the story you're writing? If someone wants to write a story about a story about an AU 7th year and leaving Hogwarts to explore the wider world in uncertain times then that's what the person wants to write about. Starting from first years bogs the whole story down. You have to slog through stuff you don't want to write/read to get to the good stuff. The reader can often tell and if they stop reading before it gets to the good stuff then the good stuff that you care about is wasted. Chapters after chapter of filter bloat a good story and hold it back. That being said, if the story is about growing up then show me the growth don't tell me. If the focus is on how things that happen change the character then we need to see those things.

** Always start /in medias res/. If the meat of your story happens in 4th year, don't make me slog through 3 years of "things that happened slightly different than in canon". There are plenty of ways to inform the reader about important differences and being a bit circumspect about doling those out can even make the story more compelling, adding mystery: "Huh, Lily is still alive? Why? I wonder what else is different"

** Is the story slice of life or plot driven? If slice of life like hufflepuff harry or harry's island home, show me straight thru. If plot driven divergence, show me from where the story begins, not where the plot truly differs.
