*** The Stygian Trilogy started so strong, but only got worse as it went along IMO. The first was excellent throughout, the second was excellent at times, and third - well, the ending was excellent, but the first three-quarters were slow-paced, uneventful angst.

**** I thought Starfall was by far the strongest, alone it would be #1 or #2 on this list. And for me Ignite was actually the weakest, because it felt conflicted about what exactly it was about.

Agreed that Oblivion was somewhat hit or miss with the pacing. I did think the love triangles and romance stuff, especially at the beginning, dragged on a bit too much, but I thought it had the most compelling character arcs. Didn't feel personally that it was too angsty but I can definitely see where you're coming from.

**** If you're not into precocious, slightly judgmental characters then Victoria Potter can come across obnoxious. On the Muggle - Wizard spectrum, Victoria is decidedly pro Wizard, so if you're into mugglewank then you'll probably find her obnoxious.

But I think it's one of the best Slytherin Harry stories (and I read a lot of Slytherin Harry stories). It's also got one of the best Hermione, as a rival to Victoria, because it's closer to how I imagine Hermione to be. The worldbuilding is really good too and it avoids heavy exposition dumps which is really common in stories where the writer has good worldbuilding ideas.

***** Ok then I'll give it a go thank you for the detailed explanation. I'm ok with pro wizard but hate it when Harry in the stories somehow excuses Voldemort's Actions especially since he's a halfblood hypocrite that only ever used the purebloods as a leverage for more power. Idk does that make sense?

** The Unforgiving Minute - Constant action and well written. Harry from the future gets an incredibly short amount of time to go back, kill Voldemort, and keep the world from getting too screwed up. Needs more recommending.

Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma - Some of the best politics, and a well written adult Harry dealing with new threats in what is basically a zombie novel

Albus Potter and The Global Revelation - Albus Potter Series by NoahPhantom - One of the best two nextgen books written in the style of the old ones. This series is a bit darker and heavier, with more detail, more mess and more characters, but an absurd level of world-building. I'd call it a mystery series, and it's really well thought out, even if there's a bit too much going on sometimes. Also an incredibly long read which is well paced.

Albus Potter and The Dungeons Of Merlin's Mist - Albus Potter Series by Vekin87 - The other best "sequel" to the originals. Again, in the same style, but written similarly to the originals. It doesn't really add a ton of magical lore like the other, but is simple and not too dark, quite cleanly written, has great character arcs and adds a good amount to the originals.

The Changeling - A great story on a Slytherin Ginny. Just check it out, you've seen this recommended before

Lessons With Hagrid - Hagrid teaches Harry Occlumency. Funny little one-shot

Seventh Horcrux - A parody in which Voldemort's soul takes over baby Harry, and procedes to spread mayhem. Very light-hearted fun.

New Blood - It's ongoing still, but I think more people need to hear about this. Cleanly written, THREE updates a week, incredibly long and incredibly overpowered Hermione. This is basically Hermione as the Harry in an OP-Harry story, except it actually kinda works and is original enough because the author can write, and adds or changes a lot of stuff about wizarding society. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a great read.

Exile - by Bennybear - A great character study on a post-DH Malfoy who gets stripped of his magic as a result of the war. It's a great read for anyone who likes slow-paced stories and aren't bothered about the magic side of things. It's very, very different to most others, so not for everyone.

The Sum of Their Parts - Again, often recommended, good action, good politics, and probably the most convincing Dark Harry I've seen.

** Honestly I'm pretty bad at remembering titles of fics I've read but the one that I go back to re-read over and over again is Forever Alive by Mordred. It satisfied my desire for a book about the Marauders perfectly. I don't know if JK Rowling herself could deliver something more authentic, honest and true to the characters.

I love the crossover series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/306153][A Lion and Two Snakes walk into a bar and save the bloody World]], its an amazing series that becomes one of the best when you reach Part 4 'Here There Be Dragons, I Suppose' which can be read as a stand alone and has Percy Weasley as Tony Starks PA. Earlier Works are crossed over with The Sentinel (tv) but i understood them with a quick skim through the Wikipedia page.

I /adore/ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11083359?view_full_work=true][Vera Verto]] which is an amazing fic following Minerva McGonagall in the year following the battle of Hogwarts as she struggles to rebuild the castle while facing her past and trying to move on to the future. So soft and sweet it made me so happy.

* 3
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
  :END:
I've had to have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy][Prodigy]] on ffn at /least/ 5 times. Its a WBWL fic with Genius!Harry (who goes by James) working for several government agencies and fandom like NCIS, CSI, and House MD. There's also gratuitous use of time-turners and great fun with his OMC best friend as they waltz in and out of Hogwarts as they please and try to find a cure for lycanthropy on the side.

Its an amazing fic that teeters the edge of humor and crack-treated-seriously. Harry's twin is a good person!!! I read it the first time without knowing any of the other fandoms (now i do, besides csi) so you can def get by with a bit of googling

* 4

  :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
  :END:
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669][a life of smoke and silvered glass]] is a fic that brought me to tears (not difficult but still). Its a canon divergence fic about Severus being - not a good person - but a better person and never hurling that slur at Lily.

Canon shifts the barest sliver but its a full-on character study with a beautiful plot about what would have changed if Severus had been good. And maybe it wouldn't be much after all.

* 5
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-4
  :END:
Oh God, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12707932/1/A-Flame-In-A-World-of-Snowflakes][A Flame In A World Of Snowflakes]] may be a oneshot, but I tear up every time. Its a short fic about Colin Creevey through the eyes of Minerva McGonagall and its so /so/ well written. I'll never forget it.

* 6
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-5
  :END:
My favorite time travel fic of all time has to be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20383987?view_full_work=true][More Than One Way To Skin a Cat]]. Its the most unique take on time travel i've ever seen, with Severus going back in time once he dies and waking up in Harry's body, and something being wrong with Dudley. I've read it thrice now and can never get enough. The characterization is amazing and the relationship between Severus and Dudley is the best thing ever.

* 7
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-6
  :END:
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2151594][The Happy Smiles Recipe]] is a sweet oneshot about Harry staying with the Weasley family after the events of Sirius' death. It has some of the best Ron characterization i've ever read. I'm so tired of people villainizing Ron and the Weasleys and this one writes them so well.

* 8
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-7
  :END:
I adore [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]], a oneshot about Dennis Creevey using Collins camera to documents the scars and loss war leaves behind. Its so well done and has made me cry each read. Its the most beautiful post-war fic i've ever read hands down.

* 9
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-8

So I haven't finished reading this one and am currently only on chapter 25, but for now [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22230682?view_full_work=true][The Darkening of Your Soul]] is an amazing Tomarry fic where Harry gets to repeat his life. Only problem? Tom has to do the same. Amazingly written and slightly humorous, a Harry who doesn't care as much and an infatuated Tom, makes a great story.

* 10
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section-9
  :END:
This is only last on the list bc i couldn't find it. Ugh. But [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15911484?view_full_work=true][Raised by Giants]] is a 5 chapter fic that tugs at ones heartstrings. The premise being what would have happened if Hagrid raised Harry. Hagrid is already a gentle character but this just makes it so so much sweeter.

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.

#+begin_quote
  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
