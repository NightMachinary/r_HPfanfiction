Just read linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday...) and realized I've barely read any McGonagall centered fics

I don't mind whether its a one shot or a multi chapter, just anything well written with her as the main character

thanks in advance :)

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
