It's a common thing in fanon for Dumbledore telling people they have to do something or he did something for “The Greater Good”, usually in bashing fics. I wanted to take a bit of spin of it that I think makes more sense in line from what we know about how Dumbledore feels about his past. Basically someone else (can be anyone really) says that something must be done or changed for “The Greater Good” and he flies off the handle and gets super angry in a rare way. A verbal dressing down about “knowing the cost of The Greater Good” referring to his regret over what happened to his sister is what I have in mind. His characterization would probably change a little bit for this but I don't think it would be too crazy.


** It's quite ironic that that trope gets used so often when in his conversation with Harry he actually says something along the lines of "What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy?"

But back to your topic, it would be funny if he always gets an erection when he hears the words because he always remembers how Grindelwald used to whisper them in his ear.

** I immediately started mentally replaying the scene from the Goblet of Fire movie. It makes so much sense now. Just before he walked into the champions room, faux-Moody must have whispered in Dumbledore's ear. "We must let him compete. For the Greater Good."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** It isn't quite flying off the rails, but this line from part 2 of The Prince of Slytherin reminds me of that:

  To be perfectly honest, I have long thought that "for the Greater Good" were the four most dangerous words in the English language, as there is almost no crime they cannot excuse when used by one who believes his cause is just.

linkffn(11191235) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][here]] on AO3 (it's a series so I don't want to use the bot for it)

​

Oh also if you decide to read the fic I'd like to note that I don't like the bit in the prologue that flashes forward to 4th year so I'd recommend trying to read at least the chapter after it before making a decision on if you want to continue it.

** Lol, I was just thinking to write a "days of a future past" kind of fic with Snape back to his 4th year in Hogwarts who casually says "all for the greater good" to Dumbledore (or not casually, I'm deciding about it, I REALLY want a scene where Snape goes crazy under horcrux influence or something else and challenges Dumbledore in the hall saying all kind of crazy - for every one else - things about the past-future and then trying to blow questions off when he wake up in infirmary, but I'm afraid it would be too much ridiculous and difficult to unravel).

** I'd hope he would, it's a stupid fallacy people use for doing evil shit while trying to justify it. Own your evil shit!

I don't think any of the death eaters or Voldemort would say something like this. They don't even consider what they are doing is wrong never mind trying to justify it. You might have Percy say it in his 7th year and Dumbledores furious response sets him on a different path to joining the Ministry.

** Harry saying something like "it's for the Greater Good" horrifying Dumbledore and causing him to try to intervene more in Harry's life (for the better) would be a great subversion of the typical tropes.

In Dumbledore's mind, if Harry and his closest friends were (the Ministry Six, for example) began buying into a philosophy much like the "Greater Good" that he and Gellart subscribed to decades ago, he'd understand that Harry could very well turn into /another/ Gellart figure after he dies.

Dumbledore going "hands on" more in response to the current situation than in canon, all to prevent a greater tragedy in the future after Voldemort's permanent downfall? It could be a great fic.
