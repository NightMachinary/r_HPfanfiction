I'm looking a story that I read years ago where Harry adds adds other students to the goblet of fire under different schools and he charms the cup to change his name to Draco Malfoy if it was added to the cup - Draco was announced as a champion.


** I know this one! It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/9/Weres-Harry][chapter 9 of Weres Harry]].\\
Harry put a ward around the Age Line around the Goblet of Fire to change any piece of parchment with his name on it to a piece of parchment with Draco Malfoy's name, then he was bribed by Roger Davies, and then Durmstrang, and then he helped Beauxbatons for free.
