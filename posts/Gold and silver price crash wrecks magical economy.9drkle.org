Seems like an interesting thing that could happen. How does the wizarding world deal with a crash in the price of gold and silver? That is assuming that wizarding currency is pretty close to pure.


** Given that the galleon to GBP exchange rate in canon is far below the Muggle gold to GBP rate, and yet arbitrage does not occur, I think we can assume either:

1. the galleon to GBP exchange trade is extremely regulated and has limited liquidity, or

2. the value of a galleon is set by wizarding government rather than being based on the value of the gold it is made of (i.e. it is a pinned fiat currency). Further, the gold cannot be melted down due to Goblin enchantments on the coins.

Either one of these, or both, would prevent a change in the value of gold/silver in the Muggle world from affecting the wizarding economy.

I'm not sure we can say that with 100% certainty since we don't know about much gold a galleon contains.

The galleon could contain a ton of gold magically shrunken, a gram magically expanded or some more reasonable amount in an alloy with base metals. Its only if we assume galleons are 24 carats gold chunks that this problem occurs.

**** Wizards use the word "gold" as interchangeable with "galleon". They are always described as gold. While it is possible that they are an alloy, the literal reading of canon would seem to heavily lean against this. And once you get into the business of unreliable narrator and interpreting canon against its literal meaning, you kinda lose the concept or canon as a standard of correctness. Which makes debate pointless.

** I dont know if the Muggle worlds economy would have much effect on the Wizarding World (at least Britain), the statute of secrecy was created to separate and hide Wizards, so i think their economy wouldn't be affected.

I remember reading i think it was a Oneshot, where Harry and Hermione realized they could just sell the Gold in his Vault for more money. But Ron didn't believe it had much value because of The Philosophers Stone. He thought Gold was common since Flamel could make as much as he wanted,

** I don't think wizard gold/silver is in circulation with the muggle world for it to be affected. Its reasonable to assume almost all of it is actually mined by the goblins themselves, and it never reaches muggles in any form.

Why? Any Muggleborn could just exchange Pounds into Galleons, melt them down and sell the gold to Muggles. I doubt goblins would put their fancy magic on coins of which they mint millions.

**** I have a suspicion goblins have had to do /something/ to prevent wizards from taking their gold out of circulation. Possibly a way to inhibit destruction. I mean, otherwise thats what would /have already happened in canon/ and all muggleborns would be beyond rich. Of course, if they did that the Minsitry would probably step in under threat of the Goblins withholding the funds.

Basically, the system seems to be built on a tenuous balance between the wizards/goblins. Wizards provide certain magical capabilities and agree to follow the goblins system (as well as enforce it on their society) while the goblins agree to act in good faith with the gold (which would explain why they still kept vaults active for families like the Lestranges or Blacks who were all either dead or permanently incarcerated in theory).

** Well a drop in gold and silver is all very interesting. But as long as you are not minting more coins there doesn't need to be much of an effect
