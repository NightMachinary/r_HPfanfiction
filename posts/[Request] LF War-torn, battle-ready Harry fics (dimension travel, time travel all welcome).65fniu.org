What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

** I don't know for sure if it's okay to self-promote here, but I've been writing my own time-travel story, which I published back in November - currently sitting at 87k words, with plenty of time to go yet. It's almost certainly /not/ as good as any of the others that've been linked here, but maybe you'll find something you like in the amateurish mess that is my writing.

  Time travel, AU. When all that Harry Potter ever loved is taken from him, when he cannot fight alone against the tide of Voldemort's evil, he has to take his one last chance. A lonely, damaged Harry returns to his past, in order to save his future. Rated M for violence, death and trauma. Will eventually include Harry/Ginny.
