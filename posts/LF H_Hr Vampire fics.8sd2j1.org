atleast one of them should be turned into it.

"The Game Is Over" by AnnaRavenheart and "Hermione's Change" by funvince are the only fics that i know that fits for what im looking for. While the latter is a good sad, but also cute romantic fic, the First one is a...rather Dark one, its typically vampire-esque.

Maybe there are other fics with H/Hr as the start constellation and then one of them gets biten or turned or more like the first one....like Harry turns into a Vampire and Hermione gets (over time) attracted to his Dark Side or vice versa.

Vampires are known to be Masters of Seduction, so maybe Harry is desperate at first but then, just for fun, tests his abilities on Hermione (or other "Victims"), but without the intention of harming her.

The Following is just an addition and no requirement: if there is a sex scene in it, it might could happen a "Love bite" at the moment of climax. So s/he bites the partner and drinks the blood, because blood tastes the best during a Climax. Maybe this Pain will lead into some sort of SM thing for the Partner.

It would be good, if the Vampire theme would rather be: the creature decides who s/he curses with the bite and who are simply are drink.
