If you don't mind, please also specify the chapter so we don't have to slog through the whole thing.

Edit: 10 hours and 3 visits to this post later, I have noticed a typo and fixed it. Carry on, citizens, I'm off to see an ophthalmologist.


** There's this one fic that was obviously the authors own wish fulfillment fantasy that stuck with me for just how bad it was

- Super powerful, staff wielding grand magus galore (pretty sure he's 16 years old, such an amazing feat)

- AOE killing curse, because the MC is just the greatest

- Phoenix familiars, 2 of them to boot (both are the rarest breed as well)

- Has his own harem, of course (goes into detail just how hot and sexy they are, most of the lines they get are about just how much they wanna fuck him)

- WBWL, but secretly the chosen one. What gave that away?

- Dumbledore bashing, Weasley bashing, potter bashing, everyone bashing to be honest. No one's on his level, in fact not even the author as he somehow manages to bash himself by writing it

... huh. I'm amazed that I've never seen this in a fic, or even heard the idea mentioned before now.

*** Yeah, Voldemort says something similar. The quote itself is highly common throughout movies and literature. Most people dislike it due to the fact Harry in ACV comes of an edgy child.

**** Yep, by Voldemort as a passing remark

  “Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”

  Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.

  “Crucio!”

  The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. ... Let the police come, he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ...

  Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.

  “Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** For me, I'd say when Harry finds out that Lily was actually pregnant when she died, because of his eidetic memory. The problem is it could've been from one or both of these two fics, I just can't remember which one, which goes in hand with this thread. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories; Angry Harry and the Seven)

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper?
