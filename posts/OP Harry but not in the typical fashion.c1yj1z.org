I am interested in unusual OP Harry stories. I am not talking your classic OP Harry where he can control spells easily and they are all super strong, or that his shields are the most powerful ever, or that his general magic knowledge surpasses all others and he can easily counter anything cast at him and fire back stronger spells. No, I am talking an OP Harry who remakes the world.

Example: A Harry who is perfectly average but can manipulate time at will.

Example: A Harry who can subtly influence anyone through their minds or hearts, seducing and controlling others.

Example: A Harry whose wealth and charisma changes the political landscape with little effort

Example: A Harry who can sense how magic works and literally unmake it or warp it how he sees fit, causing a killing curse to grow a tree for example.

The main thing is he is not OP in the traditional magical sense. Obviously, this may mean the stories are fairly short and silly in most cases, as if Harry is OP in unusual ways, like being able to wish someone dead, boom Voldemort/Death Eaters are gone and war is over. But hopefully, there are still some gems to be found and surprisingly long reads to be had.

Preferred but certainly not required: Mature oriented fics, romance included, no /main character/ slash, and a healthy dose of depth.

Thanks all!

This could be linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat). Harry can /see/ magic and souls, though he is physically blind otherwise, and this ability enables him to manipulate raw magic and perform transfiguration to unprecedented scales, being able to turn wards to water and transfigure both body and soul.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
