Any story over 100k where Harry learns as much as possible. Could be for any subject as long as it delves in and really opens the subject up.


** There was one, I think called "Geek of Magic" that I really loved. Basically, Harry is like an idiot savant, incredible at magic but so consumed with learning it he is abnormal.

It features a really likeable Ron (who has to do things like get Harry to class, have him eat, etc) and a Luna that encourages his mania. So fun, though I don't believe it was finished.

***** Yeah. It's a cool one. The author perfectly captured autism and that's something incredibly rare. I think he also mentioned he had an autistic friend from whom he took some inspiration and developed Harry's character. Frankly, the author is good.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629?view_full_work=true][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]]

I have been recommending this one left and right. I just love the dynamic between Harry and Snape, how Snape is still an asshole and didn't turn into some super protective righteous vanguard for Harry like the mentor Snape trope often turns into. Voldemort is great as well as a snarky geek who is still, ultimately, a bad guy.

Harry experiments a lot with potions, creating candies such as calming chocolates, blood replenishing cherry bombs, concentration mints. Accidentally creates semi sentient cleaning... Blob. Writes a paper on it. Author throws in dashes of potion ingredients and ancient runes for these recipes.

Very satisfying character development and ending, everyone is still basically the same only Harry just loves Potions to death so hes a lot more willing to grow a thick skin around Snape.

*** Snippet:

“Very well, Mister Potter,” Professor Snape said in his classroom Tuesday after dinner. “You will be recreating your scrubbing bubbles potion tonight. Proceed.” And Professor Snape sat down and watched Harry work with fixed and focused attention, and it was right up there with some of Harry's worst nightmares. Especially since he could feel Voldemort's attention as a cool, scaly sensation in his head. Harry was in the midst of grinding his myrtle leaves when Professor Snape said, “What are you doing?” “Grinding myrtle leaves, Professor.” “Those are fresh.” “The recipe doesn't specify.” “No one with any sense would grind fresh myrtle leaves, Potter. Fresh leaves are not crushed before adding them to a potion.” “This is what I did, Professor.” Professor Snape's nostils flared, but he gestured Harry to proceed. Harry continued his brewing, trying to tune out everything but his potion, including the increased pain in his scar. Finally, his potion gleaming a pale yellow, he tapped the side of the cauldron three times with his wand, focusing his magic on movement, activity, cleaning, cheer. “What was that?” Professor Snape asked sharply. “I tapped the side of the cauldron three times. The instructions do say-“ “That was not tapping. That was broad swishes of your wand, as if you were charming.” Professor Snape scowled at him. Harry looked blankly back, and checked his potion. It had turned the appropriate milky-pearly white the directions indicated was finished. “Bottle it, and we will see if the effect has been replicated.” Harry did as he was told, ignoring his audience, and shortly was pouring a stream of white soapsuds back out of its glass flask. It blinked open green eyes and blew bubbles at him with a birdlike chirp. “You are making me very angry, Potter,” Professor Snape said, staring at it blankly.

*** So, so many great lines in this one. I'm not a huge fan of where the follow-up work has gone, but as a standalone it's one of the gold standard of Snape-positive works. Malfoy in particular is very well written as someone who isn't precisely good, but isn't a Death Eater or sympathizer.

** Blindness is a good fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

​

Another good fanfic I like is Barefoot. It's incomplete though. So read it at the risk of your own frustration. Harry is not geeky. But super smart. It's also unbelievable and funny. Just a decent read.

first in a series of around 600k words, total. pretty AU, good story overall. goes pretty in depth into Blood Magic, also has necromancy, soul magic, thread magic, and stone magic, among others, mentioned.

Fair warning, it has little to do with most of the Harry Potter characters, other than Harry and occasionally Alastor Moody, and is set mostly outside of magical britain.

while there are hints of slash among some of the secondary characters, nothing is explicit.

also has a rather large emphasis on different magical races, vampires being the most prominent, other than demons (who invade the world in the latter part of the series).

story is also abandoned at this point.

*** Would you feel the same if you grew up in a house that hated even the word magic? Where you never really read into it too much? He cant read a harry potter book. Hes thrown into a world hes been conditioned to hate. Hes probably confused as all fuck. Especially because hes 11. 11 year olds dont have the capacity to think "Holy shit this is awesome let me learn this" because its a school about it. They have to do magic homework. I personally in his situation wouldnt be very fascinated. Ofcourse I would do the exact same thing as you but this is all circumstantial.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

In The Life He Leads by GeneralStarfox, Harry is really interested in Northern magic, iirc. It's a fanon creation, but he does geek on it a lot and compare it quite thoroughly to "normal" magic. The fic is quite long but I think the author thought of abandoning it a while ago. So maybe we'll never have the rest.

When the TriWizard Tournament is opened at Hogwarts, he must make the choice of if he would continue as he was, or honor his roots. Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families? Or will he buckle under the strain? YEAR 4 FINISHED. Now in Year 5
