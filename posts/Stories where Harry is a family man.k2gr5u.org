He helps his own kids, helps out the others kids. Or maybe, a Harry who tutors or helps out kids in general as an adult.

Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/can be any length/can be old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated. But if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes (But doesn't have to focus on any pairings)

Would rather NOT have any Weasley Bashing if at all possible.


** This is one of my favorites with Harry as a family man. It's called “What We Lost” and it's a fic where Harry moves in with a depressed, traumatized Andromeda to be a full-time father to Teddy. Despite a lot of people in the story telling him that he's young and should explore his potential, and not tie himself down like he has, he realizes there's honestly nothing he'd rather have than a home, a family, people to love, and a place to belong. It's eventually a Andromeda/Harry fic, which is an unusual pairing, but completely believable and well-done within the story parameters.

The formatting for the fic is a bit wonky (used to be in chapters but the author condensed it into one long story) but if you can get beyond that minor issue, I'd really recommend it. (Sorry I don't know how to use the FFN bot, but here's a link:)

** “We Were the Potters by celestineangel” linkao3(287028) Ginny is the main antagonist, but I wouldn't call it a bashing, just a sad story.

  How does one deal with a child who is different? Some do, some can't bring themselves to.
