We all know that DH's plot is about as watertight as a sieve, but this point has always ruffled my feathers quite a bit.

I'll leave it open whether the Deluminator always had the incredible and very mysterious ability to guide you back to your friends after abandoning them, while also circumventing magical protections, or whether Dumbledore enchanted it specifically anchored towards Harry and/or Hermione, because Dumbledore has perfect insight into the character of Ron. In any case the whole scenario always seemed way too "Deus Ex Machina" to me.

What if none of this happens? What if Ron has no Deluminator (or just a plain old Deluminator that turns off lights, because Dumbledore thought it would be useful for sneaking around) and no way back? What does he do? How do the Weasleys and the rest of the order react? How do Harry and Hermione proceed?

Please rec any fics like this.

"Do you feel like something should be happening right now?" Harry asked Hermione, who was perched next to him on the sofa, using his arm as a bookrest while humming a tune only known to her. "I mean, we are here in the middle of nowhere, nothing is happening, we are making no headway with the Horcruxes and it's cold. But why do I feel like something important is about to happen?"

"... Britannia, Britannia rules the waves, Britons never ever will... Oh, did you say something?" Hermione said, trying to sound casual while her cheeks turned red.

"You were singing?"

"I was not."

"Why were you singing Hermione?"

"I was not..." the brunette began to reply before she shook her head. "Half an hour ago I read a passage about the Dark Wizard Tymothy Wallace, who tried to enslave all Muggles and ever since I have that bloody song stuck in my head..."

"So you haven't heard a word that I said?"

"I... No. Was there something important?"

"It's just, I have this weird feeling, like something is supposed to happen..."

"Is it /him/?"

"It's not about Riddle, or even bad," Harry said quickly, trying to sound as normal and reassuring as possible, otherwise his friend would insist on another fifteen apparations across the Isles and with the outside temperature firmly below freezing, that was not a pleasant prospect. "I just have this odd sense that something should be happening right now, but I can't say what..."

Meanwhile, three hundred miles further south, Bill and Fleur shared a worried look. Ron's appearance a month ago had been quite the shock and yet the eldest Weasley had not pressed his brother, afraid to hear whatever bad news Ron had brought. Now he stood outside, a muggle lighter in one hand and his backpack in the other while the winter storm crashed against the cliff below. Whatever had happened to the three friends must have been horrible, because his little brother has clearly lost it.

** I don't see how this is that big of a stretch, honestly.

There's a big distinction between Dumbledore having the insight to know when/how/if Ron would leave the group and simply guessing that it /may/, at some point, happen.

Don't take this as bashing against Ron, please, because, honestly, he's a fantastic friend. I can't imagine having the fortitude to stick with my friend through 7 years of what could be the most perfect empirical evidence of Murphy's Law in human history and only ever "falter" once or twice.

But, regardless of this, Ron /has/ faltered. It doesn't take much foresight to guess that, in the absolute worst of the worst, Ron may falter again. So Dumbledore gave him the Deluminator because it /may/ happen.

And, to clarify, where Dumbledore's insight really /did/ shine through was not that Ron may falter, but they he would, should he falter, wish to /come back/. The deluminator shouldn't be seen as Dumbledore taking notice of the faults in Ron's character but, rather, taking notice of his incredible tenacity.

*** It would actually much easier to guess that it is very possible that the group might get split apart through any reason, an attack, a plan going haywire etc. and that it would be really useful if someone has the means to find the rest of the group. I wouldn´t even think that Dumbledore anticipated Ron specifically to leave, because they´re dealing with horcruxes and really anyone in the group could´ve been driven to do something stupid.

**** It's pretty obvious Dumbledore saw Ron as the one who would leave, that's why he specifically left it for him with a message clearly relating it to finding friends.

**** You make some good points but this only addresses Dumbledore's foresight and not the convenience of the device itself (what a wondrous perfectly suited functionality it has)

*** I think that's a bit of six of one, half a dozen of the other. Not that Ron is bad per se, but that Dumbledore had a good nose that he'd leave and thus a way to return was necessary. A character fault most probably based on what he saw in their fourth year, but one he hoped Ron would get passed.

*** Dumbledore is getting far too much credit. While he is very perceptive, to make that judgement that Ron would leave is a huge leap. Before the Horcrux hunt, there is a SINGLE event where Harry and Ron aren't practically attached at the hip. And it's only for a few weeks at absolute most.

I don't even think Dumbledore and Ron had one single meaningful conversation. It'd be almost impossible for Dumbledore to have that kind of foresight.

I think he just wanted someone who could bring the group together if they were separated.

**** If you think Dumbledore didn't know about that separation in 4th year, you're high. There's no way he didn't notice it.

I don't think Dumbledore /did/ know that Ron would leave, you completely misread my point. My point was that he /didn't/, he just knew that it was /possible/ he would and would want Ron to have a way to get back.

Harry and Ron are, of course, just characters, but even they recognized that that's what Dumbledore did. Ron questions Harry something along the lines of, "Did Dumbledore know I would leave?" and Harry responds, "No, he knew you'd want to come back."

I'm positing exactly what they're thinking - Dumbledore didn't know Ron would leave. But, if he did, Dumbledore knew he want /want to come back/. Thus, the deluminator.

You're simultaneously saying that Dumbledore didn't know Ron well enough to foresee this possibility AND that he thought /Ron/ would be the best person to bring the group together if they split up instead of Harry, the leader of the group, or Hermione, the person most likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the deluminator in the first place.

Additionally, most people can determine quite a lot about people without ever talking to them simply by observing their behavior and how they talk/act/judge other people. I have no idea why you would think /Dumbledore/ can't also do this.

***** I never stated that Dumbledore never knew about their fallout in 4th year, But at the time, that incident was isolated. There was never an occurrence before or since (until the Hunt).

Again, I think even the possibility of Ron leaving is too great of a leap. In times of conflict, Ron was ALWAYS there. They fought and didn't speak before the first task occurred. They made up immediately afterwards and there wasn't an incident similar before Dumbledore's death. Through the chambers, perceived serial murders, giant spiders, and Voldemort on the back of another man's head, Ron was there. When things hit the fan, he was there. Giving the Deluminator to Ron always came off as a “Dues Ex Machina” like the OP said.

I never said the Ron was the best person for the deluminator either. He wanted Ron to have /something./ Harry was supposed to get the sword and Hermione got the Beedle the Bard book to uncover the Deathly Hallows. That leaves the Deluminator to Ron. ( Though, in my personal opinion, Ron is the glue of the group and it makes sense that he brings the group together . I just don't think Dumbledore saw it that way.)

** I think if you wanted to change things up while keeping the deluminator the same, make it so that Ron can use it to rescue his friends or family who are taken or lost, instead of just finding them because he's left.

** Bit late to the party, but while in this one Ron still got the Deluminator, he never got the chance to use it.
