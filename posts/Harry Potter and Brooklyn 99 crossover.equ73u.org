I was watching Brooklyn 99 and thought how awesome I'd be If it crossed over with Harry Potter.

I went online to look for a fanfic to read and I found only 26 fanfics that are HP/B99.

Why dont people write more HP/B99? imagine the possibilities. Auror Harry Potter tracks a suspect and the 99 help him. Harry Potter in a victim in a case (or a witness) and gets looped into it all some how. Hell, even Harry/Jake would be good enough at this point (would be very funny. Their both disasters). Maybe Harry and the gang track some death eaters and help in a case because they did a muggle no no.

I just need a HP/B99 crossover.


** I'd want like a police comedy about the Aurors with b99 references more than a legit crossover but +++

**** I didn't mean replacing one another. I more meant imagine the bonding over study techniques and filing.

***** I didnt mean replacing at all. I feel that Harry would find Jake too much like Ron. Boyle would be caught not knowing which one to follow. Ron would be asking about this "Pizza thing" he heard from Hitchcock/Scully.

****** Ah, apologies for the misunderstanding. It would be interesting to see someone's interpretation of a crossover like this and see how they approached these things.

**** You formatted it as [text](link) but the link itself has a close parentheses character, which the markup interpreted as the end of the link and in turn broke the link (and formatting) entirely.

Insert a backslash character =\= to escape formatting. Like so -- note the \ before I close the parentheses on "TV".
