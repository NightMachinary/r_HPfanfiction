Are there any fanfics where a character from the Harry Potter universe engages in an adventure of heavy drug use, such as in the book Fear and loathing in Las Vegas?


** "We can't stop here, this is thestral country!"

For maximum points, Harry has brought his goblin attorney along for the ride. And they're just outside Ilvermorny when the potions begin to take hold.

**** "We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the Light Magic that fueled the 20th Century. That was the fatal flaw in Albus Dumbledore's trip. He crashed around Wizarding Britain selling "redemption" and "the greater good" without ever giving a thought to the grim cruciatus-curse realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously...

** So did you get this idea after watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ7m8G1mlo8][those Cracked videos]], or have you not seen them? Would actually be a cool premise for a fic if taken at least slightly more seriously.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6739776/1/Death-Eaters-at-the-Malfoy-Estate-The-Collection][Death Eaters at the Malfoy Estate]] is a crack fic with some heavy drug use. The basic premise is that during his younger days Snape was the potions master (i.e. "cook") for the Death Eaters. It has plenty of absurd and humorous moments like /Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas/ does.
