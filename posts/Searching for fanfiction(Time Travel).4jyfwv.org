Harry uses spell from Moody's book on the troll and tells McGonagall when she asks him. McGonagall tells Moody about it. Later Moody send him books on defense. That's all I can remember.

*** Ron kills hermione, ginny says she had it coming, random god offering Harry a way to get back. This is definitely not a good start :D

**** Fortunately, there's less bashing than I expected. HHr spend most of their time simply avoiding Ron and Dumbledore rather than confronting them with rants or whatever, and get to work on the problems of the first two years (which is as far as the story got before it was abandoned).

There is however a soul-bond. And Amelia and Gringotts are very helpful. And Harry is Lord Potter. And animagi forms. And a betrothal contract. And worries of "line theft". And HHr are planning on wearing swords to Hogwarts next year (?!).

You know what? Nevermind. Just go with your first impression.
