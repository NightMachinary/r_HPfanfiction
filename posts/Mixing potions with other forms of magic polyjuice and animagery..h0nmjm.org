Would an animagus on polyjuice be able to switch into their form, or does polyjuice lock you into a specific appearance?

If you cannot change, is there a residual effect beyond the hour the polyjuice lasts? Does it get cumulatively worse if you take more than one dose in a row like Barty Jr?

If you can change:

- Does it negate the polyjuice when you switch back, or are you still that other person (assuming it's within an hour)?
- Is the animal changed to reflect the body you changed from (fatter, skinner, color)?
- Can you then falsely register somebody as an animagus? (As I recall, registration involves changing in front of a Ministry worker so they can note any identifying marks.)
- Would you change back into yourself, or would the transfiguration negate the potion?

What about polyjuicing, then applying a Disillusionment Charm or other appearance-altering spell? Would it take? I don't recall anything in canon that says it wouldn't.

Canon never warns the students about mixing potions with transfiguration or other spells. I would think some combinations would not be a good idea. Remember what happened to Draco on the train when he was hit with a bunch of spells simultaneously: George noted that Furnunculus and Jelly-Legs should not be mixed.

Then again, this is a school for teens and pre-teens. If you tell them what not to do, they may very well do exactly that next time they are in a fight. (Maybe that's why Snape doesn't give safety lectures?)


** Here's my head canon. An animagus transformation is a type of magic. Since Polyjuiced individuals can still perform magic, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to still be able to shift.

The animal form of a polyjuiced individual should be the same as as their nonpolyjuiced form.

When they shift back from animal to human, they'll still stay in their Polyjuiced form until the potion wears off.

So yes, a person could falsely register another person as an animagus. I wouldn't be surprised if the ministry requires a wand to verify as well.

*** I was thinking maybe they polyjuiced into a Muggle (who clearly doesn't have a "magical signature," if you believe in such, to interfere) and use their own wand. The polyjuice is only to allow them to use an alias.

Clearly, in wartime having an animagus form is a level of security you don't want to compromise, but the punishment for being unregistered is, as I recall, two years in Azkaban. So, one registration, albeit with a fake name, and all bases are covered. After the war simply go in to "correct the record."

This is assuming that your animagus form is one that will allow you to hide in plain sight and/or escape from pursuers. Suddenly finding an elephant in Hyde Park would not be helpful for avoiding Death Eaters (or Aurors).

**** It's been a while since I read canon. But I wouldn't be surprise if there was some registry of Wizards name and wand. If you just show up with a new identity the Ministry would probably be suspicious if they've never heard of you. The only way would be to say that you're a foreigner.

Even when Polyjuiced magical objects like the Maurauder's map still has ways of knowing your true identity. I wouldn't be surprised if the Ministry has some way of detecting your true identity.

Of course, this is assuming the Ministry is competent and checks everything.

Though this all seems complicated to hide being an animagus. The only way you'll be caught is if someone saw you transforming and then reported it to the Ministry. As long as you're careful, it seems unlikely you'll be noticed.
