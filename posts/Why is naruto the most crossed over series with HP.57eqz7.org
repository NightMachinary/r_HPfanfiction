I've noticed this on FF.Net that for some reason naruto crosses over with Harry Potter a lot and I mean a lot. I don't have a problem with it but I'm curious as to why this happens...anyone have any ideas? (Posted from mobile sorry for mistakes)


** Because Naruto and Harry Potter are the two largest fandoms on fanfiction.net by far (Naruto is almost twice as large the the third and Harry Potter is almost twice as large as Naruto), so there's a much larger chance that an author will overlap between the two.

**** We can't forget about the half-shark person. And the black-haired boy with a duty to rid the world of the villain who killed his family. And the weird dude who lost an eye and has a wooden limb. And the red-heads with an inclination for over--the--top-ness.

Also, the villains you mentioned are both in some ways tragic if one analyses them deeply enough. Though, to be fair, in Naruto everyone and their grandmother and her dog are tragic, so that's that.

***** Sure, if you describe things vaguely enough you can lump together half of fiction

****** Pretty much. But that was the point, considering you normally would not think those two works (Harry Potter and Naruto) have anything in common.

** red headed mothers, who sacrifice themselves leaving a child with a demon in them.. there are a lot of other similarities. probably quite easy to come up with something plot-like.
