** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]], very cute and well-written story. The sequel does take part in Hogwarts.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/][Brutal Harry]] and its sequel, Hero Harry, are pretty good. However, pre-Hogwarts is only a small part of the story, and, frankly, not the best one. There's some shocking abuse scenes in the beginning, but if you get through them, it does get better.

I also remember reading this humorous one-shot where Harry discovers he has special powers and uses comic books to discover who he is. But I don't remember the name nor the author :(

Edit: Okay, I'm pretty sure it's this one: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5747709/1/A-Gritty-Reboot][A Gritty Reboot]].

**** I don't really understand how you couldn't find it. I did a quick google search on "tivor harry potter fanfiction" and came up with [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-15704/CrazyDan+Tivor.htm]]

Now I have to say, I read some of the chapters and it is a humor/parody sort of thing. It isn't something to take serious in any way.
