As I said in the title -

Harry is forced into protecting his twin, and his free will is bound. Snape finds out and (I think) goes against Dumbledore and Harry's parents (James/Lily) to help free Harry. Once free, Harry feels that it's impossible to force his will upon other creatures, and begins attempting to free other magical beings (spoiler for the fic: I remember him breaking the bond of house elves - they are truly a purely magical being that humans trapped for their own usage).

I remember Severus + Draco being eventual friends (maybe Harry/Draco slash), Harry being a twin.

Thanks all, I've been searching for this for a while to no avail!

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
