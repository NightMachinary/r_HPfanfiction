** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]] by Pseudonym Sam. Don't worry, only the title is in German. The protagonist is a muggleborn living in Nazi Germany. Very well written but unfortunately abandoned.

  Dieter Heydrich is a model German boy with perfect Aryan complexion, exemplary conduct in the Hitler Youth, and fanatical loyalty to his beloved Führer. But on his eleventh birthday, he discovers a hidden magical world led by Gellert Grindelwald...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] by Sir Poley. Work in progress. Very good prose and great humour. Crossover with Dungeons and Dragons but no knowledge of the series is needed. The main character is an OC from the Dungeons and Dragons universe but the majority of the fic is set in magical Britain.

  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates Fridays.

** I haven't read the Alexandra Quick series, but my favourite OC-centric fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7936530/1/As-Black-As-Night][As Black As Night]]

#+begin_quote
  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts.

The first one's complete, and it's one of my favourites, so I hope you enjoy :)

** This may not be exactly what you're looking for, it's a next-gen fic, but I absolutely love how magic is explored in this series.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter and the Global revolution]]

#+begin_quote
  Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
