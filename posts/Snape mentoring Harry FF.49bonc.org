Hello my fellow fans, I'm looking for a new fanfiction to read. I would like it to be a long story about Snape mentoring Harry. NO SLASH. I would like to see Luna Lovegood at some point in that story, but if she isn't there, it's fine. Thank you for your help.


** Have you checked out Potions and Snitches? That site has a whole category of Mentor Snape.

** Are you also interested in Snape raising Harry or only mentoring?

In regards to mentoring there is linkffn(Resonance)

I have more where he raises Harry if you are interested.

**** Here are some of my favourites:

linkffn(1754428) - The Cupboard which is more mentoring than parenting if I recall. It is a oneshot.

linkffn(6413108) - To Shape and Change involves Snape traveling back in time to mentor/raise Harry from the age of 11 on.

linkffn(6782408) - Digging for the Bones involves Harry's poor home life being discovered as a result of another character's death at Hogwarts. Severus raises Harry.

Linkffn(4307359) and linkffn(4437151) - Harry's First Detention and it's sequel, Harry's new Home, in which Severus discovers the truth about Harry and treats him much better. Severus raises Harry.

Linkffn(7724057) - Family Bonds in which Harry has a twin and is left behind in favour of his training. Severus takes care of him and becomes his father. A great story up until around the end of 4th year when it goes off the rails a bit. Severus raises Harry.

Linkffn(3736151) - Better be Slytherin! is a Slytherin!Harry story. Snape mentors Harry in this one. It's been awhile since I read it so I cannot remember if he ends up adopting him or becoming his guardian as well. The Bloody Baron also features heavily which I enjoyed.

Linkffn(3570937) - The Better Man. I am not sure how well it has aged but I remember it being good with Snape as magical guardian and good Dursleys. Harry does not attend Hogwarts.

That's all I can find easily so hopefully you find something you like!
