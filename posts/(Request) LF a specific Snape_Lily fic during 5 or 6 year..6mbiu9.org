Hi everyone. Looking for some help on a fic I can't find nor remember.

The fic takes place, at least in the beginning, during a Slug Club meeting and it's after the mudblood incident. Snape is avoiding Lily and vice versa and I remember James slipping a lust potion into her drink and she gets all horny, but she manages to talk to Snape and they agree to meet later but James and Sirius paralyzed him later so Lily gets stood up. And she gets with James later.

I remember this fic being well written, but i don't know if it's been updated recently. I've looked at ff and Google but still can't find it so if anybody can help, kudos to you. Thanks.
