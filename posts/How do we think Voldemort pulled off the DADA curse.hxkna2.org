You must have to be a seriously powerful wizard to manage to cast a spell on an abstract concept like a job title, let alone a powerful, long-biding curse. It must be super advanced magic. I don't recall the students of Hogwarts ever learning to cast a spell without something concrete to point their wands at. Hermione's curse on Marietta Edgecombe, for example, obviously required her to sign the parchment, which Hermione must've put the spell on. In fact, all of the curses which spring to mind seem to require some sort of physical trigger.

Maybe he did use a physical trigger? Maybe he actually cast the spell on the gargoyle at the entrance of Dumbledore's office, to apply to anyone going for an interview? But surely Dumbledore could've detected something like that. Maybe he cast it on the DADA classroom doorknob? Still feel like Dumbledore would've wandered by there at some point over the ensuing ~50 years and noticed. What's more, once he realized a curse had been placed, surely he would've gone about investigating. So if there was a physical tether for the curse, it would have to be something Voldemort knew every DADA professor would touch, while at the same time ensuring Dumbledore couldn't find it and reverse it. That seems impossible.

But on the other hand, just straight up cursing a concept . . . maybe it's common and I'm just not remembering other examples from the series, but that seems like arcane, Zeus-tier shit to me. It seems so /broken/, in the words of Milo from Natural 20. (incidentally highly recommend that fic btw; just finished reading the first year). Like, if Voldemort is capable of such curses, why not place one on people who seek his horcruxes?

What do you all think? How did Voldemort pull off this incredible feat of magic (if he cursed the actual job title) or trickery (if he managed to thread the needle and find /just/ the right object to curse)? Since this is [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and not [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], feel free to think of this as a prompt rather than a discussion question and respond thusly. Although I certainly wouldn't mind anyone just waxing about magical theory (paging [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]) to answer this question.


** Can't recall which fic, but I've read one where he convinced a house elf (who was either batty, or Tom drove him batty, I can't recall) that Hogwarts would benefit from having different Defence teachers every year, so the elf would take subtle steps to bring each professor down. No one pays much attention to the elves, and being sapient, they won't be fooled by changing a job title etc.

*** Interesting idea. A confundus or imperius seems more likely than a traditional /convincing/ in that case. Although Voldemort himself was one of the biggest overlookers of house elf magic, recall Kreacher in the cave. So I don't know if he would do that. And I don't see how a house elf could've influened the events without house elf magic, so he would've had to have faith in house elf magic to go this route.

Still it's a very interesting and outside the box idea. I like it. If you ever remember the fic, let me know and I'll tell the author as much myself.

********* There's a difference between the way he used Kreacher with a locket, basically as a mouth to pour the potion into, and giving an elf an instruction to act independently for a long period of time. The Jon you described requires the elf to use it's own judgement to chose the best way to dispose of the professor each year, whilst avoiding being detected by Dumbledore, who is the elf's direct employer, and therefore bound to obey.

This is the kind of agent Tom would need to trust absolutely, both in terms of competence to get the job done well, and also in terms of generally following Tom's orders absolutely. The first is unlikely due to Tom's general dismissal of elves, an the second is outright impossible due to the magic surrounding elves.

The only people I think Tom might possibly consider for a task of this magnitude are Snape or Bellatrix, neither of whom are in a position to do so. (Are they even born?)

Is this from a fic? If so, which fic? It's a very creative yet intuitive explanation! Though I'm still curious how it would affect the professor without physical contact, because even the diary needed that to trigger its purpose. At least at first.

  “Oh, he definitely wanted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”
#+end_quote

The way Dumbledore phrased it always seemed to me to imply that it was the act of refusal which cast the curse - one does not deny a person as magically powerful as Voldemort without there being magical consequences.

All that said, I don't think it's particularly unusual in the HP system to place a spell on an abstract object - this is how I view the system operating generally. It is for this reason, for example, that Dumbledore couldn't just escape his curse in HBP by chopping off his hand. The /effect/ of the curse is in his hand (for the moment), but the curse itself is on /Dumbledore/ - that is, his personhood - not any physical location.

** It actually wasn't a curse at all. Because of the sensitive tools in the DADA office, house elves were forbidden from cleaning in there lest their magic accidentally trigger something dangerous and put Hogwarts into lockdown.

Mold started growing in there long ago. The spores produced are poisonous and potentially lethal through prolonged exposure. The strengthened physiology of werewolves made sure Lupin survived. If the wizarding community wasn't so racist, they might have noticed vampires could survive more than a year teaching DADA too.

Dumbledore failed to find any traces of a curse because there was none. Being Supreme Mugwamp, he was too proud to admit he didn't know what was causing the problem and Voldemort became the convenient scapegoat.

Nobody ever asks the Herbology professor for her expert opinion... Seriously.

** Here's a thought: maybe the DADA position /wasn't/ cursed at all.

Hear me out. We know that no one stays longer than a year, but only during Harry's time at HW are there actual psychopaths/DEs/werewolves/Ministry officials in the job. They are all there (along with the subsequent insanity) because of the plots against the BWL. Prior to that, as far as I know there weren't actual deaths, just that the profs moved on after a year.

Instead of it being a curse, it would be more realistic that HW is not a very attractive position for a respected academic. Despite everyone in Britain crowing about its reputation, what we see in canon is a school that is woefully incapable of instructing its students in the basics of spellcasting.

Examples: most wizards who attend Hogwarts cannot cast basic magic. The Shield Charm is 5th year material, and most adult wizards cannot cast it (Twins say so when marketing their Shield Hat). Enough students fail their Potions OWL that Slughorn (who has lower standards than Snape) is able to consolidate all the 6th year NEWT students into a single class. No student at HW (even Hermione) approach the level of achievement that the Marauders - who were academically gifted but not studiously inclined (spent their time pranking rather than studying) - achieved in the 70s. Harry, teaching the DA, has the students revisit old material because /they can't cast it correctly/.

All of this speaks to a school that is in real instructional crisis. When the Care of Magical Creatures professor retires, who takes that spot? Hagrid, the groundskeeper who didn't finish his own magical education. That's like if a Harvard professor retired, and the university replaced him with a landscaper that only has his GED.

If you were a competent and highly credentialed educator, why would you go to Hogwarts? It is a shit school where the Headmaster makes personnel decisions based on friendship (Hagrid) or political machinations (Snape). All of the competent faculty we see are holdovers from decades ago.

What's more likely - a nebulous curse that makes zero sense given what we know of magic, or that Hogwarts is a bad job that can't attract decent teachers?

EDIT: Before anyone says people just can't cast defensive magic because it isn't necessary, imagine that your school required 5 years of boxing classes as part of its curriculum, and that other classes frequently taught boxing strategies as part of their instruction (as Defense topics appear in Charms/Transfig). In that scenario, only a handful of students are capable of blocking a punch. What would you make of the quality of education?

*** Even if it is a bad job, which it probably is, the odds of every single teacher over half a century walking out within their first year are just astronomical. You don't see it happening in the other positions. How would the DADA job be so extremely worse than the others? As you say, Dumbledore hires his friends who are perhaps not qualified. Surely he does not lack for friends and cronies so thoroughly that he couldn't find one who would be happy to stay on, as Hagrid and Snape are. And the way Dumbledore phrases it, it seems it wasn't happening year-by-year until after his interview with Voldemort. Another huge improbability. I genuinely do think there's a curse, and I'm sure there's an explanation for how it was done, crazy as it seems.

You do make a good point on the quality of Hogwarts education but I think regardless there is a curse.

** D.A.D.A position got cursed after he requested for the job, and he applied so he could have an excuse to hide his Horcrux - Diadem of Ravenclaw - in Room of Requirement.

I believe this is the key part, the Room is said to grant every request as long as it doesn't violate Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, and a curse doesn't sound impossible nor related to Transfiguration. My theory is that he instructed the part of himself inside the Diadem to maintain the request of never allowing a teacher to stay for longer than a year, and that part of soul of him inside the Diadem kept that wish alive.

It seems to be the only reason as to how such a thing could be possible, and since Dumbledore probably didn't even know the existance of the Room, he couldn't have removed the Diadem. Voldemort was very angry when Dumbledore denied him the job, so I can see him marching back to Room of Hidden Things and cursing the position out of sheer spite (using Parseltongue or some way of manipulating the soul inside the object) for getting rejected and humiliated in such a fashion.

** My favourite theory was that the slightly sentient curse was placed on the DADA classroom itself(the chambers, office and furniture), subtly altering reality in such a devious way that it would persuade the resident professor to subconsciously make mistakes without noticing, eventually leading to their demise, serious wounding accident or their sacking. And it was powered by leeching power from the ambient magic and wards of Hogwarts, lingering until its casters true death, like how the Dark Marks didn't completely fade until Voldemort's soul and grasp on magic faded from the world.

  You must have to be a seriously powerful wizard to manage to cast a spell on an abstract concept like a job title, let alone a powerful, long-biding curse.

Just to say, that you have absolutely no idea, whether this sentence canonically makes any sense. There is no such thing as “magical power” mentioned in the books, and the only difference between Tom Riddle and Gregory Goyle may be lie just in the knowledge and training, nothing about the power which could be inborn or exercised into.

** linkffn(Time to spare) has an interesting explanation.

The Hogwarts wards are doing it as a result of Tom Riddle's bout of accidental magic after being denied the position of DADA professor.

Personally, I find it stranger that no one had tried to work around the curse. Like partner with the Ministry so the Aurors teach the class on a yearly rotation; the curriculum would be consistent at least. Another possible solution is to change the name of the class to something like 'Magical Self-Defense'.

Yet another possible solution is splitting the class so every other Professor holds a 'Defense' lecture when relevant to their subject.

This is just off the top of my head, I'm sure that over the several decades the curse had been in place, a more intelligent solution could have been found,

** Another "there is no curse" explanation:

Voldemort, still salty about the refusal, killed every defense professor. By the time he gets defeated the first time nobody in their right mind wants to take the postion that is basically a death sentence. After that it's a combination of self-fulfilling prophecy and incompetence.

*** That explains why nobody would want to take the job. But those who /do/ take it, surely they would have the fortitude to stick around? After all it would've taken a lot of courage, stubbornness or desperation to apply for such an obviously cursed job in the first place.

Also, remember that Hogwarts is the most heavily secured place in wizarding Britain. Voldemort couldn't sneak in for Harry. I don't think he could sneak in and kill a professor once, let alone 30 years in a row, professors who specialize in fighting dark forces to boot. Also it's one thing for professors to leave 30 years straight, another for them to all be obviously murdered. There would be a panic over that, that would've been mentioned at some point. As it is, it seems there is not a stereotype of the job being /deadly/, just fickle.

I do think there's a curse, and I think AshLestrange and Taure provided the best explanation (although all of them are interesting): some sort of elemental magic triggered the curse, such magic being brought on by strong and base emotions, unique situations and/or especially powerful wizards. And casting on an abstraction isn't as rare as I assumed in the op, see: taboos.

Because those professors obviously never leave the castle ...

Who said anything about "obvious murders"? All it takes is a faked "Goodby I'm traveling the world" note, accidents happen, and so on. Voldemort might even have taken it as a challenge to see how many "perfect crimes" he can commit. After some time people start believing the position is cursed.

Or don't take chances and quit after a year. Even Lupin, who is courageous, stubborn and desperate didn't plan to stick around for more than a year iirc. (Edit: I think that's fanon.)

Anyway, since you want there to be a curse :P

That's a lot of assumptions. I would make those same assumptions about a ritual to create a new body. Yet Wormtail of all people managed it. Who's to say that cursing an abstract concept like this isn't quite easy, but the process of how to do it is obscure/forgotten.

Sacrifice a goat under the new moon, walk 7 times backwards in a circle around it while chanting "maledictum Hogwarts defense professor" and Bob's your uncle.

** It was connected to the Diadem of course, and in my Headcanon, where each Crux requires a life and a part of yourself in sacrifice (but spilts the soul Half Way each time), it cost the life of the at-the-time DADA professor and “Acceptance” (in that nobody would ever again accept Voldie as a part of the status quo, after making it), and so it forced each following DADA professor to become “unacceptable” after a year of exposure to the Hogwarts wards.

It was bound to the Wards in a similar way to how the Map was, however that was bound to the Wards. I guess “help will always come in Hogwarts, to those who seek it” even if it's help modifying the schools Wards.
