** I remember a FInal Fantasy fic in where Harry gained all this power, and knowledge, but the second he enters the wizarding world Dumbledore Obliviates him of said memories. I remember reading it thinking this is a nifty story, sure he's OP, but it'd be interesting to see how such a person reacts to the wizarding world with such unique powers, and then the author just does that, and I lost all interest.

If it was like a chapter, or two of Harry gaining power, and then allowing that to happen I might have continued, but I think it was something like 13 chapters of world-building, and character development that just went straight down the drain.

I remember reading reviews, and the reason I quit is, because a lot of the reviews said that it'd last until the end basically. I don't know about you, but when I read a story that spent tens of thousands of words building a character, a world, and then just throws that all away until the end without warning, I just can't read it anymore. It's not the same story. Maybe if they broke it into parts, or didn't spend so, so long building them up just to tear it all away, it could have been a good read.
