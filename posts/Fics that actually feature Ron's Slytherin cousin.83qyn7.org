For those who don't know, JK actually planned on Ron to have a cousin named Mafalda who would be sorted into Slytherin (but if the fic has her in another house thats fine).

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/Literature]]

I've looked up a few previous threads on this but they only had her as a squib or briefly mentioned her. I actually want to see where this plot could go. Like for example Malfoy's reaction to a Weasley in Slytherin and how he treats her vs how he treats Ron and them. I'll even accept fics where Ron just has an OC cousin(s) in general, whatever gender.


** I love the idea of Mafalda so I added her and the squib father in my fic that I am writing. Not published yet but I have her as a minor character. I haven't found any fics that have her in it so I figured I'd use her in mine. :-)

** Mafalda Prewett makes an appearance in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Endless Possibilities)

Also, Mafalda would more likely be a Prewett than a Weasley, seeing as her father is on Molly's side of the family.

#+begin_quote
  After Frisk's first year at Hogwarts, things should be looking up for the Dreemurr family, as the awarding of the Order of Merlin suggests. But the next new students at Hogwarts may tip some very delicate scales... and in the Underground Kurt Kairos and Sans have a project of their own. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Underground's Saviour.

  Not much would make an Azkaban escape become second page news among the Wizards of the United Kingdom, but the freeing of the Monsters under Mount Ebott would do it. And thus Frisk becomes one of Hogwart's newest, first year, students...

*** I actually know about that but I'm specifically talking about the cousin JKR scrapped. Though I suppose I'll take a fic where they actually discover their blood relations (if they didn't already know in canon) and if they treat each other any differently (though canonly I doubt that would change their relationship much).
