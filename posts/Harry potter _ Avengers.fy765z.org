This is just the general idea I have for an Harry Potter themed avengers any other caracters could of course be brought in and crossed in like as you can see above Harry as this worlds Iron man and as such. This was just an idea I had to get out there, maybe theirs someone inspired and and wants to write this.


** As fusions go this could be fun. I would swap out Daphne for Tonks as the Black Widow , as she has a better-matching background and an actual personality. Also Widow pulled off some nifty disguising in Winter Soldier that makes more sense if it's Tonks.

Also, not sure about Sirius being Yin Sen; he'd make a better match for Hawkeye, and Ron could be Rhodey.

**** Rethinking -- Sirius as Thor (large family issues), which makes Regulus or Draco as Loki, depending how you look at it. Remus should be Banner, both from personality and situation. But hey - you tell the story you want to write.

** Don't use Remus as the family butler if he's taking on being Banner... use Tom (of the Leaky Cauldron) as the Butler it would fit more, use Reg as Loki and Draco as Coulson or something

*** The idea of Remus and Tom has some merit, but Draco as Coulson doesn't fit for me I like the idea of him as Bucky.
