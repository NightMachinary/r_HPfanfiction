Most of the Star Wars crossovers that I have read cross with the Prequels/Clone Wars. A few crossed with the Original Trilogy and a few with the EU. Are there any stories that cross with Rebels or the new movies?


** Too new I guess for any decent ones to come out.

*** It's been 2 years for Force Awakens and Rebels is in its 4th season. You would think there would be something by now.

**** I´d say everything after the original trilogy, that isn´t legends is hard to approach, because the story isn´t really finished, the same for Rebels. I also don´t see how you can do something interesting with Rogue One, that isn´t to the story's detriment.

** I've thought about a Star Wars crossover quite a bit in the past couple months, and here's my problem with anything after Order 66:

The galaxy is less interesting.

Generally fanfiction is about taking characters that fans know and love (or love to hate) and doing different plots with them. After all the Jedi are dead, there aren't that many interesting characters left. Rebels has a little bit of potential, but there's not really any reason to branch off that series over The Clone Wars.

Perhaps that will change with Episode VIII and IX, but right now I struggle to find a reason to use the Star Wars universe rather than creating a new space western/opera.

  When they were exiled through an ancient arch they had no idea who or what they'd find on the other side. Hermione doesn't know what to think of the two men at first, but soon finds their fate in her hands. Crossover Harry Potter with Star Wars: TFA
