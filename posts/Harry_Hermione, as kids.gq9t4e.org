:END:
Harry still lives with the Dursleys, but gets raised by three house elves. He spends a lot of time at the Granger house. Harry and Hermione get married through wish Magic, as kids.

It's a short fic iirc, but I want to read it again. Thanks.

#+begin_quote
  Based on a prompt from Harmony & Co's Prompt Bank. Harry and Hermione grow up close neighbours, and at age 6, decide to "get married." The wedding is attended by plushies, officiated by a Potter elf, the parents think it's adorable and even magic giggles. Cut to age 11, their Hogwarts letters arrive for Lord and Lady Potter... what the heck happened?

** Ummm... Why would you be interested in reading a fic where 6-9 year olds get married and start kissing?

**** Dunno the thought of 6 year olds marrying or kissing makes me cringe. To each their own, I suppose.

***** You must not spend time with many six-year-olds. They often kiss, and play "family" all the time. At that age they act out in play what they've seen in real life, so if they've been to a wedding or three, it's not uncommon for them to act one out.
