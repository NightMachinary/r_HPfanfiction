I see this fanfic recommended quite a few times and wondered if I should read it. One of the reasons why I have not read it is because it has Harry, Voldemort, Tom R. Jr. listed in the character area. It's not because I don't like slash fanfics (from the summary I get the feeling that this is not slash fanfic) but rather I have read fanfics with similar character listings and I haven't really been fan of those. So I am wondering if it's worth my time reading the fanfics and reading it's sequel?

Edit: If anyone is confused about what I have stated above I'll try to clarify.


** Yup. It's not the perfect fic but is definitely worth a read. I never got around to reading the second part though.

** You'll have to specify what you mean by 'fanfics with similar character listings'.

The only other fics I've read with Voldemort and Harry as the main characters are linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) and linkao3(Train to Nowhere). Both of those are very AU: Voldemort is in power and comes to act as a mentor to Harry. (They're both pretty good though. I'd recommend them as well.)

/Accidental Horcrux/ is nothing like that. It almost feels closer to classic Darker!Harry fic, like HPBWL or Blood Crest. Voldemort is sitting inside Harry's head and, true to canon, he feels dangerous and malignant.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

**** Harry has some moments of extreme moral dissonance which nearly give him a breakdown, but no, as of this point in the story his loyalty to the horcrux is never broken.
