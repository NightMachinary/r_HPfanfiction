I found an awesome fic called The Snape Chronicles about a year ago that was a very well written, believable account of how Snape came to be who and what he was. Obviously, it's fan written and not JKR's but it's pretty believable. I was wondering if anyone knew of anything like that on Tom Riddle? Remember how Dumbledore said most people have no clue what he got up to once he left Hogwarts, and there's like 10 years where there's zero account of his activities? I'd love a Snape Chronicles-style fanfic on Tom Riddle. If anyone knows of any good backstory Tom Riddle fiction, I'd love to read it. Thanks!


** Little Differences linkffn(5761261) has his life from birth to his 11th birthday, and there is also The Dark Lord Exposed linkffn(11015768) that covers his entire life. Though The Crown of Mètis linkffn(6939995) is only about his search for the Diadem, it is done well.

I'd recommend Little Differences and The Crown of Mètis the most.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.

** linkffn(2948443) pretty neat story. AU in the timeline I think, it follows a young Riddle posing as a german soldier in THE African theater during WWII. His goal is to make a name for himself by taking out Grindwalde. Dumbledore f@cks his plans up.
