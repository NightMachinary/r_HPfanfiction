  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

Someone recommended The Wise Ones trilogy a while ago and I haven't seen it since. linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming). Sirius raising Harry is done by lots of authors but in this one Harry gets a pretty unique and unconventional upbringing.

** EDIT: I didn't realise the main summary was so shitty. Better one in the fic itself; dunno why the author didn't use it when it doesn't go over the FFN character limit but /shrugs/. Anywhere, this is a little more informative about the fic:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter dislikes Severus Snape. Severus Snape loathes Harry Potter. No one is more shocked than the Hogwarts Potion Master when Harry takes a potentially fatal spell to save the Death Eater turned Phoenix spy. Harry's sole hope of survival lies with Severus Snape, Hermione Granger, and, of all people, Neville Longbottom.
