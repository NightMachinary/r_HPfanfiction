:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I can remember, it has a metamorphmagus Harry manipulative Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny and Molly bashing, harmony pairing and it starts out where Hermione's hiding under an invisibility cloak after she's run away from the order cause she finds out that she got obliviated and that that she and Harry were being fed love potions keyed to Ron and Ginny, and she starts to remember that after the first time she went to stay at Ron's house, on the train to hogwarts Ron tells her she's his girlfriend because she stayed at his house and tries to kiss her, she runs away and tells Harry, and they (Harry and hermione) fall into a relationship, then she gets fed a love potion keyed to Ron, and freaks out when she sees Ron and lavender kissing. They then go to Harry who's recently been obliviated of his and Hermione's relationship, and Ron thanks Harry for looking after Hermione while they had been "arguing". After a while, the same events happen to Harry, Ginny and her boyfriend, and now harry and ginny are also dating. Coning back to the present, we realize that during the summer to keep the love potions going, tonks has been going to Harry's room in the shape of Ginny and giving him wet dreams. That's what I can remember but I can't find the fic anywhere


** Gee... I think you're better off not remembering the fic, mate.

#+begin_quote
  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
