I've read a few hundred fanfics over the past several years and to the best of my memory I don't remember the ghoul in the Burrow appearing in any of them.

Are there any fics that have the ghoul do anything interesting? Or any ghouls for that matter? If you go through the fandom wiki for [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_family_ghoul][the Weasley family ghoul]] there's actually a lot of interesting stuff to uncover that I don't even remember. There's an actual [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ghoul_Task_Force][Ghoul Task Force]] at the Ministry of Magic, there are [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Chameleon_Ghoul][Chameleon Ghouls]] which can disguise themselves as everyday objects, and there's even a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ghoul_Studies][Ghoul Studies]] class offered at Hogwarts!

All of this is ignored so much by fanfics and it's a shame because there's so much potential there.


** I know there was a fic where Percy raised the Weasley's and learns hedge magic and the ghoul is involved

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** The problem I have with the Weasley family ghoul, is that it's far too friendly. Ghouls in mythology are not benign creatures.

- *Dictionary:* an evil spirit or phantom, especially one supposed to rob graves and feed on dead bodies
- *HP wiki:* resembles a slimy, buck-toothed ogre. They tend to live in the attics or barns of wizards and witches. They are relatively harmless creatures and are just seen as nuisances because of the noise they make. They are relatively dimwitted, and live off of bugs and other household pests. At most, they will groan and throw objects.

The only fic I can think of that used ghouls, used the dictionary definition. The MC had given a bunch of Death Eaters Draught of Living Death and stashed them in a crypt, only when he went back to get them they were literally torn to pieces. (Eww.) Plus side, he didn't have to make the moral decision whether to kill helpless but evil people.

*** I'm going to quote Taure here.

  I think there are two rules.
#+end_quote

1. Don't make foreign magic OP, as explained by [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/members/15391/][@PomMan]]

#+begin_quote

  1. Don't pay too much respect to foreign cultures.\\

  The second one requires a bit more explanation.

  A while back there was a Twittergasm around JKR's use of American Indian folklore in a way that didn't accurately reflect the real-world belief systems (historical and contemporary) of American Indians.

  The problem with this is that the essential approach of the HP magic system towards folklore, myths and legends is to subvert that mythology. With very few exceptions, the HP universe takes mythological things and changes them dramatically:

  In mythology, Pegasus was a unique, legendary figure, the offspring of a god. In HP, winged horses are used to draw carriages and they drink whisky.

  In mythology, dragons are majestic, powerful creatures. In HP, they are kept in reserves and farmed for wand/potions ingredients.

  In folklore, ghosts are terrifying malevolent spirits. In HP, they are mascots who celebrate their death like a birthday.

  All of this fits with a magic system where magic is principally used for cooking, cleaning and office work. The tone of the HP series is one of taking magic and grounding it in the normalcy of day-to-day life, while retaining the spark of romanticism that makes the magic feel magical.

  With this in mind, I think that paying too much respect to the folklore of various cultures will result in worldbuilding elements which fundamentally contradict the established tone of the canon worldbuilding. If you want to produce material for non-Western magical cultures which matches the tone of the HP worldbuilding, you need to change and subvert that mythology, not incorporate it faithfully/accurately.

Essentially, if you want creatures faithful to mythology elsewhere, HP isn't the place to look for it.

** For what it's worth, most of the fanfics I've read, the ghouls are mentioned just about as much as in the books. Meaning once or twice in canon.

I think the most significant ghoul presence I've seen is from [[https://hells-half-acre.livejournal.com/115495.html][/Vile Violent Vacations/]], a sequel to [[http://hells-half-acre.livejournal.com/60607.html][/Damned Demented Demons/]] and [[http://hells-half-acre.livejournal.com/94822.html#cutid1][/Bobby and Hermione - An Epistolary Fic/]], which is a crossover series between /Harry Potter/ and /Supernatural/. /Damned Demented Demons/ starts out with the Dementors in the US acting oddly, and a grown-up Harry Potter is sent to investigate(he's considered a specialist at fighting Dementors, due to his feat of driving away a hundred of them when he was a mere 13 years old). He rescues the Winchesters from a Dementor attack and it all goes from there.
