I know people want to be helpful but there's nothing that makes me ignore a recommendation quicker than someone asking for a time travel fic rec and seeing a comment listing every time travel fic that's ever been published.

Like I get people are trying to give insight and maybe it's just a treasured genre or something but honestly if you can't limit it to around 3 per comment i'm assuming you haven't actually put any thought into what you're saying is good.


** If you want people to only rec a few fics at a time, then when /you/ are the OP you can make that part of your request.

I remember a thread this past year in which the OP requested at least a paragraph with each recommendation to explain how the fic fit the request and what made it good. Surprisingly, that turned out to be a very lively request thread with many great responses.

Each OP has different preferences. Many people prefer to receive more on-topic recs rather than less. Thus, there's no point in making a general rule about this sort of thing. It's up to the OP to say what they do and don't want.

** I know this sub has a Frequent rec and general rec link, but I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to have a place for lists of commonly requested themes. I usually try to search the sub before I make a request, but that can still be a lot.

** I definitely don't like this idea.

That seems restrictive and silly. Like someone else said: if you want a limited number of recs per person, make that clear in your post. No need to arbitrarily restrict others.
