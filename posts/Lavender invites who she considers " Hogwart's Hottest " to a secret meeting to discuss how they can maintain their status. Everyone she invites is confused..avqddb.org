** The twist is that everyone she invites has the potential to become super hot in the future, not that they're hot right now. Like Neville and Hermione(who probably wouldn't show up anyway).

This twist would give Lavender a solid talent for divination magic, which is canonically something she has a real interest in, and a further twist is that she might not even be aware she's using divination magic. She might just feel it's super obvious what people will look like when they get older. Like most savants, she can't explain how she knows, she just does.

** Hermione Granger, Severus Snape, and Pansy Parkinson sat at a table together. Never before have three people seemed more ill-at-ease with each other. This stood in stark contrast with the chipper girl currently tracing an itinerary in the air with golden letters blooming from her wand.

"...and after that, we'll have to discuss beauty regimens. We've all got such different looks, I'm sure we'll learn so much from each other. I know I was discussing dividing the student body into discrete fanbases earlier, but a certain coordination will make the elite status of our group more-"

"Er, Lavender?" asked Hermione timidly. She glanced around. Professor Snape, she was fairly certain, was simply planning what detention could possibly make up for such a frivolous use of his time. Pansy seemed torn between disgust at Hermione's presence and utter rapture that she was apparently considered one of 'Hogwarts's Hottest.' "I appreciate the thought, but... none of us are..."

Hermione gestured helplessly. "Maybe you would want to invite Cho? Or possibly Alicia? We might not be the best, er, ^{collection} ^{of...} ^{^{hotties."}}

Lavender looked around at them, shocked. "What are you talking about?" she demanded. "Emma Watson is beautiful! Alan Rickman's super hot! And Scarlett Byrne /and/ Genevieve Gaunt are both total lady crushes for me!"

**** I almost had Snape react to it. But yes, that was one of the actresses that played Pansy.
