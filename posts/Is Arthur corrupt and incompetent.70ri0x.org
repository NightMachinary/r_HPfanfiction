Arthur got 10 Tickets to the Quidditch World Cup from Ludo Bagman because Arthur helped Otto, Ludo's brother out of a scrape for violating the law. That help was worth 10 tickets as he said "to the best seat " right next to The Minister of Magic of two nations.

Arthur also went to smooth over the disturbance at Madeye house preventing any investigation from happening.

He passed a law preventing people from enchanting muggle item but wrote an exception for himself


** Every time I think of Arthur, I think of Hermione in Forging the Sword linkffn(3557725) (an excellent fic worth reading)

Makes one wonder what if Arthur inherited more of his mother's family (the Blacks) Slytherin traits? Would he be using the favour for favour trading to reach great heights instead of being content on where he is?

*** Was going to post the same quote! Thanks for posting it.

And also, here's a bit longer fragment:

#+begin_quote
  By the time they reached their camp again, Mr. Weasley had pointed out an obliviator, two unspeakables, an auror, a secretary for the improper use of magic department, a diplomat for the being division in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and a member of the Floo Regulation Committee.

  Ron was apparently used to it, because he didn't seem all that captivated. But from what her friend had said, she'd gotten the impression that even though Mr. Weasley headed the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office, he wasn't really that important.

  That wasn't what she was seeing now.

  /Well, maybe he isn't/ important /important, but he sure seems to know a lot of people./

  Though come to think of it, hadn't he sponsored a bill a year or two ago? The one that Lucius Malfoy had been so determined to foil that he'd placed the Diary in Ginny's hands. And before that, she'd heard from Harry that Mrs. Weasley had said something about Mr. Weasley deliberately writing loopholes into one of the laws so he could make his magical car...

  She stared at the man. He was kneeling by the fire, trying to light a match. The evidence of failed attempts lay all around him in splintered litter. Finally he managed to spark one into flame---and promptly dropped it in surprise.

  She tilted her head.

  It's like looking at one of those illusion drawings.

  One way: friend's father, kind of silly about muggles, a good man. Another way: writes and sponsors his own laws with private loopholes, trades favors for favors, knows everyone in the Ministry by name.

  /Both are true./

  Which meant seeing him only one way... would be false.

  “Dad's been having fun with matches,” Fred sighed.

  At her side, Ron was rolling his eyes. “Want to help him, Hermione?”

  “Of course.” She shook herself out of her thoughts but tucked them away carefully for later contemplation, then stepped closer to the fire. “Here Mr. Weasley, let me show you how it's done.”

** Arthur Weasley was quite the bad ass, who generally used self-deprecating humors to appear harmless:

- He raised 7 powerful and competent children, despite meager economic resources.
- He managed to pass the Muggle Protection Act against significant opposition in the Wizengamot, and despite himself ranking not high on Ministry hierarchy.
- He, in his spare time, managed to charm a flying invisible car, who also had developed its own sentience.
- He and Molly actively ENCOURAGED his children to befriend Harry and Hermione, after they displayed significant potentials. (my headcanon)
- Although Molly was loud and domineering, he seemed to be in control of ALL major family decisions.
- He and Bill could both cast the Fidelius Charm with ease.
- He fought in the Final Battle and didn't seem to have been injured at all.
- In the end, Weasleys had suffered the fewest losses relatively, while most other major families were pretty much depleted. They further brought the two strongest of the next generation into the family, and built an alliance with the French powerhouse Delacours.

As your example showed, Arthur was definitely no saint. But considering the entire Ministry was a cesspool of corruption, his little transgressions were comparatively benign.

#+end_quote

I think a large part of why the Weasleys are treated with scorn has to be envy. Screw the powerful and competent part. The fact that he sired *seven* /magical/ children in an otherwise tiny population, that treats squibs like lepers, speaks volumes. In many soceties children are a symbol of wealth. How many families in canon have more than two or at most three?

**** Jealousy makes a lot of sense - I think it makes a lot of sense specifically that Lucius is likely quite jealous of Arthur, given that so many of his jibes hyperfocus specifically on /how many/ children he has. Given that Malfoy obviously fusses continuously over Draco (the scene between them in Borgin and Burkes where Lucius keeps pulling Draco back from everything dangerous, but allows him into the shop despite the danger; "I'm going to tell my father!", effectively staying with Voldemort just for Draco and Narcissa's sake, etc), we can tell he's a very devoted father, if not a very good one. Given that we also know he keeps dogs and cares for birds, he probably would have happily had more children.

How different Draco would have been if the Malfoys had wanted/been able to have more children, who knows?

I feel like the magical upper classes might have actually made a thing of not having too many children, almost to cover for the fact that even having one can prove rather difficult; the most we usually see in most of the Pureblood families is 2-3.

***** Either it's very difficult (danger for the mother? stillbirths? difficulty in conception?) or the possibility of squibs appearing limits the number of children, i.e "we had two that are magical, let's not push our luck".

Even if we assume that the old families would be callous enough to dispose of a child that shows no signs of magic (likely if you look at Neville's case), it would bring a lot of turmoil to the family, not to mention the "shameful secret" aspect.

Nobody in HPverse was perfect. I hate 'perfect' characters. Arthur Weasley being a little corrupt actually sits very well with me.

Lots of people in the fandom often hate 'good guys' for one or two flaws, such as:

- Harry for not being proactive enough
- Hermione for being annoying and bossy
- Ron for being a whiner and slacker
- Ginny for a few mean actions and taking two boyfriends within two years (what a slut!)
- McGonagall for being too obedient to Dumbledore
- Molly for being overprotective (controlling?) to her children

I'm a guy and in the last 3 years I've had 3 relationships. Not a single one was serious and none of my friends think I'm some kind of a manwhore. It's this kind of thinking that shows there exists an institution of sexism. So, yeah, not a fan of that at all.

** Well, with those examples, maybe he is a little teeny bit corrupt.

Of course, you have to remember that this is the same Ministry that uses Azkaban and sends people to it without trial (Hagrid & Sirius), uses the Dementor's Kiss without trial (Sirius, Crouch Jr.), and rigs the ones they do hold (Harry). Not forgetting how susceptible to bribery it is (most of the former Death Eaters going free, Lucius buying the Minister's ear, etc.) and the fact that Umbridge attempted to assassinate Harry. Heck, even Kingsley is technically corrupt, he fed the other Aurors false information that Sirius was in Tibet.

It's entirely probable that the Ministry of Magic doesn't even pretend to be a representative and responsible organisation, and bribery, corruption and doing-favours are just how things work around there.

Even with Crouch Jr. being an Azkaban escapee, though, there's a few problems with him being Kissed:

-The Dementor's Kiss isn't explicitly protocol for all Azkaban escapes; it takes a few months into Prisoner of Azkaban before the Kiss-on-Sight order is authorised (Lupin mentions it being in the Daily Prophet after Harry's first Patronus lesson).

-If there is a precedent, it isn't upheld in Order of the Phoenix, when the Death Eaters are apprehended; sure, Lucius Malfoy might get away with it, but they have Dolohov, Rookwood, and two Lestranges, so why wouldn't they be given the Kiss?

-Barty Crouch Jr. was confirmed dead and buried in Azkaban. Yes, he was replaced by his dying mother with the help of Polyjuice, yes, Snape identified him on sight, but a convicted man being swapped for his mother and then being kept under the Imperius by his notoriously-law-abiding (or law-abusing) father for over a decade, before being rescued by two other supposed-to-be-dead-men, overpowering and impersonating a retired Auror for over a year, in order to stage an elaborate kidnapping and attempted murder of a highly-visible celebrity without anyone knowing the crime was committed...that's a tall tale even with Veritaserum. Basically what I'm saying is that Crouch Jr. wasn't soundly identified as an Azkaban escapee before being given the Kiss.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5d8w3d/so_why_did_fudge_bring_the_dementor_that_kissed/da3ds6n/][I did come up with an explanation a while back]] for why Fudge might have had Crouch Kissed immediately but not do the same for the Azkaban escapees caught in the Ministry two books later; basically it boils down to 'Lucius told him to do it to stop the mystery Death Eater (Crouch Jr.) escaping like Sirius did last year'.

** Point 1: There is nothing implying that he helped Otto to get tickets. It seems like Ludo just gave them as a thank you later (and that's not exactly against any rules or laws). As for helping Otto in the first place, its implied that its a very minor scrape and to be honest, this happens very often in the real world, with the flexibility of judgment amongst police and those who uphold laws and regulations. Sometimes you bend the rules a bit to be nice or if there was no true harm intended or something.

Point 2: The Madeye situation was even less concerning than the Otto one. Madeye was a former Auror and had tons of connections in high places. It's highly doubtful anything would of come of it as he was a revered figure who had sacrificed basically his entire life to doing good for the law. In addition, he was a close friend of Dumbledore and its very possible that Arthur was ordered by Dumbledore (a highly placed official remember) to help.

Point 3: We don't know remotely enough about that law to know how much of an exception he gave himself. Keep in mind though, the implication is that exceptions are acceptable for those doing research on muggle items, and in his job positon he is SUPPOSED to play with such things and learn more about them and their interaction with magic.

Corrupt? Not remotely.

Incompetent? Perhaps but a good chunk of the Magical world (including the Minister himself) Seems VASTLY more incompetent then he is. More likely hes just too nice for his own good to those who ask him for help, and to Molly and his family when they need something (The car was for the family use and was needed somewhat).

**** We simply don't know enough about the Madeye situation to pass any sort of judgment on Arthur over it. We do know that Madeye was a famous Auror with a great background and that he was connected to people at the highest levels of government (including Dumbledore). I see the situation as more of Arther following orders of those above him and trusting in their judgment, rather then Arthur doing anything wrong.

As for the tickets, expensive or not that does not change the fact that it's in no way implied he does the favor FOR the tickets. In addition, even IF they are expensive, this is Ludo Bagman we are talking about here. He's highly connected to the event and probably had access to mass amounts of tickets (that he did NOT have to pay for) to distribute how he pleases. Looking at real world situations, people who would be in a similar situation as Ludo in relation to an organized sporting event, do literally have large chunks of tickets they do not pay for to give away as they see fit (and they are NOT allowed to sell them for profit). So it makes sense from the real world side of things as well.

As for the exemption. You are really reaching to imply that Molly "knew" he only wrote exemptions so he could keep tinkering freely. Nowhere in the books is that implied whatsoever. Her statements are based upon her opinions on muggle stuff and whether Arthur is being silly or not to mess about.
