Animals/Animagus Story's

So a while ago I read â€˜Magical Creatures will get me killed... again!' And it's a great fic that I suggest you read, but that's not why we're here, I was really interested in the concept and I tried finding more like it but I failed.

So I was hoping that you guy's could suggest any FanFiction's that involve an animagus OC, or an OC that is great at Care of magical Creatures.

It doesn't matter what house it is in (but I would prefer Hufflepuff) and is set during the time that the golden trio go to hogwarts. From year 1-7

If you could spare some time to help me, I would be so Grateful -thank you so much!
