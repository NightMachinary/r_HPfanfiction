Rated: M, English, Romance & Hurt/Comfort, Neville L., OC, Words: 692k+, Favs: 983, Follows: 1k+, Published: Oct 4, 2013 Updated: May 21

It isn't harem, but you'll be reading for days.

/Amends/ examins post war trauma and broken people. How the heroes are broken specifically and how they cope with it. Though it's Hermione centric.

/Death of Me/ explores pureblood culture and self preservation contrasted against love and the destructive force that ambition can have. Or at least that's what I remember. It's Neville centric.

** This one is definitely up there, but I would call it Harry/multi more than a Harem.

linkffn(9443327)

It is a more than solid, probably even great, HP/Marvel crossover. Had a lot of fun, for all the 1.8m words.

How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

** Longest fanfics? Let's see what I got, hope you don't mind crossovers.

FILFY teacher - linkffn(12772385) - 800k+ Highschool dxd crossover that is really good. It is a Harry/Harem story that is still ongoing.

Whispers in the Night - linkffn(12104688) - 700k+ A Harry/Multi fanfic that is pretty decent. It is ongoing.

Harry Crow - linkffn(8186071) - 700k+ A decent fic with decent world-building. It is a Harmoney fic and it is complete.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781) - 600k+ Marvel crossover. A good and interesting story. Not a Harry/harem story. It is complete.

H J Potter - linkffn(5093897) - 500k+ A good Harmoney fic that set the standard of soul-bound fics in my eyes. Is completed.

Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path - linkffn(11898648) - 500k+ A Harry/Multi story that is decent and has some interesting arcs. It is completed.

These are the longest ones that I know, I hope you enjoy at least one of them.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
