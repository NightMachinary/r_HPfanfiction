  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

#+begin_quote
  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  В новой реальности не было волшебников и магических народов. Вместо них тут был полный набор могущественных и порой неумелых колдунов. Они вели вполне легальную деятельность и были иногда весьма популярны в соцсетях. Гарри и понятия не имел, как это все работало.

I can't really see him being a random SHIELD agent for years until the Avengers storyline picks up - tbh I kind of expected him to tell them to all bugger off until shit starting hitting the fan lol.

But then again, I couldn't really get into A Third Path to the Future, so.

Say A Prayer and its sequels is a great romp if you can get past the heavy handed crack/bashing of the first installment, but it doesn't really have much to do with the MCU. I really liked it, but it's absolutely not to everyone's taste.

  Harry doesn't know what's going on, or why he's suddenly having such strange dreams after he turned ten. Maybe he's a freak, after all. Or maybe the world in his dreams is real, and these are memories of a past life. (He'll put off admitting they're real for as long as he can. He no longer wants them to be true.)

  Harry remembers the past...for the most part, but he's still in denial. Into this add the sudden introduction of the Wizarding World, his mother's big secret.... He'll have to build friendships and alliances just to survive the year, because Voldemort isn't dead, and still seeks to regain power. But, hey, at least Harry knows how to fight!(This story follows the plot of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, kind of. Some things go very differently indeed.

  It's been over a millennium since Salazar Slytherin left Hogwarts, some sort of legendary monster hidden within the fabled Chamber of Secrets. So, why has the monster awoken now? It has to be because Harry's in attendance here, and he can speak to snakes, right? And a basilisk can't be that hard to defeat, for beings from myths themselves.But that's forgetting that there exist some liars good enough that not even Harry can tell, and then there are pathological ones. Harry's noticing some trends in the sorts of people he keeps encountering. Life likes to keep laughing at him by throwing him in the way of psychopaths and liars, Harry has decided.(This story follows the events of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets fairly well.)

  Hogwarts will never be a safe place for Harry, but always before it seemed safer than Privet Drive. Now, however, someone (a Death Eater) somehow has entered him into the fabled Triwizard Tournament. To make things worse, their newest ally refuses to share any knowledge as to how this happened (or maybe he doesn't know). Time travel complicates everything, and Harry had enough wild cards in his life before time-traveling sorcerers were thrown into the mix.But hey, he can do what's coming to be what he's best at: plan, wing it, and build alliances so that when the real threat rears its head, they're ready. He just has to last out this war without dying permanently. That should be easy enough, right? All he has to do is survive a Tournament discontinued due to its high death rate amongst "older" wizards, build a network of alliances, and, with his family's help, try to reweave fate to save as many people as possible from the immediate threat.Looks like he won't be making much progress in the quest to find a way to defeat Thanos this year--but hey! At least he gets to bond with his godfather, and uncover even more secrets from the Marauders' past.

  Harry doesn't know what's going on, or why he's suddenly having such strange dreams after he turned ten. Maybe he's a freak, after all. Or maybe the world in his dreams is real, and these are memories of a past life. (He'll put off admitting they're real for as long as he can. He no longer wants them to be true.)

** The Stark Truth over on AO3 is pretty good. Kinda dark. Mischief's heir is a fun series also on AO3, not a ton of Marvel crossover until later but loads of Loki. Super fun. And finally Raising a Wizard series on AO3 is another fun one, where Black Widow was actually Lily Potter's kidnapped younger sister, so she raised Harry. It isn't a finished series but it has 3 years of Hogwarts finished already, I think.

By the way, these are all stories where Harry meets the Avengers when young. So, expect altered timelines.

*** Warning: stark truth is kinda shit (not surprising from ao3). It's about Harry being raped by his uncle and sold to other men by his uncle. The rape scenes are disturbingly and unnecessarily long.

The rest of the fic is pure angst and what over at ffn.net would be desribed as hurt/comfort. Basically all of the avengers' reactions (horror, anger, a desire for vengeance, Dumbledore knowing about it all, for the greater good blablabla ... very cliché)

Oh and Harry cuts himself.

I guess this fic is a realistic and horriric representation of real life child rape survival..?

Just a warning for others to know before they get into it. It's not really about the marvel world crossed over into the HP world.

It's also slash main pairings.

- Great Expectations (part of a series)

- To Ride Upon Svadilfari (abandoned/incomplete but long af. I thought it was okay? I guess?)

  A man falls from the sky, and SHIELD is more than happy to help... even if Fury is tempted to shoot him before he manages to make his life more complicated than it already is. Now SHIELD's not quite sure what to do with him; especially when most of their experts claim he should be dead.But then another another turns up... and another, and SHIELD is half wishing they could rescind their offer of 'sanctuary'.Magic users might just be more trouble than they're worth.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  Loki escapes from Asgard during his punishment and finds himself back in New York City where people still remember his face. Well except for one man, who doesn't know of him or the Avengers and has a strange habit of trying to save people who are beyond redemption. Like Loki, Harry has known pain and suffering and was Mother once. Loki now has someone who wants to save him. PostAA

  For two wizards thrown out of their own world and into another Earth populated by superheroes and gods, it looks to be a treacherous ride as they attempt to return home again. But when has the impossible ever stopped Hermione Granger and Harry Potter?
