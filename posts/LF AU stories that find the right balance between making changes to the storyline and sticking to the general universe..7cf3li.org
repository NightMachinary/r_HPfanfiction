I find issues with AUs where one thing changes, but so much stays the same that I feel like I'm just re-reading the books and there are no surprises. On the other hand, I also get annoyed by AUs that go so far away from canon that it has nothing to do with the Harry Potter universe anymore. Are there good stories that find that magical middle ground?


** Enjoying linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) as of now. linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild), of course, for a more humorous take. I try for something like this in my story linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), as well.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

#+begin_quote
  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, and spells are learned or created... (Canon-compliant except for the aforementioned tweak in lineage.)

** I try to do that with my fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It's got a lot of worldbuilding, and a bunch of twists down the road but is still very recognizable as Harry Potter.
