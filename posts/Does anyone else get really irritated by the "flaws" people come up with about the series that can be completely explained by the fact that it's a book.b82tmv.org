Like if I have to read another essay about Harry/Ginny/Neville not being given appropriate therapy for their various trauma's i'm going to go insane.

It's a children's adventure novel, JK was never going to show accurate therapy, i've read summaries of psych cases as long as the first book, it's just not necessary or enjoyable.

Do you have any that annoy you?

(Side note; i'm not saying these aren't fun thought experiments/writing prompts, i'm talking about the absolutely livid comments that this didn't happen).


** I'm much more irritated by people acting like the 80s/90s are the same as nowadays in culture. They really weren't, and it's just ridiculous to act like people then would have reacted the same as 30-40 years later.

*** To add to this, it's a disservice to the people who lived then. I /love/ Pride and Prejudice, and I love the mini-series and the film (even if it took some liberties, but the /production design/ is gorgeous!). For some reason, the trailer for the Keira Knightley film called Elizabeth Bennett a "modern woman" and by saying this it sort of intimated that she is a progressive force pushing against the social structures of her time. It really bothered me. I think Elizabeth Bennett is an absolutely amazing character and I really admire her, but she is /absolutely/ a product of her time. Elizabeth Bennett hardly pushes any boundaries except that she'd like to marry for love, which was not universal, but was still absolutely common enough in her time. It's a disservice to her as a character to act like her choices were made in our modern social and economical climate. She works within her system even when she finds it a bit annoying, and she does hardly anything to push back. When her sister is "lost" with a man (the most horrible thing a young lady could do), she does not question the validity that her family's reputation is ruined forever and she does not blame anybody for probably shunning them. That is absolutely ridiculous by modern standards, and that's just one example. Elizabeth Bennett is a self-respecting woman working within the confines of her time, but she is nevertheless working /within/ the confines of her time, and I think it's a shame to pretend she is more progressive than she is just because she has self-respect.

Anyway, I agree with you, just thought I'd use a non-HP example for once.

**** For me, that doesn't really matter. The main storyline is so disconnected from the muggle world that it is pretty easy to adjust the time frame to make it work. I mostly read crossover fanfiction and often authors will write a crossover between two works that were not released at the same time and therefore require the timeline of one being adjusted to make the story work. Harry Potter is commonly the one that is adjusted because compared to most works it is very flexible with where it fits in a general time frame.

***** Is he though? I got the impression that a lot of the original round of death eaters couldn't really be pinned down. So while a lot of people would "know" it, they also didn't "know" it if that makes sense. Like, yes, dude obviously ran with a clique that overwhelmingly went death Eater, but with no way to prove it.

Plus parents are surprisingly willing to overlook glaring faults of teachers if it means that their kid gets to go to a good school.

Hogwarts doesn't answer to anyone outside of the board of governors. The ministry kinda sorta has a relationship with them, but for the most part, Hogwarts can do whatever the fuck it wants when it comes to staff appointments. It happens in privately funded schools in the real world all the time. Not to mention that Hogwarts is very much based off the Eton/Harrow-esque ideal of a school, and /corporal punishment was still allowed when the books were set/. Snape being a sneering bastard who assigns detentions and plays favorites is sort of nothing to a character who had they gone to the equivalent muggle school would have had to deal with at least one bastard who sneered, played favorites, and also believed in not sparing the rod. At all.

Like I would have loved to have gone to the sort of school where Snape wouldn't have lasted a month, but the thing is horrible teachers like that legitimately exist. I know my school had some absolutely bullying fuckwits teaching things, my sister's high school definitely did, every high school my friends went to did. Those teachers really do exist, how can people say Binns/Snape wouldn't last? IME they'd probably hold their positions for life barring something hugely egregious that couldn't be swept under the rug with hush money.

*** My headcanon for that whole fiasco is that it was done in a sense that it appeared easy. It was easy so that Voldemort would make a move on it. I am certain Dumbledore knew that Voldemort would come for it, just not when or how. The deterrent of death would warn most students away and seeing a massive three headed dog would be the final straw for everyone else.

You see, most psychopaths tend to underestimate things that they think are easy. All the while, there were alerts or something to alert Dumbledore and, maybe, the other professors that were in on it.

However, the real reason is that it needed to be easy enough for Harry and co. to resolve so that it did not look unrealistic.

** Absolutely. Moreover, I strongly suspect that most people who complain about JKR not writing "realistic" teenagers and how they would deal (or fail to deal) with their respective traumas after all the shit they went through don't /actually/ want that. After all, JKR did exactly that in The Casual Vacancy, but I haven't seen many people interested in poor Krystal. No, everybody wants their fun fantasy mysteries with whimsical magic. And you can't have your cake and eat it.

I also think it's a good thing that not every part of wordbuilding or characters' motivations is explained. The books would be three times longer and actively worse otherwise. We don't need a complete rundown of how Wizengamot works, we don't need to read McGonagall's lecture on magical theory of transfiguration or Snape's instructions on cauldron safety. It can be explored in fanfiction (and I think it's the reason why HP fandom is so big and still going strong, there's just so much to explore), but the canon would just get boggled down.

A big, BIG portion of this is that not only is it a children's book but it's also written from a child's point of view. For all we know, Harry was never told that Remus tried to contact him when he was a child and was shut down! For all we know, Sirius nearly got caught going to Hogwarts to give Dumbledore a piece of his mind when Harry told him he was in the Tri-Wizard Tournament! There are a lot of 'plot holes' that might be easily explained by 'hey, this 12, 14, 16 year old kid wasn't there to see this happen and no one told him because he's a KID!'

While it's ok to give a pass to JKR for writing a children's series with its typical cliches, readers should be a lot tougher on fanfic authors writing serious AU stories in this regard.

That being said, it's also important to note that the Books are written from Harry's very limited POV. There are many things he doesn't know and can't know. For example, the Weasleys might have spent considerable effort healing Ginny during their trip in Egypt. But since Harry only met them for a few days near the end of the summer, why the hell should Harry know about whether Ginny had been treated or not? Furthermore, why should a 13 years old teenage boy know about PTSD and psycho therapies?

If Ginny had been, for example, a neighbour or childhood friend whose absence had to be addressed because her absence would suddenly directly impact Harry, it would likely have been to some at least brief extent.

Neville and Harry won't get any sort of therapy, but I'd expect Molly and Arthur to have Ginny seen by whatever passes for a psychiatrist among wizards.

Overall, however, the way Ginny dealt with the fallout of CoS is never stated in the books. And while part of that it's because CoS is still a children's book and another part because Harry has issues when dealing with people, it would have been nice to reference whatever was going on in Ginny's mind through books 3 and 4 beyond "She was even more infatuated with Harry, but realized he didn't even registered her, so she started dating around"

And since at least half of most mental illnesses are actual medical problems, I doubt wizards understand. Especially as Muggles barely understand it even now.

Though I do think they had a better understanding of it than it comes across to Harry. Who is a kid focused on surviving, not healing.

***** Knowing how to change/remove memories would be a good starting point of making a person disassociate with the emotions tied to a memory.

- As an aside this could theoretically mean they'd be able to change the emotions tied to an event completely. I think I just disgusted myself.

​

Considering that Wizards probably haven't had something like WW1, which was the big awakening of Psychology/therapy. I doubt they understand the larger implications of all mental illnesses. But to say they have no leg to stand on is also false.

***** I read a fic where pure bloods had their memories of pain erased as a matter of course, so there was no trauma associated with an incident because to them it hadn't happened. Extremely disturbing concept but... that was the fics version of therapy....

*** Now that's a ridiculous things to be annoyed about especially as fanfiction is basically amateur writers' way of examining the original world, adding to it and changing it around to suit our tastes and senses. Coming up with reasons why canon makes sense is - at least for me - what makes writing about Harry Potter fun.

**** Seconded. I think there's a balance - I /love/ taking things seriously and trying to make it work, but I'm also aware that none of it "matters" and there can be a lot of different interpretations. It's just a fun exercise to try to connect the dots, and it's fun to see how people would build the world in a way that's different from how I would build it, especially since people may notice details that I have skipped over.

Like, I love reading endless theories about all the different ways the Sorting works, but at the end of the day a /talking hat/ is just giving out room assignments.

** Also that wizards don't seem to have much of a mental health system anyway. Because wizards idk. I've seen those essays too... it's a fair point, in the real world they'd all have raging PTSD and whatever else, but /this is not the real world/. People need to stop nitpicking and enjoy the series.

*** Let me just copy this:

Not really. A society that has had mind altering elements for how long? Legilimency was around since the 11th century, and Obliviate originated sometime between 1562 and 1649. And then the False Memory Charm that was created by the early 1900's. I'd think it'd be probable to have some idea of healing the psyche to a degree that would probably at least be comparable to what we have today.

**** I have to admit I was disappointed. I really liked the first film, what's not to like on wizards in the jazz New York?, but the second film is still just only an exposition and after four and half hours the proper story still haven't started. The second film really felt like "No, this is not the story yet, just a tease for you to pay me for another movie in two years, suckers!"

** I'd say that is one of the reasons people read fanfiction, after all.

HP are children to teenager books, written in a protagonist centered viewpoint. Many things are left out, or not understood by Harry.

So fanfiction fills the gaps and explains what hasn't been understood by our protagonist.

But I gotta agree, I'm also a bit annoyed when people become serious about calling the books bad (or similar adjectives) because they can't withstand an adult viewpoint.
