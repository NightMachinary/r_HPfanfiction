The more I read Harry Potter fanfiction, the more I realize Ron Weasley and Dumbledore are actually really bad influences on Harry. Throw in the fact I get fairly annoyed by stories that start mid-way through Hogwarts, and now I'm looking for stories that begin before or at when Harry first arrives at Hogwarts, and treats Weasley and Dumbledore fairly (if not very) negatively. Hagrid bashing is fine too.

Alternative upbringing for Harry is fine, but having the story start at or before Hogwarts begins is very important.

Dumbledore and Ron are portrayed pretty negatively in these ones. However, I personally found Harry to be a jerk in both. If you enjoy Harry being a condescending prick who thinks he's better than everyone else because of "muh superior intellect" then you might like them.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** In a WBWL, Slytherin Harry fic on ao3 called 'Sarcasm and Slytherin', Ron is an unrepentant wanker. Dumbledore is pretty much evil and one of the tags on the story is the author saying they need a stronger word than bashing.
