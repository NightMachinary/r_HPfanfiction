I've done this post before but can you people give me ideas for fanfics I might write in the future.

They should be Harry centric and any pairings apart from slash.

EDIT: My pen name is Flaming Drongo if you want to check out my stories


** I like single point of divergence type of stories. I would be very happy if you wrote something like these:

- Ginny doesn't steal Tom Riddle's diary back. (Maybe the scene where she sees the diary on Valentine's day never takes place.) As a result, Harry delves deeper and deeper into the diary, and Tom becomes a mentor-like figure to him. During the summer holiday, Harry has nothing else to do except to write to Tom, and becomes corrupted.
- At the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry escapes with Sirius. They both empty their Gringotts vaults and begin a new life as immensely wealthy fugitives.
- After the Triwizard Cup has taken Harry to Little Hangleton (Cedric convinces him to take the Cup alone), he grabs it again in confusion, and returns to Hogwarts before anything happens. Voldemort it pissed and decides to use the blood of a random other enemy of his, and returns without anyone learning about it. Also, Crouch Junior continues masquerading as Moody.

** How about a Harry/Katie fic which starts out with cute friendship bonding over being the two youngest and newest team members. They certainly would have spent more than enough time together and don't really fit the same social circle as the rest of the team (most of whom are a year above them +Wood). Perhaps have Katie act as anchor for Harry since she's the one friend who isn't involved in all the crazy shit the trio gets up to.

Or how about Harry accidentally asking Padma instead of Parvati to the Yule Ball (as in "Parv - Oh, hi Padma.", not as in he does not realise his mistake until the ball). Who knows about Harry's infuriation with Cho and therefore does not expect it to be a date. However, due to non-existent expectations, they actually have more fun than expected and it turns into a date.

** Technically not all Harry-Centric but should be easy enough to make them so:

- The Basilisk is dead when Diary Riddles re-opens the Chamber.
- Lupin isn't on the train during 3rd year, resulting in a significant number of students being Kissed
- Due to Crouch overpowering his goblet confundus the same name is picked for all 3/4 schools.
- Someone in Hogwarts gets hold of the Diary during the Philosopher's Stone year
- Harry finds Luna locked in a cupboard while he is being shunned for whatever reason and befriends her
- The first person Harry meets in Diagon is Fudge, who is rather baffled by oversized rags ands starts looking into it.
- Harry discovers the RoR during the Heir of Slytherin incident and takes to spending an inordinate amount of time there. One of the older quidditch players notice he's never around anymore and try to find out where he went.

** I haven't read a fanfic in which Harry and Cho get together in 4th year and Cho being a studious girl makes Harry take a different path in 5th year. And you could also insert some more in depth world building too.

** - What if Harry had a crush on Marietta instead of Cho? How would his 4th and 5th years change from that?
- What if instead of the Triwizard Tournament, it was a competition that involved all of the major magical schools from around the world?
- The Muggle world goes through a scenario like The Stand by Stephen King where +90% of the muggle population dies from a mysterious virus, but those who survive gain the ability to perform magic. How would the magical world operate in an almost empty world?

** Something about Harry recovering, away from the magical world, from having to walk up to his parents' murderer and letting himself be killed, all because information was hidden from him until the last possible moment. Because that's not something you can just shrug off. There should be long term psychological consequences for it.

As an author put it, "/The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation./"

I don't know who said it, but that may be the most accurate description of the series I've ever read.

** The war took a different turn, Grindelwald is released from prison and has an unsteady alliance with Voldemort. He is the one that sees the prophecy of Harry with his own Seer abilities and thus tells Voldemort it's him. In an attempt to change destiny, Voldemort orders Grindelwald to destroy the Potter family whilst Neville is dealt with by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. In turn, both of them are left orphans and both of the most powerful Dark Wizards alive died that night.

Humbled by such events and the weight of Grindelwald's memory leaving him, Dumbledore decides to run for Minister for Magic. In turn, the person that becomes the new Headmaster of Hogwarts is someone no one would have guessed, Gilderoy Lockheart.

** Hi!\\
You can explore an idea where instead of Tom Riddle becoming a Dark Lord, he becomes a politician.

This would mean that Harry's parents would still be alive, Sirius doesn't go to jail and so many other things would change!

You can make it Harry centric of course and create circumstances where Tom and he would meet or something and the former would use the latter in his political plots and stuff. IDK.

And as a huge Tomarry fan, I would throughly ship it. Or drarry, but those two are just my favourites :)
