** methods of rationality.

has a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of Harry (or someone else smart) winning all the time.

does have the drawback of actually being really competently written sometimes, so Harry does lose some battles. but hoooo boy this story has some jukes, tricks, 3d-chess-moves and thanatos gambits

  methods of rationality.

Did you actually read it or did you just skim it? Because in some of the most important plot-points Harry is entirely wrong (like being fooled by his nemesis for the whole story). I'm completely baffled by people who come out of that fic with the idea that it is a story about a protagonist who's always right, when in reality he fucks up constantly through his smug arrogance.

**** eehhhhhh. you have a really good point there.

yes, I did read Methods. It was my first fanfiction, and probably the reason I got hooked. I mentioned it here because IMO, the conflicts are mostly resolved by harry trying to FIGURE OUT how to overcome his obstacles. A lot of precious pages are spent explaining how or why things played out in an ealier scene, what plans people had, what motivations were present etc.

To Me, this story is about many strategies, some of which are very smart. I might be an idiot, but hey...

The story does contain a rationalist superior to Harry, who constantly makes him feel like the slowpoke of the pair (which rubs badly with his arrogance). Harry does make plenty of mistakes that bite him right in his arrogant ass, But I feel that makes for a better story. A story with a supergenius Harry that always outsmarts his opponents and explains his superiority like a Bond villain would be exhausting to read.

PS; I don't want to imply, that you would recommend a Bond-villain-Harry story i'm just using exaggeration to get my point across :D

**** Also, you really made me think about Methods. My perspective might be skewed since it was my first (really) big stay-up-all-night-reading text on my computer.

You sound like you got some opinions about it, and i'd like to hear them. Maybe i'll learn something, maybe I'll stop recommending Methods to everyone in my path. shoot me a DM if you don't want to type it in a comments field

*** I was thinking more along the lines of Death Note. He's a complete strategic genius, but that doesn't make it uninteresting.

** Just to be clear, do you mean to say that Harry has to be commanding other people in battle or whatever? Or do you mean that he has plans that he sees through personally or with little help from others and never really fails.?
