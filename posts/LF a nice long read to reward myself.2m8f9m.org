Just took a big exam and I wanted to reward myself by reading a really good, preferably 50,000+ words incomplete or completed any length story (or two). I'm a bit particular though. Here's what I like:

*Harry as the main character (not as femHarry) and little or no romance-- as in it's not the main plot of the story. I don't even mind slash so long as there's more adventure/plot going on as the main part of the fic.

*I much prefer the story being set during Harry's later years at Hogwarts or post Hogwarts, although it doesn't necessarily have to keep to canon, but I like it when it starts off canon and then veers off to new adventures, if that makes sense.

*If it's a crossover, I love Avengers, Xmen (Evolution, movies, original cartoon, and comic), Supernatural, and Criminal Minds as the main ones I can think of right now.

*I just finished reading The Weapon Revised and really, really enjoyed that. If there's something similar that you know of, I'd love to hear about it!

*Other themes I like: time travel, dark/grey Harry, training to defeat Voldemort, Harry in hiding/disguise, Harry in charge, tension between Harry and crossover world (trying to get something done without letting slip about magic-- and NOT LETTING IT SLIP), Harry pursuing something after Hogwarts that leads to a job/involvement in crossover world as a new life, new/unique magic systems that Harry delves into studying, Harry as an animagus (but not as the main part of the story, unless it ties into hiding/disguise?), and Harry as Death's Master/otherworldly being carrying out Death's duties.

Thank you so much in advance!


** Might I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian]]?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is one of my favorites that has little to no pairings (seriously, the author actively avoids it) . Harry is an animargius, and thanks to time travel has to hide a great deal of things from others, and he seems to be on course to becoming either an evil overlord or the MM. Of course, it's also a comedy and not dark or grey, but it does have quiet a few things you do like.

** I have a pretty great fic for you, I just finished it last night after a decent marathon read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]]

It's a Harry!Master of Death fic where he is reborn after he dies.

He gets reborn as the older brother of Sirius and Regulus Black.

It's recently one of my favourite fics and I desperately wish there was a sequel.

*** Read this one start to finish tonight. While there was the occasional spelling problem it wasn't anywhere near enough to detract from the quality of the story.

Thanks for the recommendation, by the way.

**** No problem!

I did notice a few spelling errors too, not very many (if any) grammatical errors though.

But you are right, they didn't detract from the story at all.

** For xovers I liked the Denarian Renegade, maybe the only Dark Harry i have finished reading.

Other Xovers

Si vis para bellum by Indefilade (Stargate)\\
Crumpets aren't my style (Stargate)\\
Auryn (Naruto)\\
A study in magic (Sherlock)

For post hogwarts you can't go wrong with all the stuff by Northumbrian Start with Grave Days -> Aurors and Schoolgirls -> Strangers at drakenhaug
