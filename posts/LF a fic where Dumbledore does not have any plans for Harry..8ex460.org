Not making him go through challenges, dealing with the problems as soon as they appear (not taking a whole school year and a child to solve), castle's wards at full strength through the school year. No matter how powerful or sneaky a wizard is, Quierrelmort shouldn't be able to bring a wild mountain inside the castle walls without tripping hundreds of alarm wards. This is a castle that was created centuries ago by the wizards and witches who were pretty much demigods compared to the modern witches and wizards. And the headmasters through the centuries only added more defenses to the castle walls. Hogwarts walls are saturated with so much magic that it has a quasi intelligence that can move the stairs on by itself, create coincidences that make sure the students are only gets turned into stone rather than dying like they are supposed to be when they come face to face with a fucking thirty foot snake monster that can kill you with its GAZE. When Voldemort comes to Hogwarts while possessing quirrel he should have tripped at least dozens of anti-possession wards. Hogwarts was used to be attacked during the time period when it was first created. Possession magic is nothing new. Surely a headmaster of the hundreds of them was familiar with the magic and how to counter it? I'm looking for Badass, competent dumbledore who takes care of everything long before Harry was even born. Where Harry is not a god fucking Main character and he doesn't has "the only reason he survived to last seven books" level plot armor.


** linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure) The only plans he has are to make up for all of Wulfric's poor choices. Albus entrusts the protection of the Stone to Lupin, since the last person to try Legilimency on a werewolf never recovered, and makes a point of dealing with Voldemort himself, aside from delegating to experts when necessary.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
