Harry will go through the years at Hogwarts in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor upon you will be great in Slytherin from the sorting Hat. Harry makes friends with Tracey a half blood like him who is friends with Daphne Greengrass since they were kids. Daphne is a pureblood who is distant and reserved ice queen, tracey is bubbly girl who like to make jokes. Both Daphne and Tracey are the hottest girls in school eventually but Daphne is considered the hottest in the world, she puts on glamour charms to look normal since starting school. Daphne has blond hair and blue eyes, tracey has brown hair and light brown eyes. You can add astoria and/or pansy but it should be strictly Harry Daphne Tracey as the main pairing. Harry himself is the same but being in slytherin will get bullied by the rest of the house and will hate malfoy, nott. Blaise can be friends with Harry but doesnt really talk to him much. Everyone else is the house either is neutral or hates Harry. Gryffindor think harry is the next dark lord, rawenclaws and hufflepuffs are indifferent. Harry should be normal in terms of power except he can channel the horcrux in his head to give him extra power in times of peril, same way he speakes parseltongue. Harry should be on the slytherin quidditch team first year seeker. Snape still dislikes harry and just ignores him until the end. Ron and Hermoine interact with Harry rarely, mostly confrontations between ron and Harry. It should be Harry, Daphne, Tracey finding the stone, beating the basilisk etc. Think Tracey taking Ron places and Daphne taking Hermoine place, Daphne should be smarter than Hermoine in some subjects as she is a pureblood taught at home before she started school. Tracey is mostly average in school but is a good tactician and can read people well. Harry should take Daphne to the yule ball and Tracey is jealous but doesnt show it decides to stay out of their relationship at first and doesnt go. There will be attempts on Harry, Daphne and Tracey lives for different reasons, mostly being associated with Harry. Pansy will grow to like Harry more than Malfoy and follow him around. Astoria likes Harry but is more like ginny or gabriel in being scared of approaching him but eventually tells him. Astoria should be the third hottest girl in hogwarts after Daphne and Tracey, Harry only like Slytherin girls in this fic, also Astoria is in slytherin. Harry spends summers at Greengrass Manor. Greengrasses are richer than Malfoys but the Potter and Blacks are the richest. Some events change due to Harry being in Slytherin and using cunning advice of Daphne and Tracey, they wont rush into situations and have more well thought out plans but major events should still happen but in a slytherin perspective. Greengrass and Davis families were neutral during the last war.

Write a scene 1000 words where Harry, Daphne, and Tracey are on the run finding Horcruxes, where Tracey leaves and comes back later to help them. Harry and Daphne get very close during that time and having been dating since fourth year. Tracey is then brought in as Harry second interest as Harry and Daphne explain to her they do care for her as well and all of this is hard, they share there feeling and get to know each other better, more than friends.
