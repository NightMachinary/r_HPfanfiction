Im looking for a fan fiction I read years ago, a Hermione/Severus Pairing, and it starts with Hermione as a single mum with 2 kids, and she takes a job as a potioneer on a farm and Snape is the employer, but he hides his identity from her by changing his looks and voice. Tbh I can't remember the story line 100%, but there is a part when Snape has a greenhouse that is locked away behind wards from the kids, but the kids climb the vines on the side of the greenhouse and Snape flies without a broom to get them before they fall. Hermione eventually discovers his identity.


** Is this the one ss/hg fic I haven't read? Lol keeps us updated!
