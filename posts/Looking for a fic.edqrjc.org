:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Apologies for the vagueness of this one, but it's all I recall. There's a part where Harry says something like - He'd always thought himself abnormal, but everyone else, Hermione, the Weasleys, Remus, had insistently said he was normal. Luna was the only one who'd agreed with him, and taught him that it wasn't actually a bad thing, being abnormal. It could be fun.

Generic as hell, given that sentiment is echoed in a great many Luna fics, but I don't recall anything else about the fic. It's an actual monologue or exchange in the story though, not just implied. He does actually say directly that Luna taught him that being weird wasn't bad.


** Do you remember if it was a crossover? Because this bit is from Browncoat, Green Eyes linkffn(2857962)

  "Yup," Harry nodded eagerly. He unabashedly explained, "Growing up, my aunt and uncle used to call me 'freak' because they wanted to hurt me, dehumanize me, and generally make me feel like crap. It worked. Because they were right, I was a freak, I am a freak. Luna's the one who made me realize that's only a bad thing if you want it to be. All my other friends kept assuring me I wasn't a freak, that I shouldn't listen to my relatives, or let their opinion bother me. Luna on the other hand told me quite clearly that she thought I was a freak and that she was a freak too. She couldn't understand why I would ever want to be normal by my uncle's standards, or even ever want to be anything other than what I truly am. I'm not sure the rest of my friends could really understand that, but to Luna it was the only thing that made sense."

**** I didn't remember it being a crossover, in all honesty, but that is definitely it. Thank you!

*** No, sorry. Thank you for trying though - and for reminding me that that fic exists, it sure is a good one. :)
