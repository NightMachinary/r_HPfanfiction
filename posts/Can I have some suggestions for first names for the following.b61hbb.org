The parents of Terry Boot,Lisa Turpin,Su Li,Justin Finch Fletchely,Anthony Goldstein and the Patils and the mothers of Michael Corner and Romilda Vane


** Su Li's mum's name is Na Li. Bonus points if she plays.

Sure, it's not really possible, but it makes for a nice easter egg.

**** Oh that's funny.

But I just thought of Narcissus because it makes a funny pun with the last name "Vane" (pronounced the same as "vain", which the mythological Narcissus most certainly was).
