Voldemort walks out of the darkened hall in the ministry, rubble and debris are scattered in the atrium.

"Hello Professor," he said, with a look of disinterest on his face.

​

"Hello Tom, it seems like you and your cohorts have been busy tonight," Dumbledore said, drawing his wand to his side.

​

"We're trying, but unfortunately we weren't able to get everything we wanted done today," Voldemort said readying himself.

​

"Yes, that's quite unfortunate when you can't get everything done in one day, but I'm afraid the Minister will live to see another day," Dumbledore said as the two began circling each other.

​

"No matter, I'll just have to settle for killing you," Voldemort said.

​

Dumbledore sighed. "You never will change will you, Tom? You will always be anything more than this; a boy desperately trying to rise above his station doing whatever it takes to succeed, no matter how many people you kill."

​

Voldemort looked away. "Tell me, Professor, could I have ever have changed my fate? I'm sure you've done your research; you know I was born from a love potion -that I'm incapable of love. Could I have ever have turned out differently or was I always meant to become this?"

"Actually," said Dumbledore, "that's just fanon. You are not incapable of love because of a love potion. You're just a dick."

** "Yes, Tom, because it is not from what we are born, but the choices we make in life that define us."

I don't think he'd say something like this to begin with.

Dumbledore, by all appearances, was a poor half-blood raised by a muggle-born in a life of isolation because his father was a known "muggle hater." /He/ was a boy desperate to rise above his station and resented his family for holding him back.

** "Tom, my boy, you just have toAVADA KEDAVRA!"

I know Dumbledore wouldn't use that spell, but come on, when the opponent gives you such a great opportunity to seize initiative, it's downright criminal not to take it.

** The capacity to change is always there. You aren't incapable of love; it may be harder for you to find, but you've taken the easy way out. Someone hurt you, someone abandoned you, so all your life you've been trying to punish anyone who you could blame for it, and being as smart as you are, you came up with ways to justify seeing that blame in everyone you meet.

You seemed so gifted but you never sought to rise above the conditions of your background in order to achieve something greater. That's why I pity you. You never left the orphanage.
