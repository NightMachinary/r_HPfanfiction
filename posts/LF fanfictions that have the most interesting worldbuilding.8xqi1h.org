I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome, are there any fics like it?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][victoria potter]] by taure has excelent worldbuilding. It feels like a harry potter book, in its worldbulding and greatly expents on canon

Otherwise, I can't think of anybody off the top of my head.

****** Oh, thanks! I'll be sure to check it out since everyone is recommending it left and right. I've taken a look but something didn't sit well with me when they said something like '10% of wizards have the innate ability to become animagi' as an explanation of why muggleborns can't be animagi except for some very rare cases and why most people aren't.

** Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): Grindelwald won

By the Divining Light linkffn(By the Divining Light): AU where Neville is BWL, Harry is the next Dumbledore and trained with him

The One He Feared linkffn(The One He Feared): the stuff with the ministry is particularly entertaining

Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): Voldemort won...also paganism is right.

The Phoenix and the Serpent linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): a pre-OOTP AU version of the war, some of the best OC's and villains I can think of

What You Leave Behind linkffn(What You Leave Behind): all the founders had their own secret rooms for Harry to find

The Firebird Trilogy: possibly the biggest AU I can think of short of a crossover, and the best subversion of harem fics in mind.

Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): lots of tidbits of information here, and while the fic has problems, its got a lot of interesting stuff in the background.

Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(Prisoner's Cipher): one of the best fics with a subtle AU that does a good job of doing world-building, by merely slipping it in casually like a tidbit of conversation.

#+begin_quote
  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

** I always liked Ginny's Journey by Oddish. It expanded on the wizarding world in North America back before JKR released all the newer information. (It was written and released before Half Blood Prince).

IMO, the way North American schools is set up in the story made sense to me. They seem to reflect the North American school systems, With a bunch of smaller schools across North America (which is a huge place) and a league system of sports and academic competitions between them.

Oddish also tackles the tensions between blood purists and muggle born wizards in a way that feels authentic to the race tensions that exist in the United States.

The author puts the auror headquarters in Cheyenne mountain (a real military facility. Fans of Stargate will know Cheyenne Mountain from that).

And she makes California a magic dead zone, where wizards live their lives never knowing they are wizards, but at the same time, know that there is something different about them. Which explains why the population of California is so colorful.

Honestly, I feel like the world building from this series is more authentic than JKR's. Hers feels like it was written by an Englishwoman with little to no input on what America is actually like. (Which, let's be honest, is likely)

Oddish had completed the series and posted it on Ginny Potter, but that website is now gone. It's half-posted on Sink Into Your Eyes. But hasn't been updated in years. Which is sad, because I remember the completed series being very good.

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
