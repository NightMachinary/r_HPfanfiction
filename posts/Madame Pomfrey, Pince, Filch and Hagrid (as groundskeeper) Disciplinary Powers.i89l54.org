Can Madame Pomfrey, Madam Pince, Filch and Hagrid (When he was groundskeeper) take or award House points? We see detentions served with Filch, but can these staff members dish out Detentions? Do we ever see these characters GIVE detentions or award or remove House points in Canon?


** I think Filch was going to give Harry a detention in COS but got distracted by Peeves.

*** But can these four characters deduct house points? Did Hagrid ever deduct house points when he was teaching comc?

**** I'm thinking no because Filch and Madame Pince would probably do it in a heartbeat, but we never see it.

Hagrid is too softhearted to take points and give detentions. And he was very insecure about teaching because of what Draco did, so he might not want to risk alienating students. I think it would have to be something extreme for him to do it.

** I'm not sure if Filch can actually give detentions himself, or if he can only report the students to a teacher. Honestly, if he could give detentions, I imagine he'd give detention to every student he ran across. He clearly hates them all and outright says he wishes he was allowed to torture them. ("God I miss the screaming." How is this man still allowed to work at a school?)

** I was asking because I'm writing a scene where students are misbehaving in the infirmary and Madam Pomfrey would be within her rights to remove points if she could. I'm guessing it would be left to actual professors to do that.
