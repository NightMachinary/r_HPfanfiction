*What Sacred Games*

/They say that when a prayer is answered it comes not in a mighty wind or devouring flame, but in a gentle whisper. Narcissa's prayer was answered that night not by a surge of magic or valiant young champion but by the whisper of the Goddess commanding the shadows of death./

/For such a priceless gift, she would have to pay. They would all pay./
