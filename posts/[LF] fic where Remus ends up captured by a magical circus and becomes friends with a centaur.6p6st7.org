** Hmm...I /know/ I've read this one...after an interrogation at the Ministry, he's kidnapped by a werewolf hunter and sold to the circus/freakshow/menagerie/whatever it's called, right? Occasionally the story jumps to Mad-Eye Moody's perspective where he's trying to track Lupin down to rescue him?
