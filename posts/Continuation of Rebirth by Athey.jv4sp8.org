I just finished Athey's “Rebirth” (or at least what's written of it), and I vaguely recall reading somewhere that the story was picked up by another fan fiction author.

Does anyone know anything about this (if it's even true)? Thanks.


** I checked today and while as I remembered Athey made a massive post of the "sequel" and mentioned the intent to continue with the story I didn't found anything regarding any other author adopting the story.

Maybe some else had more luck.

*** That's a shame, I was really enjoying the story up to that point
