** I think you may really enjoy linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky). It centers on post-war Hermione dealing with troubles both internal and external. Mature themes, much variation of sexuality. The style is alive and the characters are both subtle and deep.

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*** Disagreed. Their mature subject matters are simply practicing social justice in the broken world they created, it's nothing interesting, nor anything mature in the slightest. As even the older characters tend to come off as petulant children.

***** I'm late to this discussion, but I very much agree with your observation.

The real world, unlike the HP magical world, is still stuck in scarcity economy and faces existential threats on multiple fronts. Resource scarcity also makes people do all kinds of nefarious things. Conditions have gotten a lot better in the last 200 years, but we still have a long way to go.

Until we break free to the stars, we are just one supervolcano eruption or asteroid impact away from extinction.

That's a pretty generalized opinion. I doubt you've seen all of the world to know it's broken.

** I liked Northumbrian's work, Strangers at Drakeshaugh. His other work lacks technical expertise, but this one is well-written and detail oriented. All the characters are adults and behave as such. It's all canon.

I also liked scumblackentropy's work, though much of it is Hermione/Snape and Hermione/Draco. Lots of purple prose and despair.

** Stay Standing linkffn(7523798) deals with mature themes. It also presents the Golden Trio in a much more human light while also keeping them in character. Ginny is a bit OOC with her treatment of Ron, but we have no idea how she coped after losing Fred.
