specificaly, is there a fic out there where Harry potter starts speaking Dovah (Dragon language from skyrim) and the dragon understands him? NO PARSELTOUNGE i've already read them. i want something new like ddagon langue (Dovah), not parseltoungue


** Check out the writer The Masked Half-blood. He has a couple Harry Potter x Skyrim crossovers. In fact, I think he has two that deal with the first task. I'm not into two many crossovers so I'm not sure how good they are.

** There's one where he speaks Parseltongue (or as the dragon calls it, the serpent's bastardized dialect of Dragon) and makes a deal with the dragon, let him win for 2500 galleons and an absurd amount of firewhiskey. Linkffn(7594305)

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

** Not parseltongue, but mental communication, is in linkffn(The Queen Who Fell to Earth by Bobmin356), which is a crossover with the Pern novels of Anne McCaffrey. I sometimes go back just to reread the first chapter.

It has sequels.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.
