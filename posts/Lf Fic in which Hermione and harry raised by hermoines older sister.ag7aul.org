It wasn't the best written fiction but it did have a lot of sequels

Hermoines sister had a proper name but went by Danger. She marries lupin

They bust Sirius out of Azkaban. He gets married and they have a daughter named Meghan

They annoyingly refer to the kids as cubs

They meet the founders

Pretty sure danger granger had visions

Anyone help me locate. ? It's been bothering me for a while
