The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]].

#+begin_quote
  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.
#+end_quote

Whoever recommended A Long Journey Home, I'd like to feature it, but, sadly, it seems abandoned. I was enjoying it too, but it hasn't been updated since October.

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][A Better Man]]?

#+begin_quote
  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World?
#+end_quote


** A Better Man is somewhat interesting. But it has a common problem. Its main idea is the change in Vernon's character, but that is poorly explained and glossed over. Then it becomes a year 1 cannon rehash with a more confident Harry. Rinse and repeat of every Year 1 but with a bland/garrystu/selfinsert Harry. It doesnt make a big change to plot. It doesnt focus on where it should: Vernon. The first few chapters are very cool with Vernon and Sirius and Remus, but it falls apart before that becomes a full story.

*** I don't have an actual opinion on the story, this is purely a response to your critique.

I think the real problem becomes if they focused on Vernon as a major player (main character whatever) through out then how does that incorporate in the Wizarding world?

Muggles, as the books go, don't/can't/won't live/be a part of the other world except for parents/guardians/love interests (and even then their role is minimal).

While it is fan fiction, thus subject to the whims of the author, it would still need to establish that link and justify its inclusion. Which is an undertaking that can be (has been) poorly done and unsatisfying. Given the 'ok-ness' of this story, it would have (to me) been such.

Otherwise to get the Vernon 'thing' going it would have to focus on Harry's childhood, which can become tedious. Or focus on their interactions during the non-Hogwarts time, which is limited and/or inconsequential (unless Vernon developed a 'thing' we know not to become a divisive power in the coming war).

I think the concept is interesting, and can serve as the jump off point of a canon rehash, but the inclusion of Vernon as the focal force behind the plot would/could fall flat. And I feel that would have made a worse story.

** A somewhat pernickety criticism, but I found the overuse of things like 'Gred and Forge' a bit irksome as well as the fact that the fic was obviously written by someone not British (American/Canadian) who was trying to use British language. I liked the fic overall but I thought some bits were pretty cheesy and the writing quality wasn't overwhelming, to be honest.

Edit: Also, Ragnok, the dignified goblin, using 'innit'. Just not right.

Irksome does not begin to describe it. It's so overdone that using it at all is almost enough to make me ragequit a fic.

** Dude. 4 months isnt enough to consider something abandonned. I would say abandoned is 1 year without update. Anything less is ... hiatus.

*** Maybe so, but I'm still kind of uncomfortable featuring it in the book club when it's been that long.

**** Because of the nature of the fic (less of a story and more of a tapestry), even if it was abandoned, it could still be considered complete. There's a lot of room to grow, but the end of the chapter "In Vino Veritas" (as well as the end of the last chapter) are satisfying enough that they could be ends in and of themselves.

Also, it's amazing. Well worth discussing.

** It's not an outstanding fic, but it's very decent and I enjoyed it so far. Hopefully it will continue one day.
