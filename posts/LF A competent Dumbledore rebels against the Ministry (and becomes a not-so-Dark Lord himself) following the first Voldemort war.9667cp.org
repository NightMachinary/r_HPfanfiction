Maybe he objects to Crouch sending Sirius to Azkaban without a trial, or Snape is sent to Azkaban despite his reform and spying, or maybe there's too much politicking and technicalities in the courtroom instead of evidence, or maybe there's just too many of Voldemort's "ex"-followers in the Ministry.\\
In any case, does anyone know any fics where the point-of-divergence is Dumbledore abandoning his roles as Chief Warlock/Headmaster of Hogwarts/Supreme Mugwump/etc and personally rebelling against the Ministry, for whatever reason? Good Dumbledores only, plz.


** Well, it's in the second war, not right after the first, and he doesn't abandon his offices, but he does oppose the Ministry in my story "Divided and Entwined", and he tells them that they wouldn't like it if they tried to oust him:

  “The Board of Governors might not share your optimistic view,” Cornelius said. “They might consider your handling of this affair inadequate as the Headmaster of Hogwarts.”

  Albus narrowed his eyes. “Should they do that I might consider their actions as proof of their allegiance with the Dark Lord.” Cornelius paled, and Albus glared at Amelia. “I am growing tired of struggling to protect the innocents while remaining within the bounds of laws passed by inept and corrupt people. I would suggest you stop pushing me, before you go too far.” Amelia was about to answer him, but he cut her off. “Neither of you know what a real war is like. Ask some of the few remaining British wizards and witches who fought at my side in Grindelwald's War and you might understand why they and all of Europe scoff when you talk of the ‘Blood War' twenty years ago that you fear so much. Ask, and then ask yourself if you truly wish to have me as your enemy. For if it comes to it, I will not merely fight you, I will wage war against you as I did against Grindelwald.”

*** I love this story. I really, really love it. I just wish that I could reread only the interesting parts. There was a /lot/ of slow parts in your story that work well the first time you read it but feels like a chore on your second or third time.

Obviously it's still worth recommending - I've read the damn thing six times now. :)

*** Hmm. I'll admit that when I first heard of your story, I glanced at the summary and moved on. Having gone back and actually read about half of it now, I'm impressed by the depiction of war. No 5-minute solutions or single dramatic winner-take-all battles in /this/ fic; every time it seemed like things might be close to wrapping up, I had to remind myself that it's over 600K words, and sure enough, there were more twists to come.

I'm taking a break now, after Dumbledore got himself killed. It's a rather violent story, and I'm not sure I'll finish it due to that, but I commend you for the skill you've shown in writing the horrors of a real war.

** Not that he abandoned the roles, but that he was forced out of them? Sure.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  "D'you know Crouch, then?" said Harry.\\
  Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.\\
  "Oh I know Crouch all right," he said quietly. "He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban - without a trial."\\
  "What?" said Ron and Hermione together.\\
  "You're kidding!" said Harry.\\
  "No, I'm not," said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. "Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?"
