*DAMMIT a typo.

Hagrid knew Riddle in school, is extremely useful in battle, and if he didn't know about the Horcruxes then at least he had a pretty strong /inkling/ ("I don't think he 'ad enough human left in 'im t'die"). He seems like an ideal choice for the Trio to take with them on the Horcrux Hunt, stealth aside. Are there any fics where this is the case?


** ACHILLE FRIEND YOU MADE A THREAD ALL YOUR OWN!!! :) :) :) :) This is a VERY VERY interesting idea! Hagrid is so nice and cool and good with animals and yes Hagrid is so good and fun. :) I would love to see a story like this! But yes can Hagrid even apparate? :o Also he's very loud sometimes and sulks a lot in the books kind of like Ron and Harry. That would mean they would have THREE sulkers on the team! :P

*** Good point on the sulking! But Hagrid probably /can/ Apparate. He's actually a pretty competent wizard, he just pretends he isn't for legal reasons --- and his Half-Giantness shouldn't be a problem, since we know House-Elves, for example, can Apparate.

**** Ok that's good! :) But yes like you said he wouldn't be very good at stealth! He also loses his temper a lot and does stupid mean stuff, like trying to make Dudley a pig and also throwing Karkaroff into a tree for thinking he attacked Harry in Goblet of Fire? :( I love Hagrid but I think yes he would just be a huge liability!!! But yes Achille I'd love to read a lot more alternate companion Horcrux hunts, like maybe it's actually a lot of people from the DA all in a big group, like Neville and Luna and Ron and Hermione and Cho and Ginny all together. Or maybe it could be Harry alone? :)

  like trying to make Dudley a pig

He didn't. What he did was still mean, but I think it's pretty clear Hagrid just meant to give Dudley a pig's tail all along --- the "my spell failed 'cause the rest of him is already just too much like a pig" line was, I think, just a joke to amuse hHarry.

****** Oh. I always thought it was true, but a foreshadowing of how he was an expelled untrained wizard. And yes, it was still horrible to do.

ALSO ACHILLE I just noticed that your title says Horcrux joins the Horcrux Hunt! :P That would be an intesting story too, like what if a Horcrux was able to be persuaded into helping against main Voldemort? :) Maybe make a practical bargain with it: We'll give you a body in a ritual if you help us, because we're the ones with wands and you're helpless.

******* Dammit, a typo!

But yes, that might be an interesting story. Although if they're going to leave one Horcrux alive anyway seems kind of pointless to be hunting for the others.

******** Oh. Well I guess in my scenario it would have been NECESSARY because they didn't get all the super lucky plot convenience breaks that they got in canon. :P So they would have had to get the information out of one of the Horcruxes. It would also make it way more tense than just being influenced, if they actually had to deal with and talk to the evil they're fighting against on their journey.
