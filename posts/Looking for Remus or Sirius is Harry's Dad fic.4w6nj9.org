Surely there must be some good stories out there.

Thanks!


** I am actually not sure what you want. As in Remus or Sirius being his biological father or just raising him. Because the former just doesn't make sense to me... "Hey Harry, listen, I am your real father. I accidentally had a secret affair with Lily and you are my son." It would destroy the background of what makes the character Harry Potter, so you'd better search for an OC-fic about Sirius or Remus marrying and having their own kids. As for the latter, there are fics, where Sirius steps up as his godfather and actually does something instead of running away and getting himself killed. linkffn(8045114; 6518287; 6747856; 750576; 9822874; 11500936)

I haven't found any decent fics for Remus, as his fury little problem is an issue for raising a kid.

** in case you're still looking linkao3(The Bowl of Lilacs) is a good one and has Remus as Harry's biological dad. What I look most about it is that it spends a decent amount of time explaining how and why Lily and Remus ended up having an affair.
