  "Miss Granger, here is the latest issue of Playwizard: Whips & Chains & Animagi edition." Professor McGonagall said in clipped tones before handing the magazine over to the brightest Gryffindor student, "Are you absolutely certain that this is necessary?"

  Hermione nodded, blushing bright red, "Um...yes Professor. We've confirmed a strong correlation between the clarity of Harry's visions and the strength of his...you-know-what."

  "Boner?" McGonagall finished wryly, "Stiffie? Erection?"

  Hermione nodded and blushed harder. McGonagall just shut her eyes and took a deep breath before continuing, "Just as long as /things/ remain consensual for Mr. Potter. And while you may ask the house-elves to assist you with restraints and aftercare, under no circumstances are they allowed to participate in acts such as that depicted on Page 34..."

  A long way away, up in the headmaster's office, Albus Dumbledore read his recipt for the yearly subscription to Playwizard, before sighing and laying his head on his desk.

  "You know, Fawkes..." he said tiredly to the quietly giggling phoenix next to him, "When I came up with the idea that love was the power Voldemort knew not...this isn't exactly what I had in mind."

Still, I can imagine it...Voldemort's horcrux ends up in the unfortunate place of baby Harry Potter's teeny-weeny.

He goes through life, unaware of anything unusual about himself, the Dursleys not wanting to talk about how he got a scar in such an unfortunate place (or maybe they accused his parents of doing bad things to him, I dunno). He goes to Hogwarts, does stuff, with a minor difference in that people know Harry for being the 'Boy-Who-Lived-Without-A-Scratch (That-Anyone-Knows-Of).

First year, he stops Quirrel as normal and learns about his mother's protection, second year, his trouser snake lets him speak snake and stop the Riddle Diary, third year, blah blah blah we know all this...

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Then, 5th or 6th year, Harry's really getting into a teenager and doing teenager things, but having the horcrux in his willy rather than in his noggin has an unusual effect; with his mother's protection still active in his blood, exposing the horcrux to that blood (e.g. when his erectile tissue gets engorged) partially suppresses its dark properties and lets Harry access a link to Voldemort; the more engorged, the better the signal.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Naturally, this confuses Harry a lot, as he starts getting visions of what Voldemort's up to whenever he tries to fap.

Which given that Voldemort tends towards torture, murder, and plotting torture and murder, really tends to kill his boners.

Nevertheless, these visions are valuable, so, swallowing his Gryffindor bravery, Harry asks (Love Interest X) for help; after testing, they find the harder the boner, the better the vision...and the rest of the fic is a smut-fic of epic proportions where Harry is teased and denied for hours on end in the name of maintaining the hardest shaft possible.

--------------

...I think that if this fic were ever written, it would need to be from the perspective of a clue-finding...oh, let's say Ronald Weasley.

When Harry & Hermione (or Harry & Ginny!) are disappearing who knows where for hours on end, when McGonagall is sharing mysterious brown parcels with them when they are around, when a trip to the kitchen has the house elves asking 'Do Wheezy's friends need the handcuffs again?', when Dumbledore makes a cryptic comment in earshot about 'not the power of love I expected'...

** Well, whenever Voldemort experiences extreme emotions, Harry always feels his scar prickling and rubs it.

Imagine him furiously wanking off and saying, “Oh, Voldemort must be really angry right now!”

When his scar starts bleeding everyone's like “Harry, I didn't know you were a girl!” and “/Psst! Harry! I think you're on your period!/”

The worst part would be when the horcrux in him would have to die. Truly horrific. Even if he refused to have his dick undergo such a painful process that would probably leave his dick forever mangled, it would still be a horcrux then. Voldemort would have to possess his dick because it's the only horcrux of his left, and probably give Harry a boner at the worst of times and cause an inability to become erect when he needs it.

Now that I think about it, there's /no/ way this could end happily.
