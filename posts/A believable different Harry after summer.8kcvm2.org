...If you're looking for ideas, there was one I never properly developed where Harry starts to develop a fear of being helpless without his wand; given Tom Riddle's shade stole it in the Chamber of Secrets, Lupin disarmed him in the Shrieking Shack, then Barty Crouch Jr. stole his wand at the Quidditch World Cup and then it was taken /again/ by Peter Pettigrew at the graveyard (and he would have been dead then if not for Voldemort's insistence on a proper duel).

Given that his 5th year starts with him being attacked by Dementors and then threatened with having his wand snapped by the Ministry, it's understandable that Harry decides to try and learn how to use his magic without a wand in case he's ever disarmed again. He ends up turning to Dobby (who uses wandless magic all the time) for training.

** I like the changes from this Harry because of both his curse-breaking stunt and Daphne. Its really good, even if it has somewhat bad grammar. The story is good enough to make up for it, imo. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magic of Life)

There's another, but its kinda debatlable if its believable... linkffn(Adversity breeds excellence by beetee)

The last 2 that I can think of are linkffn(The Legacy by storytellespw; Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

One Sirius takes to himself to be more proactive in Harry's live, and the other, Harry finds an Occlumency book left by Sirius after his death that leads to a shitload of other things, but stays somewhat true to canon. Just know that the writting, despite extremelly good, can get a bit redundant at times.

*** I'm the writer for the second fic, just to confirm it is not at all believable and its pairing is blatant wish fulfillment. That being said, you might want to check it out anyways as all improvements Harry makes are by his own merit, and I'm trying to make it at least a little different than similar fics which hopefully makes it interesting to read regardless of its obvious flaws. :]

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

** Linkffn(10751741)

Harry/Lisa Turpin that has Harry grow up and become his own man without inheritance shit, bashing or politics. Believable teenagers and romance, despite an eventual engagement (without the intension to marry immediately). A good depiction of youth life and Harry being accepted in a family without Weasley level of overbearance (one scene takes that a little to far however). There's also s sequel.

  Is your girlfriend coming over? Make sure to air the room afterwards. Also, is she staying for breakfast?

  Also, remember to not overdo the drinking on Saturday. A bottle of Vodka for the three of you is enough.

The two scenes were I agree with your complaint are Lisa's father and the Church as well as Harry's recollection of the time when she if drugged. But perhaps I just really like the story because there is no unreasonable drama and it is a nice change compared to the average fare.
