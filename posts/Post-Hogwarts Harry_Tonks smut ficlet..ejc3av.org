:END:
I'm pretty sure it's post-Hogwarts, but it might take place in Harry's last year there. I think it only had a couple of chapters, but I could be wrong. I'm not sure what the background was, if there even was one, but Tonks comes up to Harry one day and asks who he thinks the hottest girl at Hogwarts was/is. He says Daphne. She's surprised that he went with a Slytherin and comments about it. He responds with something like "Yeah, but have you seen her?" Tonks leaves and comes back later, transformed into Daphne. Naughty times commence. I'm fairly certain that it was spontaneous on her part; they weren't in that kind of relationship beforehand.

Does anybody know what fic this is?
