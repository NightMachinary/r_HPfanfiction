(Posted this on a few other subs as well) I've recently been reading a ton of sexual harry potter fan fics such as the sword of Gryffindor and Crack'd Mirrors and I've loved them because they actually feel like gully fleshed out books and are arguably written better than some of the original books. I've been looking for another one to read so if anyone has suggestions please tell me!


** Depends what you count as an "adult" fic, becuase any fic can have smut.

If you want some darker themes and characters, with gore and violence portrayed properly than linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

If not then linkffn(For the love of magic by noodlehammer) is right up your bungee alley.
