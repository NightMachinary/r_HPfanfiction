I have a sudden urge to read stories about the lives of HP pets. Any pets really. From Hedwig to Fluffy to Trevor. I'm mainly looking for the ones that are from their perspectives.

The only restriction I would add is the fact that they are real animals or magical animals. Not an Animagus.

** Doesn't fit your request, since it is an animagus fic, but it is a gutpunch of an ending. Deserves mention.

The second is just silly.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.

  We all know Harry's story from start to finish; but what about Hedwig's? It couldn't have been easy for an owl to care for Harry. Little do we know is that she has always been there watching over him. This is her story through the years.
