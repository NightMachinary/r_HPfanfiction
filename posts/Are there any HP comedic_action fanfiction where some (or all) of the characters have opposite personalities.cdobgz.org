I think it would be hilarious to see how different the world turns out. Hermoine being a dunce, Ron a genius know-it-all, Draco still vain, but strangly nice (or does things out of spite, only for them to turn out really well for the intended victim) Peter being the actual good guy among Sirius with Remus selling them out. Just different takes on characters would be a fun read I think. Or even making it seem like Voldemort had a point and drew him in a particular aspect to where the main characters could even sympathize with him (only way I think of this happening though is if wizarding propaganda makes him look utterly evil, despite he wasn't that evil to begin with). Or even if Dumbledore sided with Voldy against an extremely corrupt Ministry.


** I think there was one like that with Voldemort as a healer. Idk, it might be in my history if you're interested.

*** If you're talking about linkffn(A Riddled Universe) yes it indeed does have a good! Voldemort, but it isn't funny or crack, but is a great fic, so I'd recommend it anyway.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** Stages of Hope by Kayly Silverstorm comes to mind, it's a dimension travel AU where already AU characters (grim dark universe) trip into another, even more AU universe (opposite ish universe). There are some crack ish comedy bits but it's mostly action and family bonding, because the grim dark characters (Harry, Hermione, Neville, Luna) all need hugs. Essentially, they go horcrux hunting and both freak out and impress the opposite universe guys. All of them are super badass. Complete too!

Reverse by Lady Moonglow also fits this, and is also a dimension travel one. Hermione finds herself in another universe where everything is...reversed. /bad dum tsss/ Slytherins are still hated and Gryffindors are still praised, but Gryffindors are TERRIBLE PEOPLE. Dumbledore's proliferated the use dark magic, pure bloods are literally treated like house elves, and it's in general this super trippy dystopia. Evil Lily Evans, badass/chaotic neutral/sane Bellatrix, and also Lucius Malfoy needs a hug and probably some therapy---all of which are cool to read. Dramione romance, and Hermione spends her time trying to fix the horrendous human rights violations going on. And even though I'm pretty sure it's abandoned, there's still a ton of content that it's worth reading.

Both of these are really good and novel-length.
