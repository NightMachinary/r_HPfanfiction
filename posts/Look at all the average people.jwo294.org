**** Hermione's flaws are shown in literally every book:

Book 1: Her bossiness is well documented, she also believes that nothing is more important than learning and schoolwork and that doing anything else is a waste of time.

Book 2: Her single-minded focus to figure out what the monster is what gets her petrified. She ran off to the library by herself nothing there was a monster that was targeting Muggleborns going around.

Book 3: Her stubbornness and pride prevent her from getting help with the time-turner when she is very clearly in over her head. She refuses to apoligise over the scabbers instant, and while it turned out that Crookshanks never ate Scabbers, everything pointed to it at the time but she still didn't apoligise cause she though she was right. And then the broom instant where she never even tried to convince Harry to get it looked at and instead went right to the Professors.

Book 4: Her stubbornness over S.P.E.W, even though it was clear that the Elves didn't want to be freed she wanted them to be anyway, constantly pressuring and nagging people so much that they end up joining just to get her to leave them alone.

Book 5: She doesn't send Harry any mail good mail over Summer, despite the fact Harry has just watched a friend die. Her condescension over Luna's beliefs, because they can't be proved in a book.

Book 6: She attacks Ron and tries to make him jealous when he doesn't like her even though she hasn't made any of her intentions clear. She also gets Jealous and frustrated over the potions book helping Harry. Her complete disregard of Harry's theory, Harry is rather obsessed here so it does make sense but she doesn't even consider it for a second.

Book 7: Her complete disregard of Harry's opinions that a Horcrux might be in Hogwarts.

Hemione has many realistic flaws and this hardly even covers them. Her having flaws takes nothing away from the character, it just makes her more complex, realistic and is far more enjoyable to read. She is extremely stubborn, gets jealous easily, takes out her anger out on others often, loves arguing, is often condescending and believes that authority and books are always right.

How you could possibly read the books and think Hermione has no flaws and is a Mary sue is beyond me.

******* Don't care about the rest of the Mary sue argument but...

In the books Hermione wasn't pretty at that point. We get a glimpse of her being "attractive" the night of the ball but that's it. Though as far as I remember, she's never really described as a looker in the same vein as Cho or Lavender or Fleur. That was just Emma Watson getting lucky when she spun the puberty wheel.

******** Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Krum even asks himself during Bill and Fleur's wedding what the point is in being a superstar if all the pretty girls are taken, referring mostly to Hermione and Ginny. Besides maybe the fact that she seemed more unapproachable and down to earth than the ditzy groupies following him around (even if they might have been more physically beautiful) is what made her so attractive to him.

******* I haven't actually read the books in awhile, however I'm sure she was never described as pretty within the books. It could be because our POV is from a 11-year-old but didn't at somepoint someone say she had large buckteath or something?

** I like this idea. Plus, with four equal partners, we'd have more brainstorming, instead of everybody always having do do what Hermione says because she's the bossiest.

Really, it's no surprise that Hermione starts off the series already worshipping Dumbledore. They both are so used to being the smartest person in the room that they just can't imagine that anybody else's opinion matters.

*** *‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Hermione exploded, ‚Äúif he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNo, it isn't,‚Äù said Harry thoughtfully. ‚ÄúHe's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,‚Äù said Ron proudly. ‚ÄúListen, you've got to be up for the end- of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course --- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you --- but the food'll be good.‚Äù*

She was the one who was worshipping Dumbledore? While both Ron and Harry brushed over his actions in PS, she actually pointed out how horrible it was for Dumbledore to set Harry up to defeat Quirrell.

** I get what you mean. Some fanfic authors really play up Hermione's role to the point that she becomes a Mary Sue.

I do recall reading a story where Lavender became the girl of the group instead of Hermione but I can't remember what it was all about so I'm having a tough time finding it.

** I disagree with Hermione dominating everything and Harry and Ron being along for the ride. I think the trio complements each other well with Hermione being the brains, Harry being the moral compass and Ron being the humanity. Besides, Hermione most certainly has flaws. She is bossy, nagging, sometimes cruel, disregards others' feelings, dismisses ideas she doesn't agree with, worships authority (at least at first) and always (directly or indirectly) brags about her knowledge. Don't get me wrong, I love book Hermione (and I think movie Hermione is a Mary Sue indeed), but as a person, I think she is quite unlikable. Even in GoF, when Harry and Ron fight, Harry thinks that he much more prefers Ron's company than Hermione's. And again in DH, Harry seems to sort of resent her while Ron is being bitchy and when he is gone, even though he mostly keeps it to himself.
