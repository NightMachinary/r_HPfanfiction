I know, I am asking too specific. But anything with a mix of Harry traveling to AU, conflict with his parents and a good plot, please recommend.

TIA

I haven't read “world changer” but, “strange reflections” basically fits the rest of what you said. A version of Harry's family comes to a mostly cannon universe after the final battle. If you haven't read it I would recommend giving it a try. It's also complete which is always a plus.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
