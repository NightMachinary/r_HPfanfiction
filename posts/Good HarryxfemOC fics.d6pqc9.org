So, I'm in one of those moods where I want some good romantic fluff/drama/adventure to endlessly consume. I've exhausted my usual HarryxGinny and HarryxDaphne sources, and I've even branched out into the HarryxLuna realm of possibility. But I'm looking for something that's...unique, something that I haven't encountered yet in my fan fiction travels: A fic with Harry and an fem!OC as the main pairing where the OC isn't just your run-of-the-mill author-insert Mary Sue. An actual relationship that grows and develops with concrete characters all around.

Like I said, most likely impossible . But I hope I'm wrong. What say you reddit?

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted & experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous.

***** Eh. The start isn't the best thing ever, but if you get to the middle/end, then it really becomes so much better. Not the best fic ever, but certainly entertaining, amusing, and, at times, even touching. Do keep in mind that the fic is pretty old - the author deleted their fics at some point and re-uploaded them later, so there are quite a few tropes.

** It's one of my favourite stories: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11552218/1/Valeriana-Natassa]])

The story features a female vampire, good writing and always leaves me with a pleasant/cosy feeling after each reread. All chapters are finished mini-stories.

#+begin_quote
  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

*** Yep, pretty good read. I should read it again sometime. iirc, I liked it quite a lot until they went to Japan. I feel like the quality declined there for some reason, idk.
