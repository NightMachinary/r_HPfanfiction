*** I would add Games and FB to canon but only in the parts that don't contradict the books... like... Newt through NY, okay... McGonagall teaching in times of FB, no

** The 7 books, and some of pottermore.

Cursed Child is just a play, just like the movies are just movies.

Fantastic Beast films are only as canon as the HP films.

** I'm a strong "Death of the Author" believer so Pottermore and everything Rowling's ever said in an interview, tweeted, written in a draft that got cut before publication, etc. is just some random Scottish woman's headcanon and no more entitled to my acceptance than anyone else's headcanon or any other piece of fanon. The Grindelwald movies are non-canon for me because I haven't seen them. Ditto the "extra" books like the Fantastic Beasts book: I didn't read it, it isn't canon for me. For that matter, anything I don't remember from the booms I've read or movies I've seen, I feel no obligation to treat as canon.

For that matter, as I learned when Rogue One became the first Star Wars movie released since 1983, anything I dislike from the books I did read and movies I did see I don't have to treat as canon.

*** Why even use the concept of canon then? It seems useless when the term headcanon already exists and what you consider canon seems to manipulated enough to be incredibly unique to you. I understand that your way of determining canon may not encompass all of your headcanon, but by excluding certain parts from the published material you change the overall story significantly to the point where it diverges enough to essentially be some of your headcanon and would be misleading to call canon.

**** Generally, I don't use the concept. I think it's kind of dumb, especially as applied to derivative/transformative works like fanfiction.

** If JK Rowling wrote it, and it's published in an official capacity, it's canon for me. So the Harry Potter series, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movies (or the screenplays), those little books that are what characters in Harry Potter would've read, and Pottermore (though this is iffy) can count as canon. Cursed Child is badly written fanfiction not written by her, and her tweets are not official despite being done by her, so they aren't canon.
