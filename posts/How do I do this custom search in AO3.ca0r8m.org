How do I do a custom search for "no pairing" fics in AO3?

For FF.net, I use scryer - I basically just filter out all the secondary characters that may indicate pairing - both Het and Slash.. (Now there might be secondary relationships with Fanfiction.net stories that don't have a secondary character in story summary, but most of the fics center around Harry, which is what I'm looking for..).

I haven't found a way to get such 'no-pairing' fics in AO3? Is this at all possible in that site?


** Exclude F/M, M/M, F/F, and Multi in the sidebar (under "Categories").\\
You can also knock out 20k~ dubious fics by including Gen (to exclude untagged fics).\\
204 of the fics left seem to be tagged with Non-Con and/or Underage. A quick glance makes me think these are more dealing with abuse than with relationships, but I'd filter them out to be on the safe side.\\
100 fics after that are Explicit. There is at least one good no-pairing fic there (/Charred Paws and Heavy Coils/), but the rest seems to be smut, so exclude that as well.

For a purer experience, Exclude Crossovers (More Options) and, if you prefer, Fantastic Beasts (under Fandoms).

I'm only seeing friendship tags and background relationships after all that.

** I'm not that involved with ao3 but from what I know you could search ''no pairing'' at [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search][this]] or at the ''Other tags to include'' in the filter section in the right at the screen in desktop mode if you want a specific tag.

Another solution is removing every possible pairing in the exclude section>relationships and/or with ''Other tags to exclude''.
