Does anyone know of any romantic or drama fics about Lily/James post-Hogwarts or the whole group post-Hogwarts. Ideally, something set between graduation and Harry's birth, but I'll take what I can find.

I know of a few oneshots, but I'm hoping for something longer.


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]] is set right after Harry's birth, while James and Lily are in Godric's Hollow. I'm never read J/L but it's one of my favorite oneshots! It's pretty long as far as oneshots go.

I've read the first 2 parts, and its really good. Not really focused on romance (its mainly general, so like the original series) like other L/J fics, but its worth a read. The author do require you to friend her to be able to read the rest, and she doesn't check up on it very often, so it'll take a while for her to friend you back (I friended her on Feb this year, posted a comment on March 1st, and she friended me yesterday). Its a collection of oneshots in the same universe. She posted it on fanfiction.net a long time ago as Annie789, but she took it down and moved in here, so you may have stumbled upon it. Its about 90% finished as stated by her

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3325624/1/The-Age-of-Inertia][The Age of Inertia]] is a really good hidden treasure. It's written from Lily's POV about how she became a spy for the Order. She is also reflecting on her life and how she got this deep in a war. SO GOOD. It has the makings of a heartbreaking story about love and dying. She hasn't updated in awhile, though. Hoping to get her some more love so she'll continue.

** Do you mind some Remus/Sirius in there? I know of a ton of great fics but they tend to skew that way.

I just stumbled upon this gem, and woah.

Slight AU, Lily is 5 years younger than James, and James is the DADA teacher. Set in Lily's 7th year, canon-compatible, very slight !hot-for-teacher, main plot is about the original rise of Voldemort, and the author actually knows how to balance drama and plot instead of beating a dead horse over and over again.
