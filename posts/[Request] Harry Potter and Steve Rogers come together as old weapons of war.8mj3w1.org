** Are you looking for a specific fic? If not, do you have any other specifications like pairings (slash or no slash, or would you prefer gen?) and if Harry travelled to the Marvel universe or if they're combined?

I'll look through my various favourite lists to see what I can find, but it might take a while. The prompt does ring a bell but I'm having difficulty figuring out which fic(s) I'm remembering.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

***** I've been meaning to read Wand and Shield, and I've never heard of Crestfallen, so thank you for the suggestions! I started reading fanfiction (esp of the crossover variety) pretty recently, so I don't have the most original library to share; these are mostly from the top hits in the catagory:

I vaguely remember Mischief Managed by fringeperson being good. linkffn(10716582)

There's also Finding Home (plus a few one shots in the same universe) by cywsaphyre. linkffn(8148717)

I've heard good things about Harry Potter and the aftermath by CJaMes12, but haven't gotten around to reading it. linkffn(8282970)

An author by the name of Whispering Darkness has some amusing short crossovers on both ffn and ao3.

Also on ao3 there's linkao3(Spellist by esama) which isn't terribly in character, but it's fun. Gen but with an implied Harry/Agent Coulson pairing.

Finally, linkffn(8897431) Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewelyn. It and its sequel, Ghosts of the Past, are both over 500k, and the latter is ongoing. I haven't read this one either but it comes highly recommended.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** Sorry, my favourites and bookmarks had fewer hp/mcu crossovers than I expected. The closest thing I could find was linkffn(Fly by Whispering Darkness) in which Harry has a magical creature animagus form, SHIELD takes interest in it, and Griffin!Harry and Steve bond with each other right away. The beginning is heavy on the angst, what with the depression and ptsd, and I'm not a huge fan of the repetetive POV switching, but this does match your request.

The other Harry & Cap scenes I'm remembering are probably buried in several novel-length fics in my list, and I'm not sure which. It's also highly likely I didn't save them anywhere. Sorry, I'll keep looking!

  Harry fled his past, flew away from the shadows that still haunted him. Steve had his own futuristic foes to battle. And even Fury wasn't sure how to go about debriefing a supposed mythical creature. Rated for Fury's coarse language.
