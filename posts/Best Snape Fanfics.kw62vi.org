I'm thinking of writing my own fanfiction, and one of the main characters will be Snape. I'm looking for well written fanfiction about him. Can be good or bad. Just trying to get a feel of the character more before writing him.


** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]])

If you haven't read that, Harry is obsessed with potions and scrounges you every spare moment with Snape he can, even though Snape is still a total dickhead. Has a really good Voldemort too. And the best Draco I've seen yet. But my favorite Snape scenes are:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    “Are you poisoning Professor Lupin?”

    Snape's lip curled. “If only, Potter. If only.”

    This was not particularly reassuring. Harry hesitated, then plowed on.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

and on the subject of trewlaney:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    ”I avoid her,” Snape said evenly. “Whenever I remember she exists, I have a powerful urge to kill her.”

    As Professor Snape seemed entirely serious, Harry decided to never, ever bring up his divination professor again. He didn't really want to be the one who tipped Professor Snape over the edge.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Harry thinks it's so offhand at first, just Snape being a typical grumpy asshole to his idiot coworker, but then you remember that she was the one who gave the prophecy and you're like ohhhhhh shittttt. I hadn't even considered what it must have been like for him to live in the same area as her.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** The correct answer to this is linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) Or any work by Flamethrower.

They fix Snape. Give him motivation and a personality and actual Slytherin qualities. They make him funny and fierce and possessive and clever and brave.

It's all brilliant.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Your best bet might depend on what part of the timeline you are writing, and how you need to address his insecurities for that part of his life. Is this a Marauder-era Snape dealing with his path toward becoming a Death Eater? Series years trying to balance his double-agent roles? Post-war romance/mystery/comedy? Decades change a person, and Snape has been through some serious shit, so think about that for sure.

Ever since I read it, I've been recommending all writers who want to get into Snape's head should find a library copy or cough up the 5 bucks to get [[https://www.amazon.com/Snape-Definitive-Reading-Lorrie-Kim-ebook/dp/B01I04EMK6/][Snape: A Definitive Reading]]. Many of my own fics are post-war EWE but otherwise canon-compliant and this analysis has helped me significantly to keep him in character.

That said, he's the mysterious magical spy, so if you can find /any/ shred of canon evidence for the behavior you want to give him, or even a halfway decent explanation for why the canon behavior is not his /true self/, then you can probably make it work!

Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][all of my fics are Snapefics]] if you care to take a look.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
