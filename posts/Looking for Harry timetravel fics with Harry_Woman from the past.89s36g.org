Are there any stories where Harry travels to the past for whatever reason (voluntary or unvoluntary), falls in love with someone there and stays in the past. NO RETURN TO THE PRESENT/FUTURE.

Obviously no slash and please no "Snape is a good guy" kind of fics. Stories like "What's a little Death between friend" would be alright as well (Harry/love interest from the present/women from the past).

  Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope

**** Skip the first one, and the first ~half of the second one. It gets really good once you get to the past. My only gripe is that the last two chapters gave a lot attention to Snape, while kinda forgetting about Andromeda getting knocked up (we have to tell grandfather soon, but let's fast forward a couple weeks after some Snape plot).

**** I don't quite remember the first part, but it gets more interesting. My only warning is that Harry is overpowered and it's heavy on lords and Blacks. Otherwise it's enjoyable.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** But the author uses the word 'sigh' a lot, I mean every other paragraph, every characters 'sighs' before saying something and 'sighs' again. Again Harry forgets what he is for and guess what? goes to show how awesome a seeker he is. After sometime i felt like the characters are monotonic who 'sighs' a lot. like they are weary and want to be somewhere else.

**** Well, English is not my first or even second language so I might not notice these things, also I kind of skip through the text a lot:) but I did get a feeling that the story is written in a slightly monotonous way and that it drags in some places and gets a bit repetitive. Nevertheless I think it is interesting, and better than 90% of the fics that are updated these days.

******** Canon Harry and Ginny (not the main character from Delenda Est) gets dragged over to the DE dimension by Harry and Bellatrix's triplets to save their life from two Voldemorts. Adult Harry and Bella prepare for war both in home and ~canon dimension, with the Order of the Phoenix not liking that they're taking orders from /Bellatrix/. Likely abandoned right when it looks like it was getting interesting

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
