I've been hunting for a quality fic based during the first conflict with Voldemort (aka the 1970s). There is so much potential for a fic in this time period and yet there has been bugger all that I have found to be enjoyable. Any suggestions? Anything well written will do at this point.

Barring that, if you could find a fic from the perspective of any Death Eater or Order member from this time period, who would you like to be, even if they're a blank slate.


** So the First War interests me a lot because it lasted such a long time in comparison to the Second War. You've basically got an entire decade of conflict, plus the preceding years during which Voldemort was gathering followers and strength. In contrast, in the Second War, Voldemort was able to take over the Ministry in a couple of years. I feel like a reasonable conclusion to draw from this is that the Ministry was much stronger in the First War than it was in the Second.

I therefore like to split the First War into three stages:

1. Gathering strength,

2. Weakening the opposition,

3. Making a coup attempt.

The first stage took place in the 1950s and 1960s. It primarily consisted of Voldemort making his horcruxes, gathering the Death Eaters, and making alliances with creatures.

The second stage would have taken most of the 1970s. We know Voldemort's MO: he kills or captures people who oppose him, which generally serves one of two purposes: either he is attempting to weaken the Ministry to enable a coup (e.g. Amelia Bones), or kill off potential threats to his power (e.g. Order members, Harry Potter).

Now, one thing which is striking about the Harry Potter universe is the wide gap in talent between wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore and "normal" wizards. And by "normal" I don't mean average -- I mean wizards like Aurors, who are extremely talented relative to the average wizard, but still little more than playthings for Dumbledore and Voldemort.

In considering that "talent gap" in combination with the reduced strength of the Ministry, I wonder if perhaps the talent gap is artificial. The idea is that there used to be a body of powerful wizards who existed on a continuum between "normal" wizards and Voldemort, with some of them able to put up a reasonable fight against Voldemort. It was the existence of these powerful wizards which prevented Voldemort from taking the Ministry with ease the first time around, and it was their absence which made it so easy to take the Ministry in the Second War -- the groundwork is essentially still in place from the First War, because it takes more than 10 years to replenish several generations of talent.

So the early years of the second stage would essentially be Voldemort seeking out potential threats to his power and killing them. We know that Voldemort was feared globally, so I don't see him restricting himself to Britain in this regard. At first, these deaths would appear unconnected - they would seem like natural deaths, or freak accidents, with the odd unexplained murder here or there. But as the years go by, the world's magical governments begin to connect the dots, and the press begins reporting on a mysterious serial killer who seeks out powerful wizards to kill.

It would only be once Voldemort is satisfied in the security of his power (i.e. all potential threats that can be killed, have been killed) that he would reveal himself to the world at large, at which point he would make his move on the Ministry. By that time it would be too late for anyone to stop him, because all the powerful wizards would be dead.

I picture this plan as having been disrupted by Dumbledore, who would have suspected Tom Riddle's hand in all these deaths at an early stage. He will have founded the Order with the intention of gathering evidence to present to the Ministry that the serial killer is Tom Riddle aka Lord Voldemort, thereby exposing Voldemort before he was ready. The Order would also seek to protect potential victims and identify those who might be assisting Voldemort.

Ultimately, I see the Order as being successful in this task (you have to give the good guys /some/ victories!) but nonetheless the Ministry has been considerably weakened by the time they realise that this person is not just a serial killer, but seeks to take over the government. It is at this point that the war transitions to stage 3, Voldemort's active attempts to take control of magical society.

*** I just wanna point out/congratulate that your theory is maybe the only theory I've ever seen to explain what Voldemort was actually up to for so long between graduation and becoming public. Ties together so many threads: the gap between Voldemort/Dumbledore and everyone else, the fear people have for him, etc.

*** It's certainly true that the contest was much tighter and thus more drawn out during the FWW (First Wizarding War) when compared to the SWW.

I've had several plot bunnies stemming from the desire to have first-hand accounts of Voldemort's rise to power, centring around a few characters that I feel would be interesting protagonists. I just wish someone had already put pen to paper on a fic on this.

Even what you label as the “second stage” provides so much potential material if one is keen enough. Delving into other magical cultures and superpowers (in magical terms individuals of course), as well as getting inside the heads of those who Voldemort sees as a threat in any way, shape, or form.

Is there anyone that strikes you as an interesting viewpoint for all of the above?

**** Arguably Mad-Eye Moody would be a good point of view. He was clearly someone significant in the war, constantly in the thick of the struggle. He would have been close to both the Ministry and Dumbledore, so he gives an insider (but skeptical) point-of-view on both situations and approaches.

**** One option would be using the Ministers for Magic during that time period. Perhaps have whispers of darkness the 50s and 60s of Taure's timeline reach Minister Tuft in the 50s, only to be dismissed as fear mongering in a time of peace and prosperity; perhaps even have her death in 1959 to be of a cause other than allergy as described in Pottermore. Minister Nobby Leach hears the same thing, but dies before anything comes about (per Pottermore, he died after contracting a "mysterious illness").

The next two canonical ministers were Eugenia Jenkins and Harold Minchum who could do nothing to stop, what had become, Lord Voldemort's inexorable march.

Unrelatedly and interestingly, muggleborn Nobby Leach's election is an interesting bit of argument against the institutionalized racism against the muggleborn in a lot of fanon - at least during the time period of the books.

***** I have always seen Death Eaters as a bit of a reactionary movement to changing times, so the wizarding world was starting to get more progressive and elitist purebloods weren't having it.

** I don't know of any long fics set during the first war, all I have are oneshots.

Linkffn(9093619) deals with a skirmish during the first war from Moody's POV. Is more of a character study than anything.

Linkffn(Speak Softly, Love by Silens Cursor) is about Antonin Dolohov choice to join Voldemort. It is meant as a companion price to the author other work Renegade Cause, I am not entirely sure how well it holds up on it's own.

Linkffn(The Pillars of Power by SeriousScribble) follows Cygnus Blacks POV on the causes and his attempts to stop the first war. Definitely a unique perspective compared to most fics,. I am not usually a huge fan of Lord's being a part of the political process, but this fic makes it work.

Linkffn(11936538) is about the aftermath of the first war and Lucius's political dealings to stay out of Azkaban.

** I'd like to see Lupin as the POV character of the war. I just love his character and would love to see more of him.

Otherwise, other Order members that were involved directly in the action would be interesting.
