** That means Harry was not the BWL. You can find that theme in extreme AU, alternate dimensions/realities, and time travels to before Harry's time.

In *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), he remained pretty obscure until he drew MoM's attention for using magic (lots of Fiendfyre) in the Anglo-Spanish war.

In *Murder Most Horrid*, linkffn(10099028), there was no Voldemort, and Harry was only a minor character. Some of the canon bad guys were still bad, but many others were not.

In *The World As We Knew It*, linkffn(3571753), the prophecy didn't exist, and its Harry was a very mediocre student.

In *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), Harry didn't exist at all in that world, and Neville was the BWL.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), Harry physically turned up in year 1975 and had to reestablish a new identity, with Bellatrix's help.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

*** I'd like to see a non famous bwl story. Like, either Dumbledore takes the credit, or actually did save him, or believes that he did, or everyone believes Lily and James saved the day while losing their lives in the process, and never realised that Harry even faced the AK. So obviously, there's a little bit of "you're Lily and James' son", but not that much attention. Because no one knew about the prophecy, so no one would assume the child was the reason, except Dumbledore, and the scar...well, the house was collapsing due to dark magic, it's not unreasonable.

***** Ok, well you read the recommended fics, and let me know if they're any good ;-)

I am enjoying the world as we knew it one, despite having avoided it previously. But Harry himself hadn't been raised not famous, so doesn't count. I think once third year came around, and he started hearing Lily scream, the puzzle pieces slowly connecting would be interesting, especially if Dumbledore truly didn't realize Harry had survived the attack.

  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
