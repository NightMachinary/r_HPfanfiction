I'm looking for good fanfictions that basically reimagine, are a rewriting, are inspired, correct or revolutionise the plot of cursed child. Thank you


** I don't often self-promote on here, it rarely ends well. But as it happens I have written exactly that. I don't know if it's what you had in mind and you'll have to judge the quality for yourself.

  Travelling through Time in pursuit of an unstable Time-Turner made of spare parts should be all in a day's work for Head Auror Harry Potter; it's just what he needs to distract himself from his administrative backlog. But things don't go according to plan. Or perhaps the plan isn't what he thought it was. It's a whole new adventure and Time is of the essence.

** I think the only real way how to deal with that thing is just to forget it ever happened. As [[/u/Philami]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4nc1hj/spoilers_cursed_child_megathread_part_2/d45ruh6/][here on Reddit]] said it “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, the people who watched [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child].”

However, if you have some obsession with fixing that, I liked [[https://youtu.be/TSQJ9W4SxiQ][this suggestion]].

** Not really a fanfic, but this YouTuber made two video essays about what when wrong and how he would try to fix it, and I think there's even an amateur play inspired by his video. [[https://youtu.be/rq-9BnHPjsY][1]] [[https://youtu.be/TSQJ9W4SxiQ][2]]
