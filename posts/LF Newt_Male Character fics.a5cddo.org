  Anon tumblr prompt: Crewt, scarmapping, body worship, body positivity.Credence adapts to all things, just slowly. But now..why is Newt going around half naked? and why is Credence doing it too? There is no propriety in this magic suitcase is there. But Newt misunderstands Credence's modesty, even if he means well, but he makes up for his assumption by offering Credence the greatest gift of his life.

** It's a bit timey whimey and a Newt/Harry pairing but I do love Against My Nature. It hasn't had an update in a while, but what's there is good and set prior to Newt getting to New York in the first Fantastic Beasts movie. linkffn(12296472)

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
