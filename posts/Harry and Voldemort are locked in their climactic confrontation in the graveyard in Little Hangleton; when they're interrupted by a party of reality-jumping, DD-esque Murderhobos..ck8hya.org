** I gave it a shot. It turned out longer than my usual attempts at writing fanfic.

--------------

The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. ... /Let the police come,/ he thought desperately ... /anyone/ ... /anything/ ...

Voldemort just carried on torturing Avery, while, unnoticed by any of the people in the cemetery, a spark lifted off Harry's body and slipped sideways through reality, weaving between the planes - a little packet of desperation, carrying a simple message: /help me/.

In a million worlds, that spark would gutter out before reaching anyone both capable and willing to give its sender succor. In a million worlds, a traumatized child would have to face the darkest wizard of his country, alone and surrounded by enemies.

One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort's wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve ... but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light back into Voldemort's wand.

Slowly, very slowly, it moved along the golden thread. It trembled for a moment, but then stopped moving, as if stuck. Voldemort's face was beaded with sweat, but then he smiled a cruel smile, and the bead of light started moving back towards Harry.

He concentrated even more, and the bead slowed down to a crawl, but his head was pounding and his hope dwindling, when another light appeared as if from nowhere, slamming into the bead and forcing it to make contact.

At once, Voldemort's wand began to emit echoing screams of pain, and then - Voldemort's red eyes widened in shock - something started to emerge from the tip of his wand. It was a head, then a chest and arms, and then a whole body.

The figure fell on the ground, panting, and as it rose Harry let out a gasp of surprise. It was a woman, but a woman wearing the weirdest outfit Harry ever saw, for all that he was familiar with wizard fashion. She had an helmet on, and a breastplate, and she carried a sword and a shield, all shining silver in the magelight.

If Voldemort's eyes could have widened more, they would have, because she was not the only uninvited guest to his party. Four more figures emerged from his wand, all four distinctive in their own way. One was hooded, carrying a sword and a bow; the head of the other was bared, his hair shaved, and he was unarmed. One had garishly coloured clothing, and was carrying a lute, while the other was dressed in pelts and holding a staff.

"-re we there yet?", said the one in gaudy clothing, promptly making the other four turn to glare at him. "Ok, ok, geeze! Calm down, live a little!", he said, raising his hands in mock surrender.

He strode to the middle of the clearing, and looked around, wrinkling his nose a bit, but then smiled. "Nice place. A bit drab, but very traditional. J'approve!", he said, turning towards Voldemort to give him a thumbs-up.

That seemed to shake him out of his stupor, and the surprised look on his face was quickly replaced by an angry one.

"Who are you?", he demanded.

The others turned to face him. "We are adventurers," said the woman in armour, "traveling from world to world to right wrongs and to carry out just-"

"To kill people and to steal their loot!"

There was a clank as her gauntleted hand struck her helmet. "Would it kill you to just shut up for a minute, Bard?"

"Touchy, touchy!", he said, in a singsong voice. "But, what she said."

Voldemort's right eye had started to twitch, Harry forgotten. He started to inch away, towards the Portkey and Cedric's fallen body.

"/Who are you? Answer me! Imperio!/"

The Imperius curse flew towards the woman but, before it could strike her, the bald man was standing in front of her. The curse struck him, but he didn't even blink, shrugging its effects away like water off a duck's back.

In an instant, the group was combat-ready. The bald man's fists were raised, as was the woman's sword. The woman in pelts started chanting something, and, even if the hooded person from before had somehow disappeared, they were clearly still around, as the arrow flying out of the darkness proved.

Voldemort's reflexes were fast, but not quite quick enough, and the arrow struck him in his arm. He touched the wound, dumbstruck, but his face quickly became a rictus of rage as he felt the blood dripping over his fingers.

"/You dare?/"

"Oh, he's a touchy one, too!"

"/Shut up, Bard, and be useful for once!/"

"Oh, very well.", he said, unslinging the lute from his shoulder.

"One, two, three, four - /up in space, their ships go boom, in a pyrotechnic doom; on the ground, no hope is found, as they die in burning mounds/"

Harry's hand grasped one of the handles of the Triwizard Cup, and he knew no more.
