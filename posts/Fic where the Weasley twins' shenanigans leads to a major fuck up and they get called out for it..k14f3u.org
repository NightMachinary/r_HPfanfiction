Maybe they are guarding a weakened Voldemort, who is playing to their sense of mischief and he escapes. Maybe one of their inventions actually kills or seriously hurts somebody. I am not really looking for a bashing fic but one that shows that their dicking around can have serious consequences and that their jokes are not always rightly timed (I found their name switching before the battle of the seven Potters completely poorly timed for example).


** linkffn(Shattered by Dreamfall). It doesn't get worse than this.

  After losing Ron in the final battle, Hermione has tried to go on with her life. Until a prank gone wrong makes it all feel useless- like his death was in vain and there is nothing left to live for. Probably a one shot.

** Closest I've seen was in chapter 49 of Prince of Slytherin linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/49/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) where Ron calls them out, and chapter 8 of Burning of Bridges linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13279982/8/Harry-Potter-and-the-Burning-of-Bridges]]).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.
