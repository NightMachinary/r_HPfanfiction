:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Edit: found! Linked below.

At some point all the teachers must rush to help Harry (he's in the hospital wing with serious injury?) and the sentence went something along the lines of 'Dumbledore hiked up his robes to reveal muggle trainers and moved with surprising speed for a man his age'. This is a long shot but I'm hoping someone here can give me some guidance or at least let me know if you remember this?

Or anything else about it that I might be able to use to find it?

(I think it was a severitus/sevitus fic but honestly I have no idea for sure.)


** try google variants of that phrase with 'site:reddit.com', 'site:fanfiction.net', and 'site:archiveofourown.org' - without the quotes attached to the end of it. It'll search that site specifically for instances of that phrase, or whatever is the closest it can find. If you put the phrase in speech marks like "Dumbledore hiked up his robes etc" then it'll look for that phrase specifically. Otherwise it'll just look for similarities.

*** I've been trying but regrettably can't find much. Not to mention Ao3 doesn't show fic summaries in google so I'm having to go onto each page to check which is slow going.

But I'll keep on trying!

** Well this oddly enough rang a bell for me. It's Harry's New Home by kbinnz. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1577900/?a=fa][Link]]

/Chapter 30:/ *Who would have thought that under those ridiculous-looking, headache-inducing fluorescent robes the old coot wore running shoes?*

Context is that Harry and crew are trying to find out what's under the defense professor's turban via sticky charm prank, but surprises, Voldemort ensues. Wards go off from dark magic, so while trio fights the dark lord, teachers run to their aide.
