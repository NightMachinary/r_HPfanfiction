JK Rowling intended for hermione to have a little sister . Are there any fics where that does happen (everything being canon)


** There are few where she finds out having a sister (mostly adopted) when finding her parents in Australia post-war.

- “Breakfast In New York by Radaslab” linkffn(5141159)

I certainly forgot couple of these.

+I know JKR somewhere said, that she planned for her to have a horrible Slytherin sister (Mafalda?), but I don't recall any fanfiction story which would run with this idea.+ (Mafalda was supposed to be Prewett, a daughter of the accountant Squib cousin of Weasleys).

  Hermione goes to Australia to bring her parent home and gets a big surprise. It turns out her Memory Charm wasn't enough to fill the hole in their lives. Now, she has a new sister who will be starting at Hogwarts as she returns for her seventh year and deals with the aftermath of the war. Epilogue-compliant.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

  She doesn't know the world, or herself, but she'll always know the boy who meets her in a washed-out King's Cross Station. Even when he starts coming to her in pieces.
