** You probably won't get a huge response from here, but I like this ship, so I'll share mine (with the caveat that I have not read a huge number of these yet, so can't vouch for their quality):

- Until Proven by tiranog: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1825321]])

- Nocturne by tiranog: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1825051]])

- Chryssalis by starcrossedgirl: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714]])

- The Apple Tree by Philo: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4241040]]) - I think I'm one of the very few people who don't really like this story, but give it a try since it's hugely popular. I just don't buy the idiot!Dumbledore thing, and some of the dialog seems stilted and unrealistic, enough that it jars me from the reading experience. Might give it a third attempt though, since I'm a sucker for a long story.

- The Boy Who Died a Lot by starcrossedgirl: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]])

- For Auld Lang Syne by Cybele: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/34560]]) - This one was great and refreshing; one of the first fics I read when I started reading HP fanfiction again after a long hiatus. This has an OC in it who I not only came to like but sympathize for, which is rare in fanfic.

- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?action=seriesby&uid=53][If You are Prepared by Cybele]]: An oldie, but goodie. Very good. One of the best Snapes, and a heart-breaking story. Give it a chance even if first-person POV isn't your thing; it's done well here.

- When Love Calls by mk_malfoy: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1148]])

- Cambiare Podentes by Jordan Grand: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/39333]]) - Also a super-popular story, and I liked it as well. I have some issues with how Snape is characterized but overall it's a solid story, especially for a trope I usually shy away from.

- [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11820&PHPSESSID=11fb28ca3f68d06047b2d10702586f50][Everybody's Fool by Cluegirl]]

- Calligraphy has a sparse style of writing that lends itself well to writing this pair. Check out [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11420][The Fourth Year]] and [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5658][So Lonely Without Me]].

- [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=564][Death Eater Takes a Holiday by Lee Lee Potter]]

- Gray Skye Mourning by KneazleGriff: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315797/1/Gray-Skye-Mourning]])

- A Brave New World Cithara: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5653847]])

- In This World for You by SnapesFavorite: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2522479]])

- [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=25627][Nights of Gethsemane by starcrossed]]

Some stories have been taken down. All by an author known as RaeWhit, for example. She wrote a bunch of stuff; I have all (or most) of her stories if you want them. Telanu's Tea Series is another classic that's been taken down. I have a copy of that as well.

The very first Snarry I read was [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7364728/1][Homecoming of the Soul]] by Slumbering Potion. I thought it was actually pretty good and it's one of the more realistic relationship building Snarry fics I've read.
