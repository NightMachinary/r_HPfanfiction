:END:
Hermione is raised as James Potters sister and there's a ritual where she's recognized as Gordon Gryffindor's descendant and Lily is Salazar Slytherins? And Hermione also tells all the muggleborns that there's a way to trace your family lineage and see who their magical descendants are


** In MaryRoyale's Roundabout Destiny, Hermione ends up as James's twin sister and Lily turns out to have some magical heritage. But Hermione isn't Gryffindor's descendant and Lily isn't Slytherin's, so I'm not sure if that is the right story. linkffn(8311387)

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU. Nominated for Best James Potter and Best Peter Pettigrew in the 2018 Marauder Medals!
