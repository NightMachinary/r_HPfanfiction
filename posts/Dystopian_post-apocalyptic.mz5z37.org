So....Anyone can rec any fics with a dystopian/post-apocalyptic AU? A good example of what i am looking for is linkffn(13047893). A competent Harry that survives interacts and has character. I would prefer no romance and completed fics.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, then the war. Harry now guides the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. Canon loyal, not dark. Adventure, not angst.

** I loved Beyond The Curtain by Bobicka. He has a femHarry in LOTR story going now which is pretty good.

Now back to your request, I unfortunately havnt found many great dystopian fics, but I did start one of my own.

The premise was that Grindelwald and Dumbledore's duel was so great and powerful that it was witnessed and recorded by muggles. Muggles who were nearing the end of WW2 and feared the wizards as weapons of the enemy. So, they interfered and killed both of them, then used the film and now widespread knowledge of magical kinds to stir up a McCarthy-an style witch hunt which eventually broke into open war.

In my fic, a canon-esque Harry stumbles his way into the dystopian world and gets rescued by the "Muggleborn" magical crews(havnt decided their name yet) who monitor for accidental magic from children and extract them before they are reported to an anti-magical(havnt figured their group's name) police force.

Now Harry is a fugitive in a new and devastated world. One that mostly dominated by paranoid and dangerous muggles. Now he has to navigate between two factions, the pureblood one that hides behind massive magical shields at a familiar Scottish Castle and is lead by a handsome and dangerous Tom Riddle. And the paranoid, fragmented, and hidden new blood one. The local leader of which is a witch with very similar eyes to him.

Well I didn't mean to get into so much detail, but writing it has been tough sledding. World building for dystopia requires a lot of work.

*** I would say it sounds interesting. Since I don't see a link i will assume that you are still writing at the moment. In that case i would suggest to read something like mortal engines by Phillip Reeve it would be good source of inspiration i think.

**** Yes, it is very much still a work in progress. I ran into a brick wall and had to go back and start planning and rethinking things. Not gonna be posted until I have a real plan for where to go and atleast half written.

I havnt read that, but I will add it to my list. Thanks.

** Linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) Technically counts if not in tone then in the apocalyptic premise. Harry is apparently the last wizard alive. Complete comedy with no major romance and very competent Harry. Would advice reading the Wikipedia pages for Firefly and Serenity for maximum comprehension.

Linkao3(Manacled) Very Dystopian Voldemort-Wins AU. Mind the warnings. Completed with romance as a central theme. Harry is dead.

Linkao3( Mi Aedijekit by local_doom_void ) Set a few centuries into Voldemort's rule. Very unique. Harry POV with tons of OC'S.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

  “Hush, Harry,” came Voldemort's soothing voice. “I shall take... such good care of you.”--“I desire our reunion sooner rather than later. Come back to me, and I will ensure that you are as utterly comfortable as I can make you. You may be assured that I will never rest my immortal body until I have you once again.”--“I did not intend to -- ”“You did so intend! Well? Will you finally stop moping now that the box was not-empty for a night?”“No,” Voldamort snarled. “This fixes nothing.”--A retrospective tale of language gaps, of untrustworthy memories, and of the culmination of a millennia long affair between a Dark Lord and a counterrevolutionary. -- (summary edited 2020.12.19)

** This one begins in a post-apocalyptic AU setting and then (minor spoiler) dumps the Harry and Teddy from that world into the canon world. Their magic has been irrevocably altered from where they come from, and Teddy in particular has no idea how to act in a "normal" setting. It doesn't perfectly fit what you're asking for, but it's got great worldbuilding and fantastic characterization (including some fun OCs) so I'm recommending it anyway!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680][*into the arena with your head held*]] *high by LullabyKnell:* Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
