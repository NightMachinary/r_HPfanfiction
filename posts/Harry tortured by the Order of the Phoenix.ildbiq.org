:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a long long time ago on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and can't stop thinking about it. I think it's a Harry joins Voldemort kinda fic. The order thinks that Harry has gone dark, and to remove that darkness they torture him. I think Arthur Weasley tortures harry and Hermione comes and tries a new torture curse she invented. All this torturing they do makes him join Voldemort. Atleast that's what I remember. Maybe I'm mixing different fics. Does anyone have any ideas as to which fic this is? Thanks in advance
