Hey Freak why did I

- get kidnapped by terrorists!?
- get roped into a murder inquiry!?

Harry's response is just yeah cool... wait what?


** I'm pretty sure this is basically canon, except nothing as drastic as kidnapping or murder, and Harry's response is to get locked in his cupboard

** I'd love to get a story where Dudley is going through some massive misadventure, with danger and plot and stuff, and the entire time he's peering around corners expecting to see harry. It doesn't even have to be anything magical, it's just him, paranoid, aggressive, and irrational. The clash when Harry finally comes back for the summer could be very fun.

** Things Dudley does keeps getting blamed on Harry but Dudley really wants the credit for it for once so he keeps doing more and more outlandish things in an effort to get his parents to stop attributing things he wants to be credited for to Harry.
