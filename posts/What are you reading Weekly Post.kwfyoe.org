** *The Second String by Eider_Down (Ao3)*

[[/u/jesterxgirl][u/jesterxgirl]] recommended linkao3(The Second String by Eider_down) to me last week and holy hell am I enjoying it!! No one spoil it on me I'm only on chapter 30.

I love a story with a good juicy plot and this has plot coming out the wazoo!!! There's secret vigilante group, pirates, a super messed up Voldemort, dramatic as shit magic, real world consiquences. 10/10 truly fantastic.

Harry ends up back in the 70s during the first war, but he doesn't do the "Find my Parents" trope. Instead he carved out his own life and friends and reasons to fight.

It's so well written. It's an entirely different plotline from canon but there's little canon parallels that are very clever. Harry has to battle the moral implications of knowing what he knows and how that translates to the world. Harrys inner monologue is hillarious!

Pls read. Good time 😊.

**** The slash is a slower build and while not a plot point /per se/ it is as integral to Harry's emotional stability as his other relationships with his mentor and his friends. It is treated as a relationship and not just as erotica

I read the FFN version, not the Ao3 version, but I don't recall it being any more explicit than non-lemon het stories I've read. There were a few steamy paragraphs with some fade to black scenes, but never in the middle of a battle or something. Always during downtime and character development.

** *Time Left Today by gzdacz*

linkao3(Time Left Today by gzdacz)

​

It's the summer after the first year and Harry killing Quirrel has a bit more repercussions than the non-issue it was in canon. Snape gets to drag Harry around the European continent without using magic in order not to trigger the trace, because the ministry wants to question Harry for the trial.

​

Harry doesn't know too much about that, he is busy figuring out how to act around this teacher who hates him, trying not get in trouble in much the same way he has learned how to navigate the moods of the Dursleys. Snape and Harry constantly misunderstand each other while they race from city to city in trains and buses. Harry is also delightfully eleven, as he sometimes occupies himself with imagining that Snape is his kidnapper and how he would escape, playing pretend like the kid he is. They are trying to figure each other out, learn sensitive secrets about and slowly develop trust.

​

It's from Snape's and Harry's POV, well written and also fun to think about Europe in 1992, with border controls, all the different currencies and the descriptions of all the different locations. The story is about two thirds finished, with new chapters every Wednesday and Saturday

** A really good one for anyone who appreciates the name of the wind. Also comparable to prince of a dark kingdom I guess? Writing is solid and the fantasy side is well done.

Harry has been raised outside the wizarding world by a Druid, but is now on his own. I won't spoil it any more. Seems to be on hiatus though.

Edit: If you like this one then perhaps you've also got time for perhaps one of the more interesting abandoned stories on FF (that's still looking for an author to take over). Try ‘out of the night' by raining ink. Amazing world building of a little strange to start!

** It was my birthday this past week, and I'll tell you that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples --- though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky! The closest thing to Ogden's that exists is Lagavulin (scotch). The first time I had it I had to lie down (luckily I was at home), and then go take a huge shit, and then I swore I'd never drink something so gross again... until two nights later when I realized I was craving it. It's so rich that it's overwhelming at times, while still being exceptionally smooth, and above all else smokier than you can believe. You feel like you're breathing fire after the first sip. If you put all scotches on a graph of richness by smokiness Lagavulin is all by itself in the top right corner. I drink 16 year old, but I hear the 8 year old is still excellent if you want Ogden's on a budget. 1/1, for sure. My favorite whisky that isn't made in Japan.

On to the fanfiction:

Just now I am reading the latest chapter of Manatee-vs-Walrus' post-DH epic Loose Cannon. I love this fic so much, even though the occasional chapter suffers from Perfect Hermione syndrome. The fic is funny most of the time and engaging all of the time, but my favorite moments are the bits that depict people (usually, but not always Harry) dealing with their emotional baggage, past traumas, current prejudices, and I'm sure a hundred other things I can't put into words right now. I love a fic with emotional weight (that isn't reliant on things like bad communication or frequent character death), and if you do too you should really be reading this. Best of all, a new chapter every Wednesday! Never fails to cheer me up after work. One of my top 5 fics for sure, a 1/1.

linkffn(13452914)

I also read a few HP/Star Wars fics this week:

Magic of the Force by Vimesenthusiast I did not finish. The fic got to a point where it felt like the plot was going nowhere, the writing wasn't great, and some of the jokes didn't really land for me. As an example, when young Harry meets Lily in the afterlife near the beginning of the story she's wearing the clothes she was wearing when she died, which is some kind of kinky skintight bondage suit. I think I was supposed to think it was funny, but like most of this fic it left me feeling nothing. I think SW is deceptively hard to write for. The more you slow down during a SW fic the worse it becomes. It's a universe full of adventure, and (speaking for myself) that means for a story to work it has to be much more high octane. I think more author's should remember the monomyth and try to cling to that. It's what every good SW movie did, and it'll guarantee you an ok fic, even if you aren't going to produce the next Citizen Kane. Back to the fic, I didn't finish it, so I have to say 0/1.

linkffn(11577249)

Similarly I did not finish In All Things Balance by ffdrake. The writing on this one was definitely better than Magic of the Force, but once Harry is sent to Hogwarts the story grinds to a halt. This ex-sith lady is trying to take over earth as step one to saving the galaxy from the sith/jedi conflict. She shouldn't be wasting time sending her adopted son Harry to hogwarts for seven years. Or if she does decide to do that, I'd rather the story stick with her and explore the interesting things she might be doing out in the world. Like I said, SW means excitement. You can't grind your story to a halt in SW. The Havoc Side of the Force (a great story that I enjoyed very much) dies right after Harry establishes a base for himself and stops adventuring, I think for this exact reason. In SW you have to keep moving, and In All Things Balance didn't. I hope that if you can put up with the middle part it picks up later, but I'm not so hard up for things to read that I'll suffer through a slog hoping it gets better, and I've read Wheel of Time, all of it, back when it ended on Crossroads of Twilight, so I know slogs! 0/1

linkffn(11759933)

What's A Gungan? by mjimeyg on the other hand was excellent. Dotted with the occasional funny criticism of the prequels (read the first 100 words and you'll see what I mean), but more than that just telling a pretty good story at a brisk enough pace to feel Star Wars-y. The last few chapters felt a bit rushed, but better that than 20 chapters about Harry learning to use a lightsaber or whatever nonsense the author could have stuck in there. A solid 1/1, well worth reading.

linkffn(13569941)

Also by mjimeyg, I read Family - It's in the Blood, and while the title had me yearning for a Harry Potter/Hades crossover, I was not disappointed by what was there. Just a fun little one shot where Astoria Greengrass teaches Harry the importance of family. It was cute and fluffy, but sometimes that's what you want. This is a 1/1 too.

** I started reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28719780/chapters/70416402][Harry Potter and the Act of Moving Forward]] by thehonorablewangfire on ao3. Rated M. There's only 8 chapters so far, but it's pretty good. It's an H/Hr re-write of Deathly Hallows. So the events are familiar, but with some notable differences from canon. I really enjoy the characterizations, they seem very accurate to the book portrayals in most cases. There is a little bit of smart!Harry, but it's mostly explained as him being more proactive in the Horcrux hunt than him being over-intelligent. Definitely worth the read, and worth keeping up with as it progresses.

** I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle,]] which I have been putting off because the series is just so long (1.1mil words so far). The story is set in America, with a cast entirely made of OCs, post-HP canon. Yes, it's well written, creative, has great world building... but at least in the first book, being Alexandra Quick really sucked. Wildly unfair treatment from adults (though there's a reason) and from her peers as well. Enough that I'm wary of continuing the series. To contrast with Harry Potter, he had to deal with a lot of crap, but he also got to be a quidditch star, and gifted magical artifacts, and his adventures repeatedly won Gryffindor the house cup... Whereas Alexandra gets months of detention, murder attempts, government scrutiny, bullying, and... basically nothing good to balance all that (yes, she got to attend a magical school, but even a pretty bad public school would probably have been more enjoyable, and far safer).

So, for those who have read further, does it get better, or does being Alexandra Quick continue to be suffering?

** *Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire by Coulsdon_Eagle*

Recently completed. Not exactly a revolutionary plot: Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet instead of Harry's. Pairing is Harry/Hermione. The writing, however, is great.

Some characters act a bit more extreme than they did in canon; the abuse Harry suffers before the first task is a bit escalated against Hermione. That put me on edge at first, because a couple of times it verges on bashing, but it never really goes that far.

A very competently written, entertaining fic. Nothing life-changing, but well worth the read.

It's the first H/Hr fic that I found to develop the relationship in a convincing way, with them becoming closer - but nothing romantic for quite a while - as a result of Harry remaining loyal when Hermione is entered in the Tournament.

Also, Hermione wears less plot armour than canon Harry did, getting hurt much worse in the Tasks.

** After getting pretty far into it, I abandoned 'A Marauder's Plan' even though the writing quality is excellent and it is really good. I did skip to see how it ended though. Anyway there are a lot of elements that weren't *my* thing like Lord Black/family magic/Harmione, and I think Harry was kind of a Gary Sue in this. That I think was what was one of the most off-putting parts-part of why Harry is likable and the everyman (sort of) is that he is the main character that he is flawed and not good at everything. Sirius's portrayal is really good. I *would* recommend it to others-just because I couldn't stick with it doesn't mean others won't like it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]

I also read "Drag Me over the Rainbow," the same author as "The Letter." It's a fun read I guess. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12054989/1/Drag-Me-Over-The-Rainbow]]. It has a lot of Harry and Sirius but a Remus/Tonks pairing, some of which I skimmed over because I get bored with canon ships and don't like Tonks that much. Idk why-she can change her hair but she's just not that interesting to me. Sirius is entertaining in this but the most amusing parts (to me) are when Ted Tonks adopts Buckbeak, although that is a tiny portion of it.

Now I'll peruse this sub for my next read.

Yeah, that kind of thing is why I keep coming back to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] when I want a Sirius-raises-Harry fic; no Black family magic, no Sues, just Harry getting a flawed-but-sincere parental figure, and the ripples that result. It does have (eventual) Remus/Tonks, but much more developed than canon. No pairing for Harry as yet, partly because it's only reached fourth year, but there's quite an interesting fake dating subplot during the Tournament.

I think I did start reading A Marauder's Plan, but stopped earlier because of the issues you mentioned.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13189098/1/]]

Harry is a gentleman thief after not growing up at the Dursleys. A delightful read that jumps around locations in Europe and beyond, yet does not completely give up on Voldemort being around. Hermione also features, having attended Beaubatons because the Troll incident ended differently. Features impressive magic (including a massive duel with Flitwick in the latest chapter), fun little subplots and good humour at appropriate moments. All of it is wrapped up in excellent writing and I genuinely think this should be far more popular than it is. Give it a read for something a bit different than the usual!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5061224/1/A-Looping-of-the-Scales]]

This fic is really well done and probably one of my favourite stories. It is really well developed and a unique adventure story. In a potions experiment gone wrong, Snape becomes young Snape while at school with Harry, Hermione, and Ron. What would Snape's life look like if he went to school after the fall of the Dark Lord? It is very well written and one of the best young Snape fanfics even if you don't like the pairing.

** Dear lord is this list long! Ok let me get my thoughts together.

Linkao3(The Darkening of Your Soul)

Tomarry because even though I've never liked the ship, I read a really good fic that everyone was going on about in the thread and now I'm obsessed with it.

I don't like bashing of any kind and this has some Dumbledore bashing but I like Kreacher so I recommend.

Linkao3(Heir Apparent)

Yea just yea. Again tomarry.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Greatest Show)

I think this is tomarry? Blatant wish fulfilment but I'm a Lucius Malfoy fan so I'm all over it.

All these fics have a theme...you see what I've been craving? I'm starting another fic very similar to these right now.

Linkao3(Nothing Between the Ears)

Severus/Lockhart. Yes.

Linkao3(How Fred And George Accidentally Befriended a Wannabe Dark Lord)

Reminds me of the fic where Ron does dark magic. In fact let me link that fic. No pairings for either.

Linkao3(How to Succeed in Dark Wizardry (Without Really Trying))

More fics....

Linkao3(The Tragedy Of Titus Andronicus)

No pairing

Linkao3(Resurrect The Living)

Tomarry

Linkao3(The Devil You Know)

No pairing

Linkao3(Falling Higher)

Lucius/Voldemort. A classic I read as it was written and occasionally reread.

Linkao3(The Merry Men and Women of the Forbidden Forest)

Lucius/Narcissa, Harry/Ginny, I think Ron/Hermione, Draco/Luna and what can be read as either Severus/Albus Dumbledore or Sirius having a crush on Severus. The last two are not tagged and are my interpretation.

Also one of my favs to reread.

Linkao3(How I Met Your Mother with Lucius Malfoy)

Lucissa.

And that's it because I'm tired of typing

No

With no where else to turn, the sixteen year old prefect does the unimaginable, and soon Ron Weasley is no more. Well, that's what Tom's aiming for. The kid is a pain to manipulate.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

** This story happened after the second wizarding war in which not many has explored. It's nice to know the aftermath of the battle and how Harry copes up with all the deaths and pains he has endured especially after becoming a Horcrux. It has a unique twist/plot and would certainly make you cry. It's really worth a read.

Title: A Horcrux's Fate

Rating: Teen and Up

Synopsis: (COMPLETE) Harry Potter triumphed over the final battle against Lord Voldemort, but just as everything appears peaceful, he soon realized that it isn't over as it seemed. Something deep inside him feels wounded and is drastically withering away---a sign that his life is in grave danger. The truth of being a Horcrux will set off a chain of events that'll test his strength and will to survive. But the question is, how far will Harry have to go before he accepts his grim fate?

** Hello, I' m looking for a specific HP fic. I can't remember the Name or status or even where it has been. The only part i remember and thats a really big part of that ff is : Harry is in Grimauldsplace and knows that he owns it. Also the Ordermember are staying there and Molly Weasley behaves as if she own' s the place. After Harry gets up early he makes himself some breakfast but when he turns around one of the weasley has taken it without permission. At first he's only annoyed and makes himself something different, but again its taken by another. I think it happens 3 or 4 times till Harry finally gets angry enough to blow up only to have molly rant at him, making him the quilty party and telling him: as long as you are living in my house... Jadajada. Eventually after twobor three days and a visit from Dumbeldore ( and maybe Harry Birthday, that the lot forgot about?) it comes out that Harry has' nt eaten for more than two days. Finally Harry shows Molly her place while telling her ( angrily) that this is NOT her house, and that she is his quest not the other way around.

Thats really all i can remember. Maybe one of you recognizes the story and can send me the link or the title? That would be awesome! Thanks a lot :-)
