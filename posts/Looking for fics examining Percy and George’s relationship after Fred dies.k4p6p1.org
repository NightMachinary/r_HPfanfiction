I read the whiskey checklist by raven wolfmoon on fanfiction.net and loved it. So now I'm looking for more fics. Length doesn't matter, one shots and long fics work. It can be about the whole family mourning as long as their is a focus on Percy and George at one point.


** I found one that I liked, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25655260/chapters/62282011][A Brother's Love]] by TheCheshireBat on AO3, that focuses on Percy helping George through his depression. t They spend some quality time together and engage in brotherly bonding. It's angsty but also very wholesome. Sadly it hasn't been updated since August.
