  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.

320k words between this story and the sequel. Complete. Snape is brilliantly written and the story as a whole has a level of polish that's uncommon in fanfiction.

*** I thought it a decent ending to the auspicious start of book 1 (though I prefer the first of the series).

** For anyone considering reading this, I just started and it is great! A little slow starting off, but it handles the strange situation very well. A model for severitus fics!
