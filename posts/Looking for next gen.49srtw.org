Looking for some next gen fics. Would prefer the more unknown fics as I've read a lot of the other ones. Thanks!


** Clash linkffn(11226787) is a mostly Rose-centric fanfic with many mysteries to unravel, and a pretty interesting characterization to Albus Severus.

Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard is my favourite next-gen series following Teddy's first year. It's complete, and you can also find the 3rd, 5th and 7th year books in the author's profile page. linkao3(1038392)

Among the notable things the author tackles -- Teddy's first year class in Hogwarts is only 15 students due to the war; when he excitedly takes out the Marauder's Map to use it he realizes that it's out of date due to the rebuilding and there's a really nice backstory where he and Harry try to update it.

If you start reading the first book, in the beginning it's a bit slow but it does parallels the books. His 1st year is mostly hanging around Hogwarts and making friends, getting into adventures.... getting a hold of a certain stone. 3rd year someone escapes from Azkaban, 5th year is career year and also some angst as he starts realizing how much he's lost (less caps-locky raging than Harry though) and 7th year deals with prisoners of the war being released and someone's doing their own twisted brand of justice onto these peopl who have already served their sentence.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Albus Potter Series linkffn(4380964) is among my favorite series. There are some issues with grammar/spelling, but great story telling and even better characters. I can't think of a next gen fic that has characters that are more believable (both in being individuals as well as having familial traits in common with their parents).

***** I know this fic rec thread is almost a month old, but I stumbled on it while looking for next gen fics.

The "America" thing is never really brought up again. It was just there to explain why the character's family wasn't mentioned in the previous books, since he has wizarding parents. The series itself is worth a read.

** Try these (all gen, ensemble-ish):

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]]: /Archibald Penrose had a rubbish job: poor students, low levels of respect, high causality rates and some degree of amusement (depending on how you look at things). Why the hell would anyone want to be a muggle studies teacher?/
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]]: /If romping through the Forbidden Forest on week-long escapades to hunt for a mythical plant doesn't seem normal to you, then you haven't met Hugo Weasley. Hinkypunks, nymphs, Acromantulas? Not a problem for this ragtag team of ordinary heroes. Join Hugo, Scorpius Malfoy, and Professor Longbottom on the search of the decade: just what does Hugo Weasley have that's so special?/
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]]: /This is Fred Weasley, and you're listening to The Morning Waffle, where we talk about absolutely everything and absolutely nothing. Apparently it isn't enough that I have the highest ratings on the network -- now we have to do this blasted competition to make sure Stan Boringsworth doesn't steal my air time. Raj got us into this, and by Merlin, I'm going to get us out!/
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]]: /My family was never one for normality nor did we ever try to label ourselves that way. Through the years, we lived through our shares of fights and laughter and chaos. I didn't know much about living, but they taught me all I knew about loving. In the end, there didn't seem to be one without the other./
