:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a fic I read some time ago but searching though ff.net /AO3 etc can't find now. The basic premise is that in defeating Voldemort, Harry remains a horcrux and beings to try to harm Ginny. Cue both Harry and Ginny having a memory charm put on them so they forget, and they are kept apart. Fast forward a few years and they get together again, causing the memory charm to become undone. I think it finishes with the Weasley's etc attempting to replace the memory charm and Harry/Ginny escaping. If I remember correctly it was a good story and the quality of the writing was quite good. Much love if someone knows what I'm talking about. and can help me out.


** I believe it's Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect by Brennus
