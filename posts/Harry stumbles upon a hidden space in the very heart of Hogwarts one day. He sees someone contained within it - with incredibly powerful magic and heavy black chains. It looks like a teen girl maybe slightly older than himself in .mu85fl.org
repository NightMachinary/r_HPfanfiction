#+TITLE: Harry stumbles upon a hidden space in the very heart of Hogwarts one day. He sees someone contained within it - with incredibly powerful magic and heavy black chains. It looks like a teen girl maybe slightly older than himself in age, and he just instinctively knows she's alive.

I am sort of surprised at how little fanfics use figures from history to teach Harry other than Salazar Slytherin.

With this particular prompt I was going for Morgan Le Fay, but you could really make it be anyone you want.


** This prompt is straight up taken from xianxia

It only needs the girl body to be destroyed and her spirit follows harry teaching him the ancient secrets of cultivatio-I mean, ancient magic haha

jade beauty daphne kekw

there used to be a story on ffnet called gorgoneion, the author apparently was a big xianxia fan and you could tell while reading it. but the author had a weird meltdown and deleted the story and his account, shame because it was actually a good story, and afaik the closest we got to a harry potter xianxia.

***** well kek is basically "lol"

it comes from World of Warcraft, where horde and alliance players in universe speak different languages, and the substitution cypher to simulate this renders LOL as KEK to the opposing faction, at least if I recall correctly. I don't actually play WoW, so...

*** I like the idea that Hogwarts is supposedly the safest magical school in the world due to a concept like this. Inflict as much of the misfortune as magically possible on a single child, and as long as that child survives, the rest of the school does very well. That child either dies very quickly, or becomes very good at surviving the random dangerous bullshit.

What else could explain why so much bad crap happens to Harry, while the rest of the school seems to have a fairly normal existence? (Other than being a protagonist!)

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF
