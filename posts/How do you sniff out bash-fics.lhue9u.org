Let's say you're on the sub for one reason or another, looking for a good fic to read. So you post (or find a post) looking for "ABC, XYZ, No Ron/Molly/Ginny/Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, please."

/Ah, a person of culture,/ you think.

So you scroll down to the comments and find a great selection of fics, or so it seems. You click on an interesting-looking fic and---

#+begin_quote
  while Ron is resentful of Harry/Hermione's accomplishments/intelligence, Neville seems to celebrate them.

Aw shit, here we go again. Someone's posted a bash fic...again. Maybe they forgot that it had bashing; fics tend to blur together after a while. Sometimes it's because they "didn't see the 'no bashing' disclaimer". Okay. Or maybe it's because they "felt [the bashing] was deserved" and thought that the OP wouldn't mind, because "I was posting a great fic that I believed others would enjoy.... the only Weasley that get truly bashed is Ron and by the end of the fic Harry and Ron are on even terms", or because fanon has overridden canon and they believed everyone was "their canon selves".

Whatever the reason, annoyance has replaced interest and you're left searching for another (hopefully bash-free) fic.

What are some ways you use to vet out fics that have bashing if it's not stated in the summary?


** If it's Harry/Hermione and doesn't mention who Ron is paired with or specifically say it isn't bashing anyone, it's probably a Weasley bashing fic.

If there's any hint that it's a gray!Harry or indie!Harry fic, it's almost guaranteed to be a bashing fic. (Hints include Daphne, or any other Slytherin, being mentioned in any sort of positive light, Goblins and inheritances, politics and lordships, and anything about discovering new abilities.) Actually, if any Slytherin character is tagged, it will probably involve some bashing, unless maybe if the story is set post-Hogwarts.

If Neville is mentioned at all, it probably means Ron is getting bashed and Neville is replacing him, unless Ron is also mentioned. Or it could mean Neville is the WBWL and Dumbledore (and probably a few others) is getting bashed. Or the story could actually be about Neville, but that hardly ever happens.

On that note, WBWL stories always bash someone.

Anything mentioning muggles is probably going to go full mugglewank, which is basically bashing the entire magical world. And anything about Harry going to another country will probably bash magical Brittain.

If the word "Dumbles" appears anywhere in the story, summary, or author's profile, it's a bashing fic. You can also search for "screech" and "shriek," and if those words are used to describe anyone but Hedwig and possibly Myrtle (particularly Molly and Hermione), it's a bashing fic.

** Checking character tags is pretty fool proof. If you're on ffn, and the tagged characters are Harry, Hermione and Neville, it's gonna be Weasley bashing.

Hell, even seeing just Harry and Hermione likely means it's gonna be one of those “Harry realised who had been his best friend all along and it wasn't that greedy fucker won-won” fics

** Step 1: Open all chapters (feature on ao3, don't know about Fanfiction.net)

Step 2: CTRL+F “the greater good/love potion/inheritance test” etc all the usual suspects

Step 3: Briefly skim through a few sentences around the found entries, getting a little bit of context so you can see if the fic is worth your time.

Using this method, you can quickly sniff out whether or not a fic is junk without spoiling too much for yourself.

** Some AO3 fics tag ‘Weasley bashing' or ‘Dumbledore bashing', which is a very handy way for me to know which fics to stay 100 miles from.

If the fic subscribes to lots of other tropes too (e.g. Harry goes to goblins and gets lots of money, Harry goes to Slytherin and there's a ‘Slytherin court', etc) then there's a 99% chance of bashing.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Where a summary promises you that the story contains only "minimal bashing" or "light bashing", the story will invariably contain completely over-the-top, full fat, extreme bashing.

** The mods should really implement a rule where fics in request threads actually have to actually y'know /match/ the request.

Whenever it's not linking bash fics when the OP clearly doesn't want them or grasping at straws to find a reason to rec Seventh Horcrux or The Sum Of The Parts or randomly making threads like these ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/je6kz5/does_anyone_know_of_any_alternative_battle_of/]]) into Haphne love threads

** - Literally any fic tagged Independent Harry, Gray/Grey Harry, or Dark Harry on AO3. Or using those terms, or the shorthand thereof, in the summary. These will pretty much always bash Albus Dumbledore, occasionally it's easier to list who /doesn't/ get bashed.
- "Fed up with the manipulations..." or anything like that in the summary. In fact, just look for any synonym of "manipulation".
- Summary uses any insulting nickname for Albus Dumbledore.
- Harry/Hermione ship without Ron being paired with someone else, usually indicates Ron bashing.
- Ginny is another likely suspect for ship-war-related bashing. If she's not shipped with anyone, reader beware.
- Neville is tagged as an important character. Ron isn't. That means Ron is getting bashed.
- Any shipping involving a canonically-irredeemable Death Eater means you should expect some degree of "the canonically-evil side is secretly good, so the canonically-good side is evil".
- First quarter of the fic, ctrl-F "Inheritance", "Executed", "Ancient", "Hadrian" (as in inheritance test, "the Potter will was never executed!", "Ancient and Noble House of WhateverTheFuck", and Hadrian being Harry's usual 'real' name in these fics for some godforsaken reason).
- "Slight bashing" is never slight.
