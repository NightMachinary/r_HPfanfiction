** *Padma Patil/Tom Riddle* - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9502389/1/Lotos-et-Serpentium][Lotos et Serpentium]] linkffn(9502389) is a confluence of things that I do not ordinarily like: time travel, romance, and soul bonds. But it somehow works, not the least because it doesn't involve creepy-insta love. The rarer-than-rare pairing is enough to be interesting by itself.

Sadly abandoned, it seems.

*Ron/Pansy* - [[http://hp10k-showcase.livejournal.com/7219.html][Glass Half Full]] bears the description "Twenty years after the battle at Hogwarts, it's not happily ever after," but to give a fuller description, Ron is a recovering alcoholic and Pansy is his takes-no-shit sponsor. It's from Ron's POV and written to sound like it. It also has two fantastic lines at the end.

  It is said that a child born under the influence of a love potion will never know love. The gods, in a single act of mercy, bestow upon this child a gift -- a lotus that will survive his darkness. Time Travel. Soul bonds.

** I believe linkffn(Dignity in Fear by Xtremebass) is the only Hermione/Tonks fic that I've read worth mentioning or seen recommended by others. Apparently a few chapters have been added since I read it too.

If you've been around much you probably can't have missed linkao3(2573990), but it bears mentioning in my eyes because it is just such delicious and creative fluff.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
