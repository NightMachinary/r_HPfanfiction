Just the musings of a deranged man.


** There's a bunch of fics where Hedwig got replaced with a phoenix, which is kinda like bashing because normal OwlHedwig is too boring I guess.

Reminds me of a terrible fic where Harry named his pet basilisk Hedwig.

#+begin_quote
  /Hagrid purchases a conspicuous and easily-surveilled owl for Harry./

  Right after Hagrid introduces an 11-year-old Harry Potter to Quirrell, he decides to leave Harry - a defenseless and naive child - alone in Diagon Alley, in order to return to the place where Voldemort is. Afterward, Hagrid continues to shop with Harry, deciding to buy Harry a birthday present in the form of an owl:

  “Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, ye'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.”

  Hagrid buys a beautiful, white snowy owl named Hedwig... certainly a creature which stands out, and which would be easily tracked and followed, as described in Book 4 in the chapter Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Sirius, on the run, sends a letter stating, “Don't use Hedwig, keep changing owls.” Ron questions this, and Hermione states:

  “Hedwig'll attract too much attention... She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he's hiding... I mean, they're not native birds, are they?”

  Hagrid, always looking out for Voldemort's interest, specifically purchased Harry the most conspicuous owl we ever see, which would be easy to track and observe, which is all the more suspicious given that he did so right after returning to the last known whereabouts of Voldemort's other servant.

** Oh, stars. You've reminded me of the Ron/Hedwig fic, now. I thought I'd successfully put that from my memory...

**** Hedwig probably got pretty bashed landing on a motorway after she died. (If not by the fall, the cars.)
