You know what? Lavender Brown was the best thing for Ron. She likes him for who he is, and never tries to change him. She is affectionate, open and clear with her feelings, she never insults him. What more can you ask for in a girlfriend? The only downside she had was that she was too clingy. Honestly, the good way outweighs the bad.


** I agree that they're good together, so it always makes me a bit sad when Lavender is used to make Ron cheat on Hermione and justify their separation in some post-war, Hermione-centric fics. IMO they both deserve way better than that, and you can still ship Hermione with someone else if she and Ron just decide they're not good together and agree to separate.

** I liked Lavender and never liked how she is usually put down for being into girly girl things (both by the fandom and by JKR somewhat). Was the Won-Won stuff ridicolous? Maybe, but she's a dumb hormonal teenage girl acting like a teenager would. And agree, I always felt she liked Ron for who he was. I think it could have worked once they both matured.

*** I can understand teenage Harry thing Won-Won was ridiculous, but I think most of us have a silly name for our partner. For example, Arthur doesn't get belittled for calling Molly Mollywobbles.

The only thing I would say is that it's one of the few examples of a couple that didn't meet at school and marry in a heartbeat. Realistically, it doesn't happen as often as presented in canon.

**** That's because it was a teenage girl using a silly name and everything teen girls do is perceived as ridiculous (even in HP, see Hermione with her "not like other girls" portrayal)

On the other hand, a very good point. I'm just sad of out of all the school sweethearts who ended up marrying in canon (as unrealistic as it is), it wasn't Ron and Lavanda. I mean, out of all the school romances they had the most potential according to me (excluding Harry and book!Ginny)

** I love Lavender. I think JKR did her dirty, and I don't like the characterisations I've read of her in the past of being shallow and vain. She's a Gryffindor. That's got to mean something. I think she's passionate and brave. My WIP is firmly Romione, in fact I started the story from before she and Ron got together although there are hints that she did like him before Hermione got in there first, but Lavender is still an important part of the story.

I'm interested in any stories that give Lavender depth.

But she most certainly was not shallow. Hell, as far as romantic feelings goes, hers for Ron was one of the most genuine in the whole series. In a way the Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione's never could.

******** Gotta disagree about that one. Built up throughout the books. He barely acknowledged her until book 5 and there are no potentially romantic tones in that one. The whole relationship basically started in book 6.

I think Harry thinking of Ginny as the last before he dies in bullshit through. He only got with her near the end of Book 6. And the whole monster in the chest thing implies it was a simple crush. Sure it could have developed into something a bit more, but it really never gets to that point before Harry breaks up with her, and Ginny barely in Book 7. The whole relationship was mostly just Harry fawning over how perfect she was, JKR, literally just throws in perfect in multiple descriptions of her. It didn't feel earned. Harry should have thought of Ron and Hermione last, he was with them way more, and they had more meaningful experiences.

Okay, Ginny and Harry might have had a few moments, like them mentioning what it's like to have Tom Riddle in your head, but those are far few in between.

********* I honestly not get this argument at all. Would you have preferred that they fell in love at the platform in book one? I personally am not a big fan of “predestined” love stories, or love at first sight. It's completely natural that the relationship goes from best friends little sister, to friend, and then to lover.

They also fit each other very well. Ginny's exactly what Harry needs; she knows how to get him to open up, he finds her attractive, she makes him laugh. They even set each other up for jokes. She's also brave and loyal, both qualities that Harry value. It doesn't have to be deeper than that. And even though Ginny isn't present for most of book 7, we can see that their relationship made an impression of Harry, since he thinks about her a lot.

And I don't mind the romance not taking much place in the books. It's an adventure/mystery series; the romance is a side plot.

Your right it's not a romance, so if your not gonna dedicate proper time for the romance aka half-ass it, then don't do it all. The whole love story is pretty irrelevant, and reading about Harry's monster chest isn't particularly enjoyable.

And no, don't straw-man, I didn't say fall in love at the platform, that's literally the opposite of my point of it being rushed. They could have met at the platform and actually interacted more in the books. The thing is the relationship was never "best friends little sister" or "friend. Definitely not friend. There was no relationship at all until book 6.

While being attractive and funny is a believable reason for Harry to have a crush, I mean that's more than Cho, it doesn't work as the grand love story, to the point that she's the last thing Harry decided to think of before he dies.

Even though they "broke up" at the end of HBP, it was pretty clear that it was not by choice on either side, but by necessity. Something that was made clear at Harry's birthday with their one last stolen moment together when he basically promises her that he's not gonna go looking for any other girl while traveling around. For him, Ginny was his endgame.

Yes he had a lot more experiences with Ron and Hermione, but Ginny represented an actual future for him, a realization of his deepest desire. Of course he thought of her last. I've known my best friend for almost 30 years, but god forbid if I'm ever in a situation similar to Harry's, I won't be thinking of him but of my significant other.

It was a teenage crush and the fact that both were willing to go through with that totally obvious "fake breakup" plot a blind person could see through proves that, while probably genuine, their relationship did not run very deep.

I like Ginny as a character and out of all the Weasleys, IMO she has the most interesting themes (not that canon explores them). She's basically the only Weasley I genuinely like. But the romance was a rushed, botched job on par with a first attempt at writing rather than the Sixth part of an international smash hit.

Nobody else showed the same lvl of loyalty to him. And with the way Harry's life was that would matter a lot.

I think JKR was stuck with Ginny bc of how stubborn she is about wanting Hermione to be ugly. which I don't think she was anyway other than her teeth, and that got fixed. Victor Krum went to the Yule Ball with her. If she was ugly he wouldn't have done that! Plus, I don't think Draco ever made fun of her looks.

He was not alone though. He went to Bill's house and stayed there his brother and sister-in-law. He also got life signs from his family and the Order. That is nowhere near the same situation Harry and Hermione were in after he left. And the Weasley were definitely treated better than the Muggleborn who were deported en masse to hell on earth or outright executed. He could have survived under Voldemort, while Harry and Hermione could not.

#+begin_quote

Look, realistically speaking, Harry and Hermione would think that they were done for once Ron left and did not reappear the next day. They had no proper plan or the means to defeat Voldemort. Their deaths seemed imminent. They would have had sex by Christmas, if not earlier. Not due to any deep romantic feelings, but because they would have been desperate for any kind of interpersonal comfort. It would not have been a very healthy relationship, but I don't see either of them just toss it away as soon as Ron returned, mainly because Hermione never abandoned Harry, no matter what. That is her best trait by far. Maybe if Ron had brought Ginny along... Anyway, at that point, they would be in too deep.

It's not that I don't like Ginny. In book 5, she would have been a good match for him, at least after Cho. Had Rowling set up their romance differently, you would not hear me complain about it. Had Rowling written a different version of the Horcrux hunt, you would not see me arguing against Ginny here. But due to the botched nature of the last two books, I can't see anything other than Harry with Hermione as the logical conclusion. And again, I don't see them as a perfect couple, but as two broken people who only had each other in their darkest hour.

  Yes he had a lot more experiences with Ron and Hermione, but Ginny represented an actual future for him, a realization of his deepest desire
#+end_quote

That's how I feel about their relationship as well; Ron and Hermione (friendship, their adventures, war) were his present and his most important relationships while at Hogwarts. Ginny was his future.

When he thinks about his possible doomed future he thinks about the time he wasted not being with Ginny (months, years). The thought of Ginny's future not including him and marrying someone else bothered him a lot.

I really like how their relationship was portrayed in the books; a glimpse in Harry's future.

*********** Not to mention that Harry's past experiences makes him completely unsuited for a casual, surface-level relationship. He tried having one with Cho, and it bombed spectacularly. He grew up not knowing love and care, and was viewed either as a trophy, liar, or hero his entire adolescent life. Harry values honesty and loyalty, and more than anything he wants someone to see him as Harry, just Harry. Ginny is the only one who ever gave him that. Especially with the war and Voldemort, I don't see how Harry would just go around dating people for the hell of it.

#+end_quote

Exactly. And not to mention that he's no Casanova either... That's why the first scene in HBP (Harry flirting with the waitress) felt so OOC. Perhaps they showed it to suggest Harry was over Cho, ready to be with somebody else, or that he had an upgrade in his flirting skills during summer lol

Something else I don't understand is the double standards for Ron and Harry. Ron and Lavender together is great, as suggested by this thread. Nevermind that Lavender never lived the same adventures together as Ron and Hermione. But Harry and Ginny is not. Because Ginny wasn't friends with Harry since book 2, she didn't take part in the hunt for the horcruxes or whatever.

Their story was not about friendship. It's about romance. He felt at ease with her and opened up about wanting to talk to Sirius but when she suggested that he should talk to Cho, he cut her off... Not only he would never discuss Sirius with Cho but he wasn't going to talk about Cho with Ginny either. And we know that one of the first steps to friend-zone someone is to discuss your crush with them...

Anyway, I think JKR knew exactly what she was doing about Harry & Ginny throughout the books.

*** god you're so goddamn RIGHT and you should say it.

for someone who claims to be a feminist, Rowling's pretty fucking bad at it in her writing. even without the actual transphobia issues.

even the other female characters in the series are hella one-dimensional! people complain about them all being basically OCs in fic, but that's pretty much the only choice a fanfic author has if they want to delve into those characters bc there's so /little/ we know about them in canon.

Luna's a caricature of bullied-weird-kid but there's very little information on her being bullied, her upbringing, whether or not she has genuine mental issues, whether she actually believes in the conspiracy theories she spouts. Ron and Ginny call her looney. she sees thestrals after her mother's death. a lot can be extrapolated, but do we ever actually get any indication as to how she feels about that? do we know anything real about her other than that Harry finds her a convenient date in book 6 and that she gets kidnapped in book 7? do we know anything substantial about her in canon? nope!

the Patil twins: all we know about them: they have Indian heritage, Padma's in Ravenclaw while Parvati's in Gryffindor, and Parvati seems to be friends with Lavender. they don't do anything aside from being Harry and Ron's dates in book 4.

Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell: all we really know about them is that they're on the Gryffindor team and what year they're in.

Molly Weasley: for a large part of the series, a lot of her function is to be motherly. she acts as a parent to Harry, and doesn't have much personality outside of that except when she's horrible to Hermione in book 4 and fighting in book 7. a lot of things are implied by the fact that she was in the Order, and actually fighting, but none of those are elaborated upon and that annoys me.

Narcissa Malfoy: mostly there to illustrate the Wizarding World's prejudices, and later for Rowling to go all oh-not-all-Slytherins-are-bad-even-though-she's-bad-because-she-helped-Harry. very little discernible personality.

Fleur: she's French, part-Veela, and is married to Bill, and Harry didn't bother interacting much with her in the Tournament. the rest of the Weasleys make fun of her because... she's French, part-Veela, and is married to Bill. a lot can be implied by these things but Harry doesn't care to find out and Rowling doesn't care about her characters.

Tonks: clumsy, Auror, former Hufflepuff, Metamorphagus, loves Lupin. that's really all we know about her in canon. Rowling does her dirty with the few scenes she gets later in the series- she's basically a cop, takes down dark wizards for a living, but Lupin acts like he's too dangerous for her, and nobody contests that. honestly, why does she need to be paired with him anyway? Rowling just wanted to avoid fans headcanoning them both as gay, imo. Tonks is the closest Rowling comes to a well-written female character and she dies anyway

McGonagall: there to fill a teacher role for Harry and that's it.

Trelawney: a caricature of a drunken-hippie-tarot reader. as a drunken goth tarot reader, i don't like it.

Lily Potter née Evans: she's dead and therefore doesn't count. there are debates about her all over this sub, but we can all agree that compared to James we don't know much about her.

the rest of the female characters in the series are little more than OCs to be elaborated on in fic- we get a name, maybe a line of dialogue or a snippet of background, and that's it.

There's no family complications, no political complications, he's very familiar with the most traumatic event in her past, it's all straightforward.

**** Brutal! But I also like it. I am simultaneously for and against Romione. For, because of my loyalty to cannon, the fact that we see everything through Harry's lense (and he isn't a perfect narrator*), and that they are foils for each other, and that it's entirely possible they matured a lot (instead of staying who they were at 15-17).

*1. Harry isn't the most observant of the inter personal relationships going on around him; he's too focused on figuring out Voldemort's next move, understandably. 2. Growing up with the Dursley's, Harry probably doesn't have much tolerance for fighting and yelling and, in my opinion, isn't good at distinguishing "playful" bickering from actual animosity. (However "playful" bickering/banter gets old fast).

Against, because if they haven't changed enough, then their relationship is doomed. Ron needs someone who appreciates him for who he is, someone who doesn't conflate fighting with flirting (I feel like Hermione loves a good debate, but it often turns into a nasty argument with Ron because neither party understands what they other wants), someone who doesn't play jealousy games (such as fawning over McLaggen). To be clear, I'm not saying that Ron should be with someone who's "not smart," because, firstly, Ron isn't a moron. He's not top of the class, but that doesn't make him stupid. In fact, I think he got shortchanged in the later books (and all the movies); in SS/PS/HP1, he's a chess genius, but by HBP/6, he can't write an essay without Hermione's help?! Ron doesn't have an issue with smart women (or people more intelligent than him in general), he has an issue with people who are pompous about their intelligence, who use it to make others feel "less than," whether intentionally or unintentionally.

May I also suggest Ron/Luna? I feel that Luna had a way of making people feel "seen," which is something Ron needs as he has always felt overlooked (think of the locket in DH, "least loved by the mother who craved a daughter, [etc].). Ron would be good for Luna, as he has a good sense of humor and rolls with the punches, so to speak. One thing in the books that stands out to me is when Ron is in the Hospital Wing after being poisoned in HBP and Luna is commentating for the Quidditch match. It really cracks Ron up and he makes a point to tell Luna it was amazing.

And lastly, I would like to plug [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11462379/1/][Of Bare Feet and Blibbering Humdingers]]. It is unfinished, sadly, but also an amazing Ron/Luna story ♥️

** Not sure where to add this, so I'll just throw it on top. Lavender fans might like linkffn(7428134) where she is doing everyone a solid by dating Ron.

*** My god, are you nuts? I ask for stories that have Ron stay with Lavender, I clearly mention that I think Lavender's feelings for Ron were genuine and you recommend a story where she's dating Ron only because she wants to remove his third wheel so that Harry and Hermione can happen?! Not only that, but at the start of the fic Hermione wants Ron, but Lavender convinces her that she actually wants Harry?!

Jesus Fucking Christ! Remove this post asap, please.

  A talk between Hermione and Lavender during sixth year reveals Lavender's reason for dating Ron. Please note: Hermione and Lavender are the main characters, and not the pairing. I'd tell you the pairing but that'll give away the end of the story! NOT R/Hr

** Nah, sorry, Romione 4 lyf. Lavender's great and all, but the Ron/Hermione relationship is beautifully built over the 7 books.
