So the idea is that pureblood families are important because they have an outsanding generational contracts. Because of that they are politely called Lords and Ladies.

Now Voldemort was able to convince more radical wing of Wizgamont to follow him and even kill other Lords. Those that follow him either don't know whole story or don't care. Voldemort himself as a bastart of one of noble families doesn't have a full picture, but pretends to know.

Dumbledore as a Headmaster of premier school in Britain has full knowlege of existing contracts, but has no ability to inform people of them, because standart Headmaster nondisclosure agreement.

Now what contracts are? They are agreements with magical clans or entities of power that are eithet non-agresion pacts or some-such agreements. For example Prevell family had agreement with death for relics. Now some non disclosed family has a non-agretion pact with Winter Court so that magical Britain doesn't battle winter fae.

So in essence Wizegamont is a function of families that originaly had a non agretion pact with each other to keep Britain from battling magical other kingdoms or entities. The contracts who, with what and what price are hidden. So it might be that Nott family caries a contract of non-agretion with goblins, so they don't rebel, or it might be that they have a relic contract. People don't know they only know that there's a contract in that family.


** Given that Dumbledore can't kill Voldemort because of his horcruxes and is a far more capable fighter than Voldemort's death eaters to the point where it'd be the magical equivalent of a 25 year old drop kicking babies, it seems "right" already for Dumbledore to use non-lethal force against lethal force. I can't actually recall Dumbledore using a stunner against lethal force. He stunned Crouch but Crouch didn't actually have a chance to employ lethal force.

Then of course, there's the line between lethality and stopping power. A spell might be lethal eventually, if left untreated, but allow an opponent to remain combat-capable. Take sectumsempra, for instance, an example of a "cutter" authors seem to enjoy employing.

Allow me to quote myself (with changes):

"However, as a small aside, another aspect people always fail to consider is stopping power. People always love to laugh at stunners because of its non-lethality and its countercharm. However, I think stunners are actually one of the better spells in one's repertoire. Take diffindo or sectumsempra. Authors will have their characters use cutting spells instead of stunners. Let's examine the combat capabilities of each spell.

Stunners instantly put down their target. Full stop. They can be added together to become more lethal. One you are hit, you're out of the battle. You're vulnerable to a follow-up spell. It can also be used to halt objects.

Sectumsempra and diffindo are variable. People can easily survive stab and slash wounds and remain conscious from them and that's in the actual world. There's plenty of evidence to suggest wizards are more resilient (the unlikelyhood of Harry's parents dying to a car crash, Harry taking a bludger to the head and surviving, etc). Stopping power is lacking compared to the stunning spell though a lucky hit may render a target incapable of fighting.

People can be revived from stunning spells. It's interesting to note that it still takes a while for them to be combat capable once more. However, once stunned, one cannot wake themselves up, leaving one vulnerable to coup de grace. People can be healed from cutting charms with episkey and the counter to sectumsempra. /Because of its lack of stopping power, one can heal oneself of their cut/.

Both spells can be shielded against, blocked, and repelled.

In conclusion, a stunner is better for actually rendering an opponent non-combative. One of the better examples is George Weasley. A sectumsempra that takes off an ear would have killed him had it been a stunner or at the very least rendered him incapable of fighting (the fall). Draco Malfoy remains conscious and moving (combat-capable) after being hit with a sectumsempra.

This type of thinking applies to the spells used elsewhere in fics. Blood-boilers, bone breakers, ice spears, etc all lack the stopping power and effectiveness of stunners. The order didn't shy away from killing but neither did they shy away from using more effective curses. The only spells I consider more combat-effective in canon are the killing curse (though this has the drawback of a hefty power requirement - Harry likely can't use it for a majority of his school years) and Dolohov's unnamed curse. And most authors don't even use Dolohov's spell."

*** Though I think it's important to note that injury spells /do/ have stopping power when used against most non-combatants. Most people without combat experience when injured /are/ stopped (pain, shock, my hand is gone!). Which is why death eaters could have such success with them since their primary targets were non-combatants, but the Order might not.

** The contracts idea reminds me of /Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power/, whose author's name escapes me at the moment.

However, as I see it, the reason Dumbledore doesn't use lethal magic is that he is powerful enough to defeat pretty much any number of lesser opponents nonlethally. Therefore, for him specifically, any killing would be gratuitous and damaging to his soul. This is not the case for the other Order members, who use lethal magic as needed.

** If you are fighting a strictly one on on battle then I can see using stunners but if you're a situation where you're fighting multiple opponents than the use of stunners is not to your advantage because unless you immediately follow up with a spell that keeps an opponent down a stunned opponent can rejoin the fight. So spells that can remove limbs (tough for an opponent to continue the fight without a wand arm), or cause more extensive damage is probably what you should use.

So spells like Confringo, Expulso, Defodio, Deprimo, Reducto, Bombarda, etc are probably your better combat spells.

*** Given that confringo's best use in canon was rendering 1/5 people combat incapable in canon with a point blank unshielded explosion with the worst use (1/3 instances in canon) being it turning on its casters, I'm not so sure explosion curses are the way to go. The most successful use is pushing a Death Eater off a broom, and removing a sidecar (though the explosion next to Harry didn't hurt him).

Expulso explodes a table right behind Harry and Harry is merely knocked down and temporarily loses his wand. No shrapnel, no real injuries, not even heat like confringo.

Reducto is used on objects. We never see it used on people and I'm not so sure it can be. We see clear differences between the way magic treats people and objects in canon. Deprimo and defodio falls under the same type of deal. It's even more unlikely when one considers the possible transfiguration mechanics behind defodio, human transfiguration (much less vanishing) is immensely difficult. Deprimo doesn't have much of an AOE given that Hermione blasts a hole right below them with no blowback. And again, it's only seen used against objects.

Bombarda is not in the books, and seems to be the movie's equivalent of confringo.

I've already written extensively elsewhere on the stopping power capability of a stunner and with the limitations of magic and explosion spells in canon, I don't think it's fair the say that's they are better combat spells. Even stronger evidence is that aurors and order member don't seem to employ them, which seems to show that those explosion and gouging based curses are very limited in combat.

**** However, remember that there seemed to be a preference to capture for trial versus eliminate the bad guys so that's maybe why you don't see more lethal curses used against the bad guys. And not because they didn't work that well. (Now one problem is I can't remember if it was canon or fanon that had Dumbledore pushing for the aurors to not use lethal spells (I know it's very prevalent in fanon I just don't remember if it was in canon as well. At a certain point canon/fanon start to merge in your mind)).

Look all I'm saying is that if I'm in a fight with multiple bad guys and I use a stunner it is immediately going to be followed with a spell that ensures if the bad guy is revived he's not getting back into the fight. Now you may have a point that some of those spells I listed may not work properly against a human body regrettably canon is not clear on that. And it may just be a factor of intent and amount of power put into it. If the spells I listed do work well on a human body then I would use them in a multiple opponent battle.

There's a line from an old Henry Fonda/James Stewart movie where the character states. "I know better. Any man worth shooting is a man worth killing". There's another old saying that is also apropos "Never Leave a Live Enemy Behind You". And that's how I believe the good guys should treat the bad guys when it comes to a fight.
