Basically the idea behind this is that there's literally nothing that separates (non digital) magical photos from muggle photos, except for who is in them. A frankly ludicrous prompt/au but I want to see what people do with a universe where people find out about their children being magical when their holiday photos keep moving.

** Petunia getting progressively more paranoid and harassed as photos of small Harry keep blinking and smiling at her slightly and no one seems to notice. Not Vernon, not Marge. She start expecting him to move out of the frames altogether. She heard of haunted paintings, why not the accursed photography too? She thinks she sees movement out of the corner of her eye but when she looks, Harry is there as always just a bit /not right/.

That is till baby Dudley starts squirming and clapping and demanding he gets a photo frame in his hands to see 'a telly'.

She burns all the photos and cuts Harry out of those she can and disposes of them even through green eyes of her nephew looks at her from them with dissapointment.

Harry never poses to new pictures again.

** "Come on it's just a photograph!" He pulled Emily's hand, tugging her towards the high rock in the village. "It's brand new and--"

"I really shouldn't..." She cut him off. "Mom said I..."

"Oh all that death-ray nonsense!" He scrunched his nose. "People will make anything up these days. Don't worry! I've read a few papers that say it is perfectly safe to use. Don't worry. Come on." He started tugging her again.

They finally reached the peak. A beautiful sunset lit up the horizon. Clouds rolled away in the distance.

He set up the camera.

"Say cheese!"

FLASH

"Wow! Look, you're..." the word beautiful died in his throat.

"What's wrong?"

"N-nothing, Emily! I think its battery died. I'll charge it properly for tomorrow." He lied. He had charged it up and had brought a spare just in case. Shoving the picture in his pocket, he held her hand, and they walked back to the village.

He left her at her house, and ran back to his own.

He pulled out the slightly crumpled photograph.

Her skirt blew in the wind. Her hand waved.

It couldn't be.

He knew everything about this camera... How light was etched in the paper in an instant.

It shouldn't have been possible.

And yet it was.

His pulse quickened.

Making a sudden decision, he gave his excuses to his mother and started running to her house.

He turned the corner, only to see it burst up in flames.

Two black clad figures stood in the beautiful garden, glowing sticks in their hand.

He bit his tongue to restrain his scream.

And then he heard the words. Those dreadful words. "Morsemordre!" The two figures spoke in unison.

A glowing skull crystallized in the night sky.

The figures vanished as if they had never existed.

He clutched the slightly crumpled photograph.

They didn't know what they had taken from him. They couldn't know, when even he didn't.

But he would get her back.

Those black clad enemies would taste his bitterness, his resentment, and above all, his rage.

** If normal photos on film of wizards caused them to move around, you could bet that the CIA would still have several spy satellites using film and scanning each frame repeatedly to detect anything moving.

If anything weird is happening somewhere, get the nearest satellite to take a bunch of pictures and run detect_wizards.exe. If no wizards are found, send in regular law enforcement. Otherwise automatically send all footage and coordinates to the nearest magical law enforcement agency.

Might be practical to use a xerographic photo plate that works a bit like film but can be reset after use so that you don't have to launch new film rolls into space every now and then.

** I'm not sure about writing a fic around this concept, but it's an interesting thing to theorycraft into an existing AU with slightly changed mechanics.

In some cultures, there used to be a belief that a photograph or mirror-image could capture your soul.\\
What if this was a misconception, based on knowledge from the magical world?\\
A camera will capture a little bit of /magic/ from whatever it takes a picture of, and enough magic in a picture will animate it. The more the magical thing is in-focus, the better the chance of it animating as more magic is captured.

A mirror will also capture little bits of magic from its subjects - a standard mirror, given enough exposure, will grow a personality by default, though the magic can be consciously directed to do other things (see also: Mirror of Erised, Marauder communication mirrors).

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
