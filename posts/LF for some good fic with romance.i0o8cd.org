hey,

so the male should be harry (or introverted oc) and the female preferably a non-gryffindor (absolutely no ginny/hermione or luna, and daphne only new or more unknown because i probably read the ones most would recommend)...

would also be good if harry isn't on friendly terms with ron, hermione, ginny & molly... (and please no 24/7 compulsion throwing & love poisoning dumbledore)

thanks

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

** The Cadmean victory fits those. Its a Fleur Harry fic that follows through the years after the triwizard cup. It's a bit Harry OP but the only fic I remember liking that has all your requirements.

** In my opinion there is only one perfect depiction of Harry in a relationship with someone.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][And that someone is Wednesday Addams]]

This is my favourite HPFanfic, its amazing.
