I think this pairing has a /lot/ of potential, but every fic with it seems to follow the same trend: Harry starts dating Susan Bones, who gets her aunt to free Sirius and they all live happily ever after, sometimes with Sirius dating Amelia, too. I'd like to see something more original, please.

Preferably no Weasley bashing, but I know that can be difficult. Definitely no harem fics.

Thanks in advance!


** Why do you think Harry and Susan have lots of potential? We know next to nothing about her. Honestly curious, not criticizing. And I'd love to know why you think so.

And its true. Susan is defined by her useful connection with Amelia in all fanfiction and nothing else.

To be fair, that's more of a basis than most fanfic relationships.

*** They also have a similar background (half-blood; families are heavily targeted). I just find it interesting that no one has been able to rec anything. Tells you something about the dearth of fanfics with this pairing...

**** It doesn't really focus on Susan/Harry, but they do feature heavily in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569][Seven Names]] so it might interest you

*** For the same reason that people think Daphne has a lot of potential as a love interest. Unlike Ginny or Hermione, or even Tonks and Fleur, she doesn't really have any known personality traits, so you can basically make an OC without having to deal with all that comes with writing an OC love interest.

That the fanon description of her veers into 乇乂ㄒ尺卂 ㄒ卄丨匚匚 territory probably helps.

*** The fact we know next to nothing is what I think is a very attractive object for the writer. It allows them to use their creativity to shape the character how they wish instead of having a defined characteristic(s) the writer needs to adhere to when portraying the character.

For instance, you don't exactly see a mentally impaired Hermione generally in stories since she is already characterized as a intelligent person

  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
