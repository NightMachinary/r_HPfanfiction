Here is my idea...

So it's the Battle of Hogwarts and Coldemort is bringing back Harry's body...

Neville stands up to Voldemort and then He threatens to kill Neville. The everyone stand up to him and the Weasleys and Hermione end up in front and try saying that they will have to get throught them to kill Neville. Then Voldemort says fine and starts to udder the killing curse. Two things happen at once. From behind the group, Neville think ing it will be the last thing he will do, draws Gryffindors sword and kills Nagini from around Voldemorts sholder, the final horrocrux. At the same time. Harry, not standing sitting thier while his friends and family are killed, drops from Hagrids grip, seizes Voldemorts hand just after Neville killed the snake and directs it at Voldemort, causing the most feared wizard in history to commit suicide.

I give concent for someone to clean up, tweak, and finish this story idea, just credit me and link the story in the comments. In the mean time I would like you opinions on this idea.


** Coldemort made me think this was going to be a very ambitious Frozen crossover.

Clearly things did not go according to plan at the rebirthing ritual.

This prompt raises an interesting question though. If wand movements are an important component to casting, surely having the wand tip move in a 100 degree vertical arc as Tom's hand is guided so that the wand is facing Tom's own face... what kind of spell effect occurs?

*** Much harder to do than the movies make it out to. Basically impossible, and definitely impossible for Harry.

**** Voldemort's neck is weak and fragile after so many Horcruxes

***** Not how horcruxes work.

  “Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”

  Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
