:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I've been trying to remember a fanfiction I read a few years ago, I've tried looking for it but no luck just yet. So I'm hoping maybe someone here will recognise something! I will list the things I remember about it.

•Time travel to the marauders era

•Harry and Hermione - they are like siblings - they go with the surname Granger

•They appear in Dumbledore's office

•They will both stay in school - Gryffindor - won't be resorted because they doubt they'd get into Gryffindor again

•It was just mentioned briefly in the story, but Ron abused Hermione and Ginny cheated on Harry.

•Sirius/Harry

•I THINK there was sex.. but I am not 100% certain

•Harry and Hermione have a mental connection due to spell/potion and can speak to each other like that

•Harry and Hermione are both animagus -Hermione is a feline. Cannot remember Harry's - they also have nicknames for each other

•I THINK Hermione and Remus have a romance or something but I cannot remember completely

•Harry has horrible nightmares as per usual, Hermione wakes up one night and runs to the boys dorm because she heard his distress via their mental connection

•Harry gives Sirius a necklace (or other jewellery) before going back to their normal time that Sirius has to wear until his 17th birthday

•It's a bond between Harry and Sirius (like Hermione and Harry's) and it lets Harry speak to Sirius (mentally) even though they're in different eras

•Everyone from marauders era forget about Harry and Hermione when they go back because >Time Travel<

•On Sirius' 17th birthday he remembers everything and magic happens and he's brought to the future to be with Harry

•Remus is working at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in the “normal time”

This is all I can remember for the time being, and I really hope someone knows or remembers something ❤️


** Not everything fits, I think you might be combining more than one fic in your mind.

#+begin_quote
  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?

*** Sadly that is not the one I'm talking about. Ron doesn't appear in it at all apart from being mentioned.
