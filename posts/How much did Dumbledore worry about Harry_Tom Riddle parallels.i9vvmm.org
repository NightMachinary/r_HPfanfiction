In /Nightmares of Futures Past/ Dumbledore is portrayed as being very concerned that Harry resembles Tom Riddle. In the early chapters at least, I think this is exacerbated by various comments by Snape. Sure, in that fanfiction things are worse (from Dumbledore's perspective) because Harry is magically powerful, incredibly proactive, and not particularly pliant, humble, or manipulable.

Still, it got me wondering. In the actual story line, Dumbledore says over and over again that Snape has his complete trust. I think it entirely believable that Snape bad mouths Harry off scene, either in staff meetings, or one on one in Dumbledore's office as the two discuss different aspects of Dumbledore's plans. Yes, such one on one meetings are speculation on my part, but given the meetings the /know/ happen after Riddle is resurrected, well, is it not reasonable to think that Snape may have had some role as in spying on Malfoy Senior or other pardoned Death Eaters even before Riddle returns? Or that he might not have lost his temper with Harry and gone to vent with Dumbledore the way he does in /Nightmares/?

Assuming that Snape has been talking about Harry off scene, how much do you think Dumbledore was influenced by it?


** Not too much. I think the differences were clear by the conversation in front of the Mirror of Erised and he definitely didn't worry after CoS.

No need to assume. The Prince's Tale, DH:

#+begin_quote
  “--- mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent ---”

  “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

Later...

#+begin_quote
  “He is his father over again ---”

  “In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother's. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.”

*** Yeah, I remember this, but the conversation in chapter 12 between Dumbledore and Harry after Justin is attacked makes far more sense if Dumbledore is using Legilimancy on Harry. Otherwise McGonagall has brought Harry up to his office for essentially a non-starter of a conversation in which Dumbledore just randomly assures Harry that despite having been hauled up to the headmaster's office he /isn't/ suspected of anything.

Similarly in /Order of the Phoenix/ Dumbledore says "I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined." At this point Harry already knows Mrs. Figg was a spy for Dumbledore, he's admitting that he has watched /more and in other ways as well/ (even though Harry never picks up on this).

I don't know. I guess it really comes down to that conversation. The disconnect between Dumbledore proclaiming how much he cares for Harry while allowing him to remain with the Dursleys for all those years. Sure Harry shows remarkable resilience, but the treatment he experienced, no matter how strictly you try to keep to exactly what the book explicitly states, wasn't acceptable. At very least, even it was arguably legal back then, it wasn't something that someone who "cares deeply" (slight paraphrase) for Harry, who wants him to be /happy/ and /normal/ should have tolerated.

It seems much more realistic to me that Dumbledore is playing Harry here. And if he's playing Harry, he's probably manipulating Snape as well (in the quotes you give). So perhaps I'm off on a total wild tangent thinking that Dumbledore actually listens to much of anyone besides himself, but that still begs the original question. How much did Dumbledore really trust Harry, and how much did he worry that Harry would go wrong?

#+end_quote

The assurance isn't random and not 'anything.' He doesn't think Harry attacked anyone, but he also suspects Harry isn't telling the whole truth, which is why he wanted to speak with him.

#+begin_quote
  in other ways as well
#+end_quote

No. There's nothing for Harry - or anyone else to pick up on - as that's not what Dumbledore said or even suggested. He watched Harry more closely than Harry could have imagined. As Dumbledore has portraits, professors, and the ability to make himself virtually invisible, it's not hard to believe.

Dumbledore has Harry watched and watches him because he's Harry Potter. Not for similarities between Harry and TMR.

#+end_quote

Not a disconnect at all. Dumbledore tells us exactly why he operated the way he did:

#+begin_quote
  “My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters --- and many of them are almost as terrible as he --- were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore isn't simple. He planned an endgame that relied on the behaviors' of damn near everyone involved. The similarities between Harry and TMR are small and more to do with their life circumstances. Not personality.

McGonagall brought Harry up to Dumbledore saying "it is out of my hands" before Harry had a chance to tell the whole truth, to utterly lie, or anything in between. I agree that Harry did omit key facts that should have been revealed to authority figures, but not until after he was already sitting in Dumbledore's office. Why was he brought up there in the first place? As a witness? Dumbledore and his deputy are clearly not on the same page then because Dumbledore has already decided what has happened (or not). As a suspect? More or less the same thing, /unless/ he /is/ a suspect /until/ Dumbledore uses undetected legilimancy on him.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Dumbledore gives us his justification, yes. The problem is that he could have done so many things to change the situation. Look how little it took to scare the Dursleys into giving Harry a bedroom as just one trivial example. But no, Dumbledore will condemn someone, but not actually teach them in any useful way. Oh, he might scare them some. He does that with the Dursleys when there is no choice (when Petunia is thinking about kicking Harry out for example). He does that with Riddle when they first meet. But honestly, the way he does it is more than likely counter productive.

I do agree that Harry and Riddle share nothing of their personality. But then Dumbledore doesn't /really/ know Harry's personality all that well except from second hand reports. It is precisely the content of those reports that I started this thread asking about. What kind of reports was Dumbledore getting, and how much did they influence him?

McGonagall seems to think Harry is James Junior almost as much as Snape does. Her first instinct in /the Philosopher's Stone/ is to assume Harry is playing a prank on Malfoy and that Harry thinks it is funny that Neville gets caught in the cross fire. She's so convinced of that that she doesn't care to hear any other explanation.

Sprout thinks so little of Harry that he notices that she's acting differently towards him in /the Goblet of Fire./ We have no real indication of Flitwick's impressions of Harry, and Hagrid is warm and fuzzy, but hardly a reliable judge of character.

Dumbledore is a deep thinker and meticulous planner. He certainly called the shots across the series with a skill that any chess master could envy. But how accurately did Aberforth describe Dumbledore when he said that Dumbledore (I'm paraphrasing) lived a life of secrets and lies, learned from their mother? Every comment Albus gives is calculated, even if it is also honest.

Because Dumbledore wanted to speak with him. I'd wager Snape, and Harry, were more privy to Dumbledore's thoughts and doings than McGonagall was. And Harry had omitted facts when Mrs. Norris was attacked.

Dumbledore knew enough after their chat before the Mirror of Erised to discern Harry and Tom Riddle had very little in common. I mean Harry needed reassurance at the CoS that he was nothing like Tom Riddle.
