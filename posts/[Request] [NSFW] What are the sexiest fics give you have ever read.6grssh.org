I don't care about any pairings, hetero/slash/femslash or otherwise, I just want to know what set your pants on fire, so to speak. And read about good sex. Go!

Edit: sorry about the extra 'give' in the title. Autocorrect :(

Edit2: Apparently there's a need to explicitly say I'd like to read about sex between consenting adults...

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
