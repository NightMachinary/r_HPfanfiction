Am I the only one who absolutely hates when Hermione is depicted as the "brightest witch of her age"? Like, really? Are you saying that of all the witches of her age that there are in the entire wizarding world she is the brightest? How do you know?

I think it would have made more sense to describe her as the "brightest witch of her school year".

I also see this a lot with Voldemort, calling him "the worst Dark Lord in history"

When I read a fic with these types of descriptions I just stop reading, I can't stand them


** I always understood “her age” as “among the girls of your age”, and that it basically meant she was the smartest in her year at Hogwarts. Nothing more than that.

**** A number of fanfiction authors out there do in fact make much more of this statement than it deserves. So your milage may vary. I would not necessarily abandon a work just because it uses that sentence, you need to take a deeper look at the context. In the actual cannon books it is a fairly harmless complement, and some works will use it that way. Other works will make her out to be a genius, and in some of those she really is (like linkao3(14281440) and its sequels) while in others she is only thinks she is (I do not think linkao3(14271909) uses that line, but if it did, it would fall in that category) and everything in between.

*** The "That I've ever met" is also slightly important too since, I imagine he hasn't met all that many 13 year old witches outside of the one's he's teaching at that time, some of the girls in his school year from his time as a student and some outliers from above/below him when he was in school.

People often think/mistake it as it being the smartest witch of her generation, which even if it had been that, is still just him saying she's smart for 13/14 years of age

** It's Lupin that says it. It's not a blanket "I R HERMIONE SUPER GOD" statement that people tend to write it as, it's "I'm a bit of a recluse, but you're the brightest 14 year old witch I've met" but people, real or fictional make sweeping statements when that's not what they actually mean.

Hermione could be outclassed by a Wizarding version of AKB48 that attend Mahoutokoro, but Lupin would have never met or heard of them, so the sweeping "Brightest witch of her age" is personal bias due to not knowing others, and compliments usually lack quantifiers, as they're less of a compliment "You're the brightest witch of your age, that i know of... though you're probably beaten by dozens of people that I've never met sorry" is less of a compliment or a boast about your favourite female student.

As for the Voldemort one, people who lived through suffering from one Dark Lord will think that's the worst due to personal experience. You can't tell someone that they didn't suffer because someone in the past suffered worse and add quantifying arguments, that just makes you a dick. If you didn't live through Grindelwald, but your relatives were tortured, murdered and reanimated as Inferi by Voldemort and you had to burn your own little sister's body so she didn't kill you, it wouldn't matter if Grindelwald or Gengis fucking Khan was "Worse" statistically to others, to you, Voldemort was the worst Dark Lord of all time

*** I never thought about it from this point of view, but in this case you're right. But this doesn't change that when I read a sentence like these, they just put me off. I've read few fics where these kind of descriptions are not made objectively, meaning that I don't read them as "you're the brightest witch that I know of" but as "you're the brightest witch of the entire wizarding world".

Maybe I always misunderstood while readingthem, but they just put me off and I usually stop reading that fic.

Sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my first language.

** Lupin said "You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione." That's it. Stans have taken to making this "brightest witch of her age" for no reason other than to prop up the self-insert. No one would deny that Hermione's smart, well-read and hardworking, but she also needs to be some sort of OP!MarySue goddess as well. By now the phase has been altered for well over a decade so I doubt anyone will change it to what it originally was.

In Prisoner of Azkaban this is exactly what Lupin says:- ‘You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.'

Also the context is Lupin has just revealed his collaboration with Sirius and is trying to convince the trio of his good intentions, so it would make sense to flatter Hermione.

**** Well, Lupin isn't qualified to say Herms is the brightest with of the ERA, and it's also very weird to say "You're the brightest witch of the late 20th century I've ever met", it's clearly "you're the brightest 13 year old I ever met", and Hermione is definitely very bright and more importantly, curious and self-driven, but she's not a super-genius, so yeah.

***** That's exactly what I wanted to say. In many fan fictions this sentence that in the books is a normal compliment is exaggerated. The author implies that Hermione is the smartest witch of the 20th century, literally. I also found fics where it was explicitly written that Hermione is "the smartest witch if the century".

** I've always viewed it as it as a schoolyard achievement. "Not bad for Junior Varsity's #1 Lacross Hitter" or "Local High Most accomplished debater (2001-2002.5).

​

Thus on par with Harry being 'The best seeker Hogwarts has seen in a generation' or Ron 'playing the best game of chess'.

​

And when fics use it too seriously the whole thing just becomes comedic. "I'm qualified for Broadway because I was best Supporting Actress of Westerburg High" *snerk*

** Yeah, it's silly. Lupin's just complimenting her when he says it in the book, but it's not like he endows her with a title that everyone in the world knows about. I don't mind if people write her as a genius, but she should have to prove that, to the reader and to the other characters. Aside from getting good grades, most of the especially clever things that Hermione does are things only Harry and Ron know about.

** We have the movies to blame for this, in part. In book 3, Sirius's last words (to Harry) after being rescued are "you really are your father's son." But in the movie, instead his last words are to Hermione instead - "you really are the brightest witch of your age". Like, this guy has spent the whole year as a dog and living in an actual cave, how would he know shit about anything, let alone the other witches at Hogwarts?
