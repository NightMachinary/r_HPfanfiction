Just no crack fanfiction, I want well-written and 'serious' stories.


** Thanks for the mentions, I like the idea probably because its not something i've run into before really, going to read "Its Green" next (already have "Out of the Night" in backlog).

Can't be of help myself but you could see if [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/The-Horror-The-Horror][The Horror! The Horror!]] ("Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.") as mentioned by [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28k72s/looking_for_independent_harry_fics/ciby67z][twofreecents]] in another post is up your alley.

***** I just finished reading "Its Green". I too enjoyed it. The short chapters were a bit annoying though, and I don't really see an overall plot. But the immersion into the magical world was definitely welcome.

**** Yeah, its a shame that Out of the Night is abandoned. It is definitely higher up on the list of stories I wish would be finished.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] may be of interest of you. Slight spoilers below (giving you the reasons why I'm posting about a runes fic on this thread):

As you may have guessed, it mainly involves runes, however he figures out how to use runes to distill plant/herb/mineral "essences", (Which makes for amazing potions ingredients among much more) and eventually teams up with Neville in a non-class herbology project or two. Herbology is not a /huge/ part of the story, but it's not quite a small one either.

Only M/F relationships in it, so no Nev/Harry if you were wondering. Can't recall the main pairing, but it's definitely Harry/cannon female

** Hi, found a fanfic with apothecary/herbology/potions and ingredients that you might like. Only issue is it isn't Harry but Snape. Not too familiar with reddit so will post and PM in case the post doesn't notify you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/The-Apprentice]]

The description doesn't really inspire much but as the title suggests Snape becomes a Potion Masters Apprentice in an apothecary.

There is a little of James/Mauraders (but not much), slightly more about avoiding becoming a Death Eater, it has a decent amount of Lily (mostly correspondence). Really though (even with the above) it deals mostly with him in/around the Apothecary- at least chapter 4 onwards.

It is abandoned. Thanks again - read 'out of the night' which was fantastic and as I already stated loved 'its green' too.

** /It's Green/ reminded me a bit of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«]] (at least the first 25 chapters or so, bit of a herbology focus) and also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and where to find them]] (nature focus again and also child development like /It's Green/). I quite like this type of story as well - wish there was more.
