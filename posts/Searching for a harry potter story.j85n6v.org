Hi i am searching for a story i once read on Archive of our own. I thought i had kept it but i lost the story. Hope that somebody can help me i at least know still some thing about it.

It's some sort of alternate universe or alternate past, where magic never did go away just like the magical beings did not go into hiding, so the modern world is mixed with the old world.\\
They don't travel with the train to hogwarts they have to walk when everybody meets on a certain location. Harry and others are some sort of warriors or maybe vikings, and hermione is abducted on a slave boat i think from new york? So far i know they reached hogwarts i thought it was some sort of harem story and that blaise was a boy who pretends to be girl? And draco was a good guy and family of harry.
