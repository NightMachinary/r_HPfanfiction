So I am just curious because in a lot of fan fiction the students go to the "Gryffindor stands" or whatever. They're certainly separate in the movies.

I'm sure in one of the books there's mention of people from different houses sitting near each, but after a quick skim read I couldn't find that either.


** No, considering Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle are in the same stands as Hermione, Ron and Neville during the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff match in PS.

*** Thank you! I read the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match three times looking for that line, totally forgot there was another match in PS.

** Headcanon: No official separation but people tend to self segregate so it ends up being functionally separated.

** From Prisoner of Azkaban:

#+begin_quote
  Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like "GO GRYFFINDOR!" and "LIONS FOR THE CUP' Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green;
#+end_quote

So students do seem to congregate together in the crowd.

Incidentally this quote is also the one time in the books that we're given an actual figure for the number of students at Hogwarts (800, assuming that the houses are of equal size). How to reconcile that number with the apparent number of teachers is tricky, however.

Coincidentally, if you assume that almost all British wizards attend Hogwarts, that gives you a birth rate of around 115/year. And if you then assume an average wizarding life expectancy of 150 years, that would give you a British wizarding population of 17,250, which does feel about right for the character of the community.

In Victoria Potter I reduce the size of Hogwarts to around 500 students, but also say that approximately half of all invitees reject the invitation to attend, which gives you an annual birth rate of around 140. That produces a wizarding population of 21,000. On top of that you have the other beings within Ministry jurisdiction Ministry such as goblins, centaurs, ghosts, trolls, merpeople, vampires, hags, etc. which gives you a ballpark figure of, say, 30,000 beings within wizarding Britain.

*** There are other hints at such number of students, like when there are over a hundred carriages to transport the students to Hogsmeade, the Yule Ball having over a thousand seats and most significantly Harry mentioned there to be 31 students in the class with Umbridge, we know that DADA is taken without other houdrd and that there is a similar amount of each of them, meaninf the birth rate is probably something like 120/year.

** I just dug through ALL of the official chapter art for the US books.

[[https://www.harrypotterfanzone.com/pictures/11-hermiones-helping-hand/]]

BUT, this might be a publisher decision. Maybe.

[[https://www.sweetpetescandy.com/products/mini-puzzle-harry-potter-quidditch]]

This puzzle was made by the same artist, and has a different design, yet same art style.

Inconclusive. About the seating style. If it was like the first picture, I can see each house (or side) having designated seating. If it was the other one? Yeah right, Malfoy and company aren't going to climb that many stairs just to get into an argument.

** My hypothesis is that different sections of the stadium are merely decorated in different House colors/motifs. Students might tend to gravitate towards their own House colors, but if that part of the stadium is full, you might end up sitting in the Ravenclaw section instead of the Gryffindor section. No one is going to ask you to move because you're in the wrong section, and it's not assigned seating.

** I think this is an image from the movies, though. Since the House colours are quite distinct in the movie version. But I don't think it stands true for the book version.

** perhaps not designated areas for each house but you would probably end up with mostly house groups just necause that's how people are

** They're not segregated by house, seeing as first year Neville and Ron get into a fist fight with Draco, Crabbe and Goyle in the stands during one of the matches.

However, most students would sit with their own house. It makes no sense for Slytherin supporters to sit next to Gryffindors in a Gryffindor v Slytherin match.
