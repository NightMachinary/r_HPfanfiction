i was scrolling through fanfics and i came across this as a summary for one of them

"What if the abuse hardened Harry instead of braking him?"

and was wondering if there well written fics with this premise there are plenty where harry is broken and canon harry seems well adjusted even though he shouldn't be

no slash no fem!harry no hinny or harmony and no bashing


** Sounds like "Brutal Harry" to me.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
