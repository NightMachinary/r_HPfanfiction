Hello! So I was wondering, after reading an interesting Naruto Fic called "Dattebayo, Taich≈ç!" (If I remember correctly), which had the cast of Naruto finding the Bleach manga series and emulating the Gotei 13. I was wondering if there was anything like that in the HP fandom, where characters find some fiction and base themselves off of it. If you find some, please give me the links! Thank you!
