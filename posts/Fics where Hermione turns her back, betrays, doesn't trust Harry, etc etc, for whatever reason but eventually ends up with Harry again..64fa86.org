  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

Also it's bloody fanfiction if you want only canon hermione than read and watch canon. This is a story with different sitiuations that magnify a few character traits and dim a few thereby making different characters, and sitiuations but at the core the same persons. Don't like it, don't read it.

Just hypothetically, if I were to write a fic with a Manipulative!Dumbledore who keeps trying to oppress Independent!Powerful!Harry while yammering on about Greater Good, but does it in a laughably inept ways that are easily foiled by Harry, you would call it bashing; but if I then revealed that the reason he (Dumbledore) is like that is that in /this/ fic, he suffered a severe head injury during his battle with Grindelwald, you would no longer call it bashing because now there's a "reason" for it?

But, you're right. I guess I owe you genuine thanks for saving me the time I would have spent reading this fic before dropping it in disgust.

************** No. Just like real life if they actually have problems that make them this way it is not bashing. Bashing is when you degrade a character for no reason other than entertainment value.

Secondly are you retarted or something. Do you not know what bashing is. If dumbledore treated harry less than right because he is going to die, and harry treats the headmaster like crap, because he somehow found out about this, and dumbledore has tried everything to get rid of the hocrux, but than through circumstance or magic the hocrux is gone, and dumbledore tries to be a better person that is not bashing. When everything above, but instead he continues being unreasnable (harry and dumbledore) that is bashing.

In this story dumbledore while vindictive, and let his emotions get the better of him still believes harry is a hocrux so he doesn't want a happy person(like dumbledore did in the books and movies.)Harry wouldn't be willing to sacrifice himselfif he was happy.

Could this story be improved? Yes like all storys, but it does not have pointless bashing. If it is bashing it is there for a reason. God you are an idiot to not understand this. Characters in popular culture are 'bashed' yet none complain about it because it is there for a reason.
