So basically it is a growing tree and you have to groom it, like cutting away useless rooms it grows form time to time, those that have too ridiculous dimensions or are treating to push aside important rooms.

And it is the oldest still lived in Housenut-tree in Britain and someone wants to put it under protection and that means someone has to live in it because only then they can create new nuts.

I know silly idea, but maybe someone likes it
