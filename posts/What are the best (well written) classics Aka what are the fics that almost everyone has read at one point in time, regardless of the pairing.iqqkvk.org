** AU style classics probably include most of Joe, Skitterleap and Valbone, Boy Who Lived, most of jbern, probably a good chunk of the DLP library. If your reading tastes overlap with this at all you've probably read at least one or two of those.

The more "modern" classics (as in this sub) would be MOR, Prince of Slytherin, and Seventh Horcrux, controversial as all of them are. Personally I've only read PoS, although I imagine more experienced readers have at least started all three of them.

Cauterize is a pretty classic short fic, I think most people who've read a lot of fic have read it at a point.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

** Since you seem to be new I think the most spoken of fanfic you are likely to find is linkffn(My Immortal) it is such a famous fic that even some people who didn't really enter the fandom know about it. For all the content based around it you wouldn't be incorrect in saying that it outgrew the concept of merely classical.

Other than that linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is another very known about, though not in the same scale as the previous.

Linkffn(Partially kissed Hero) is a quick read for when you are feeling particularly bored.

Beyond that one's there is also the moral anchor that is “For the Love of Magic by Noddlehammer“ at ffn, it leaves you with such a warm and lighthearted feeling after reading each chapter and Harry's actions on this one are always so heroic and true pillars of ethics, it truly embroiled the famous principle of “Do what is right, not what is easy”... it really don't get enough recognition!

** I think your shipping tendencies are going to color this pretty powerfully. Also--how long you've been reading, because some of my "classics" predate AO3 and I never read HP extensively on FFN. Luckily, most of my favorites ended up on AO3. I pretty much don't read straight ships, so I haven't read /any/ of the fics listed so far.

When I think of classics, I think of linkao3(742072) A Year Like None Other by Aspeninthesunlight, which is gen. I fell out of love with the later works in the series, but the original, IMHO, stands as a classic.

I think of linkao3(46784) Gold-Tinted Spectacles by Beren (Drarry) (I haven't read this one in a long time but I remember when it was /the rec/ back in the day)

A more recent example that I think WILL be a classic is linkao3(12006417) Survival is a Talent by Shanastoryteller (which I will rec at the top of my lungs forever). Drarry also.

If it's not, it 1000% should be: linkao3(6334630) The Sum of Their Parts (dark golden trio, AMAZING).

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  Harry is about to enter his seventh year, and things are not quite what he expected. He is no longer the angry boy who watched his world fall apart at the end of his fifth year, but neither has he completely found his place yet. He is looking for something, and to his confusion it seems to involve Draco Malfoy. Set for revelations that will shake his whole world view, Harry must deal with unstable magic, far too many secrets, love, kidnapping, his dead godfather, and of course Voldemort and his lackeys. It's going to be a busy year.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** Agree with the poster above that shipping preferences will probably influence this. Personally, I've always been a canon shipper, so for me, my classics all live on sites like Checkmated (RIP that site) and Sugar Quill. A well-regarded "classic" written during the "three-year summer" was Arabella and Zsenya's "After the End", which probably still exists on the Quill site.

  Malfoy's handsome face was contoured into a condescending smirk. "No faith in that giant brain of yours, Granger?" She looked up at him defiantly. "Maybe I don't have faith in you!" she said, raising her voice. Malfoy only looked at her. "You'll find I'm very surprising." Dramione AU, Year 6 with a slow burn and a killer twist. Book I of "This World or Any Other" series. COMPLETE.
