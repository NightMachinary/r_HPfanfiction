Whenever the topic of Wizarding Britain's population comes up, a common response is to say that there are 280 students at Hogwarts. However, the logic (or lack thereof) used to come up with 280 students attending Hogwarts makes zero sense. It makes several assumptions such as:

- That there would be roughly 40 students each and every year, with no major deviations whatsoever.

- That every single Hogwarts house has the same number of students

- That every single Hogwarts house has the same gender ratio

- That having 40 students in a year is even the default average (Harry's year would be lower than normal given the First Wizarding War)

- That the number of children born in the earlier parts of the war (1970-1977) wouldn't be significantly higher than those born during the peak of Voldemort's power (1978-1981).

For one thing, we know there is far more than 280 students attending Hogwarts based on three main factors. Firstly, JKR stated that the list of 40 students was basically a reference guide for herself if she needs to use recurring background characters. It was NEVER meant to mean that Harry's year only had 40 students, but rather JKR only chose to write down 40 names for her own use if she needed to have recurring side characters appear. For example, some characters mentioned in Harry's sorting either never get mentioned again (MacDougal and Moon), others get a single reappearance at best (Blaise Zabini gets sorted in PS, but doesn't appear again until HBP), and most of the characters on JKR's list never get mentioned in the books at all.

For example, if JKR needed Harry to interact with some random Slytherin in his year who wasn't too closely tied to Draco and/or Pansy, she could just look through the aforementioned Class List and then simply use one of the characters on that list who Harry hadn't met yet and whom we don't already know their Hogwarts house. Case in point: Blaise Zabini in HBP. We saw him sorted in PS, but he's introduced as if Harry wouldn't have known him prior to HBP. Especially since Gryffindors and Slytherins share Potions class together, so it would be basically impossible for Harry to not really know him. Yet Harry and Blaise act like their meeting in HBP on the Hogwarts Express is their first encounter. To a lesser extent, this happened with McLaggen also in HBP (how would Harry not know him if McLaggen went to Gryffindor's Quidditch tryouts?)

Secondly, JKR wrote the series imagining their to be 1000 students total and roughly 3000 total witches and wizards. The 3000 figure is debatable since less than 2000 out of that 3000 would be adults in employment. It also doesn't count non-human beings (i.e. Goblins, House Elves), nor does it count the number of magical creatures. However, we know that Hogwarts definately has about 1000 students because in POA, there is a mention of roughly 200 Slytherins in the Quidditch stands which means that it is canonically impossible for there to only be 280 students attending Hogwarts. Assuming slightly similar numbers across the four houses, it means that there are at least 800 or 900 students at Hogwarts in canon.

The mistake that most people make is they assume because JKR only mentioned 40 names on the Class List that there only about 40 new students per year, and most people also assume that Harry's year of Gryffindors making up 8 people(5 Gryffindor boys, Hermione, Lavender, and Parvati) means that each house is getting about 8-10 students each year. Its more likely that the dorm rooms can expand to accommidate increased numbers of students sorted. So if there were 10 Gryffindor boys in Harry's year, then the inside of the dorm room would be expanded to hold 10 beds. Harry's year would have a lower than average number of students, and it makes sense that in Ginny's year there would be an significant increase in new students, and even moreso during Dennis Creevey's year two years later since Wizarding Britain would be in relative peace.

Finally, and this is the important thing, the actual wizarding world at large is much bigger than most people thing. Case in point: the fact that the Ministry has about 500 staff working on the Quidditch World Cup. Meaning that the Ministry can't have less than 500 people. I always got the assumption that the Ministry made up a significant amount of the employment in Wizarding Britain because of how important the Statute of Secrecy is. This isn't even getting into the minimum number of people required for several locals British Quidditch teams along with the England National Quidditch Team. Let alone the sheer number of different departments and offices and suboffices in the Ministry, and the total amount of Ministry workers needed to run the Ministry as it is in canon.

In the UK, roughly 20% of the population are 17-years old or younger. This means that 80% of the UK population are 18-years old or older. However considering that wizards live much longer than Muggles, the actual percentage of adults in Wizarding Britain would be closer to 90% of the population IMO, but I'll just use the original 80% figure to make this easier.

If Hogwarts has roughly 800-1000 students and is made up of students aged 11-18, it would be fair to say that the number of witches and wizards in Wizarding Britain who are 18-years old or younger would be roughly 2000-2500. This is by multiplying the number of Hogwarts students by 2.5, since the difference of 11-18 is 7, and 7 multiplied by 2.5 is 17.5, it means multiplying the Hogwarts student population by 2.5 gives the total child population of Wizarding Britain.

Therefore, if the number of witches and wizards aged between 0 and 18-years old is around 2000 to 2500, then the adult population of Wizarding Britain would be closer to 8000-10000. Meaning that the overall population of Wizarding Britain would either be around 10,000, to maybe 12,500 on the higher end. From a world-building perspective, Wizarding Britain having a total population of 10,000 just makes sense in terms of how canon portrays the Ministry and various jobs.

*TL;DR: There are more than 280 students at Hogwarts. JKR's list of 40 names for Harry's year was NEVER meant to mean that there were only 40 students in Harry's year. Hogwarts has bare minimum 800 students. Wizarding Britain has a population of around 10,000 witches and wizards (8000 of which are adults). JKR's answer of 3000 total population in Wizarding Britain makes no sense given that 800-1000 out of that 3000 would be Hogwarts students.*


** I definitely agree with you on the numbers in the school. I personally think that the overall population is higher for the same reasons Achille-Talon mentioned.

However, I have one major problem with the numbers at Hogwarts, and that is the teachers. It's a problem that exists in canon, too. How can McGonagall teach 7 years of classes? If each House in each year pre-OWLs has a class, that's four classes per year for five years, then one to two classes per year for the two NEWT years, for a total of 22-24 classes. And if they meet for an hour 2, 3 times per week? That's anywhere from 44 to 72 class sessions to fit into, presumably, 5 days. The lower estimate could be physically possible, if McGonagall somehow taught for 9 hours every day (on top of duties as Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor). Furthermore, if there are 800 students at Hogwarts and everyone has to take Transfiguration through 5th year, McGonagall is teaching over 570 kids.

Teaching 570 kids for 9 hours a day? Plus grading? It just doesn't work.

This, of course, applies to all of the "core subject" teachers.

Maybe I'm applying logic to a place in the series that shouldn't have logic applied. But as far as I know, there's only ever been one teacher per subject in canon and that's the best argument I know of for a smaller school.

To be clear, I don't think the solution is to make Hogwarts smaller; I think the school needs more teachers.

Edit: I based this on the assumption that not all of the classes are taught to two houses. Potions (plus Herbology, and maybe some other core classes too) is different, having both Gryffindor and Slytherin, and the electives are a whole other thing entirely. I didnt know about that reference Luna makes to Ginny being in her Transfiguration class.

So maybe all the classes are doubled up by house. It would make sense given the number of students per class, and "Harry is a lovable, oblivious idiot" is a rather logical argument.

I love the time turner idea, though! it would be amazing to see a fic using that. I feel like that could either get very cracky or very dark.

*** Actually we always hear that they share classes in groups of two houses.

Though considering the size of Hogwarts, I'd think alongside the amount of fanon discontinued classes. As well as names such as "Charms Corridor", "Transfiguration Courtyard" etc. Suggests that at one point there might've been multiple teachers for each class. But the student size dwindled the the point where it was considered useless to have that many teachers.

True, but it's still years 1-7, which is a super long time with just one professor dealing with so many students, per class.

In my headcanon, Minerva later ends up hiring two professors per class, it still seems difficult, but more manageable,

For instance: Professor one of Transfigurations teaches years 1-4. While Professor two of Transfiguration teaches years 5-7. Professor one of Charms teaches years 1-4, Professor two of Charms teaches years 5-7. And so on and so forth. That's a lot more easier on the Professors, I feel.

They share some classes but not others such as Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. Presumably because those classes have the size and don't need to share a potentially limited space such as Greenhouses or Potions classroom.

**** This is canon, sort of. There's a mention of a department of Transfiguration that Minerva joined (whilst Dumbledore was still there too).

I think one can speculate that the main Professors are scheduled by Dumbledore to always have Harry (so theoretically he'd have the 'best' education). For example, at my school they scheduled it so the main mathematics teacher would always be teaching us maths because they thought our class had a particular knack for it (which was quite true and it worked).

Harry is just oblivious to the intricacies because it's not relevant to him.

Basically I can buy Harry-as-narrator just not mentioning the other (e.g. Transfiguration) Professor, since he has McGonagall, wtf does he care that the other classes have Professor Sedgwick - he never interacts with him, so he doesn't come up in the story.

I can also buy the idea that there's only one teacher for each subject during Harry's years because wartime = fewer kids = less students/classes, and in more normal times, there would be more teachers hired.

EDIT because I haven't seen it mentioned yet: Also wartime losses = fewer skilled adult wizards to take teaching roles = making do with fewer teachers by doubling up on schedules etc.

I mean, we see Trelawney and Firenze sharing Divination classes, and Pottermore tells us that both Dumbledore and McGonagall were teaching Transfiguration at one point, so multiple teachers for one subject is very much a thing.

The only sticking point for me is the whole big plot point around THE Dark Arts position being cursed. idk it just seems like if there's potentially multiple DADA Profs at any one time, it's not... such a big deal? Less 'woooo-ooooo this position is cuuuuursed' haha.

*** Another solution, perhaps, is that the teachers have access to Time Turners. I'm not suggesting this is the canonical reason (let's be honest, it all falls on Rowling just not being great at math, something she confesses to), but it would be an interesting and plausible answer.

After all, they got special dispensation to give one to Hermione just so she could take extra classes. It's not /unreasonable/ to think the teachers may have also gotten dispensation to use them to cover all the classes.

Of course, a lot of this falls apart when you think about the further ramifications. Quirrel, Lockhart, Umbridge and the Carrows with Time Turners sounds fucking horrific.

See my other post for just one potential suggestion of how Quidditch players' revenue could be independent from their number of fans. But depending on how expensive professional Quidditch tickets and merchandise are, it needn't even be.

/If/ you want to go with a Galleon value such that 1000G is a king's ransom, for example, then just 400 fans who pay 10G for entry is an entirely viable business plan, assuming they play a match a month --- especially if you factor in merchandise and the fact that some (most?) Quidditch players may be independently wealthy to an extent like Harry is, not necessarily in a "millionaire" sense but in a "could easily live without the job for a year if need be" sense of wizards who strictly speaking don't need to buy much of anything to survive.

Also and unrelatedly, something you fail to mention that might also increase the total population is that the usual Muggle way of eyeballing from number of children to number of wizards may very well not apply --- since wizards tend get married younger, and to live much, much, /much/ older. Probably a very significant percentage of the Wizarding World's population is over a hundred.

My headcanon says that the schools JKR mentions on Pottermore are the best magical schools in the world by reputation. There would be other smaller schools in most countries with a significant magical population.

Also it is plausible that wizarding culture is significantly different from muggle culture that the /same/ racial tensions don't exist among wizards.

***** Yes of course. A civil war is nothing short of catastrophic in smaller societies. If a society is 10k strong, and a thousand die in the conflict, that hit to the population (10%) is potentially enough to completely destroy that country/community.

To put it into perspective, France had lost roughly 5% of its population in WW1, including a whopping 25% of its male youth population - and twenty years later, the Germans rolled over them with ease, and the big hit to their population is a big factor. I know that people like to troll France for surrendering so quickly, but when a country has lost that much manpower just two decades ago, there isn't much that it can do. Demographic collapse is completely debilitating to a country.

You'd need a larger population as a society just to survive a civil war. It's why I said that even 300k is pushing the limits.

****** Great Britain's population is 66 million people. If Magical Britain only has 300k people, that means that Wizards make up only 0.0045% of the population- more than enough to justify their ability to hide themselves without notice from Muggle society, as well as explaining why the Statue of Secrecy is necessary.

By that logic, if 10% of the population is between 11 and 17, then Magical Britain has at least 30,000 children in need of schooling. This means that either Hogwarts needs to be expanded to put it in the same scale as a large university, or there needs to be multiple magical schools in Great Britain- at least ten, if each school has a population of about 3000 students.

This means that Voldemort's forces should be significantly larger, magical education needs to be heavily expanded, and the "everybody knows everybody" mentality present in the books and fanfic should go out the window. It's too bad not enough authors choose to go this route.

First, don't try to understand wizarding economy. The wizards have an economy for their own convenience (they don't really /need/ one), and it is nothing like the Muggle one, since by necessity it relies only on services and luxury goods. If the wizarding market crashed, the direst consequence would be that Minister Fudge would make a speech declaring, no, we're going to keep pretending the Galleon is worth what's it's always been worth, and everyone would keep pretending, and there would be absolutely no crisis.

Second, if this particular bothers you, I've seen the suggestion that 1000 Galleons isn't /actually/ that much money (substantial, but not impressive) and that it's actually stayed the same since the Middle-Ages, when it /was/ impressive.

This is just flat out wrong. Their economy is considerably more than services and luxury goods - they do have agriculture, manufacturing and mining industries, albeit on a smaller scale. The fact that they use gold, silver and bronze as token currency is a clear indicator of a mining industry. The suits of armour present in Hogwarts didn't appear out of thin air either - Transfiguration does not last forever, and no one is mad enough to transfigure them back each time the previous caster of the spell died - which means they were cast and forged. Since Filch can't clean shit, they're magical in some form or the other, and protected from corrosion.

There's also cauldrons, which have standards, something Percy Weasley would like educate you on. There are different materials with which these cauldrons are cast and forged, from pewter all the way to solid gold. There's knives that every single wizard uses for Potions, and these knives are forged in a way that they are either impervious or at least resistant to the corrosive nature of ingredients that find use in certain Potions. There's also ones made of silver.

Then there is the fact that there is some technomancy going on behind the scenes. Magic destroys the laws of physics on a regular basis, but the WWN exists, and radios that work in magical environments like Hogwarts exist. Same goes for cameras. There's nothing to suggest that more appliances like these aren't there either, so the manufacturing of technomagical appliances is there.

Of course, wands, brooms, snitches and bludgers - these are the most obvious ones. There are multiple broom manufacturers, enough to suggest that they are small to moderately sized companies, and while wandmaking and quidditch ball-crafting can be done by one or two individuals, that still makes them cottage industries.

None of those things can be luxury goods, wands least of all.

There's obviously clothing and apparel - there would not be clothes shops if people could just wear transfigured clothes all day.

  1000 Galleons isn't actually that much money
#+end_quote

When you consider the fact that the Weasleys had to use second hand wands for multiple children, and that wands are the second most expensive item on their shopping lists for school (lol) at 7 galleons, a thousand galleons is quite a lot. Back in the 90s, the record transfer fees for football players were in the 10-20 million GBP range, so a thousand galleons would be the equivalent of, say, a million pounds or so, if the two worlds were equivalent. Since they're not, it'd be something in the area of 100k GBP, which is still a lot of money, especially back then. The five pounds to a galleon conversion is, of course, retarded.

Match tickets and commercial merchandise sales, both of which are income sources the fans are directly responsible for, are the single largest means for clubs to make money.

700-1000 people at each match won't be enough.

Sponsorship won't work for the sole reason that the population is too low. If it is as low as 10k (or even 300k as I suggested), then every time a new line of products comes out, literally the entire customer base will know about the release on release day itself. Sponsorships are a means for a company to boost their brand and advertise their products - and why would anyone pay to advertise when word of mouth already does it so well for free?

Lucius may be insanely rich, but he's not insane to throw around money that he's never going to make back.

Here's something interesting about WC 2018 - Iceland may have had only 3 matches in the entire tournament, but 66,000 fans showed up at the WC to support their country. That's 20% of their total population. Tell me, if they can manage to do that when they're not even the host nation, then a smaller country's citizens being unable to get tickets where they'd make up just 10% of the overall seats? Fudge is a people-pleaser, he would definitely do something as harmless as this (10% of all tickets at the final reserved for British citizens before a specific date) if it meant boosting his ratings.

If there are about a thousand students at Hogwarts, and Hogwarts covers 7 years of a person's life, and we assume that wizards live to around 130-150, then that would put the population around 20,000.

Personally, I put the student population at about 500, then I consider those who don't go to Hogwarts, maybe even bump up the average lifespan, and I usually end up with around 15,000.

I think she admitted some years ago that she messed up the numbers.

She built a great backstory and plot, but she didn't expect the readers/fans to be so thorough in their analysis.

Take Dumbledore, for example. When adding up everything he says or does he comes across as either massively incompetent or outright evil. He was warned against the Dursleys, and he admitted later that he knew that they treated Harry badly, yet he did nothing. He let both Snape and the majority of students bully Harry. He did nothing when several students were petrified. Why was Lupin the only werewolf to attend Hogwarts? What was that bullshit with taking the house cup from Slytherin and give it to Gryffindor? Why did he pair the most antagonistic houses (Gryffindor/Slytherin) in the most dangerous classes (potions)?

She did it for the plot, of course, otherwise it would have been a bit boring. But that created problems for Dumbledore as a character.

It doesn't matter at all that there could be possibly more unnamed students or larger years, it just doesn't work if you don't also come up with a bunch of never mentioned teachers and classes.

Lets just look at McGonagall's schedule. If I assume that all years are as small as Harry's year and it's always a mixed class with 2 of the houses and every student has at least 2 Transfiguration classes per week (which seems low), that makes: 7 years * (2 times per week * 2 classes per yeargroup) = 28 lectures/classes to teach and prepare per week.

Maybe people were killed, maybe they didn't want to risk their child being targeted and so never had children.

But when there wasn't a war, I'd imagine a lot more students. In particular, I use this for the Next Generation after Harry and co.

A lot more people have children, either ranging from just one child, to most generally three or four, at the most.

I don't see the Weasley children wanting more than three children of their own; likely from remembering how often they were forced to wear hand-me-downs and the like, they wouldn't want their child to feel overshadowed either.

But even so, I'd definitely can see the next generation having more children than previous years.

People like Malfoy only have one child, while I see other families wanting at least two children, at most.

I often see Teddy's year having a decent amount of kids, but still having less, but once we get to Victoire's year, I see there being more students.

The school at any rate needs more teachers, I'm not very good at math, but just imagining the teachers trying to teach students from let's say 7 in the morning to perhaps 4 to 5 in the evening, it would be overwork and lead to passing outs from the professors, just not feasible to me.

There's 1-7 years, there's two houses, per class. Either Gryffindor with Slytherins, Hufflepuffs with Ravenclaws or switch and flipping them occasionally, that's a lot of students either way, and too few professors. In my headcanon, Minerva hires more professors. Like how with Divination we had Trelawney and Firenze, in Defence Against the Dark Arts we get two Professors, Transfigurations two Professors and the like.

That still feels like less Professors than is needed, but it would be more helpful; to me, at least.

** Copying from a post I made about this a few months ago:...

Magical population has always bothered me in this. The world building makes it seem like there are a lot more than people write about. If you just take the population of the British isles in 2000 (58.8 million), and there are only 10k magicals, that is just 0.01701 % of the population. I find it difficult to imagine that magicals could even find each other with that low of a percentage, especially when you look at population levels when the "founders" were around. Would the magical population even justify an entire castle for a school (or a school of any kind). The estimated population of the British isles around 1100 AD was 1.9 million people, using the above magical calculation, that would be 325 magicals total around when Hogwarts was founded. Also, i feel like the size of the magical government is not justified by just 10k magical people, let alone 325 people.

However, if the magical population is just .5% of total population, then that would be 294,000 people alone, which would help justify a large school, and the government that they seam to have (just in UK).

​

Another thing I would like to add to this, is that the population would grow just based on when they have children. Based on the books alone, it looks as thought most magicals have their children in their 20's (young for people who can live up to 120+ years old), and if this trend is old, or continues, than the population would go up just based on buildup (not enough people dying to offset newborns). This is also discounting wars...
