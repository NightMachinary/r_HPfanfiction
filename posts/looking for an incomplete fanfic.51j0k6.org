I remember reading this one incomplete fanfiction. It was really long, like 92 chapters, but I can't seem to remember it now. All I remember was that Hermione ended up going to Japan, it was an HHr fic, and that it ended with the Ministry being investigated by the International Confederation for Wizards.


** I suggest searching "Longest Harry Potter Fanfiction Community". There are many that would fit this.

Off the top of my head, I remember Accidental Animagus having near that amount, but I have no idea if Hermione goes to japan.
