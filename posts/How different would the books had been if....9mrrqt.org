**** I think a lot of smaller details would change but that the bigger picture would stay mostly the same. Narcissa already loves Draco a lot, so I doubt fem!Draco's relationship with her would be different enough to affect the story.

Her hanging out with Crabbe and Goyle could go either way tbh. But even if she went with new friends, I still don't know what could be changed on the bigger side of things.

I'm not really sure what you mean by the boyfriend in sixth year thing. Draco didn't care about girls much in sixth year, right? Why would fem!Draco suddenly care? Because girls must get boyfriends? lol

** Maybe this is chauvinistic, but I cannot see Harry acting the same way towards a a female Malfoy. In fact, I don't think she'd be a main antagonist for him in the school at all. In canon, the girls mostly bully other girls (Pansy -> Hermione, for example), while the boys (Montague, Flint, Crabbe, Goyle, and, of course Draco) are the ones that actively bully Harry (dressing up as dementors, altercations in the hallways, etc).

The only way a girl Draco would have a major role, I think, is if the 6'th year cabinet arc got expanded, but before that I don't think she'd be important to the story.

However, during 6'th year, if she gets drafted by Voldemort as well, then that would set her on a collision course with Harry, and there's a lot that could change; namely, a romantic arc that the FF writer in me is perking up at.
