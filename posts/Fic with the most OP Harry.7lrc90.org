Which fanfic hosts the most outrageously overpowered version of Harry Potter? The "Merlin is a weak chump" kind of overpowered.


** The 11-year-old Harry was sitting on his seat on the Hogwarts Express for the first time, Ron sitting opposite him, when they heard a knocking on the window.

Glancing outside, the two of them noticed...an absolutely HUGE, rainbow-scaled, feather-winged snake flying alongside the train, staring directly at Harry through the train's window.

/HARRY POTTER,/ the feathered serpent sort-of spoke, /I HAVE BEEN BID BY MY MASTER, HE WHO IS GOD ABOVE GODS, TO DELIVER A MESSAGE THROUGH TIME AND SPACE TO YOU./

With a quiet pop, a rolled up scroll appeared in the air in front of Harry's eyes, and fell down onto his lap.

/YOU ARE TO READ IT AND CARRY OUT THE NUMERICALLY ORDERED INSTRUCTIONS WITHIN./

Sparing a glance at Ron, who had fainted from sheer shock at the sight of the giant snake, Harry nodded slightly before unfurling the scroll.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
"Step 1: Say the following words out loud;" Harry read the scroll aloud, then paused and frowned at the next sentence, "'I, Harry Potter, hereby claim all of the magical power I am entitled to, as sole beneficiary of the sacrifice of blood and life by Lily Potter-slash-Evans, so mote/may it be', whichever you prefer, just read it aloud and it'll make sense-"

The Boy-Who-Lived was interrupted in his reading as his body began to glow like a light bulb, and swirling winds...swirled, around him, not just rattling but smashing the windows, tearing up the seat cushions, gouging the hardwood and plucking a few feathers from Hedwig's tail for good measure.

Harry looked up, very confused, until the giant feathery snake from before stuck its head through the now shattered window, /NOW, THE NEXT STEP/.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Harry hurriedly nodded again and turned his attention back to the parchment, "Step 2..."

After reading it silently, the 11-year-old pointed awkwardly at the snake's head, "U-um...I dub you Kukulkan and bind you as my familiar," he said, checking the scroll again to make sure he got it right.

With another flash of light, a string of energy shot out from Harry's finger, wrapping itself around the giant snake before /squeeeeezing/, shrinking the now-dubbed Kukulkan down to the size of a bracelet around Harry's arm.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
"Step 3:" Harry read, after glancing at Ron (he was still out of it), "...'I wish to go immediately to the Ultra-Super-Duper-Evil Planet'."

With a loud POOF, Harry vanished from the Hogwarts Express, and reappeared in a dark, dingy, smoky city.

Next to him was a sign: [Welcome to the World of the Irredeemably Vile Bastards! We're so evil, we don't even have a word for being not-evil! Even our flora and fauna are evil! We hope you hate your stay!]

As Harry stared at the sign, a blonde man with a cane wandered past, musing aloud to himself, "What shall I do today? I know, I'll make all of my slaves who have Horcruxes eat each other alive, then treat the survivors to a musical performance with my badly-tuned bagpipes!"

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
Harry stared incredulously at the man walking past, before looking back down at the list.

Step 4 was a bit longer than the first few; /Step 4: Kill everyone on this planet, declaring them a blood sacrifice to your familiar, Kukulkan. On occasion, order Kukulkan to transfer the power he receives from the sacrifices to you. Once you have enough power, vaporise the planet, that'll get rid of the remaining few million with Horcruxes (trust me, they're evil)./

Harry stared at the parchment. He glanced back at the blonde man heading down the street, who was now wondering aloud if the screams of people under Cruciatus could replicate a pipe organ. He stared down at the parchment again.

/Cruciatus is the most powerful pain-inducing curse known to mortals and can destroy someone's mind within 5 minutes. Horcruxes are worse. Trust me, these gits are capital-E Evil./

Harry shrugged, looked down at Kukulkan on his wrist (who hissed encouragingly at him), before he turned and pointed his finger at the Irredeemably Vile Bastard.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-4
   :END:
*One truly epic bloodbath, and one Death Star's worth of planet vaporising, later...*

Harry was feeling quite a bit stronger after blowing up the World of the Irredeemably Vile Bastards.

Actually, 'feeling quite a bit stronger' might have been an understatement; he could /see/ the entire universe in his mind, stars and suns and planets and moons, right down to the merest molecules of gas in that nebula over there. He was quite tempted to rearrange a few things to spell out rude words, actually.

Harry didn't even bother turning his head to read what the scroll said next; /Step 5: Send a copy of this scroll, and a clone of Kukulkan, back in time to the Hogwarts Express where you were. Order the copy-Kukulkan to make sure past-you reads it and follows its instructions./

With a slight flick of his head, a giant feathered snake, holding a rolled-up parchment coiled in its tail, briefly flashed into being, before vanishing through time into the past.

/Step 6: Through the power of ridiculous amounts of blood sacrifice, you are now utterly omniscient and omnipotent. Congratulate yourself on being the most OP Harry Potter ever written in fanfiction./
