I'm trying to find some good completed or at least recently updated fanfiction that's mostly set in the star wars world- I'd prefer Harry centric fic but open to other characters


** Havoc of the force.

** There's linkffn(13213130) which has a interesting idea behind the story. I'm also reading linkffn(12390364) though it is primarily because of Thrawn and finding the fic while rereading the Thrawn Trilogy. Though that doesn't diminish the great story idea behind the fic.

  All my life I had no control. Not when I was with the Dursleys on Earth, and certainly not when I ended up on Nar Shaddaa as a pickpocketing street-kid. Joining the Sith Empire's Imperial Intelligence was supposed to bring order to that chaos. But one awfully timed invitation to magical school later, and my control was stripped once again. VeryAU, ImpAgentHarry, non-forceuserHarry.

  Thrawn is known to be ruthless & highly intelligent. What happens when one of his conscripts happens to be witch from a newly conquered planet with diverse cultures, different mind sets. Can she come to terms with her imperial service? Will she fail to stay alive? Will he figure out that one of his conscripts is more than she appears to be? FemaleHARRY Genre:Wrong-child-who-lived.
