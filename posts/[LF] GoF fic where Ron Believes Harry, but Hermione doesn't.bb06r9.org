It's the canon event used heavily for Ron Bashing, but has anyone tried playing it the other way, where Ron sticks with Harry and Hermione leaves.


** I can't offer a rec, but a good way to justify it might be to bring Rita Skeeter into the story earlier and have Hermione start out believing what she says and writes because if it's in a printed source, it must be true (a key facet and later arc for Hermione coming in earlier) as well as dovetailing into the appeal to authority that early Hermione also is fond of and somewhat echoing her COS reaction to Lockhart. This would be cementing a character flaw for Hermione who runs the risk for a lot of the books of being perceived as perfect.

This would also make Hermione's later turn on Rita more personal and provide an arc of personal growth as she learns something on-page instead of at the start of each book already having all the required knowledge built in for that year's plots.

** I don't think I ever saw it (Ron often stick with Hermione when she leaves Harry since it gives the occasion to change Harry friendship, often for a Slytherin) but I have to say that Ron did believe Harry in canon, or at least came around pretty fast.

​

At first, Ron was dissapointed that Harry put his name in Goblet without telling him (6th son at home and now just dumb friend of the hero, teenage insecurities and things like that). But even there, Harry takes a good part of the blame for being extremely aggressive with Ron (yelling at him, lauching a pin to his head. . .), which made any reconciliation harder.

And I do belive that for a time, Ron also acted like Percy, in the sense that he knew he was wrong, but could not recognize it and ask for forgiveness (until he saw best friend almost dying).

​

At this point, I'm really bored to see Ron bashing and talk about "betrayal" and stupid Ron holding Harry back (I totally blame movies for this). In GoF, Ron was dumb yes, but just dumb as any teenager is at this age, a bit like angerfest Harry of OoP, not the lazy prejudiced monster some people make him (on this point, I can also point that Ron leaving in DH, his 2nd "betrayal" was heavily influenced by the Horcruxe).

PS: I see now that the reply "no, it seems pretty rare" transformed into a rant on Ron bashing, but yeah Ron is love, Ron is life.

A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** I mean she is a bit trusting in authority. An annotated book should have been dissected, especially the margins are better than the standard text. She follows orders to put a traumatized boy incommunicado. She doesn't believe in the possiblity of the deathly hallows. I think the only reason she doesn't believe the newspaper is that it attacked her first with lies. Hence the AU. Mostly, I just was curious, because I have never seen the reverse situation for GoF, and I honestly can see her logicing herself into the conclusion Harry cheated.

**** She set a professor on fire when she was a first year. She smuggles a dragon. She breaks the rules to investigate what the beast of Slytherin is. She breaks countless rules to brew Polyjuice potion. She convinces Harry to start an illegal organisation. She still writes to Harry after fourth year, she just doesn't tell him about the Order. She doesn't believe in the hallow's because for all intents and purposes, hallows are a children's story.

All in all, for all her flaws, Hermione is not as trusting of authority as you believe. For her to believe DP over Harry, she would need a solid reason for her to doubt him.

***** Hermione will do anything to protect Harry, and for all the books characterization of her being a rule-abiding student, she does break rules quite a bit. Hence why the whole potions book fiasco leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Hermione, for all her loyalty to Harry, tries to get him to tell McGonagall about the torture, in my opinion one of the most useless administrators in book history. And though the Hallows are from a children's story, she acknowledges the existence of a wand in history that's described as a super wand. Outright dismissing the legend is silly. The myth of the greek hero who slayed a chimera is actually canon, as well as cerberi. Heck even the method of calming them from mythology is canon. But I could see her *possibly* believing the daily prophet at the beginning of 4th year, especially if they start a smear campaign (I don't see why Harry keeps quiet about Sirius). It just would have to be really good propaganda. Frankly the trusting in authority is more an issue with McGonagall and Dumbledore in canon. For a supposed authority figure, she does nothing, except defend Harry against Umbridge in career counselling. And Dumbledore made mistakes handling harry in his 5th year, with no one defending Harry, and the man even admitted it. Not one person defended Harry. Not for Occulumency lessons, not for the information embargo, anything really.

******* I agree completely. I'm surprised Harry had any respect for her in the series. Frankly, I think she was the reason Harry never went to true adults. I know I don't. I'm not saying Dumbledore is a saint, but he was given tough choices. Snape is fairly irredeemable in the books, but movie Snape, which Rowling herself liked better, I think would be an interesting fanfiction character.

******* Ouch! I'll take the hit for not reading your reply properly. That's on me. And you're right. I was looking for some character exaggeration. The idea of the request wasn't for a bashing itch, I was just curious if anyone had ever written that. Not necessarily well-written, but at all. That being said, Hermione is a bit of a close-minded character. She discounts Luna's magical creatures (which although quite a few were deemed imaginary, she did discover some new ones with her husband Rolf Scamander), Malfoy being a death eater, and the Deathly Hallows being real. This does not make a bad person. On contrary it makes her more human. I also think that's why I could see her, under some arbitrary set of circumstances deciding Harry did enter himself in the TriWizard Tournament. That being said, she will never *abandon* Harry. I don't think I've seen a single case of it in the books. Of course, it does get kind of hard to justify her messing anything up, because she isn't stupid and the school is a deathtrap, but apparently all Harry Potter characters are genre-blind. This request though was more for the idle curiosity of does it exist.
