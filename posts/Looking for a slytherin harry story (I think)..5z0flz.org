I'm looking for a story where harry has a pet snake and hedwig, and in one particular scene they were both arguing (hedwig and the snake) about something, the details escape me. Help finding this story would be greatly appreciated.

P.s. i think harry understood hedwig too though i could be mistaken.


** We need more details. There are TONS of stories where Harry has a snake and Hedwig.

*** The snake and hedwig argue quite a bit, quite a few times. Theres really not much else i remember. Any stories similer i would still appreciate. Oh harry isn't in gryffindor (once again still not 100%sure on that).

***** They might have him talk to a snake, but most of the ones I've read have him either consider it or not at all.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.
