Runes bieng much more powerful & useful in that part of the world trolls & giants bieng much more intelligent . The norse gods either bieng real as deities or wizards that muggles just worshipped as gods. Dwarves bieng the main bankers & creating wepons akin to godrics sword.

The beast & monsters would be intresting as well as other races. Light & dark elves. The world serpent actually bieng real. Giant wolf's

More varied & war like magic. Divination bieng prevalent

Getting to explore durmstrang Would anyone be intrested in something like this?


** I have always wanted a wizard story based more on Norse Culture and Mythology. Sacrifices, divination and potions would probably be exceptionally popular. Curses and Blessings and afterlife will also be featured extensively.

In fact, I have tried many times to write such a story. The thing is I always lose confidence in myself as ignorance of Scandinavian culture smacks me in the face hard.

Also I am reasonably sure that runes were more used for divination than for casting any spells. Magic also wasn't really the tool of war for them. It was more an expression of the will of the gods.

**** A couple things regarding ancient magic you may want to think about for your story is a lot of ancient magic is not as efficient as magic is now. Something like you CAN do this but it requires hundreds of lives sacrificed to do it. Or I remember reading a story where the old magic had more words and slightly different effects. Or simply ancient magic is dangerous because fewer people recognize it right away/defend against it because it.

** Three observations:

- Hogwarts teaches Ancient Runes like Muggle schools teach Latin.

- The Tales of Beedle the Bard was written in runes in the 1400s, centuries after they fell out of use in the Muggle world.

- Curse-breakers are anticipated to encounter Ancient Runes frequently enough that they are a NEWT requirement.

From these observations, I think it's heavily implied that Ancient Runes were the written lingua franca of magical Europe (or at the very least, northern Europe) until at least the Renaissance era. So I certainly think there's a lot of scope for a significant Scandinavian presence in European magic.

Stuff like the Norse gods being real - that I think pushes things out of the realm of a canonical magical tone. The running theme of canonical magic is demythologisation - pegasi aren't the offspring of Poseidon, they're just winged horses and they drink single malt; Cerberus doesn't guard the underworld, but rather is Hagrid's pet and is called Fluffy, etc. So introducing literal deities etc. rather clashes with the established HP system, I think.

I do think the other two points are sufficient to reach the "lingua franca" conclusion, however. What the removal of that third point results in, I think, is a more limited geographic scope of the use of runes - more likely Northern Europe, rather than pan-European.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but Norse Runes were actually used up until thereabout. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_runes][Medieval Runes]], though what I've learned but do not have a source available to double check right now. In Norway the nobles and of course priests would be the only one to truly make the shift over to Latin. Which left the rest of the population to still write in runes, which lasted until the Reformation arrived in Norway.

**** *Medieval runes*

The medieval runes, or the futhork, was a Scandinavian 27 letter runic alphabet that evolved from the Younger Futhark after the introduction of dotted runes at the end of the Viking Age and it was fully formed in the early 13th century. Due to the expansion, each rune corresponded to only one phoneme, whereas the runes in the preceding Younger Futhark could correspond to several.The medieval runes were in use throughout Scandinavia during the Middle Ages, and provided the basis for the appearance of runology in the 16th century.

** I really like the idea of non-English wizarding cultures. It is sad that we all are trying to be English and write into the culture which is alien to us. However, it has to be done by somebody who is native to the culture, otherwise we get the Hollywood Vikings with axes stuck in the thirteenth (tenth?) century.

For example, I am a Czech, and so I am excited by the community of fanfiction writers around [[http://budec.net/]] (everything in Czech, sorry) which is centred around the Czech magical school at Budeč (according to Muggles, that's a old Slavic hillfort which was abandoned rather suddenly in the early tenth century after the death of the Czech patron saint Saint Wenceslaus; we know that in fact wizards decided to hide the school seated there from the Muggle world).

Concerning Ancient Runes, “Чары” in Russian (and in other Slavic languages, in Czech it is “čáry”) means both charms (like a class in Hogwarts) and lines (like what you draw on paper). There are very rare archaeological excavation of proto-Slavic never undeciphered writings (I believe on birch bark) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Christian_Slavic_writing#Evidence_from_early_historiography][чръты и рѣзы]] (which means roughly “sketches and cuts”), which can very well be just last few remainders of the old Slavic magic roughly comparable to the Norse Runes.

** I love the idea and have been speculating on the history and culture of a wizarding Scandinavia for a while, considering writing a fic set there either as an SI (seeing as i'm scandinavian myself i would be reborn there) or as a story of harry being taken in by distant relatives at some early point.

I have a (shittyly edited) collection of my thoughts on the structure, history and culture, including the interplay with norse mythology and the various creature and species. these are just my notes on the history of magical scandinavia

#+begin_example
  • Once divided in Aesir and Vanir tribes, with many conflicts

  • Aesir being martial wizards with focus on enchanting, runes and biomancy, society dominated by battles with various beings such as jotuns (ice giants), mountain giants, werewolf tribes and occasionally dwarves and elves

  • Vanir being pastoral and fishing, focus on rituals, elementalism and spirit magic, more closely integrated with muggles, seen as wisemen and Völva

  • Peace first established in 106 to support German tribes in repelling Roman invasion, first contact with modern wands (ceasefire negotiated on Fredsøy, named hereafter)

  • Unity first started in 356 with establishment of first Scandinavian wizarding ting on Fredsøy

  • First Ting led by Law speaker Odin Borson, Chieftain of Asgard, largest city of the Aesir

  • Ting restructured and expanded in 573 (giving long time wizarding allies the dwarves representation and expanding to more magical communities), 782 (Iceland included, nisser given citizenship, though not representation), 946 (British and Irish territories acknowledged but not included, Faroe Islands and Greenland gain representation) and 1130 (Finnish wizards join, Ice giants given representation after nearly four centuries of peace)

  • Fredsøy and magical territories in Scandinavia begins separation from mundane politics in 1397 in reaction to Kalmar union (single royal family being able to pressure magicals to much for their comfort), seceding completely in 1523 under cover of Swedish rebellion.

** So yeah, I'd be super into reading a Scandinavian-based fic. Anything to get out of the old stuff in Britain which we've retreaded for years lol

I think fics featuring magical studies from different perspectives around the world are sorely needed in general. I'm from Mexico and I sometimes daydream about our own hypothetical magical community. We come from deeply religious, superstitious cultures which I think are full of untapped potential for fascinating settings, magical theory, etc. A magical community in the heart of the Lacandon Jungle, a secret magical school deep in the Sonoran desert; Mayan descendants and their studies of astronomy and the cosmos (which could lend itself to Lovecraftian tales of contact between wizards and deep-space entities--maybe that's where their ideas of deities came from?), northern shamans and their study of Soul magics, so on and so forth. I've been meaning to write something on this, hopefully one day I will.

I also have this idea of different versions of spells in different languages, like maybe there's a form of the Killing Curse that's in Japanese, and it was actually preferred to the standard version back when dueling with it was legal, because it had one less syllable and thus had a faster casting time. Dumb stuff like that.

It'd be best for her to keep all nations varied but also fairly balanced. We can't have some other Magical community of another country suddenly be super OP compared to the rest.
