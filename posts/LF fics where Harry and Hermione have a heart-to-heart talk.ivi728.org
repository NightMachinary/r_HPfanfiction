Does anyone know of fics where Harry and Hermione have a sincere conversation on how Harry keeps putting Ron first? Just in general, Hermione hashing out where she stands with Harry and her place in Harry's life? No Ron-bashing please.


** Does it have to be Hermione positive?

** [SELF-AD] It is just mere one-shot and it is actually Ron/Hermione talk, but talking about Harry is involved as well. “Late Morning Talks” linkao3(20141410)

#+begin_quote
  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.

** This slow burn linkao3(24410095) has exactly what you asked I think. It's WIP and H/Hr are still finding their way together but Harry has become a better friend, which I love.
