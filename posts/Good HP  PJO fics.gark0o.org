We love to pit HP and PJO/HoO against each other when in reality it's comparing Lemons and Limes. (No, not like that. :(() Anyway, can you guys suggest any good crossover fics? I've had trouble finding good ones on AO3 and navigating FFnet scares me (lol) so I'm here. I would especially love to see character interaction (Harry + Percy, Hermione + Annabeth, Stolls + Weasley Twins PLS); PJO/HoO characters attending Hogwarts/HP characters going to Camp Half-Blood/Jupiter; I'm neutral to time-travel; Nico-centric fics aren't really my taste. Thanks in advance!

P.S. Cross-posted to [[/r/camphalfblood][r/camphalfblood]]

P.P.S. If I can't find a good enough fic for my tastes I stg I'll just write this myself HAHA

** There aren't any. Sorry. I've looked over ff.net, but PJO authors apparently either can't write or haven't tried, and HP authors just want to make Harry fix all of the PJO problems.

Actually, there may be a decent unfinished one? But I don't remember any. I still feel like there could be a decent Percy as DADA teacher fic, but I've never seen one that was any good.

Too bad XedAlpha will never write one.

** I think I know very very few complete pjo/harry potter fanfics but here is a list of those that I have found and enjoyed.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - The best one I have found and I know someone already recommended I just add it here so the bot can list it.

Home is Where the Hearth is - linkffn(12791536) - A nice fic and one I enjoyed.

For Want of Family - linkffn(10711973) - Another pretty well done fic that I enjoy.

Son of Athena - linkffn(11441234) - One of the only complete fics I know and pretty well done.

Sadly this is list is shorter then I like. But it's hard to find good pjo/harry potter fics. Most PJO authors are stuck using very much overworn cliches and tropes it's hard to read their work after some time. PJO got me into fanfiction in the first place and will always be my favorite fanfics to read but I rather cut off my hand then try to sift through the archives of PJO stories again.

**** I got fed up with reading the same story, same plot, and copy and pasted characters over and over and over again. Like there are hundreds of 'Percy Guardian of the Hunt fics' or 'Child of Artemis' or 'Chaos champion bullshit' all that feel very copy and pasted. It kills me trying to look for something new and exciting but only to see that is the premise. Like it was novel the first two times but now it's been run into the ground so much I can't even stand to look at the archives cause those are the first thing I see. I stand by what I said about the cutting off my hand bit. At least I keep my sanity, what little I have left at least, lol.

  Perseus Jackson was a strange person, Harry decided. He came from overseas, had the weirdest American accent, spoke strange sayings, had ADHD and dyslexia, and stood up for every kid. He was a Gryffindor, but consorted with Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and even Slytherins. Perseus Jackson was a weird person, Harry Potter decided, but he wouldn't have it any other way.

Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.
