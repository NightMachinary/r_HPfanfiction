** Depends on what you are trying to convey, but honestly, nothing really stops you from having all three.

**** If you're trying to portray the MC as a leader, you would probably want to go with and/or emphasize Team duels. If you want to show how strong he is, you might want to go with Singles. Things of that nature.

** Whatever works for you, dude. I write single and team Duelling events for my AU, both at school and professional circuit level, and I think the variety within one sport (like tennis, for example) is pretty believable - especially if it's reasonably popular in-universe.

** As well of thinking of the pair-ups, why not think of scenarios?

Like, are your duelers just going to stand on a stage and shoot lasers at each other? Will they duel in a terrarium, with plenty of natural cover and camouflage? Will they have special rules, like taking out the leader or capturing a flag?
