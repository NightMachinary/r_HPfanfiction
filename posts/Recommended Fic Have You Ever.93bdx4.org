/Have You Ever/ is an extremely enticing fic, filled with adventure, romance, and it is so beautifully written. I'm not a huge fan of the Hermione/Tom Riddle pairing, but this fanfic had me believing. Give it a chance! This came out in 2005 by Lady Moonglow and it's considered a classic. I highly recommend it! You can read it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2406786/1/Have-You-Ever][here]].

When you're done, watch my best friend's fan trailer she made for it a few years ago! She's extremely talented. You can watch it [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDr9Kpgv3MQ][here]].


** I totally forgot about this one. It was a favorite of mine back when it was first posted!
