Sometimes, people ask "what does Molly Weasley *do* all day?"

She's got a husband who works out of the house, she's got children at boarding school...what does she do, at home by herself?

I've been thinking about this, and it occurs to me that the Burrow might actually be a small but functional farm.

​

We know they own land apart from the house itself. The Weasley children are mentioned as going flying in an orchard, and I don't think they would risk that unless the orchard they were flying in was something the Weasleys owned and knew they could keep private. Ottery St Catchpole is supposed to be in Devon, so we'll say it's full of apple trees. Depending on the variety of apples, different markets exist - eating apples, cider apples, and so on. They may also be able to sell *apple wood* in small quantities, to Ollivander for wands or for other magically necessary woodwork.

We know they have a garden. Vegetables, and possibly small scale growing of magical plants which can be sold for potions ingredients.

We know they have poultry. Meat - especially if you can magically increase the birds in size without hurting them - feathers (can be sold, or used domestically) and eggs.

The Burrow is described as a converted piggery. Pigs are an easy animal to keep on not much land, because they can eat just about everything we do - super economical use for kitchen waste. They have large litters once or twice a year, and piglets fatten quickly. One or two adult sows (I'm picturing Tamworths, because if anyone's keeping old/heritage breeds it's probably wizards and it amuses me to imagine the Weasleys keeping [[https://alchetron.com/cdn/tamworth-pig-b63124b8-1392-4c4e-8de8-92bd6d97958-resize-750.jpeg][extremely ginger pigs]], but it could be any kind) kept on the kitchen scraps and forage in the orchard, producing perhaps fifteen to twenty piglets a year between them. They can raise and fatten some for their own use, and sell the rest.

Goats? Again, hardy, easily milked by hand and possible to keep on small or poor-quality land. Or perhaps a small cow - a Dexter, or (to continue the ginger parade) a [[https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/agupdate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/3e/b3e19871-03fa-5bf2-8c85-15bb41faefa2/59caa4aa5ce67.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C933][milking shorthorn]] or a Ruby Red Devon if they were willing to go a bit bigger. Devons are usually beef cattle, but milking stock exists They can sell or eat bull calves should any happen to be born, and milk a cow. No matter if it's goats or cattle, it would not surprise me in the least to see Molly charm a butter churn to do all the hard physical work for her.

​

Molly has plenty to keep her busy even when the kids aren't home, and all of it stretches the Weasley budget just a little bit further if she's shrewd enough. Money is always going to be tight with so many kids, but this way it might not be impossibly so.

If not, what do we think she's doing? Especially during term time, when it's only her and Arthur.


** Well i mean she only had a couple years to relax as she had at least 1 child with her until COS. then she was busy with the order

** Honestly guys if you've ever compared what she made and the portions and how much time it takes to prepare make correct and delicious food and clean up after it, magic or not, good food is not made in a hurry plus there's cleaning after so many people especially little ones who don't help. And she seems to handle most minor and mid discipline of all the children by herself because Arthur works so much
