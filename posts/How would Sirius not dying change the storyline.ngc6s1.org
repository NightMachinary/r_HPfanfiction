I'm not sure if I wanna kill him off or not. Like I haven't read any fics yet that go into detail what would happen if Sirius didn't die in the department of mysteries.

Currently writing a fic where OC befriends Sirius in dog form during POA ( she's a kinda-lonely new girl.). I know it'll crush her and Harry but I'm not sure how else it'll affect the original storyline. The only plot point I can think of is fletcher stealing the mirror and selling it.

I have only written half of third year but I wanna plan ahead, so any fic recommendations or points to watch out for?


** Sirius not dying means Harry is less depressed when he hears the Prophecy, Tonks keeps her original Patronus, and Sirius without a doubt goes with the Trio on the Horcrux Hunt. Lupin wanted to but Harry was like "stop being a dick you have a pregnant wife go back to her now" but Sirius wouldn't have any reason to be tied down. Would maybe be able to make the Break-in at Gringotts easier. Would (maybe) know Fiendfyre for destroying the Horcruxes.

Though if they took your Fem OC with them too, 4 teens and a Dog solving a Case? It's the Famous Five, Wizarding style.

7th year he'd tell Lupin "Moony, you have a wife and kid, you stay, I'll go" and would go with Harry. Lupin wanted to go with the trio. Sirius just would.

********* Authors keeping him dead isn't necessarily because it's the “easy way out” so they don't have to do tons of planning to change the storyline. There are certainly reasons that doing so may make the most sense for a story or someone's character development, particularly Harry's. Losing Sirius - the only parental figure he had - was part of his development in the original books and contributed to the person he became.

If someone is just going follow the same storyline just because it's easier than planning out changes that make sense based on the history they've created, then people are better off reading the actual books.

I didn't really catch on what character development Harry might've gotten from his death. It's been a long while since I've read the second half of the series. I know he became more scared of loosing everyone because of it but that's about all I caught on to. So please if you can elaborate just a bit that would be awesome.

The thing is he already has an emotional crutch in this story so I'm not really sure if Sirius' fate is essential to my plot line for character development as I'll be throwing all sorts of stuff at them.

Since they woudln't need to infiltrate the Ministry, Yaxley wouldn't break the Fidelius Charm, so they would be able to stay at Grimmauld Place the whole time and have full cooked meals from Kreacher, so less arguments.

Given Kreacher helped to make the whole Ministry thing happen (he injured Buckbeak and then used that to trick Harry into believing Sirius actually /was/ being tortured) on Narcissa's orders, do you really think Sirius would keep him around?

It's a small detail in your post, but I don't think Kreacher would still be around after pretty much /actively betraying/ Sirius. At best, Sirius would get a different house-elf - I could see him hiring Dobby, for example.

No matter how much he threatens him, freeing him would only mean more problems for the Order. Why do you think Harry didn't free Kreacher then and there when he learned he became his Master ? OP could find another way of making the Ministry thing happen.

***** Note that Kreacher didn't /know/ Sirius was going to die. He was essentially just doing something /because Sirius wouldn't want him to, but never ordered him not to/. Sirius's death was an added bonus of sorts. Even if Sirius doesn't die, all else being equal, Kreacher would still have done what he did.

Given he was already acting on Narcissa's orders, the security risk is there regardless of keeping or firing him - plus, memory charms are a thing. Obliviate, sock, done.

Although, who said anything about freeing? For all his good parts, Sirius is pretty... Unstable. I think he'd just as soon put Kreacher's head with the other decapitated house-elves.

******* Sirius can just as easily fill in the required blanks - RAB was his brother, "that fake locket looks familiar..."

And I'm not sure Harry would actually stop him - he was perfectly willing to hand Pettigrew over to his actual worst fear, to have what he knows is a Fate Worse Than Death.

He also reacted /really badly/ to hearing what Kreacher did in canon. While I think his reaction would be more tempered than if Sirius had died, I think he'd be willing to just walk out of the room and let Sirius do whatever he wants to do.

Kreacher's reasons don't factor into the discussion at all. He actively sabotaged Sirius and Harry, therefore Sirius and Harry both have reason to have an antagonistic relationship with him.

Kreacher would also be personal for Sirius. He's a living reminder of the horribly abusive childhood he had, and now he pulls something that almost got Harry, Sirius and everyone else /killed/.

#+end_quote

It's how it canonically is, so therefore it is the "default" to argue from. Of course, the author is free to make it happen any other way - but then we're not asking the same question anymore. "What if Sirius survived in an AU where the Ministry Battle either didn't happen, or happened for a different reason" is a vastly different question to "What if Sirius survived the Ministry Battle".

#+begin_quote
  And the locket was in the house after sirius moved away, and Sirius doesn't care about family heirlooms, he probably wouldn't pay attention.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between "I give a shit about family heirlooms so I recognize this as not being one" and "I've seen this /very specific design of locket/ in the old family home I've been confined to for a year with not much better to do".

#+begin_quote
  And it's important for Kreacher to stay around because Sirius has a biased view about his brother. Sirius would never know the truth about Regulus.
#+end_quote

Is this /important/ though, or is it just something /you'd/ want to see? I'd argue the latter, given we don't actually know what the author of the fanfic wants with it. If they're fine with leaving Regulus out-of-focus and developing Sirius's character in other ways, that's their good right.

From a realistic point-of-view, a /lot/ of family issues never get the resolution they could have, and people take their issues to the grave. This bit of character growth is not something that /needs/ to happen in order for the story to have a logical conclusion, just something that you /want/ to see because it makes for positive character development.

** I think:

- Harry would be /far/ less depressed in the summer between fifth and sixth year.
- Sirius would /definitely/ know R.A.B. were his brother's initials, making the search for the Real Locket a lot quicker.
- Fletcher would not have the opportunity to steal the locket, much less sell it, with Sirius being there.
- Fairly sure that Kreacher, given he acted on Narcissa's orders to make the whole Ministry Fiasco happen, would no longer work at Grimmauld Place - whether by the giving of clothes (plus an Obliviation) or by death.
- I'm actually not sure if Sirius would have access to Bellatrix's vault. Logic dictates he wouldn't - but he'd want in on that plan regardless.
- In fact, I think he'd want to be there for /most/ of the action.
- Instead of the Camping Trip From Hell, they'd retain Grimmauld Place as a relatively safe base of operations.

** I would love to have authors use Sirius more.

He could stay in Britain, instead of leaving like he did. There are Polyjuice potions he could take and other potions/magic he could use, where he wouldn't look like himself.

Or even using muggle hair dye or different colored eye contacts, etc, could potentially work. Hermione or someone else could mention it.

Sirius could help the kids when they are looking for the Horcruxes, if you do have Sirius going somewhere during that time frame, he'd know how to escape people and be able to help them.

It sucks that Sirius was forced to stay at his hated childhood home, being around his screaming portrait of a mother, and his house elf didn't help matters. No idea where Remus lived, but I wish he had stayed with Remus instead.

I wish Sirius had told Harry how to use the two way mirror. It feels like such a cheap writing tactic used by Rowling, not have Sirius explain how to use it, Harry doesn't think to use it, and then finds it and feels awful about his death all over again.

Sirius gets caught in the DOM, Albus steps in and demands a fair trial. With Voldemort being revealed to have come back, people are more prone to listen to Albus, Sirius gets a trial and it's revealed he was innocent the whole time.

Harry also wouldn't be so depressed when he finally learns about the Prophecy.

x x With cool heads - Sirius gets his trial. How healthy is he?

x x x Not very much, the Azkaban and the stress of being locked up at Grimmuald means the healers do not want to release him ( Sirius gone for period of one year to Longbottom stint)

x x x Decent enough. Harry can live with Sirius, which leads to a much happier Harry. Even if Dumbledore wants him to live at Privet, at least Sirius can move in next door, or even be a good dog.
