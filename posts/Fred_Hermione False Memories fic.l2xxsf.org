- Hermione thinks she is married to Fred but is not.
- She creates like a whole false reality for herself and the doctor said just to go with it.
- In her memories, Fred proposed to her by putting the ring in a book.
- Hermione talks to Ginny because Fred isn't being as affectionate as "normal"
- It is similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7151993/1/Candy-Wrappers-and-Wedding-Rings][candy wrappers and wedding rings]] [but that's not it]
- Hermione freaks out because she doesn't have her ring on.

PS I've been looking for this for years
