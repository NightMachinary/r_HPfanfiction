** /Black Luminary/ updated today and the author stated they will be trying to release one chapter of book 3 every week. linkffn(12125300)

/Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/ updated for the first time in almost a year earlier this week. linkffn(10210053)

/Harry Potter and the Chrysalis/ Updates sporadically but I really like where the story is going and have reread the first book multiple times already. linkffn(12278649)

/The Mind Arts/ is an /amazing/ story that also updated earlier this week. linkffn(12740667)

All of these have a Harry who is a prodigy but avoid the common tropes that most fics using similar plot devices fall into. Also, all 4 are of a quality that is usually difficult to find in fanfiction, hope you enjoy.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

*** I still don't know what to make of Black Luminary. It keeps getting recced on here but to my mind it doesn't seem to have any clear plot. It started out doing one thing, then Harry got to school and it became all about something else, then suddenly it's all about Lethifolds, completely out of nowhere.

With Harry changing personality every few chapters I'm finding it really hard to enjoy.

**** I'm all caught up, but it has been a while since I have read through the whole story so my recollection may be hazy. With that in mind, I believe that the overarching plot for the story has intentionally been left vague. We are unsure of where the story is going and, really, unsure of just what differences this story has from canon. The author has stated that it's AU with large changes that are immediately discernable and smaller ones that have only been alluded to thus far.

So each book, so far, has had a self-contained plot: book one with discovering the identity of Harry's antagonist, book two with the lethifolds and book three's plot to be discovered. These plots, while entertaining in an of themselves, also serve the purpose of further elucidating the overarching plot and giving us necessary details to piece together the puzzle that is the story itself and its history. So I think that the author intended for us to feel that we don't know what the plot is, as they're stilling giving us the information necessary to discern it.

As for Harry's drastic personality shifts, that was something I also had trouble with. An explanation was given but it didn't exactly seem sufficient. I've just taken to thinking that the reason the shifts are so drastic is that Harry himself is going through significant emotional upheaval which he is still attempting to tamp down on. We know that he's gone through a significantly traumatic experience at some point in his past, and we know that he attempts to compensate for this by using occlumency. This has been shown to be more, or less, effective depending on the situation. Emotional nuance and all that. It's strongly implied, in chapters 12 and 15, that Harry is essentially always acting while in public. So the personality shifts can also be accounted for through that, as he shows one face to the public and another face to his close confidants; none of which necessarily reflect his true personality.

****** The basic premise is that early in sixth year, Romilda Vane slips Harry a love potion and rapes him. The fic is mostly about Harry coping after it happens, which is complicated by Harry not really understanding that what Romilda did to him was rape. There's also a lot of focus on Harry's relationships with other people, especially Ron, Hermione, and Ginny.

The writing is superb, so I would definitely give it a shot if you're at all interested in that premise and can handle all the potential triggers.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
