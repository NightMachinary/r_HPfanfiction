Looking for fics where the magical world enters into a golden age. There are lots of wonders in the magical world that no one knows how they were created or has the power to create them. I'd like to read a fic that somehow brings back that knowledge or makes changes in Hogwarts to where wizards and witches are smart enough to create great feats of magic again.


** linkffn(4659219) is more of a precursor to a golden age, but it does fit the "bringing knowledge back" bit. It's one of my favorite HP fanfics ever, and sadly, there was never any more. I really love the premise and wish someone would write a sequel.

  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
