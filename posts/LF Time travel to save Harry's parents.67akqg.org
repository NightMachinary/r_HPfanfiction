  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3643284/1/Harry-Potter-and-A-Grandfather-s-Gift][Harry Potter and a Grandfather's Gift]] uses it not for his parents, but for his /grand/parents. (Who are not Charlus and Dorea, but not the canon grandparents either. Warning: it also has a straight Dumbledore, due to having been written before The Reveal. It is also totally devoid of any conflict whatsoever, as Harry ends up absurdly OP --- or rather, his grandfather does. But it's a fun read anyway.)

*** Haha, this was one of the first Harry Potter fanfics I ever read. Very classic, basically the quintessential magic trunk fic. Doesn't really stand up now, but creative and serviceable.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
