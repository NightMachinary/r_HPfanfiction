I've seen a couple fics in this trope but not any that were done well or realistically.

*** I tried, but I just couldn't do it. There is this obscure little thing called capital letters. I don't know if this is some sort of strange stylistic choice. If it is, then it isn't working for someone like me, who takes grammar seriously. Oh, well.

**** Eh fair. Don't look at me I didn't write it üòä.

It took me a bit to get into too, it was jarring but I dunno. The story is about Harry feeling small and alone and unwanted. The consistent small letters emphasise that, the story looks small and young and timid. Nothing jumps out or is yelling at you, it's all very quiet and careful.

It matches the tone. Rest of the grammer is grand. It's just that. Rules were made to be broken and what-not üòä

***** My grammar thing is a left over from school. They drilled it into our heads, then had us read Halld√≥r Laxness (Iceland's only Nobel prize laureate). He consistently wrote words the way you pronounce them, which is a grammatical mess.

But if we tried to do that yourself, no dice. You see, when he did it, it was artistic license. We were just being prats. Pff. Hypocrites.

  "i don't know if they could've put a flap in the door of the cupboard, now that i think about it," harry laughs nervously. "dunno if it would've fit onto it. since it's smaller than the bedroom door." hermione and ron's heads both shoot up. "what?" ron asks. "excuse me?" hermione says.

** This is one of the things that I love about "Blood Magic" by GatewayGirl and "Digging for the Bones" by Paganaidd.

Both are Severitus fics and the focus is on that. But halfway through the story on Blood Magic there is an article on Harry's life with the Dursleys resulting in Fudge trying to get guardianship over Harry. Quite a few adults are shocked at the extend of the abuse and try to apologise to Harry and Harry does not take it well. I find it a really realistic portrait of a child with a bad homelife.

Similar can be said about Digging for the Bones. I find Harry's reaction to living with Snape really well done and in-character with how he is portrayed in the books.
