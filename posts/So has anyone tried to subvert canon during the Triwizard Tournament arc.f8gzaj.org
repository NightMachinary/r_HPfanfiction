In Fourth Year, Harry and Cedric Diggory are Hogwarts champions. Harry unwillingly and Cedric willingly. And we all know that Cedric becomes something of a martyr figure because of his death. But has anyone attempted to subvert the canon for the Triwizard tournament? Specifically, put a different Hogwarts champion in Cedric's place? Like, a "What if the champion had been a Slytherin?" or a "What if some older Gryffindor that might know Harry got it?"

Or, Harry actually going about his Tasks with different strategies? I remember seeing this shitpost once where Harry beats all the tasks "the muggle way" which was absolutely hilarious but reasonably plausible.

Maybe this is a bit of a dumb question (fanfic is like the BEST PLACE to perpetually rewrite canon), but I personally don't have enough experience in this fandom to have knowledge of it.


** I'm writing a fic where Cedric dies in the first task because he got the horntail. The odds are 1/4 for each dragon after all, so why does Harry always have to get the worst one?

I also seriously considered killing Gabrielle during the second task, but my beta talked me out of that one.

*** I made this post because I'm considering writing a fic where the Champion is a nobody muggleborn from Gryffindor. Just the most unspecial student. Average grades for everything. And they get the spot.

Their strategies for the Tasks are part shitpost and part Jack Sparrow-level creative genius. Completely off-the-wall solutions. But it's not surprising, because they're decent at everything. They're a jack of a trades.

*** Love me some darker fics. I mean, it's a fucking dragon, why do all authors hesitate to kill even a single character.

**** It's not even a dark fic, I was just annoyed by how so many fics put Cedric on a pedestal as if he was Jesus reborn.

** My favourite is when the challenges are changed. I read on where the First Task was a challenge to solve a sort of magical rubix cube.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
