** I never understood how someone, even Voldemort, could “accidentally” create a horcrux. I remember reading from JKR that there's a really nasty and dark ritual/ceremony required that was so disturbing she wouldn't describe it. Otherwise, any murder by any witch/wizard could create one (and they were widely unheard of, so much so that even Dumbledore had to learn of them from Slughorn via Harry)

*** My theory has always been that Voldemort intended to use Harry's death as part of the Horcrux ritual and therefore already done all prerequisites or whatever is needed, so the killing of James, Lily or even the attempt to kill Harry was enough to split the soul and form the unintended Horcrux

*** My headcanon is Voldemort had split his soul so many times that it was already fragile. He was going to use Harry's death for a horcrux (because making his chosen enemy be used to make him more immortal would be something he's into. Do you prepare the ritual beforehand and then when the curse bounced off, there's a horcrux.

*** Harry is not technically a horcrux, just a psuedo one. There is a ritual for an intentional one.

Dumbledore was already aware of what Horcruxes were. He states somewhere that he had his suspicions as soon as he learned of what Tom Riddle's diary was capable of doing.

Dumbledore knew, however, that Slughorn had conversed with Tom Riddle about the topic and, while he didn't know /what/ information Slughorn may have imparted (or, likewise, may have learned of Voldemort's intentions), he knew it could be important. Turns out Slughorn ended up discovering the number that Voldemort was aiming for.

*** I like the idea that he had already done the ritual and had it primed to use the murder of Harry to do it. Like a few feet away he had a hidden ritual circle containing the left testicle of Gryffindor or whatever, and he was going to AK Harry and then say some final magical word to complete the ritual, but then the backlash happened and the ritual fixated on Harry instead of the artifact by mistake.
