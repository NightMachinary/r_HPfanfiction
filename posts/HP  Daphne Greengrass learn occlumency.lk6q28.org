So, a few years ago there was a story that I was reading and I can't remember what the name is called.

The greengrass family sneaks into 4 privet drive Post -order of the Phoenix, to take him and keep him safe after Voldemort comes out publicly. I remember that Harry pushes Daphne down the stairs when they pick him up. When they get to Greengrass manor, the parents lock harry and daphne in a location warded room so they can learn occlumency. The premise around it in this fic is that magical owls find people based off of their sense of identity, and that using occlumency you can suppress your identity from magical means.


** I remember this story to but cant remember the name.. If you've found it can you please send?
