Hey all, really looking for fics that explore Harry's self sacrificing nature, like in recnac, or that explore him losing adults in his life like in POE, i do enjoy a bit of mentor snape, but I've exhausted potions and snitches, and its not the end of the world of he's a douche like in POE, i know these fics are well known and divisive, but i enjoyed them both and so would be interested in any recs along the same line.

Thank you in advance!!!
