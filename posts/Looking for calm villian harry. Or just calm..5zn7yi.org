I'm looking for a harry as a villian, preferably. Who is always calm and in control of every situation is always not one or even three but dozens of steps ahead of her foe/s. a moriarty or sherlock harry where her mind is the ultimate weapon. Like a recent fanfiction said there is nothing quite like a villian in a suit standing and talking calmly in front of you and all the hero can do is take it.


** I think she's calm in linkffn(moratorium). Moriarty is her role model.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

**** Such Natalie Dormer vibes, now I gotta read this XD

Edit: 225k words in 7 chapters! Seriously, could have made it a bit less scrolly. Also, why is a female named 'Harry'? :P
