** Funny thing is, if you had removed the Weasley Bashing you would probably already have lots of recommendations.

Here are some:

linkffn(8769990) this one bashes Ron and Molly, and somewhat Ginny(in her defense her mistakes are because of Molly)

linkffn(13133746) I don't recall how much this one does it, but it may be exclusive to Ginny and Molly.

linkffn(12155794) This one starts 5th year and I like it, even if it doesn't focus on the romance too much.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

******** It's for the catharsis, I suppose.

For example, my college friend collects Ron-bashing fics for fun. She told me Ron reminds me of her high school best friend, a chap who professed #foreverfriendship, only to betray her by convincing the rest of her "friends" to shun her.

Seeing Ron get bashed for his year 4 disloyalty, his support of Harry's pariah status, really strikes a chord with her. It's escapism, seeing the traitor get what they deserve.

Really, I can't blame her.

Bashing isn't inherently the sign of a bad writer; it is just a more unforgiving point of view. It's therefore easier to go overboard and alienate the character's fans.
