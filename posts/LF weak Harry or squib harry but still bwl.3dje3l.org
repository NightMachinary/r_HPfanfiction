Can anyone recommend a fic where harry is weak at magic or has none but is still the bwl?


** It's rather short and not entirely serious, but I enjoyed linkffn(Not a Squib by Bajab).

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

*** Is he really weak in canon? Driving off a hundred dementors with a patronus in third year doesn't seem weak to me.

**** - Successful seeker
- Triwizard champion
- Winner of the order of Merlin first class
- Youngest and most successful auror captain ever.

If that's Harry "underachieving" then I don't know what you expect him to do...

****** Underachieves? Compared to whom? Hermione?

Hermione is a once-in-a-generation genius who specializes in memorization and book learning. Compare her scores on a written test with anyone else and they will fall short. She literally had perfect or near perfect scores on each subject. That is not at all normal.

Harry's school record is quite impressive and he scores way above average compared to the rest of his year.

*** I agree tbh. Not weak at magic or of will, but overall weak.
