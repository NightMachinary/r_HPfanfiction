Looking for novel length rewrites or just different version of how the 7th book could have been done .

what are the best, what are your favorites ?

I am reading the harry potter series to my gf, and I really disliked the 7th book .

Any help would be amazing .


** Would [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] count? It's not AU, but it follows Neville and is a bit more dramatic/has a lot of character development.

** Try Bottle Fame and Brew Glory by Rannaro: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3824385/]] -s/he's has an incredible capacity to write novel-length. It's not easy. Snape's POV. Not first person.

By the same author, A Difference in the Family is Snape's biography and a bloody good read. Incredibly well thought out. And at 648k words, possibly the longest book I've ever read. It just keeps going! All good stuff though, very interesting and almost necessary background to some of tr stuff Dumbledore and Snape were doing while Harry was busy doing schoolwork and trying to get himself killed.

** My favorite was Melindaleo's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux]['The Seventh Horcrux']]. Ginny joins the trio on the Horcrux quest. Well written, no unnecessary fluff, and keeps you hooked.
