In the story, Hermione and Draco totally develop a believable romance and then he forces her to take a potion that wipes her memory and in that way it stays pretty close to canon. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?


** Yeah it's Silencio by Asha the Kitty, and the sequel Secrets. Totally depressing, that series. Secrets is being updated, albeit extremely slowly.

** Twist of fate has the same premise but is Harry/Draco, really good though.
