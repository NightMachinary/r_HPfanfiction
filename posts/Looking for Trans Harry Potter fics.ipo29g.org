Preferably MTF, and it doesn't exactly have to be harry but those are more common, i really like reading them cause its nice seeing positive trans rep +to spite JK Rowling+ cause it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, thanks for your recommendations!


** I'm cis as heck, so I don't really know if any of these are accurate to the trans experience, but they're stories I've enjoyed that are relevant to your request, so I'm recommending them on that basis.

There are two that are basically variations of the same idea called Season of Change and Son of Potter, Daughter of Black. The premise is basically identical - Harry starts assigned-male, transitions to female, finds out some family shit and there's family drama while she fights Voldemort. Son of Potter has more Sirius, but that's basically the only real distinguishing difference.

The Archaeologist is a sort-of-appropriate semi-gen fic where Harry gets punted to an alternate universe, wakes up in the body of his female equivalent, and basically doesn't care and wanders off to explore tombs. Fun fic, if a little clunkily told, with a lot of Bloodborne stuff involved. The Trans stuff is basically just harry shrugging and not really caring too much about their gender, so I don't really think it counts, but YMMV.

Magical Metamorphosis is probably the most trans-storyline fic I've seen. Harry transitions to Fem!Harry when she realises she's trans after walking up some stairs. Hermione is very supportive.

The Girl Who Lived Again is another fun Trans!Harry fic mostly about her experiences with her friends and family rather than any self-exploration journeys or the like.

Pranking the Tournament is a sarky-Harry-mocks-the-tournament fic where he takes a potion to become a girl for story reasons and discovers some stuff.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."
