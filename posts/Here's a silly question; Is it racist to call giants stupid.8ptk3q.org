** I suspect you are trolling, but no, it's speciesism, racism being prejudice or discrimination on the basis of race. So far as we know, "giant" isn't a race of humanity but rather a different species. If you want to fit them into Muggle systems, giants may still be of the homo genus, like Neanderthals, but they are not homo sapiens.

To address your follow-up points, even though I answered the first question in the negative, a position being racist is of course is a separate issue from a position being justified or moral. Historically, most racist positions have been lacking in any rational or scientific justification and have also been morally heinous. However an example of commonly accepted "justified, moral racism" is in medicine, where certain medications are known to have different levels of efficacy on different races.

If giants are genuinely more stupid than humans (and all signs would indicate that they are), then it would be both speciesist but also correct to say "giants are stupid". Whether it's moral or justified to segregate them on this fact is doubtful. We don't segregate stupid humans. However, the accusation that giants are innately violent and dangerous, if true, would be much more powerful in justifying their segregation.

As for Hagrid, he's half-giant. We don't know what traits he shares with actual giants. He certainly seems more intelligent than the "pure-blood" giants we are told about, and he's definitely not violent in character.

*** I'm not trolling, I was just thinking about House Elf rights and SPEW and it got me thinking about how wizards interact with magical creatures.

I mean, Sphinxes are as intelligent and self-aware as humans, so I think they should have equal rights and opportunities as wizards. There could be a sphinx Minister for Magic, or Sphinx professor at Hogwarts, or even a Sphinx janitor.

But what about a giant janitor? I dunno. Should centaurs be subject to the same laws as humans? I dunno. It's interesting to think about.

In regards to the rest of your post, can we honestly say that giants are genuinely more stupid than humans? Magical Britain is obviously filled with bigotry and corruption, so we can't take anything any of the characters say at face value. If you were raised on an isolated mountainside by uneducated cave people, then you would probably be as stupid and feral as Grawp. Giants are like the uncontacted tribes in the amazon; of course they're going to seem uncivilized.

I'm not saying giants /aren't/ naturally stupid, but I think this sort of thing would be interesting to explore in fanfiction, which is why I made this thread.

**** I think there's a lot more to answering the question "should human society recognise a species as having equal rights to humans?" than intelligence or self-awareness.

Your example of the sphinx is actually a very good one. Yes, they are intelligent. But they also will maul to death any person who incorrectly answers their riddles. This means that sphinxes, by their nature, are simply incapable of participating in human society as responsible citizens. It would be mind-bogglingly foolish to grant them rights as if they were humans.

I think people see the example of House Elves deserving equal status and they make an unjustified generalisation. You can't just whitewash the differences in species away. House Elves are not just intelligent, they are also highly compatible with human society: they are of the correct temperament to respect laws, they recognise human social constructs like property, they are willing to perform work, and they don't possess either biological violent tendencies or aggregated social ill-will towards wizards.

But there are obvious examples of species where this compatibility does not hold, whether for biological or social reasons. Sphinxes are one, for the reasons above. Another example, if they are indeed violent by nature, is giants. A third possible contender is vampires, who potentially need to hunt humans in order to survive. A fourth example is goblins, who are antagonistic towards wizards to the point that they renege on any agreement and seek to trick wizards into an early grave. They have fought numerous wars against wizards and have fundamentally different views on basic tenets of the social contract like private property. Goblins are not like house elves. They are not the victim of wizards. They are the wizards' *enemies* who just so happen to have lost the fight for supremacy.

Only a suicidal society gives full rights to their enemies. Sure, give them some rights such as basic protections from cruelty and exploitation, but that's a far cry from permitting full participation in civil society. You don't give the keys of the kingdom to people who are diametrically opposed to your way of life, especially in a democracy.

Really, House Elves, Centaurs, Merpeople and werewolves are the only non-human intelligent species who I think are deserving of recognition as having equal rights to wizards. Of these, centaurs and merpeople have already rejected this status because they disliked the wording ("creatures of near human intelligence") and the implication that they needed to be granted rights by humans. Werewolves, by the end of the series, are likely well on their way to legal recognition. So House Elves are kinda the unique case of a species in need of a dramatic change in legal status.

Really? So what happens when a there's an oddball sphinx that doesn't care about riddles? Or instead of maiming those that don't answer her riddles, she just tickles them or something? Can we really justify denying her individual liberties and rights, simply because of the behavior of /other/ sphinxes? Is that ethical?

I mean, you say that House Elves need a dramatic change in their legal status, yet the overwhelming majority of House Elves are content with the way things are; Dobby is just a weirdo that doesn't fit the mold of his species. And like Ron said, there are weirdo's in every species.

The possibility of there being an "oddball sphinx" is exactly what I'm disputing. Posing riddles and mauling people who get them wrong is an innate part of the nature of a sphinx. Being intelligent and sapient does not mean that you have the ability to act contrary to your nature. Sphinxes are closer to being an animal that just so happens to be able to speak than a person who just so happens to have the body of an animal. They are, so far as we can tell, creatures of animalistic instinct, despite their intelligence.

Fantastic Beasts notes this explicitly. It states that sphinxes were considered for "creature" status on the basis of their intelligence, but in the end their violent nature resulted in them being classified as beasts, a rung on the ladder /below/ House Elves and goblins.

*EDIT*

Well, no one can compel a House Elf to take up freedom, but that doesn't remove the moral obligation on wizards to at least offer it, and in the mean time guarantee certain standards of treatment.

It's a common misconception that House Elves are held in slavery by some kind of magic, or magically compelled to obey their masters. This is not the case. In GoF, Winky directly disobeys Crouch Sr: he told her to remain in the tent, but she left it and went out into the woods in direct defiance of his explicit orders. Similarly, Dobby was perfectly able to betray the Malfoys -- no magic stopped him from doing so -- but he felt compelled to punish himself afterwards.

This is why initially Hermione attempted to simply persuade the House Elves to embrace freedom. It was only after she gave up on that as hopeless that she redirected her efforts towards convincing wizards.

As a related matter, people often wonder why House Elves can do laundry if clothes free them, but the obvious answer, given the above, is that clothes only free a House Elf because this is recognised as such in House Elf society. From what we see of Winky, in theory a House Elf could just decide to wander off one day and abandon their master. But the social construct of service is so strong that even defiant House Elves like Dobby feel compelled to serve until they are provided with a flimsy excuse to leave like being unintentionally passed a sock.

If you're self-aware and intelligent, then you have the capacity to learn. If you can learn, you can learn to act against your nature. It's human nature to fear death, yet plenty of people end up killing themselves, in complete denial of their inherited Darwinian survival instincts. A less grisly example would be how humans are biological predisposed to certain logical fallacies, but we can learn to recognize those fallacies and correct our thinking.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take precautions against a species nature, but intelligence introduces a conflict between nature and experience that can't be hand-waved away.

I'd also like to point out that /Fantastic Beasts/ also says that Acromantulas are also not "beings," because they're incapable of not devouring humans that go near them. However, we know for a fact that an acromantuala that's had contact with humans during its upbringing can learn to act against its nature; Aragog never attacked Hagrid, and he didn't personally attack Harry or Ron --- he simply couldn't convince his wild children to spare them. We also saw Grawp learn to act against his supposed violent instincts. He even visited Dumbledores funeral in a suit. Plus, I highly doubt that Dumbledore would let Grawp live so close to the school if he believed Grawp was incapable of learning to live peacefully with humans. So, that's two canon examples of /Fantastic Beasts/ being wrong.

I think it's also worth pointing out that, in /Fantastic Beasts/, it specifically says that sphinxes are "usually only dangerous when what they're guarding is threatened" --- it's not like they're mindless monsters or anything. What if a sphinx was raised to protect a human, instead of protecting a treasure? Suddenly, that sphinxes "dangerous animal instincts" become ethically justified, like how a mother is ethically justified in defending their child from a murderer.

So, you can't say that it's impossible for a civilized sphinx to exist. Can we really deny that hypothetical sphinx rights and liberties?

Or how about this, would the unprovoked killing Aragog be murder? Should capturing a sphinx be a case of kidnapping? They're intelligent and conscious beings.

I think these are not the correct analogies. Suicide, while against normal human instincts, is nonetheless within our nature. Anything that humans are capable of choosing to do is, by definition, within our nature. I am talking about the unknown things that are outside our nature - things which we cannot think of, because it is beyond our cognitive ability to grasp, what Chomsky calls the limits of understanding. Intelligence does not gift a being with the ability to grasp all concepts, or to do all things. Your ability to choose is still limited by what your biological nature can conceive of, and of what you are physically capable of doing.

What I am saying is that, from what we can see, a sphinx can no more choose not to attack someone who fails to solve a riddle than a human can imagine a new colour. It is outside of our nature. It's difficult for us to conceive of, because we are the only intelligent beings we know of, and so we naturally assume that all intelligence must be like our intelligence: the ability to comprehend and choose the same things. But there's really no reason to think that human intelligence is universal among all intelligent beings.

I think the real problem here is that, while you are talking about intelligence and the ability to learn, what you are really saying is that sphinxes have free will. That is something entirely separate from the idea of intelligence. In the Harry Potter universe, which is dualist by nature, I think that question comes down to the question of whether sphinxes have souls.

Not couldn't. Wouldn't. He deliberately used a technicality to evade a promise he had made to Hagrid in order to indulge his desire to feed humans to his people. Not the greatest example for your argument, I think.

But then you trust the biased wizards' view of the nonhumans there? Isn't it overwhelmingly more likely that Sphinx /culture/ places a great importance on riddles and the ritual need to murder anyone who answers them? With assuming that it is their /innate nature/ to pose riddle and maul anyone who answers them wrong being equivalent to aliens observing humans and concluding that they have a biological compulsion to start singing anthems whenever they see a particular arrangement of colors on a piece of cloth.

********* The limits of understanding is directly proportionate to our intelligence of cognitive abilities. The reason there are things we can't think of is because we're too stupid to understand them --- the ideas are too vast or complex for the hardware of our minds to processes. That isn't a matter of instinct or nature; it's a matter of computing power.

However, we do have some degree of intelligence, and that intelligence allows us to act against our instincts.

An ant, however, has very limited intelligence, and as such is incapable of acting against outside it's inherited programming. If you cloned an ant, and then "raised" that ant in a unique environment, it would still respond to external stimuli in a way that is largely indistinguishable to the original ant that shares its genetic material.

However, if you took two identical human twin babies and raised them in radically different cultures you would end up with people who have different ideals and make different choices, despite their shared genetic code. This isn't because we humans lack instinct, nor does it mean that our instinct is less developed than that of ant.

What separates humans from ants is our ability to learn --- to observe the world and make logical conclusions based on our observations. Our intelligence allows us to act outside of our inherited programming. Our brains software is constantly being patched by our experiences, while the mechanism behind an ants decision making process is not significantly updated throughout its life.

If a magical species is intelligent, then it can learn, and grow, and update its decision making process based on its experiences. As long as it can learn, then its upbringing will in some way dictate its future actions. The ability to learn is directly tied to intelligence, and so intelligence is directed tied to a creatures capacity to act outside of what its instincts are compelling it to do.

Let's say a wizard placed a curse on a baby sphinx. This curse will make the sphinx feel excruciating pain every time it asks a riddle. The sphinx is sufficiently intelligent to recognize the causation relationship between asking riddles and experiencing excruciating pain. It'll associate riddles with unbearable suffering. It will learn not to ask riddles. This poor sphinx's inherited instincts will be updated by its experiences, and it'll grow and mature into a sphinx that acts outside its supposed nature.

This is all directly due to its ability to observe the world and draw logical conclusions based on its observations, which /is/ intelligence. So, it's not unreasonable to say that a creature's capacity to act outside of its inherited nature is in many ways directly proportional to its intelligence.

So, if a magical creature is as intelligent as a human then we should judge them as individuals, and /not/ based on their inherited nature, since that nature is subject to being overwritten by their experiences.

********** This is kinda veering into a general philosophy of mind debate, divorced from Harry Potter. On that topic neither of us can say anything new and I am not keen to summarise arguments which are far better explained in the literature. Suffice it to say that:

1. I disagree that the limits of understanding are simply a matter of computing power; the hardware matters too. The human brain is not a computer and, until our understanding of the brain improves, it remains unclear as to whether computer-based emulation of the human mind is possible. This can be characterised as either a rejection of functionalism or, alternatively, a modification to it based on the idea that certain functions can only exist on certain hardware.

2. I place a different weighting than you in the nature vs nurture debate, where I consider a person's character and values more determined by their biology than you do.

Returning to Harry Potter, you have to remember this is a dualistic world. Remember, for example, that a Dementor victim has the same intelligence as they had before being kissed. Their brain is working perfectly fine. Nonetheless, despite being of equal intelligence to a regular human, they are incapable of making even basic decisions such as deciding to eat when they are hungry.

Regardless of your opinions about the nature of intelligence in real life, within the Harry Potter world it is established that intelligence is not the be all and end all of determining a being's status. Portraits and the Sorting Hat are examples of things which are intelligent and self-aware but not sentient. They are not capable of personal growth, love, etc. Their intelligence and self-awareness are equal to a human's in appearance (i.e. the pass the Turing test) but they are in fact limited to a specific purpose and nature. Accordingly, it's entirely possible for a sphinx to be intelligent but lack any kind of ability to act contrary to its nature, because in the HP world, intelligence and self-awareness aren't really all that much. It's the ability to speak and think but it's not sufficient to grant you full sentience. That is restricted to beings with a soul.

*********** I was under the impression that portraits weren't intelligent at all. They're, like, sophisticated chatbots --- the creator inputs a behavior and sets the painting to output that behavior in response to specific new inputs.

Like how past Headmasters tell their portraits things, and "set" those portraits to only reveal that information in response to specific circumstances. And all the portraits have been set to output "pretending_to_sleep.exe" as their default behavior. So, even a portrait of an intelligent person like Dumbledore will output "pretending_to_sleep.exe" in circumstance where that output is highly inappropriate, like when Harry is about to get himself killed in the last book, simply because that portrait has no intelligence of its own to modify its outputs in a way that isn't specifically accounted for in its design. I hope you can see what I'm saying, though this is all a bit of a divergence.

As for the duality stuff, I don't think it's entirely relevant. My argument was a matter of nature vs nurture, and it doesn't matter if that nature is inherited through genetics or through the nature of the inherited soul. In my previous post, you can supplement every reference to genetics with "soul-etics" and my point still stands.

************ Re: portraits, it is not that they are enchanted with specific behaviours like a programme. Rather they are enchanted to come alive, and once alive, if the subject is a sufficiently powerful wizard, then they learn by observation:

#+begin_quote
  Some magical portraits are capable of considerably more interaction with the living world. Traditionally, a headmaster or headmistress is painted before their death. Once the portrait is completed, the headmaster or headmistress in question keeps it under lock and key, regularly visiting it in its cupboard (if so desired) to teach it to act and behave exactly like themselves, and imparting all kinds of useful memories and pieces of knowledge that may then be shared through the centuries with their successors in office.
#+end_quote

Note that the portrait isn't being programmed to follow any kind of algorithm. It's learning by observation as a child might.

Further, such portraits are capable of interaction with humans in conversation on an equal basis, without any limited domain or script. They certainly seem to meet all the normal criteria for possessing intelligence - a "general AI", as it were. And yet they are not sentient. They have no internal mental life - a "philosophical zombie".

#+end_quote

I think it's highly relevant. Your argument was that intelligence is sufficient for a being to act contrary to its nature by learning. But in the HP world, this is not a characteristic of intelligence. It is entirely possible for something to be fully intelligent and yet fixed in a certain state. The ability to change or to act contrary to your own nature is a characteristic of free will, which derives from the possession of a soul. A soulless animal which possessed full intelligence, equal to that of a human, would not have the ability to learn to act contrary to its nature.

For example, Voldemort damaging his soul damaged his ability to repent of his previous actions. He was intelligent but his character was static. However, taking Harry's blood into himself, and along with it the goodness of Lily's protective magic, gifted Voldemort with the ability to choose to act against his own nature once more. JKR explained as much on her old website:

#+begin_quote
  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.
#+end_quote

It is clear that your magical nature determines the courses of action you can choose. Voldemort's magical nature was evil, but he altered this by putting goodness in magical form into himself. By doing so, Voldemort inadvertently granted himself options that were not open to him before - he magically granted himself the capacity for goodness, which before he lacked. His intelligence was the same throughout.

Returning to your points:

#+begin_quote
  So, if giants have souls then they deserve equally rights and liberties under the eyes of the law? I'm speaking from a purely ethically perspective here, never mind the logistics of actually incorporating giants into society.
#+end_quote

If giants have souls then they are capable of exercising free will and therefore overcoming their nature.

Giving them rights, however, seems to be a political rather than ethical decision. The capacity of giants to change may well be a factor in that decision, but it would not be the only one... I imagine the fact that they have a nature to overcome in the first place may be a problem, because just because giants can overcome their nature, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will. Another factor may well be a giant's ability to cause unintentional harm through its strength and low intelligence. Like a child with a rifle.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Obviously the sphinx is intelligent enough to know that it is going to experience pain upon asking a riddle, so it will be a very miserable sphinx. Nonetheless, if the sphinx is guarding something, I think it will find itself compelled to ask a riddle to any person seeking access to the thing, and in turn attack anyone who got it wrong. That's just part of the magic of a sphinx. It's "hardwired" into the sphinx's behaviour, like an involuntary reflex.

Another example, if they are indeed violent by nature, is giants. A third possible contender is vampires, who potentially need to hunt humans in order to survive. A fourth example is goblins, who are antagonistic towards wizards to the point that they renege on any agreement and seek to trick wizards into an early grave

It's common in the fandom for people to take the fact that JKR was making an allegory with Muggleborns and assume she is doing the same with all species. I think this instinct is largely incorrect, a kind of kneejerk progressiveness which may, on a case by case basis, lack justification.

Sometimes an animal is just an animal, with no special message intended. Especially when the animal is taken from common mythology. From Fantastic Beasts (the book), it appears that JKR didn't intend for sphinxes to be anything other than a magical creature which just so happens to be intelligent.

There is no real life analogy for coexistence with a different intelligent species and I think people too easily reach for the low-hanging Godwin's law fruit. The whole point of the Muggleborn analogy is, like real life racism, there is nothing there to justify it. Pure-bloods aren't more powerful, smarter, etc than Muggleborns. But where there is a genuine difference in species, then suddenly the analogy with any real life comparison goes away. Each instance has to be considered on its own merits, there's no quick and easy "but racism!" answer.

For example, with goblins, the fact that they share many characteristics with the historical stereotype of "the Jew" cannot be a coincidence. However, I hesitate to say that JKR is intending to draw an analogy between the treatment of goblins and the treatment of Jews. The reason for this is that, unlike the Jews, the goblins have historically given as good as they got, and on top of that they do seem to be genuinely malicious and vicious in nature. I suspect that JKR's intention with goblins was to make goblins the historical origin for the myths about Jews, where ignorant Muggles associated the one with the other.

I think you were doing fine up until the goblin example. It doesn't appear to be the case that they will renege on /any/ deal, that seems to be strictly for goblin-forged artifacts (e.g. Gryffindor's sword). We have no examples of them, say spontaneously deciding to empty someone's bank vault. And since we know all currency is cast and minted by goblins, if what you were saying is true we should know of at least one instance of this occuring, but we don't. They clearly hold to their agreement with customers using their banking services. The closest I can think of is them mobbing Bagman, but we know that was because he tried to screw them over a wager he lost on the World Cup and Triwizard.

That seems to be their only real difference in view on private ownership, not a deep difference of philosophy regarding the social contract. In fact, even the rebellions are quite squarely about lacking wand ownership, not some other issue. They don't appear to be intersted in violating laws or entirely subverting broader society on the grounds of incompatible views.

****** The Goblins' view on property is that whoever makes it, owns it, and it is not possible to transfer property. It just so happens that practically, on the current social arrangement, this only comes up as an issue where wizards come into possession of goblin-made objects, but it is not limited to those items. It is a view about the nature of property in general.

So what happens if you give goblins the right to vote and allow goblins in government? You will get goblins voting in favour of laws which reflect their view on property, and administrators making decisions based on their view of what is right. This would be a massive problem and a huge own-goal for wizards.

With regards to reneging on deals, we only really have a sample size of one, so it's hard to say for sure. All I will say is that the only time we saw a character make a deal with a goblin, the goblin betrayed that deal, and did so in a deliberately vicious manner which was intended to result in the death of the counterparty. This is not the only example we have of goblins having excessively violent tendencies: the punishment for trying to break into a vault is death by dehydration, a massively disproportionate response to theft, and one that goblins seem to take delight in. Moreover, the overwhelming impression we are given of the history of the wars with the goblins (which we are not told are all about wand rights) is that they were a particularly vicious foe.

Oh, absolutely. It's the primary reason that nations deny voting rights to people of other nationalities and those outside their borders. I believe this is fully justified.

******* If that were their view on property in general then one would think people like Bill,who mention it with respect to goblin artifacts, would mention it. But no one who would know this suggests that their very currency could taken by goblins whenever they feel like it.

Is there even a voting system in wizarding UK? The Minister seems to be voted in, but by whom I don't know (maybe the Wizengamot). But even then, that's only going to apply to what they make. In which case, people will simply stop buying goblin made objects (besides which, those don't seem plentiful outside old, wealthy pure-blood families like the Blacks).

That Gryffindor apparently trusted them suggests that it was not common for goblins to renege on deals (unless we're going to say Gryffindor was out of his mind). In fact, from what we are told it's the excellent job he did which caused the goblin to try and keep it, not because he didn't plan on honoring the deal. We have more than a sample of one. I repeat, are we given the suggestion that using Gringotts is risky business because goblins might jack the contents at any time? Never hinted at, Hagrid even says it's he second safest place to put your valuables.

Griphook makes it clear wand ownership was a major factor in their rebellions. Giving evidence of their viciousness (which they are, to be fair) by pointing out how rebellions were described is silly; rebellions by nature are bloody and vicious. Harry skipped the question on his OWL that asked if wand legislation was a major factor in 18th century goblin rebellions. The 1612 rebellion was about lack of Wizengamot representation. But the Chipping Clodbury rebellion (a modern one) was explicitly about wand ownership.

You are misremembering Bill's comments.

#+begin_quote
  "Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones."

  Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. "What do you mean?" he asked.

  "We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership."

  "I respect --" Harry began, but Bill shook his head.

  "You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs."
#+end_quote

Bill is quite clear that the Goblin concept of ownership extends to all property: "the rightful and true master of *any object* is the maker". Goblin-made items are singled out only in so far as those are the ones goblins get upset about, because those are the ones they consider themselves the rightful owners of.

I would like to point out, for all the bellyaching about Griphook betraying Harry, it was Harry who had made the deal in bad faith and didn't intend to give Griphook the sword. Griphook saw through it and after keeping his end of the bargain, made Harry pay.

It is a bit sad, really. Griphook had spent most of his life resenting wizards, and despite that he had started to respect Harry.

******* As a point of order, it was Bellatrix who entrusted the goblins with the horcrux, not Voldemort.

In any case, goblins are known to be unreliable in specific ways. Bill mentions "ownership, payment, and repayment". Hufflepuff's cup was made by Helga Hufflepuff, not goblins, so goblins would not consider themselves its rightful owner. There's no payment or repayment involved, so no problem there. And providing vaults is a /service/, not a good, so no problem there so long as comply with goblin payment rules.

So there was no real risk of goblins suddenly seizing Hufflepuff's cup. This does not mean, however, that goblin ideas about ownership, payment or repayment are compatible with British wizarding society.

** First, I would like to point out that Giants are not a different "race" as we mean it, they are more like a different species.

Secondly, "race" and "racism" are largely social constructs defined by when and where you live. As an example, in the USA, up until the 1930s-1940s, the term "white" did not include anybody of Irish, Polish and Italian descent. Now it does. And NO, I am not supporting racism or the like, I am simply stating these things are defined by individual cultures and the times, and are thus abstract in what they mean.

Here is an example: blood-prejudice is functionally racism. There is no difference beyond cultural differences and history (which seems to be the origin of most racial tensions anyway). Conversely, giants and wizards are different species, with clearly distinct biological and magical differences.

If someone wiped out muggleborns in the magical world, it would be referred to as "genocide." If someone wiped out all the giants, it would be called "xenocide."

No its not racist to call them stupid. Its just pointless and cavalier. They can still kill you after all.

Are they though? Maybe 5,000 years ago some wizard student tried to brew a growth potion, but they accidentally used slime from a bullfrog instead of slime from a cane toad --- that mistake led to them growing 20 feet tall.

**** Okay, some of your question gets into the idea of whether magic has an effect on speciation and evolutionary biology. This is a rabbit hole that I am not smart enough, prepared enough, nor *want* to dive into headlong. But I will answer a certain aspect of your question.

First, you need a sizeable population for a new species to occur. That negates both the growth potion and the polyjuice from producing similar results of diverging species. Even then, there is no reason not to believe that wizards could not change someone 20 feet tall back into human, or any other magical catastrophe. There really is no proof that goblins or giants or elves are anything like humans beyond the superficial.

Secondly, you have to realize that cross-species breeding does actually occur, often in zoos. If you want some laughs, google search liger and wolphin. The point is the byproducts are almost always sterile and unable to breed. BUT, in one in a million cases or so, they can breed with another species and also have a progeny.

There are two likely possibilities for magical species. At some point a population of species were isolated from the rest, and over time diverged enough to become the way they are. Giants could have resulted from being humans trapped in mountains, similar to something like homo floresiensis. Alternatively, these species could be the deliberate byproduct of a magical species creating them. Hagrid demonstrates that you can cross-breed a chimaera and a fire crab (gross) in GoF. Try looking up the Firebird Trilogy for similar examples to this.

So no, it wouldn't be the dawn of a new species. You need a LOT of them to create a new species, and they need to be fertile and survive.
