Sour Grapes by Lillian_Silver, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16502882]], linkao3(16502882). Nice Dramione story. Twisty plot with surprises, nice slow burn romance, well written, good dramatic tension, good characterization. At a few places in the story Narcissa is super smart/wise/strong which I thought was really cool. Story gets dark in places. Recommended.

#+begin_quote
  June '03Five years after the war, Draco and Hermione meet by chance as she wanders into a French vineyard just hoping to re-live a trip she took there with her parents during her school years. Instead, she finds a shirtless, barefoot Draco Malfoy hiding out unbeknownst to the wider wizarding world. He's ashamed of his past misdeeds, and she's been recently humiliated by her soon to be ex-husband. Neither are aware that their lives are about to be inexorably linked, forever.

** Thank you for actually using the recommendation tag correctly. I wish more people would. This particular fic doesn't interest me, but I'm sure others would like it.
