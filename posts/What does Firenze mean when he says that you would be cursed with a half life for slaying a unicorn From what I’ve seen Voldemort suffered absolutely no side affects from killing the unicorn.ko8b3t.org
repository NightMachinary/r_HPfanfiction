** It was Quirrell who drank it. Having Voldemort hanging out from the back of his head was slowly killing him, and he drank the unicorn's blood so that he doesn't die.

*** Yeah, I'm inclined to think that the side effects hit Quirrell and made his miserable existence even worse. Voldemort didn't drink it and wasn't substantial enough to be affected.

**** Didn't Voldemort say "drinking unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own."

***** He could have still been referring to it sustaining the body he was possessing, treating Quirrell as his property.

Actually, you might be right on the money. As I recall, Voldemort said in the Graveyard that he possessed small animals, primarily snakes, and they all kept dying.

** I understood "cursed half-live" to mean some sort of physiological effect since he also says that drinking the Elixir of Life is a cure. Either Voldemort loses the effect when he is disembodied after the confrontation with Harry or the ritual in the graveyard cures him.

  You have slain something pure and defenceless to save yourself and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.'

  ‘But who'd be that desperate?' he wondered aloud. ‘If you're going to be cursed for ever, death's better, isn't it?'

  ‘It is,' Firenze agreed, ‘unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?'

  ‘The Philosopher's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who --'

** We know nothing about Tom Riddle's post-resurrection quality of life and even less about quality of his inner life. For all we know, he didn't have real human body, but some kind of artificial alchemic construct, which was in constant danger of falling apart, and he was kept together by a group of healers.
