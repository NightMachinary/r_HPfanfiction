:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for this for a friend of mine, I remember in the fic Harry found out he was a full blown metamorph, and decided to try being a girl to see what it was like, and found that he actually preferred being a girl.

Edit: Not sure if any of the suggestions are the right one, but I've forwarded the suggested stories to my friend. Hopefully she finds one she'll like. Thanks for the help folks


** I feel like I just saw this one the other day but can't find it in my history. Female Harry is "Rose" and but isn't the dominant personality. That one?

*** There's one where when Harry's name comes out of the GoF, he asks for which school he's been entered and it's a girls' school - could've been Salem's Witches Institute. So he decides to "prank" everyone by turning himself into a girl who turns out to look like his mother. Harry gets their own private room because the boys' dormitory obv won't do anymore. I think there might've been a scene where they pretend to be Lily's ghost to scare the shit out of Snape. That's all I really remember, maybe someone else knows of it.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  It starts with a prank and some spite to the Ministry - a gender swapping potion, courtesy of the Weasley twins, just to mess with people. So, uh, if this was all just some joke, why the hell does it actually feel... Refreshing? Must just be a change of pace. (Trans!Harry Potter, attempts at daily uploads. Starts with Goblet of Fire.)
