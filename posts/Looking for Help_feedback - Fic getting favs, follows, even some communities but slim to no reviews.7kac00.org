What the title says. I took a small hiatus from a fic and usually draw inspiration from reviews but have not gotten any on the newest chapter. Readers when do you review? And authors is this the same for you? (I guess no reviews are better than bad reviews). Thanks for any help or thoughts!


** People are lazy. I've read /so/ many fics I havent left reviews for

*** Honestly, people might hate me, but I've never reviewed anything. I tend to read more popular of completed fics though.

** They're usually not reviews. Typically, what post are comments or questions. So you need to have something to entice those comments and questions out of them. Have something surprising or interesting in every chapter that would elicit a remark. End on a cliff hanger. Have someone with unclear motives and objectives.

Or, the old favorite, just tease various parings and watch the fanboys and girls rage.

** I leave reviews whenever I read a story that leaves an impression, or if it particularly frustrates me. I've left maybe a total of 100 reviews in total. Most of them have been suggestions or constructive criticism, I think. The ones where I just praised the story were usually the ones that I especially loved reading.

The most I've gotten in a single chapter, as an author, is 30 reviews. That was for a chapter that had a lot of action, which I expect is the reason. I also got a bunch when I left a different chapter on a cliffhanger, but those reviews were mostly just "Oh no, cliffhanger! Update soon!"

Maybe your story just doesn't have anything someone might want to comment on?

** I've posted half a dozen consecutive chapters without getting a single review more than once. It is disheartening but you have to keep plodding on. It's character-building.
