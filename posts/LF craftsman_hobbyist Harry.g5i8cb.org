*I am looking for fanfiction in which the MC - it doesn't have to be Harry - takes up an interesting craft or hobby. It can be an internship, a job, apprenticeship, a student's club, you name it.*

The most important part is for the character to be invested in something more than obligatory lessons and possibly the BBEG. I would like to see more happening in that wonderful world. It can be happening in Hogwarts, or (preferably) outside its walls. As long as it's something new!

*Examples:*\\
linkao3(Ninja Wizard Book 5 by mad_fairy) It's HP/TR, but doesn't let the pairing dominate, so even though I dislike the pairing, I enjoyed the story. It introduces the Melting Pot - a student club dedicated to pursuing practical projects with magic, like building houses, hot tubs...

linkao3(Mischief's Heir by mad_fairy)By the same author, a MCU fusion. Hogwarts has Explorer's Club Inc. Its members start the first wizard space program on top of many other cool things.

linkffn(3252882)Has a rock band. And a lot of other stuff of varying quality, but I remember it as a fun, light read.

I know there was a travel/exploration Fic where Harry was an apprentice to Ollivander.

** Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion linkffn(11610805)

First year Vernon simply says, "No." to Hogwarts and that's that. Then he makes Harry get a job. Harry's an accomplished carpenter at his job and he also picks up painting. He eventually gets drafted into the TriWiz and puts his skills to use in the tasks.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  Start with Harry Potter, change something, and Harry learns to rock. Irreverent, chaotic, and the more movies you've seen, the funnier you're likely to find it. Expect many cammeos.
