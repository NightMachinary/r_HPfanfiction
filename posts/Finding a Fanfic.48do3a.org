I didn't see a topic like this, so apologies in advance if I missed a thread just like this. Basically, if you can't remember the name of a fanfic you're trying to find, describe it and see if someone can find it. (Also, you might just hear about a fic someone else is looking for that you might want to read too)

Anyway, I'm looking for a specific fic. Basically, Neville is BWL(not a wrong BWL fic) and Harry's parents still die but this mostly goes unnoticed since Harry isn't the BWL. Harry ends up a orphan who doesn't know about magic until his first year. His last name was something like "Kessinger" I think. Fanfic still centers around Harry, even though he isn't BWL. Fic was incomplete when I last read it, still in first year.


** I hate to give it more readers because it's such a terrible story, but anyway, it's Fortune Favors the Bold by koria27.

*** Linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11357426/1/Fortune-Favors-the-Bold]])

But, yeah it looks pretty terrible.

One with similar setup (neville bwl, harry gets adopted) is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]]). This one is much better, imo.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  On Halloween, Voldemort chooses to attack the Longbottoms instead of the Potters, marking Neville as the Boy-Who-Lived. A world where everyone cares a lot less about what happens to Harry Potter. Everything is different, except not really. T for language, though it's not too bad.

*** I was going to comment on the fact you called it bad, but then I read the first chapter. You... you aren't wrong. Normally I like to think with longer stories that the author has put a decent amount of time into the story, because god knows I have for my longer ones. However it looks like this person has the ability to write a long time about nothing, not proofread, give no back story, and put out a chapter.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

**** Thank you for the help, but that isn't it. I forgot to mention, neither Harry nor anyone else knows Harry is Lily and James's son. Also, Harry is a Gryffindor in the fic, if that helps.

** I'm also looking for a fanfic, it is a harry potter/avengers fanfic as far as I can remember, the story is that harry becomes a endless but Fate hates the fact he gets more attention than her because he is the new endless so she tricks him into endlessly reincarnating and in the latest instance of his life he was born a female and is the daughter of tony stark and a woman he used to date in college, she then goes on to begin interning at Stark towers so she can see what type of person her father is but she ends up getting kidnapped along with tony and ends up in the cave with him to which she then confesses to being his daughter after the guy in the cave says that she should. Anyway that's about as much as I can remember about it if anyone knows what it is please let me know.

  Book I of the E're Series: "I can't do the equation without all the variables." Tony Stark has always had to deal with variables. But when he miscalculates a new one everything he knows changes. There is a new player in the game, one that will shake up the world, and leave nothing the same. The very future of every world rests on the unknown. Hp isn't a big factor till book II. R&R
