Sirius is one of JK Rowling's most complex characters and my absolute favourite. However, it saddens me what fanon has turned him into: someone who's only defined by them being a huge flirt, a stupid, baseless idiot (which directly goes against canon) and a beacon of light that can do no wrong. So what I'm asking for is a good Sirius-centric fanfiction, that does justice to his character (exceptionally intelligent, outstandingly talented, top of his year, complex, moody and reckless as well as a bit mad).

I've already read A Black Comedy (didn't like), Dark Birthright, A Marauder's Plan, Harry Potter and the Deux Ex Machina, the Unbroken Universe and Renascentia.

Romance is OK, except for Wolfstar. Any time period is also fine. I'd also prefer no time-travel or crossovers but I guess it's OK as long as it does justice to his character.

Thanks in advance! :)


** I'm really enjoying Sirius in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][Black Sheep Dog series]] by izzythehutt.

*** Its a time travel fic. I've read it twice, it's really good, and the time travel makes it.... Plausible? It's not everyone's cup of tea though, and it gets pretty explicit. There's no wolfstar, but there /is/ a rather explicit sexual encounter involving Remus and Sirius at one point.

**** In case this helps, it's not a Hermione + older man kind of story. Before the time travel, there's some obvious chemistry between Hermione and Sirius but nothing inappropriate happens between them at this point. Once Hermione goes back in time, she is the same age as the marauders and they start dating as teenagers.

***** No, that has nothing to do with it, honestly.

It's just the pairing itself. Hermione and Sirius. It's because of the nature of Harry's relationship with these two. Their age doesn't matter to me.

And maybe because I always prefer the H/Hr one, though I'm not sure whether I'd be ok with Sr/Hr even if I didn't like the former.

****** Fair enough, just thought it might be useful to clarify. Personally, this isn't an issue for me as Sirius isn't Harry's godfather back in the 70's and Hermione lives with them in this time period for a very long time. But of course everyone's got a different interpretation of it, if the pairing just doesn't work for you, then that's obviously fine.

I was about to recommend some of the author's other stories to you as they are genuinely very well written and she's got a huge range of different pairings, although a lot of them fit into this category of pairings that you're probably not going to like... She does have a WIP ongoing which is H/Hr, I've not read it yet but I've seen it recommended a lot. It's linkffn(The Reclamation of Black Magic) Maybe give this one a try!

** Have you checked out Innocent by marauderlover7? It's a multi-part series (5 with one regularly in progress) that is pretty much my ideal fanfic. It focuses more on the relationship between Harry and Sirius rather than Sirius alone, but it might still interest you if you like Sirius. It's got a lighter tone that leans more to canon IMO than a more grittier approach (which I'm not knocking). Nice humor as well that doesn't stray into outright comedy.

***** I'm still new to fan fic in general, but I can make a recommendation that I think could settle the score.

Read Alexandra Quick, if you haven't. It has nothing to do with Harry and Hogwarts, and if you can get past that and like the main character despite their flaws(a lot of people honestly don't like the story because of those), this fic is insanely good and well-written. It's by the first fan fic author I ever read and his Hogwarts story is good as well, but I personally think this one is his best.

***** I'll have a look at some stuff I've read and get back to you in the next few days. Off the top of my head I can think of one that is similar but it's got Sirius/Remus slash. It's tastefully done and the author is a professional playwright so it's well written. It's called Stealing Harry By Copperbadge on AO3. He's got a bunch of other Harry Potter fics as well but I think many of them are also slash and don't know if you're bothered by that. Hope you find something you like and I'll put up anyone's I can find among my collection that fit! ( pretty sure there must be one?!)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

Edit: I just noticed that you said no time travel, but you won't regret reading this story anyways.

It is not a normal fic, but a series of stories/letters/photos/etc. of the Marauders. Google it and you'll find it very quickly. Incredible read - an absolute classic.

**** I have to say I agree with you. I was not a Wolfstar fan (and I still don't search the fics out but I will read a wolfstar if it's a good story: see: All the Young Dudes). But this fic was so much more than that in my opinion.

I think for me the big issue is if Wolfstar was real: Sirius and Remus wouldn't have believed the other to be the spy. There's no plot line that can convince me otherwise. I think the Shoebox Project was abandoned at just the right time and had so much other wonderful content within so I still look fondly on it. It wasn't pinholed in only their relationship (which can't always be said about other fics).
