*** What do you mean? I love fics where Harry can shoot laser beams, cast any spell wandless and without moving, turn into any animal, fly, command every animal, is master of death, has every seat in wizengamot, owns Hogwarts, has more money than all of the others combined, knows 23 martial arts, master swordsman, trained in navy, gym master, the very best like no one ever was, owner of 7 dragon balls, member of both avengers and justice league, has sharingan, shinigami powers and devil fruit, and lo and behold when the first charms class hits he's like; "i shouldn't levitate this feather before Hermione to not give away my advantage".

**** And of course there's the retarded Dumbledore tottering around twinkling his eyes to attract mind rape targets to help Lockhart figure out who he can physically rape with Snape in some sort of grotesque Lovecraftian foursome. But never fear! Harry knows his rights! He'll shout at Dumbledore over the slightest thing! No evil shall remain uncommented upon in his mind's dialogue! NONE! But wait, shouting out might make people realize his wands actually Godzilasilithulu claw with a core of thestral unicorn virgin blood (cus its so metal) and people might think he's dark!

***** I'd like to see some well done revenge fanfiction. I mean really channeling their inner Count of Monte Christo by tearing their life apart at the seams one piece at a time. Not the retarded "I'mma yell at you until you suddenly feel bad for the shit you've shown no remorse for until this very moment" thing. I vaguely remember one Ranma story that did it relatively well, but I can't remember the name for the life of me.

***** Sadly there is, i remember reading a WBWL story where he was trained by Merlin himself. The story was so bad i can tell you all of it in 2 sentences. Imagine canon Harry Potter, now everything happens exactly the same, only thing that changes is Harry does nothing and some invisible guy does it for him. No i'm not using invisible as in he is doing it secretly, he is like right there, invisible near his brother and Voldemort and does the magic for things to go like canon. Voldemort burned because of Lily's sacrifice? Nuh-uh, super secret ancient magic Harry used super secret ancient spell while invisible to burn him. That was not even exaggration, that example was actually from the fic itself.

*** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is a great example, and a brilliant story overall. However, Harry Crow is nowhere near as strong imo, as there's no tension in the plot and the characters all act the way a fourteen-year-old imagines adults behave. I've not read the rest of your recommendations.

I think *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]]* by Epic Solemnity fits your criteria.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different? And how much different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it? Harry/Riddle.
#+end_quote

There's also *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/7/Death_of_Today][Death of Today]]* by the same author.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment. Harry/Riddle.

They're both slash though that's a small aspect of both of them.
