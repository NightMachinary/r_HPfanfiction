Harry's life at the end of his 5th year was in utter chaos and his life was not going to get any better any time soon. From the flames, a brotherhood thought dead will reemerge, a family will break, trust will be destroyed, an enemy will change their path, a father will finally be found, a love will bring hope, and a hero shall rise from the ashes to become the legend he was born to be.


** One of my favorites
