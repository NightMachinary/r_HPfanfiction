I understand some level of discretion is necessary but i get really annoyed by stuff like - let's leave Sirius in Azkaban for a few more years - maybe I shouldn't stop my parents from dying and myself from having a horrible childhood, but it's okay to hang with them and the marauder for a year - I bet it's a great idea to plan the next 4 years of my live based on voldemorts resurrection playing out exactly like it did the first time around - dating people who are older than me 20 years into the future is somehow wrong

I'd like one where the main character just goes like " meh, this is definitely not the worst outcome for a kid that's marked for death and has two friends and a nightmare of a home life " and actually uses it as an opportunity to do something productive.

*Not looking for an easy mode speed run of the story.


** linkffn(A little child shall lead them) is basically that exact premise. It's not the greatest fic ever, but it's the usual White Squirrel quality, and fairly short. You'll enjoy it, I think.

** Waiting for that Graveyard Resurrection Scheme is now IMHO the biggest BS in time travels. I mean they knew Voldemort was hiding as a wraith in Albanian forest or as a homunculus in Riddle House, and he was WEAK in those forms! A direct attack on Voldemort when he was in those weak forms would have a far greater chance of success. They didn't need to destroy all the Horcruxes by that point either, since they could just subdue Voldemort.

Fortunately, there are still some decent time travels that don't buy into this BS (in addition to those recommended):
