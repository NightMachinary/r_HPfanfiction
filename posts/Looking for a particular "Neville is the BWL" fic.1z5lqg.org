IIRC the basic premise is that Lily didn't die, and escaped the country with Harry and Sirius, Neville becomes Boy-Who-Lived etc but becomes spoiled due to his Grandmother posturing him and whatnot. He's dating Ginny, but is a dick. The Potters and Sirius return to England in canon book 6 and shit hits the fan.

It's been ages since I've read it and I can't for the life of me think of what it's called. Would really appreciate it if anyone could help me out.

Edit:

It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][Return of the Marauders]]. I highly recommend it, much thanks to [[/u/thatonecoolguy]].

*** Nah, it's a different one... The only magic school mentioned other than Hogwarts is Beaubatons, and that's only in passing.
