Hey guys I just finished reading HP&TBWL by Santi and absolutely fell in love with the original characters in the story, ESPECIALLY Calypso Rosier. They're super multifaceted and I want to know them more so it got me thinking, what's everyone's favorite original character they've read in a Harry Potter fic? This can include “blank slate” characters like certain depictions of Daphne Greengrass or Tracey Davis but I'd prefer actual OCs if any come to mind. Links appreciated for context!

  Written as a bit of a bonus/gift for everyone who enjoyed reading All the Young Dudes, but specifically for everyone who wanted to know what happened to Grant, my OC from that fic.In two parts, because you know what I'm like.Set in 2016.

** The /Second String/ definitely comes to mind for this since it is full of OCs and 'blank slate' characters like Griselda Marchbanks and Caradoc Dearbon. I loved the OCs in this, especially Pel and the barflies. I liked that all the OCs were real-seeming adults, not kids, and each was given real characterization. Other than Pel, I loved Dalcopp, the drunken lift repairman (based, I think, on the character Norm from the old sitcom "Cheers"), who could have been a throw-away character or there just for easy laughs but by the end was tragic and heroic and human in a really touching way. linkao3(15465966).

** As far as the "blank slate" characters, the Daphne Greengrass of "What's Her Name in Hufflepuff?", linkao3(22283053), is one of my favorites. She can talk to turtles. And she knows a very useful spell for identifying rocks.

I'll also say the Albus Severus Potter in "Progress, Not Perfection" is an excellent depiction of what a toxic little shit a teenaged boy from a privileged family will always be.

As for purely original OCs, I jave a huge soft spot for Gemma Rees of Loose Cannon, linkao3(26804215), which is teeming with great OCs (Lucinda Bellamy nee Spoonwocket is another great one).

La Pantera from Accidental Animagus, linkao3(14078862) is an excellent Dark Lady OC.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  All of Wizarding Britain suffered in the war, but few suffered more than Hermione Granger. After over a decade away, the brightest witch of her age is returning to England to take a position at Hogwarts. But although Hermione survived the war, she isn't quite the person she once was. While Hermione struggles to find happiness in her new life, some of her most treasured companions struggle to come to terms the ways their old friend has changed. In the end, whether with old friends, old enemies, or new proteges, this fic follows Hermione as she (hopefully) learns that she still has people in her corner, even after all these years.

** It's still sadly unfinished and seems destined to remain that way, but the best OCs in the fandom are Merlin, Rahn, Rahji and Ayati from linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh). Those characters take on a life of their own.

Titus Button in TE7's various stories, most especially linkffn(Vitam Paramus) is another great OC. Always the friend who's there no matter what happens. A voice of reason amongst more emotional characters.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

** I quite enjoy Rose Peta-Lorrum from Harry Potter and the Girl in Red. It's a D&D fic in the vein of Harry Potter and the Natural 20, but that follows a similar starts-whimsical-then-rapidly-descends-into-darkness path to canon. The series description says it all, really:

#+begin_quote
  An innocent, delicate flower is ripped from her home and dropped into a world where nothing makes sense. Armed with her intelligence and imaginary friend, and owning nothing but the magical clothes on her back (and anything that will fit in her picnic basket), Rose Peta-Lorrum must now survive the trials of the Rowling Plane.

  Warning: Starts out light and cracky, but gets darker the farther in you get.

(Rose is neither innocent nor delicate)
