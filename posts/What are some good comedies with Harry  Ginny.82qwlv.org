** I don't have a lot of experience with shipping, but I recently read "Learning to Breathe" by onoM. Harry is essentially a magical supersoldier struggling to interact with normal people. Kind of a dreamboat (for me), if slightly broken. Ginny is the supremely unfortunate girl who has to put up with all his shit, because she was stupid enough to fall head over heels for him.

It IS abandoned though, and I seeeeriously suggest you avoid the last few chapters. There's a dramatic turn that was 120% over the line for me. That shit was NOT kosher.

**** We see draco put on a mean magical item, that can control his actions. The man controlling is essentially satans bigger, meaner older cousin....Steve.

The author puts one of those rings on Ginny...aaaand my brain just kind of shut down.

** Linkffn(9818387) This is a fairly lighthearted story that has fun with the Soul bond but later on also has an interesting plot. Its Dumbledore is delightful.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
