I would prefer OC and stories that centre on how squibs try and live in the magical world.


** Not a squib, but in this one Tom Riddle Sr whos a Muggle tries to make a place for himself in the wizarding world so his son grows up well known. He never says he's a wizard but he's careful to not make it known he's a Muggle.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I'm writing one, I haven't seen near enough though. Mostly when I've seen squibs they're one or two characters in independent Harry fics

  Gather close to hear the tale of a woman who lied her way into Hogwarts, threatened animate objects, tricked her teachers, and fooled her classmates, proving once and for all that Squibs deserve better.
