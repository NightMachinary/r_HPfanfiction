Harry acting/speaking like he's gen z, mixed with canon antics

"Mister Potter, are you stating that when Miss Granger was in trouble, instead of calling a teacher, or /anyone/ that wasn't a first year, you ran up to the troll, climbed on its back, yelled "yeet", shoved your wand up its nose, then proceeded to flail off it's neck until Mister Weasley knocked it out?"

"Aight, imma be honest with you chief, it played out much differently in my head."

"Mister Potter?"

"Yes Ma'am?"

"You're an imbecile."

"That's fair."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"It seems Potter has lost control of his broom!"

"There's a dick joke in there, somewhere..." Harry mumbled to himself, about to fall to his death.

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Why is he taking of his turb- SWEET MERCIFUL BUDDHA WHAT THE-?!"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry got into the flying car, gleefully humming "We're going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship, zooming through the sky-"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Did you guys see where that bludger was headed for?! If I didn't skrt out the way in time I would be deadass dickless-!"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

After a moment, Harry frantically scribbled down,

"Wait, you've been trapped in a diary for /fifty years???/"

"It's a journal, but technically yes-"

"Oooof"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry looked at the teenage apparition doing his spelling lesson infront of him, he glanced down at Ginny, then the sorting hat, and up at the emerging basilisk.

"Ah shit, here we go again."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"I hope Malfoy dies in a barn fire, no cap."

"SKRREEE-!"

"EEEEIIIII-!"

"He'll be fine, its just a scratch."

"Hagrid! You have to take him to the hospital wing!"

"Lmao, tis but a flesh wound. But eh, close enough."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"-Harry Potter's God father!"

"I'm shook."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry looked between the unconscious Snape, and the three homeless looking men fighting in front of him.

"Stop your sniveling Pettigrew! We know it was you who betrayed James and Lily!"

"Anna oop-"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry slowly crept away from the deranged man that had cornered him at the Quittich WC, and looked around.

"HELP! I NEED AN ADULT-!"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"I swear to wizard-Jesus if someone so much as /looks/ at me like they think I cheated I'm gonna go /fucking feral-/"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"ARE YOU SEEING THIS?! Ladies and Gentlemen, Potter has just climbed on the /Hungarian Horntail's back/ and is riding it-!"

"I take back what I said about the tournament! This is fucking LIT-!"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry glanced around the graveyard, counting Cedric's body, thirty or so Deatheaters, and Jeff Goldbloom-straight-from-'The-Fly'-Voldemort himself.

"Haha, I'm in danger."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Harry, can you /please/ try to take this trial seriously?! If you don't even try to defend yourself you could be expelled!"

"It is what its is, it do be like dat sometimes doe."

"HARRY FOR F-"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Everything you've been told about You-Know-Who is a /lie/."

"Oh, I do not care for you."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"For real tho Ron, if you ask me about my mental state one more time I swear on Merlin's saggy nutsack I will suplex you right out of the tower."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"If y'all are down, I'm finna go save my God daddy and possibly start a new war, viva la resistance, g?"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Harry?"

"Sup?"

"Are you okay?"

"Emotionally and mentally no, but I use my humor to distance myself from my overwhelming grief and anxiety, which I suspect stems from the death of my godfather, and the depression/ptsd I've amassed over the course of my shit show that I call a life. But physically, I'm g."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Did you drink the liquid luck?"

"It's a possibility."

"You're an idiot."

"Bruv, why you gotta be so sus? Not a vibe 'Mione, not. A. Vibe."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry stumbled down the astronomy tower, barely making it towards his friends before he fainted.

"That epic gamer moment when Snape unalives Dumbledore."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Hermione and Ron watched from the tent as Harry sat in the middle of a field and screeched, absolutely numb to his shit by now.

"REEEEEEEEEE-!"

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

"Harry Potter, come to die."

"LOL, bet. I've always wanted to die, this ain't a special occasion."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Harry watched as Voldemort slumped to the ground dead.

"And that's on Expeliarmus. Periodt."

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Thats all I got, its 3:33am rn, I'm gonna sleep and reflect on this abomination.

Also if yall know any fics like this, please link em.


** This may be the best and worst thing I've read in recent memory. Granted, memory has more holes in it than a colander, but my point stands!

The deadpan "wtf" from everyone else is what makes this. Although I feel this is less 'Gen Z' than it is 'Gen Z by way of Internet memes', but I appreciate both the effort and the insanity required to cram so much ridiculousness I to such a short bit of writing.

No matter how many people watched Little Einsteins as kids it's not actually something I've seen referenced in person. Just online, rarely. Also, "anna oop" is another spelling of "and I oop". It's harder to recognize when it's been further shortened.

The OP is likely gen z since they have great grasp on when to use gen z slang in a sentence. Many people who aren't gen z can pick up a slang word but it won't work naturally in a sentence for them.

*** Honestly tho don't even worry, Gen Z humor makes /absolutely zero sense./ It's so broken, that we make jokes about and acknowledge how stupid it is. The best explanation I can give is we see someone do something weird or funny, then we talk about it, create a word or reference of some kind, put it in our everyday vocabulary, use it till we get tired of it, then use it occasionally, maybe changing It's meaning by making it ironic. Its pretty much all one big inside joke lol.

***** you say that

but being bitter all the time can't be that healthy for either mindstate or blood pressure

In all seriousness, the sentiment you're espousing is ridiculously overblown. "kids these days" aren't spending inordinate amounts of time on the internet doing /mysterious harmful internet things/, all that's happened is media has shifted. The internet is the supreme aggregator, which condenses newspapers, books, phones, letters, TV, and also creates Social Media, which hasn't existed before.

Think about how much time people /actually/ spent away from all those things I've just mentioned before the internet. It's not a lot.

Not to mention, kids are really, really naive. It sounds mean, but it's true. They don't know anything! You cannot stop the march of civilisation, but you also can't throw your hands in the air and give up raising them. Kids need borders, or else they'll overdo it - just like a dog will overeat. But they also need to /understand/ these borders, or they'll disregard them out of spite or because they don't see a reason. And "because I say so" isn't a reason unless the real reason is inappropriate for children.

Social spaces have shifted, away from what you know, towards what you don't. Yes, it seems strange. Everything new does. But you gotta accept it and open your mind to new ideas, and dumbfuck jokes like the one I responded to are not productive, they reinforce your cozy little mindstate instead.

** I'm a millenial, and this story has references to humor from the time period where I was most actively looking for memes and internet culture, like end of 2000's to early 2010's. That's just before the first gen z's have the privilege of chatting on the interwebs.

Before reading this story, remember that memes age fast and they may age badly. Judge your predecessors kindly.

1. What's the rocket ship reference? 2) do people say 'periodt' out loud? And does it sound like somebody is making the t sound at the end of "period" or does somebody really say "period tea?" 3) Your drabble made me laugh. Thank you :)

Fun fact for anybody unaware, shook has definitely been used by Gen X and Gen Y people. There was even a rap song that used that word extensively which was really popular in the mid/late 90s ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTKpYJ80OVQ][Shook Ones Part II]]). To be fair though, I didn't see that word on the internet until 3ish years ago.

**** 1. there was a show in the early 2000s that many gen z kids watched or knew of called "Little Einsteins", and someone made a remix of the song that plays when they go into their rocket ship. It was kind of a bop/meme for awhile on tiktok especially.
2. Periodt is pronunced periot, and the saying comes from the show "City Girls" in which they say it like that as a sentence closer. Like, "I'm done, that's the tea, periodt."
3. your welcome! And thanks for the nice comment ‚ò∫

** It's extra funny because canon Harry is peak Gen X despite being born in the last year of it. So it's really funny to see him so drastically different. Also canon often writes Harry and CO as millenials, because they are millennials writing their favorite characters. I think it would be a breath of fresh air to read fics where they are either written as too cool Gen Xer's (HP is set in the 90's for fucks sake) or just write them as incredibly earnest Zoomers. I'm so tired of reading the same millennial drivel
