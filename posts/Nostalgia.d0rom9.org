I have been reading Fanfiction for years. I don't even know how many. It feels like ages since I started. I was reading fanfics even before Fanfiction had an app. I have read so many fanfics that I have started to re-read the good ones. I remember finishing the Harry Potter series for the first time and searching google for Harry/Hermione content, pics and so on. Then I saw the very first fanfic that I have ever read.

linkffn(Epiphany by Hemlata)

A fairly simple and short one yet it was enough for me to start reading fanfiction and not just Harry Potter but many other fandoms.

So this is my question to you.

What is the very first Harry Potter fanfic you have ever read? Or the one you can remember?


** Linkffn(Resonance by greengecko). Harmony and Severitus stories were my introduction to HP fan fiction. The idea of both, especially Snape adopting Harry, was absurd to me, so naturally I read the story and eventually found potions and snitches.

** linkffn(Brown Coat, Green Eyes by nonjon) I initially got into fanfiction due to the cancellation of an inspired tv show, but there wasn't much out there since it only had one season and a movie worth of material. By that point, Harry Potter fanfiction boasted 300,000 stories to sample, compared to ~2500 for Firefly/Serenity.

** linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50). It was a surprise for me that an amateur writer is able and willing to publish a novel on the Net for free, which is quality comparable to the “real” literature.

** Oh god. I think I listened to one on youtube as an audiobook. I hadn't even realized fanfics existed back then. I was looking for a HP audiobook but instead listened to a fanfic. It was about James and Lily and how they got together. It was quite sweet and I think that's the way I found out what fanfictions are. I started out so innocent in comparison to what I read now...

** Honestly, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which a lot of ppl seem to hate, and they don't recommend as an introductory fanfic, but it was my first hp fanfic and what got me interested. I think I was generally turned off by the shippy nature of many fanfics (not really a romance fan). I cringe especially when it's something like /Draco always found the bespectacled green-eyed boy attractive and his heart raced every time their eyes met/ and they try to excuse his bullying as 'tugging on a girl's pigtails' (which I hate just generally, but I hate even more that ppl portray the tugging on pigtails trope as cute). And there's always some jealous alpha male who's dominant and (supposedly) seductive and it's soo tacky. But I digress.

hpmor, was my introdcution into alternate universe fics, which were not driven by a ship. And honestly, I didn't love it at first. There was so much canon bashing, and, even though I can see the author tried to put up obstacles, somtimes I felt Harry got his way with people too easily. Among a various other issues, I didn't expect to read more than 10 chapters before I got tired of it. But I read on and I kind of loved it. I loved that when he was using the time-turner too much, his use was restricted. I loved that Harry wasn't automatically magically skilled cos he's the Chosen One. I loved that even on the scientific side, which he prides himself on, his experiments on magic didn't work out like he thought they would. I loved the battles. I loved the Azkaban part. I just love it in general and it's still one of my favourite fics.

side note: I found it while I was searching for a pdf for Prisoner of Azkaban, which I still can't find. So if anyone has a pdf for Prisoner of Azkaban, pls link

  A DH story, fairly true to the original plot line, written from Hermione's perspective, starting from the point where Ron left... A story of Hermione discovering, in the silences shared with her best friend, what love truly meant... what love had meant all along. (No Ron-bashing).

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
