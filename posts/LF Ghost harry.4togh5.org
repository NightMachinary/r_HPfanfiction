I just read Grim Grinning Ghosts linkffn(11065365), as suggested by the supernatural thread, and wanted more in that vein, specifically the ghost Harry bit. Complete is preferable, as I am not a patent woman.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8495049/1/If-I-Die-Young][If I Die Young]] -- linkffn(8495049) -- 6yo Harry is killed by Vernon and his ghost is discovered in the cupboard.

***** I tried reading the first few chapters, but had to quit. The work is in dire need of spell check and proofreading.

I think it is an interesting premise, but not interesting enough to make it worth my while to slog through.

****** Fair enough. I've honestly stopped worrying about spelling and grammar in fanfic. Spelling errors actually make me pay more attention to a text because I have to stop and figure out what they meant to say. For example, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4tpvhe/why_i_hate_the_deathly_hallows_items/][this post is awesome]] -- very little punctuation, and I'm pretty sure they wrote "thief" when they meant to write "they're". It's like reading poetry. :)

******* I had to stop reading too, I didn't notice huge spelling errors, but spelling isn't my best subject. For me it was the "pov" announcement throughout chapters. It was really distracting. The idea was interesting, but the writer didn't really do anything with it, it felt like a rerun of first year only with Harry being a ghost. After the Mirror and troll in the bathroom, I realized I was skimming and closed it.

  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending.

** linkffn(The First Step is Fatal) Dudley pushes Harry down the stairs and into a brand new TV. It's a good thing he's dead, or Vernon would have killed him. 60k fic that will probably never be completed, so no worries about waiting.

  Harry enters Hogwarts under strange circumstances where he is sorted into Slytherin. Not what he expected when he fell down the stairs and died at home on Dudley's eleventh birthday. Possession would have been Harry's last guess at a second chance.AU1styr
