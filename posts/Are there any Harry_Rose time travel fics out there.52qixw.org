I don't normally care for time travel fics, but this idea appeals to me. Partly because Harry canonically is attracted to Ginny and if Rose inherited the right traits from her parents, she'd be similar enough to her. And also partly because the idea of Harry falling for the daughter of his best friends is as weird as it is juicy.

Can't find any fics for this idea though, sadly.


** Not what you're asking for but really similar is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]]. It's a canon-compliant (but not CC) time travel where adult lily Luna goes back to 1980 for a couple days and has a brief romance with Sirius. It's not a fix-it fic because it uses canon time travel (everything already happened that will happen etc.), but some stuff is really satisfyingly "fixed" anyway.

There are also some adult (40+) Harry scenes with 20 year old Sirius that are great. All the next-gen kids in this are great, real characters too. Linkffn(5846417)

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

**** As far as I know there's no fic like that. But I've read a good one with similar elements (next gen girl time travels, romance with older gen guy). If all you want is Harry/Rose smut, just do a search for it on ao3. My rec was well suited to the request in the other important respects.

Also, just because you're OP doesn't mean it's all about you. I've found some favorite fics rec'd on threads that aren't what OP wanted exactly.

Finally, I took the time to find that fic for you, link it, and write a description. If it wasn't helpful to you, just say nothing. Anything else is bad manners.

** Is it going to be forward time-travel?

Are there going to be two Harrys simultaneously?

**** No time-turners, or a Harry/Rose pairing would blow the universe.

However, a Albus/Rose/Scorpius dimensional time-travel to an alternative universe 20 years in their past would be highly interesting.

It could begin with something like that:

About 1.5 years after the CC fiasco (no time turner in my head canon, but Delphi caused different troubles at Hogwarts), the new Trio got their hands on another dangerous artifact. It blew up in their face and threw them to an parallel universe 25 years in their past. They showed up in Diagon Alley exactly on the day their parents did their shopping before year 6.

****** I'm perfectly happy with Hermione being the Minister, Albus in Slytherin, and best friend with Scorpius. I'm also happy with Scorpius being a great kid.
