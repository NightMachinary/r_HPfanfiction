I'm wondering if anyone though of another way to destroy the horcrux in Harry. For example, since the horcrux is in Harry's scar can't you just remove the skin that the scar is on and then destroy it.


** I think the most believable way to do it is to use Lily's protection magic pre-GoF, in the period when Voldemort remains vulnerable to it.

I don't like any kind of easy "extraction" magic - this undermines the very concept of the horcrux, which is that the soul fragment and the container become one such that the fate of the soul fragment is tied to the fate of the container.

However, Harry is in the unique situation of being a container with other stuff inside it as well: namely Harry's own soul, and Lily's protection magic. I think this creates an interesting angle in that there are different magical forces at play inside of Harry and they are hostile to each other.

In canon, Lily's protective magic only seems to respond to Voldemort when he is an external, physically present, threat. However, you could perhaps come up with a series of events which ends up turning Lily's magic inward and destroying the soul fragment.

Given the known rarity and power of Lily's protective magic, I think you could get away with using it without undermining the seriousness of horcruxes. But the events which led to the magic being turned inwards would have to be sufficiently weighty to make it feel earned, still - it couldn't be just a case of chatting to a healer who redirects the magic with a simple spell.

** I think that, as a general principle, any proposal to dehorcrux Harry needs to answer a very important question: Why didn't Dumbledore use it, as opposed to the convoluted Hail Mary that he had ended up using in canon?

For example, in a fic that I had outlined but never wrote, Hermione had gone Dark to the point of making a horcrux of her own. In doing so, she learned enough about the process to understand how to move a soul fragment between vessels, which allowed her to remove the hocrux from Harry. Why couldn't have Dumbledore done it? Because while he knows the steps of how to make a horcrux, but he has never observed one being made, so he doesn't have the knowledge needed.

** A horcrux is a vessel containing a piece of soul. Harry is the horcrux. The only way to destroy a horcrux is for it to be damaged beyond repair. Which in regards to a human is death.

*** But is it all of Harry, or just the scar part of Harry? And possibly there's a way to transfer the horcrux without destroying it, and then destroy the thing it is transferred into, instead of Harry. We see this with the diary horcrux, which is preparing to move from the diary to its own body created by the soul or life-energy of Ginny. Is it possible with other horcruxes?

These are the questions to OP is asking, which I've seen solutions to in numerous other fics. Of course we can never know if the solutions are fully canon-compliant, but we can certainly provide fics where we've seen them done.

No. The horcrux isn't the piece of soul, its the vessel.

** 1. Instruct Harry how to Create a Horcrux
2. Proceed to let him make one.
3. Kill Harry and by doing so destroy Voldemort's Horcrux.
4. Recreate Harry's body.
5. Explain Harry how morally wrong it was for him to create a Horcrux and hope that he ends up feeling regret, causing his soul pieces to unite.

** I have always ascribed to the belief that the scar is a representation of the Horcrux, but the Horcrux itself isn`t actually there.

As for ways, well, perhaps calling a curse breaker, or using magic not available in England, perhaps calling upon deities? A Temple of Osiris where he would remove it and cast it at the bad part of the Duat/

One fic had Harry accidentally go to a temple in Egypt that was designed to remove them, he almost died too.

The way JKR did was so convoluted it basically doesn`t matter, it was done for plot reasons not due to any internal logic.

*** The canon method is very simple and straightforward. The vessel has to be destroyed. For a living horcrux, that means killed.

It's the being alive afterwards that's tricky

** I'm pretty sure I've read a fic where Hermione's parents did a surgery on him and removed the skin and a bit of skull. Alternatively, rituals seem to be popular- african, indian and goblin shamans seem to be pretty good at it. If you're going for humor/ parody sex is also another way to do a ritual. Particularly group sex. I remember another one where Harry wasn't actually the horcrux, but it was a very small splinter that lodged itself in his face in the explosion so they just removed it.

** Anything that isn't just as mad, bad and dangerous as the canon solution always feels inauthentic.

I have a certain amount of affection for the idea that a Dementor could suck out a horcrux but that's merely because this would also result in Harry's soul being sucked out. But if you're willing to take that risk and then do a "Book Eight" fic (Harry Potter and the Soul Gate or something) where everyone tries to recover Harry's soul and stick it back in the bottle, as it were, I guess I'd read that and find it appropriate.

** There are actually thousands of different ways proposed of doing just that. The fact is that the whole Horcrux premise is so open ended that you could believably have it removed in any way ranging from taking off the scar, throwing a finite at it or just not removing and making the whole thing fall apart for any reason you can think to more complex ways, such as arkane rituals forgotten by humanity, new magiks made with years of study, having Harry make a Horcrux and having Voldemort's be taken away with his soul-bit, fiding a way of making Harry and the Horcrux merge or even using the link to force-feed Voldemort with enough regret to make him re-merge with all his Horcruxi including the one in Harry.

The real trick is to make it in some way as to go well in hand with the other elements of the story, such as, if it could have been done by Harry why didn't Dumbledore (who has much more knowledgeable about the matter) do it sooner? Or falling that maybe the DoM? How did Harry discover the method when he is basically a standard teenager? Would the method work on the other Horcruxi?

I've seen it done many different ways and all of them more or less make sense by what little cannon shows of magic in general and Horcruxi in particular, it's only a question of knowing how to work it inside your story.

** - linkffn(7392700) has something very very different from dying to fight Horcruxes, albeit La petite mort is involved, if you get the meaning. And yes, it is RobSt, so all warnings related to him apply.

- I have always wondered why when fighting super Dark curse, Dumbledore somehow forgot to call into action one professional cursebreaker he knows, and how is actually a member of his Order of Phoenix, Bill Weasley. Isn't it weird? So, yes, I am just writing my own story, where Bill is responsible for getting rid of the seventh horcrux.

I think it's pretty safe to assume that Dumbledore's abilities and knowledge exceed Bill's. It probably wasn't worth the risk of bringing him in on the secret. I think you have to bring in bigger guns than Bill to sell a Horcrux removal method. That's way too easy.
