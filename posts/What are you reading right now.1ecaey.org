*** Harry Potter/Dresden crossover - I am literally twitching at my desk as I try to restrain myself until he gets at least 100k words out.

**** There's a REALLY good series of Potter/Dresden crossover, although it doesn't exactly have Harry Dresden in them as a major character, called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]]. It's seriously one of my favorite fics, and even though it's more of a Super/Dark!Harry it's a fun read. Basically, Harry gets a Denarian coin at a young age, and fucks shit up. There's three 'books' in the series; I think the author is working on a 4th.

There was another good crossover series between Dresden/Potter that I had started, but I totally forgot... I wanna say it's something with 'outsider' in the title but I could be wrong.

I haven't checked out the one that was posted in that parent comment, but I'm going to now - also, were you twitching/restraining yourself because the story seems to be shit, or really good?

***** Thank you so much. Whenever I go looking for crossovers myself, I have never once found anything good. This is definitely first now on my To Read list.

****** Yeah, unfortunately most of the crossovers are just people adding random bits and pieces that they like from each 'verse and they really don't mesh all that well together. But when it's done right, maaaan, it's /good/.

Have you ever read the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, by the way? Or things of a similar nature?

******* I've skipped Stephen King as I am not all that interested in squick/horror as a focus - they are fine if background for something else. He is on my list of things I intend to read someday, but he is lost somewhere in the 400's in terms of priority. Why?

******** Ah, ok. There's this one fan fic series, called the Hero trilogy, that is mind blowing. It's epic, in the most basic sense of the word - it's /HUGE/. Three 'books' but each is 300,000+ words, compared to ~250,000 of the longest actual Harry Potter book, Order of the Phoenix. The story takes Harry out of this universe and into a multitude of different ones and is very like the Dark Tower series, but it's written so well that you don't even have to have read DT before to understand.

I always recommend this one to people who look for a more serious, adult-oriented fic. Since you said you're not that interested in this as a focus, I'm not sure if you'd like it, although there really isn't any horror as much as the constant fight against evil sort of thing. The book always gave me chills when I read it simply because of the writing style, and there's a lot of deep concepts in there and shit.

In any case, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][here's the link]] - check it out on a rainy day with nothing to do, if you'd like.

*** Ah man, Nightmares is absolutely my top fic... /well/, top three haha. One of the first (and best written) time travel ones I've read so far; pity the updates are taking so long now :( I remember reading them when he was still putting them up consistently, sigh

Am 14 chapters in and so far frustrating that Harry is extremely unrealistic as far as reactions/thought processes that a 14 year old adolescent would have in that situation. Writing is consistent and all but seems to be one of those fics where the author has no clue how men function on the inside at all and particularly at that age. Wouldn't be so frustrating if she didn't spend so much time inside his head.

*** The series is unbelievably drawn out, but amazing. Got me into fanfiction, and I hate slash.

To be fair, I was deceived. Slash wasn't present in the story until the point where most stories would have completed thrice over.
