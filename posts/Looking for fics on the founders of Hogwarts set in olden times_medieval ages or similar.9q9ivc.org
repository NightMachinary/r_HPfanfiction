** All of these involve time travel to the Founders' era, but involve extensive interactions with the founders. They also actually make an effort to include small bits in period languages/deal with the fact that modern English and Old English are very different and hence would affect the ability of time travelers to understand things (doesn't effect comprehension of story):

Linkao3(Gelosa√æ in Ecnesse)

Linkao3(Of A Linear Circle - Part I) The Of a Linear Circle series (long, and a WIP, but updates like clockwork and is fantastic. First two books are founders traveling to the present, third is someone traveling to the Founders era)

** I don't understand - canon says that the founders lived during the late tenth century, and that is the high middle ages, which more or less corresponds to the "medieval" age. Are you looking for stories where they lived in a different/later period?
