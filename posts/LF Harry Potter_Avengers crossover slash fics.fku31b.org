** Can I recommend a series of oneshots?

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1272098][Your Soul Is Bound To Mine]] by a_dale*

In total it's at 88,156 words so far. It basically goes through pairing Harry with everyone in the MCU, but they are sooo well written! I look forward to new stories. Every one so far features a different type of soul-bond, or way to tell who your soulmate is - very creatively done. Almost all of them are slash, except maybe a couple.

*** I love this series! The latest one is Captain Marvel which isn't slash but the end of it was so cute. Definitely second your recommendation.

** I highly recommend Of wizards and heroes. (The first fic) It's a Loki/Harry pairing. Very well written, great plot and great realistic relationships between the people. The other two fics I believe are Tony Stark/Harry Potter which are shorter than what you wanted but are both complete too and pretty good.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  The Magical's were separating form the Mundane world. No longer able to ensure their secrecy with the advancing technology of the Muggles, they were leaving entirely.Harry wasn't going with them. Or, the one where Harry met Tony and the events of the first Iron Man movie mostly happen anyway.

  Harry worked for W.A.N.D., the Wizarding Association of National Defence. He liked his job, and he liked being a lonely, miserable, old bugger. But when he's assigned to protect Tony Stark he's unprepared for what he'll have to face: a nosy, interfering superhero intent on getting Harry a life, or perhaps just getting himself one.

** I've read the top result (Of Wizards and Heroes) and I enjoyed it. I'm not particularly into The Avengers but it's a fantastic story.
