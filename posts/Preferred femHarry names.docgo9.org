I don't typically read female Harry because most of them are poorly written, but when I do some of the name choices kill me.

Personally, while I hate the name Harriet, I do prefer it because then Harry can continue to be called Harry and I don't get confused.

(And if any of you have any decent fem!Harry fics I'd love to give them a look)


** I like Rose since flower names seem to be family tradition. Complete changes like Victoria or Alexandra or Hazel are great too, what I really can‘t bring myself to like is when the author calls her Harriet/Harley/Harwhatever. It seems lazy and often characters shorten it back to Harry which is just sad.

No female name is worse than male Harry suddenly discovering his real name is actually Hadrian though.

*** Many names in the series tell something about the person (lupin, fenrir, Sirius, malfoy...) so holly being associated with positive things in mythology keeps in that theme as a name for Harry. The connection with his wand is also a nice bonus.

** I'd like to defend Harriet. I know everyone hates it, but the name ‘Harry' was James naming his son after his grandfather. In a very 1980s way instead of using Henry, I might add.

To me, that implies a close relationship. It's completely possible that he would try to use a female equivalent for a daughter. Harriet has always been a fairly popular British girls name, especially for posh families. In 1980 Holly is in the top 100, so I like that one too as a possibility. Harry was a ‘nasty common name' so the name James and Lily use would probably need to be common. James was probably rebelling against Fleamont and Euphemia.

Harry wasn't really a “nasty, common name” in the sense Petunia means by “common”: the reader is supposed to understand that Petunia is not only a snob, but (in the tradition of mocking snobbish upper-working-class/lower-middle-class mostly women) unaware of how off her class-perceptions are.

** Personally I can't stand Harriet or Harri or similar names that are too close to Harry. They make me thing of Lily and James picking names, coming up with Harry then not knowing what to do if they have a girl.

"I've got the perfect name: Harry!"

"Great, I love it! What if we have girl, though?"

"...Har...Harri...Harriet! Yeah, Harriet."

Shrugs "Works for me!"

Flower names work if they aren't too out there, like Iris, or Rose or something.

British royalty names can work well.

Names that were common in the 80s work.

​

Mostly because I like gender bender stories, but I find the tendency to use "I have a girls body I need a girl name" as waaaay overdone. I prefer it when it is "I'm still who I was yesterday, I don't care if the name makes you uncomfortable"

But of course, you mean Born A Girl Harry. Eh, it doesn't matter too much. Although it is neat when an author uses a name that shortens to Harry then has her go by that for everyone but the professors.

•Morrigan (originally Violet, but she got re-named by a couple of coven witches who raised her (hasn't been updated in over a year🙅‍♀️))

•Violet, or Vi (disappeared just before she turned eleven, spent most of her teen years in the streets of Middlesbrough before the magic world found her again at age 18. She smokes cigs and weed, drinks, likes to sleep around, is tattooed and pierced and doesn't care for magic. But the magic world has to protect her because the war is going on. She's nice and sweet and just wants to live her life in peace with the friends she's made. I love writing her.)

•Lillian (my first fem!Harry and a terrible person. So edgy, so evil. From one of the first fics I've ever written and it does kind of show, with some tropes in the beginning and lazy editing)

•Rose (gender-bent Harry sent back in time by Death, who, as the new reality's Harry's twin, has to guide said Harry to fulfil his destiny while coming to terms with his own new identity and sex)

If there's interest I'll happily share links, though, if there's time at some point, I'll have to do a massive rewrite with the first one.

I just don't prescribe to the idea that gender or sexuality are things that would completely change someone's personality, rather than maybe change a few aspects due to differences in circumstances.

I hugely dislike when fem!Harry gets a random flower name like Rose or Iris or Jasmine, partially because I just don't like most flower names (Holly is the exception), and partly because there's no evidence as far as I am aware of any Evans naming tradition. The only named Evanses are Lily and Petunia.

If it's a genderbender story where male!Harry gets a magical sex change, and she embraces it, I'm alright with her taking her mother's name voluntarily, but I'm not cool with Lily naming her daughter after herself. Double points if it's the former and it's femslash, because lily-lesbian symbolism.
