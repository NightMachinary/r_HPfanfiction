  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

*** I've seen this recommended a lot lately, so I read a bit of it yesterday, but man I can't get through it. So many of the shitty wbwl tropes are in this story.

**** I think you're too sensitive to the cliches. They wind down as the story progresses. They really aren't that bad and actually are quite believable. I suppose you didn't go much deeper than 2 or 3 chapters. I like this story for it's charm and for keeping the children and teenagers as they are, not as miniature adults. They behave quite normally and even Lily and James are mostly believable adults. It's not uncommon for parents to direct all their attention to a single child. It's very in-line with the fic. Lily and James truly love their children but they are their own people, not perfect parents.

EDIT: The only trope I can think of that validates your comment is the behaviour of Tom Potter. He's a bit of a dick, but then that's common in younger brothers and he's the one with all the attention. Even then, it's been handled very responsibly, he just tattletales to his parents and doesn't REALLY go against his brother, just tells on him.

*** Just read it, and it's terribly amusing Harry's younger brother, Tom, the wbwl, is very well characterized as a classic bratty younger brother-constantly whinging and ratting him out and trying to spin things to get him in trouble with their parents.
