** This is for platonic Snape/Harry stories. It has lots of good fics.

** Not that much and the gravitational pull of the large sites (FFN and AO3) tends to suck whatever good stories are found on other sites there as well.

- I like stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter) which are on [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]]

- there are some specialist sites (usually order of magnitude smaller than FFN or AO3). So, for example, if you are a fan of Hinny, there is [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/]] which is not much active now, but have some older stories, and the leading Hinny site (still active) is [[https://www.siye.co.uk/]], however plenty of stories from there find their way to FFN and AO3 as well.

- and then there is [[https://wattpad.com]], which is absolutely gigantic site for everything (not only fanfiction stories, but original ones as well), with the fame of most of the stories of very low quality (by teenagers for teenagers). I know about two or three stories from there which are at least readable, but trying to find something there yourself is mostly exercise in futility. Wait here if somebody suggests anything.

** Are you looking for other archives to browse, or specific stories? Somebody has already recced the potionsandsnitches archive, but there is also [[https://www.faenfiction.com/fanfics/harry_potter/harry/anyone][faenfiction.net]], which is devoted to finished fics. I do not know if they have permission to repost these; some of them are marked as deleted from their original sites. It's also white lettering on a black background, which can be hard to read.

As for other archives, they keep disappearing. The most recent (I think) casualty being Skyehawke, which was known for high-quality works. Some of those stories/authors crossposted to ffn and/or ao3, but not all, which means a new batch of stories lost to time.

Others require a login, and requests may or may not be addressed at this time. This includes [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], [[http://www.turn-of-the-page.com][a turn of the page]], and [[http://sycophanthex.com/][sycophanthex]]. (Note that some of the hosted stories ARE on ffn/ao3, but not all.)

Then there are the websites dedicated to specific authors, usually the site owner and his/her friends. This includes individual accounts on LJ, IJ, and/or Dreamwidth, as well as hosted sites. You'll need to provide specifics to get recs there, or if you're looking for story recs that are on lesser-traveled sites.

*** fanficauthors only required a login to read mature stories, but that's changed. I'm not certain how recently it happened. If a story has a mature rating, you are now asked to verify that you want to see it.

**** Well that's helpful. I know some people won't read on a site that requires a login.

**** FFA has gone read-only as far as I understand. No more comments, no more logins. (It's mentioned in the out-of-nowhere new Jeconais fic. So, February?)

*** I second the recommendation for fanficauthors.net, although it is pretty much dormant now, there's lots of good stuff there.

** /Some/ Wattpad stories are really good (I recommend anything by kmbell92 and To Protect by JanieKayne). And Wattpad comments are funny sometimes BUT they sexualize everything, and with popular fics rereaders always spoil everything + make really obvious "hints" so watch out for that if you decide to check it out

** Wattpad is the only one that comes to mind, and no offense, but I think there's a reason people don't use it.
