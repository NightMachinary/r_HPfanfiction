So... I have an idea of a story I want to write and it's been in my head for months, here's a brief part of the story that's been in my mind.

So, the part is about a broken soul-bond between Harry and Ginny, like Harry's still alive, but Ginny's dead, and because Ginny's dead, Harry's going evil because the soul-bond split their soul between the two of them, and when Ginny died Harry only had half a soul in him, which means he can't feel emotions like love, and happiness anymore. Harry ends up somewhere were the spirt or ghost of Ginny can talk to him. And by the end of the story Harry ends up managing to get Ginny back alive.

I know this isn't the best, but would you still read it? And I'll planning on having the story set up in a book, then marking this the plot for the sequel book.


** If Harry cannot feel emotions like love and happyness, why would he feel anger, and hate? I think Harry being apathetic would make more sense.

*** That could work, but when I wrote this I was think that because he only has half a soul and not a full one, he should be able to feel some emotions, but not all, and with the Ginny part I wrote there, it'll be like two puzzle ðŸ§© coming together, so for that I'll still need Harry to feel some emotions

** Is Ginny also only feeling some emotions? The opposite ones to Harry, I suppose?

*** ..? I don't understand, I thought I made it clear that she's dead, but will come back to life at the end of the story, or until near the end of the story.

**** But her ghost is talking to Harry. Ghosts in the HP world have emotions. If their souls merged and Harry now only had half, she must only have half too. So it's she only feeling some few emotions?

** I remember reading a fanfiction where that's exactly what happened to Tom Riddle and his soulmate (she was killed because of Dumbledore) and the result of the broken bond turned Voldemort mad. This fic is a Harry/Ginny soulbond (where their bond is also threatened by Dumbledore) but I don't remember what the name is, unfortunately.

*** I think you're talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12274913/1/Harry-Potter-Binding-Fury][Harry Potter, Binding Fury]] and if it's not that one I have another one that kind of fits, but in my opinion this one fits more

**** Oh yeah, possibly. I remember that fic, I even told myself I would re-read it soon but I didn't remember that Voldemort had been soulbonded in that one, not before your comment.

Yes, I was talking about that one.

** The error in your logic is that the two started with one soul each. How did they end up with only one soul between them? If the souls merged, then he has half a soul that is equal in size to his former single soul.

If each soul is a gallon jug, combining them gives you two gallons, where each still has a gallon, only now each is mixed with the other. If one dies, the other still has a full gallon.

Now, if you want to say that having his soul be half-and-half is driving him insane, that works. The mixture is unstable because htere's no Ginny to handle the half that needs Ginny.
