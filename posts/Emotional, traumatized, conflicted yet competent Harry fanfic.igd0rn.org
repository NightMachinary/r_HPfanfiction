(So this is just an example of plot, doesn't have to be the exact same details and such, just the general themes of a realistic Harry).

A realistic Harry. The Dursley's abuse leaves infinitely greater impact on Harry, Harry needs them to pay, he MAKES them pay one way or the other. The traumatizing events he experienced leave far greater mental scars. Snape's abuse and Dumbledore's lies tear him down further. Harry is depressed with trust issues and frustration and self hate but is grounded by his loved ones.

He has breakdowns, is sick and tired of everything, at one point he leaves Hogwarts. But he is willful, he needs control of his life. He refuses to stay at the Dursley's, he gets trained to fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, he's more competent. But at the end of the day he doesn't fight to save the world, he doesn't owe the world anything, the world only tore him down, he only fights for his loved ones, he kills. Harry/Hermione pairing.

TO BE CLEAR: This is neither a God Harry or a bashing type fic. Dumbledore is a good person but Harry would have a broken relationship with him, Snape is the complex anti hero he is but doesn't get a pass, Voldemort would destroy Harry in a fight regardless of training but Harry is more of a fighter against Death Eaters for example. Etc. I don't enjoy the wishy washy pure hearted all good Harry, I want a certain edge to him. Rowling's Harry is simply completely unrealistic to me. Too hopeful, too good...I don't want fucking Superman.


** Not exactly what you're describing, but I predict this may be your cup of tea. An Abused!Harry/childfic oneshot. Tragic, well-written, haunting. linkffn(13657777)

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** The longfic I'm currently co-writing sees Harry very much from the perspective you are describing, and progresses along those lines. In our story, Harry is gravely impacted by the abuses and horrors in his past, and is driven to become someone competent, even if he doesn't always know the best way to get there. He suffers breakdowns & depression (though he doesn't know yet what to call it). He needs people. He chafes under Dumbledore's rules & longs to live by his own principles. Snape does not get a pass for his asshole behavior, but neither are we bashing anyone in the fic.

Possible detractors depending on your preferences: not Harry/Hermione, Harry is still somewhat "pure hearted" (though part of the point of the story is to teach him to see more than one side of these issues), Dursleys probably won't heavily feature (they'll be talked about though), it's eventual Mentor Snape, Harry still fights for the world, and our story is roughly a 50/50 blend of canon & OC characters

If you're interested, it can be found on both FFN & ao3: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
