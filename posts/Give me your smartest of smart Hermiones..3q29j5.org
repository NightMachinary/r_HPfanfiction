I want something along the lines of The Arithmancer, or Applied Cultural Anthropology. A story that's written by an author who treats intelligence and knowledge as more than just numbers on the stat sheet. Thank you!


** In Potterverse, a character's intelligence can affect the story in two ways:

1. Character's capacity for and rate of learning, developing, and performing complex magic, including learning magic from books.
2. Character's general decision making, ability to plan, anticipate other people's behavior, find solutions to problems, etc..

Item 2 doesn't mean that an intelligent character has to be always right, but even the /mistakes/ that character makes must be the sort of mistakes an intelligent person would make, which are often the sort that someone less so wouldn't. A good canon example of that is SPEW: Hermione's intelligence was one of the necessary conditions for being informed about Muggle history of slavery and making the connection between that and the House-Elves, as well as researching Wizards' writings on the subject and critically analyzing them; but she lacked the necessary experience (and emotional intelligence?) to figure out what to do about the situation, so she fumbled it. But, other characters never even had the /opportunity/ to fumble it in the first place, because they weren't even thinking about the big picture with respect to the House-Elves.

So, canon gives us quite a lot of both items. Brilliant!Hermione fics that try to get at (2) are much harder to write than those that stop at (1), because it's easy to write "/X/ cast spell /Y/ and /Z/ happened", but it's much harder to actually consider how a highly intelligent character (often more so than the author --- with no offense intended to the hypothetical author) would think and act, and what mistakes they would make. It's telling that, IMO, LessWrong's narrative in HPMOR did both (1) and (2) for Harry but only (1) for Hermione.

With that rant out of the way, here are fics that I think pull off both (1) and (2) well:

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew)

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)

- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss)

- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge)

- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin)

- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa)

- Off-FF.net: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]]: In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

These pull off (1) well and (2) somewhat well (or at least don't emphasize it as much):

- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

- linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser)

- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen)

- linkffn(Compund Interest by Cillit Bang Bang)

- Off-FF.net: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Couldson Eagle]]: What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

I'll add more as I remember them.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically.

#+end_quote

It's not that she's not the main character. To expand on what I'd posted earlier, she gets an upgrade to her ability to learn and use magic and to get better grades, but it doesn't seem to ever translate into actual consequential impressive feats and victories through smarts. Does it matter how how smart she is if she her smarts have no effect whatsoever on anything of importance in the story?

So, HPMOR's smart Hermione is, in fact, "numbers on the stat sheet", to use OP's phrasing.

#+end_quote

I think that Hermione in general was mishandled by HPMOR. I get that she was meant to be a foil for Harry --- intelligence without rationality --- and with Dumbledore, Quirrel, and Harry and his Dark Side around, there is only so much agency that a character without their advantages of experience and other factors can have. But, it would have been nice to show her actually learning some of what Quirrel and Harry had to teach --- maybe actually surprising one of the Big Three once in a while with something other than her Moral Fortitude.

Speaking of her Moral Fortitude, while all characters got tweaked relative to canon --- some more so than others --- one of the tweaks for Hermione was to erase /her/ dark and ruthless side (which I happen to have outlined in response to another post on this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3q29j5/give_me_your_smartest_of_smart_hermiones/]]).

The only arc where she had any initiative is the inane Self-Actualization arc, and even that turned out to be the Big Three being playful.

At the end, when all is said and done, when two of the Big Three are gone, and Hermione gets an unearned powerup that gives her a lot of freedom of action, what's the first thing she does? Why, she [[/spoiler][effectively pledges herself into the service of the third one]], before she even knows the whole story of what happened.

  if there were ever a sequel i bet that failing would be rectified.
#+end_quote

Did LessWrong ever so much as hint at a sequel? My sense is that the story has been very much wrapped up.

This is especially in light of the reveals at the end that [[/spoiler][Dumbledore brought about the whole thing by blindly following prophecies --- and there aren't any more left]].

And, even if such a sequel were written, I doubt that it would be rectified; consider that [[/spoiler][she's pledged to basically be Harry's minion, standing by him and all, and do note that Harry's Unbreakable Vow does not balance that, since it only gives her veto power over potentially world-destroying things Harry might try]].

****** agree on all counts

no sequel, a small epilogue forthcoming. what i meant was that hermione is pretty clearly set up to wield power in the unexplored future magical britain of hpmor.

i was disappointed by plot points in the final chapter, although it was well written and interesting as usual. it did short shrift to hermione.

further, it's hard to explain exactly why. and given 650000 words, yudkowsky should have been able to fit in more of her growth and agency. one possible excuse: it was his first ever effort writing fiction of appreciable length. not to mention how difficult i personally find it to write female characters; i can't very well blame him.

That's the trouble, though; she is set up to wield it as a delegate, not as a principal. [[/spoiler][She surrenders that power to Harry, by swearing to trust in him and stand by him, so really, it's Harry wielding twice the power. If, hypothetically, they ever have a serious disagreement over something that isn't potentially world-destroying and fail to reconcile, her oath, if binding, binds her to yield. I guess that if the next thing out of Harry's mouth were something like "I do not accept your oath," both the characters and the scene could be redeemed --- Hermione almost made a dumb if understandable mistake, and friends don't let friends do that]].

As it is, she implicitly acknowledges that her judgment will never be as good as Harry's, no matter what. Now, remember their first meeting, when she challenged Harry over who should lead the project to scientifically understand magic? Funny how she evolved from that...

Anyway, I am sorry, this is getting OT, and it's mostly my fault.

A psychopath? She's trying very hard not to become a Dark Lady! It's her greatest fear, as confirmed by a boggart! It's not her fault that she has to terrify Draco into becoming her minion in order to keep his father at bay --- she even helps him get one over Harry Potter, and if she doesn't teach her fellow Muggleborns that fear is more reliable than love and encourage them to learn how to inspire fear in their enemies, who will?

***** Everything in that post is literally true, even if I was rather whimsical in phrasing it. Yes, Hermione is descending into darkness, but she is not a psychopath. Rather, her Sorting creates problems for her whose solutions require greater and greater moral compromises, and those solutions beget more problems yet, which beget more compromises. I've seen the author compare his approach to this fic to /Breaking Bad/, the TV series.

******* Just off the top of my head, canon Hermione casually lied to McGonagall after the Troll Incident; set Snape on fire a few weeks later; proposed to and executed a plan to brew a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients (that she stole herself, IIRC), in a plan to kidnap and impersonate three of her classmates; kindapped and blackmailed a reporter; started a paramilitary organization in a school, disfiguring (possibly irreversibly) a fellow student for betraying it; manipulated a female teacher into being abducted by centaurs --- while likely being familiar with the Greek mythology about just what centaurs do to female captives; assaulted Ron for dating another girl, and then hexed a student to help Ron get on the Quiddich team; rewrote her parents' lives to send them to Australia; and didn't disapprove of Harry's use of the Unforgivables. A good argument could also be made that she tried to trick House-Elves into freeing themselves, though we only have Harry's interpretation of events on that.

Don't let fanon mislead you. When Hermione feels justified, she is more ruthless than Harry, Ron, and Draco combined --- and unlike Draco, she isn't half-hearted about it, and does it of her own initiative, rather than being threatened into doing it. And, the only time that she actually showed any remorse about what she'd done was with her parents.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
