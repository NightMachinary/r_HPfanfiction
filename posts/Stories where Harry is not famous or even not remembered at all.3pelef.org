I'm not talking about those weird 'Harry Potter has a brother, and everyone assumes he is the boy-who-lived' for some stupid reason, and for an even more idiotic reason his family now no longer acknowledges his existence'-stories.

No, I'm thinking more along the lines of 'Harry Potter wakes up during his xth year at Hogwarts, and suddenly noone remembers ever having seen him before', or 'Harry tries to use the Fidelius-charm, but because he is just a stupid teenager he accidentally declares himself the secret', or 'Harry physically travels back in time and needs a new identity, and because he's not the best when it comes to acting normal in social situations, he fails to rebuild his old friendships', etc.

You know, stories where the loss of identity actually has an impact on the story and character-development, and isn't only included to have a reason to bash other characters once his identity is revealed.

Any suggestions?

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** It isn't necessarily what you're asking for, but I think you might like it.

linkffn(Just Another Orphan)

There are a few other stories where Harry is just a kid, not the BWL if you're interested in that.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

***** Is the Hadrian fic any good? I tend to avoid them like the plague as they tend to go from Harry Potter to Hadrian Potter-Black-Perevell-<rest of pureblood Britain> and finnishing up with The Heretic God Emperor Hadrian.

****** It's actually surprisingly well written, seeing as Hadrian is the least bad of all the cliches present therein. I definitely recommend the series.

  Dark times lie ahead for the Wizarding world. Blood will be shed as Harry Potter sets sail in his perilous quest for revenge - by any means necessary. Non-BWL, no canon rehash, dark undertones.
