I was reading a recent thread on what's wrong with quite a few Hermione-centric fics. One comment: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d1vukq/my_issues_hermione_shipping_in_fanfiction/ezrowux]]

Stuck with me. So, I'm asking for fics where Hermione's self-esteem isn't deluded. Where she's about as good as she is in canon.

**** If book 6 were a fanfic I would anti-recommend it because of all the character bashing, particularly Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore

***** What exactly does Ron do in the book?

How exactly is Hermione bashed?

Dumbledore?

****** Ron's response to finding out Hermione kissed Krum was over the top jealous git. He's more sympathetic in most fics where he's not intentionally being bashed. I can imagine reviewing it in a fic with "OK I GET IT YOU'RE MAD ABOUT TRIWIZARD BUT HE APOLOGIZED HE CAN DO THINGS BESIDES JEALOUSY"

His failure to break up with Lavender properly was extremely douchey in a way worse than anything he did in the previous five books. He didn't even apologize and it's basically treated as a big joke.

Hermione's response to Draco and the HBP book are both OOC stupid in a way unlikely to be seen in fic. Cheating the quidditch tryouts and savaging Ron with birds are both OOC evil in way unlikely to be seen in fic. OOC based off of the previous five books, I guess technically it can't be OOC if JKR wrote it. But even now, anything on that level for evil or stupid I would close the fic for bashing Hermione unless the fic had a LOT more going for it.

Dumbledore set aside time to hang out with Harry all year and gave him very little information/very unimportant information. He gave him no help with defensive magic or anything to help him keep himself or his friends alive in the battles to come knowing full well what was happening. He says he knew what Draco was doing all year when Katie Bell and Ron would definitely have died without a lot of luck, which is brutally callous.

** This fits canon well, I'd like some of those stories, too (so I second your request!)

Sadly I don't have any of these, because frankly fanfiction-Hermione mostly is either the walking library-sidekick, kind of the MC (Harry and Ron do what she says when she says it) or she is bashed for being a stickler for the rules and authority etc...

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
