***** Pass, i personally feel that anything relating to the champions is a no go for the above reason. Maybe this is coming from the perspective of a girl who read the HP series without any previous exposure, but i feel some of these names can genuinely spoil some of the shock value about the plot set up.

**** I mean is it really? Without HBP Harry wouldn't get the Felix Felicis(no guarantee that Hermione would get it), without the liquid luck the number of Horcruxes would be delayed information, possibly even after Dumbledore's death. Also who killed our dearest Headmaster? The Half-Blood Prince.

***** I agree. I think a lot of what happens is due to the HBP. Expanding on your list, Harry couldn't have tricked Ron before the quidditch match, Lavender and Ron may have never gotten together, Harry wouldn't have known about & then used sectumsempra meaning that him and Ginny may have gotten together in a different way, etc. The plot point seems small but HBP comes up, in one way or another, continuously.

***** I guess with the afterknowledge it just seems less important; Harry never develops any potions skill to be used in DH, Snape's most significant action all book was actually just fulfilling Dumbledore's orders, Draco's completely fine after the Sectumsempra incident, and doesn't appear to have changed for the better in DH in any way....

I'm really unsure why it isn't widely recognized as the worst book of the series

******* In surveys it's pretty evenly split. On the main HP subreddit it seems to be CoS but they think Draco had a redemption arc and Dumbledore did nothing wrong so I have very little respect for their opinions.

I'd basically rank them in descending order, JKR is an excellent children's book writer but the more adult it gets the more it invites critical thinking and the weaker they get. I'd rank HBP far far below DH, the second worst, though.

**** This was always my complaint about the Goblet of Fire. Every other title has a presence throughout the book and something to do with the climax. The Goblet is kind of just there for a few chapters, does it's thing and never comes up again. I think they should have either made the goblet the trophy or at least just the goal you have to touch to win (And thus the portkey which is there for the climax) or named the book "The Triwizard Cup"

** A few parallels to The Shining for those who care:

A group of three people travel from far away to arrive at an old but grand structure with ghosts inhabiting it. Located, of course, in seclusion within the mountains. They are forced to spend a long period of time here regardless of the mounting dangers.

The main characters have a deep connection to their respective enemies, which goes so far that the lines between the two blur.

Supporting characters, such as Hermione and the redrum kid, have knowledge which ostracized them from their peers.

Other supporting characters, such as Ron and the wife end up having a falling out with the main characters.

Old guy who has previous experience and knowledge with the evil bad guys, dies in the end trying to rescue good guys. Like Snape and that guy who had the shining ability but got axed immediately.

Castle and hotel change appearance constantly due to supernatural forces. Such as the Room of Requirement being powered by, and the ballroom in The Shining powered by... Well, dead guys.
