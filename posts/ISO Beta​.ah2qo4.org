Sorry if this isn't the correct place to post, but I am looking to have my own work betaed and beta other's fics. I'm on AO3 and looking for someone who has experience with writing/betaing fic. I would love to have some critique/inspo on a work I'm currently in the middle of. Anyone interested?

*** Sure thing! So I write Drarry, medium plot, and usually rated explicit. The one I'm working on currently has about 10k words and the first half is posted. It's an EWE with unusual careers. Draco is a writer who's left the Wizarding world and Harry a postman. It's a getting together fic.

Needing someone to help with any inconsistencies or make suggestions along with standard grammar and spelling. Does this help?

**** Drarry is generally not well received around here because it requires too much AU/OOCness to work believably and still feel like Rowling's universe. You might have more luck over at [[/r/HPSlashFic]]

That being said, perhaps you will find someone in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/authorbeta][beta section of this sub's wiki]] (you have to scroll down a bit)
