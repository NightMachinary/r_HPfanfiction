**** Ah, okay. Have you read the Firebird Trilogy? I don't really have any others besides that, as I'm pretty picky when it comes to reading stories in general, much less harem ones.

***** Alright, thanks for the recommendation. I'm reading Simurghs Son right now so this should be fun. Sorry for being vague, but I was trying to be as broad as possible as I've never really read something like this before. Harem relationships never end poorly in fan fiction, so I wanted to see just one where things crash and burn.

****** Firebird sucks, not because its not well written - it is really well written. Not because the story is not thought through, it is decent. No it sucks because it goes against anything a free and selfrespecting person would stand for.

I remember closing the tab after half the first book because I just could not take the idiocrasy of the people in that story anymore.

So, be warned. Prepare yourself for some disturbing concepts and psychologically damaged people.

That's sort of the point though? The books are a breakdown of what that type of society would actually look like and (spoilers I guess?) how it ends up breaking down.

The ending is very much NOT pro-harem at all!!

******** The problem is that if a group is fighting against an inhumane system, then they shouldn't punish their own people for violating the very rules and customs of said system. At the very least, someone among them should go "WTF? Are you crazy?", instead of going along with it. Sure, it is brought back up at the end, but in a rather tacked-on manner. "Remember that time you punished me? I can't forgive that, bye!" feels a little too little too late.

******** Don't be so quick. It is very much an interesting read that takes a cliche fanfic-premise (harems) and runs with it for real.

Yes, it starts weird by creating and showing us the type of fucked-up world where harems are a thing (the excuse is that magic creates 4 times as much witches as it does wizards), but if you go further in than only half the first book you will realise the author is merely setting the stage for the eventual structural breakdown of that type of relationship.

It's very much worth a full read.

****** Does the Simurgh's Son actually progress into a harem? Where I left off it seemed like all the girls were barely tolerating his flirtatiousness.

******* Shit, sorry. Forgot to reply. I'm not entirely through the story, but it it looks like the flirting is all for show. He's never really serious about it, and is aiming towards a monogamous relationship with someone(I hope). I don't want to spoil any more in case you want to go back. Again, sorry for the delay.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.
