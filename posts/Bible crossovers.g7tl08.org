Considering how Jesus was often depicted performing his miracles with [[http://www.rome101.com/Christian/Magician/][a magic wand]] in early Christian art, has anyone written any Bible crossovers?

This post can be considered a request, prompt, or discussion.


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

This one is a Bible/Occult crossover. Hermione accidentally manages to invite a demon for tea and they do their best to teach her everything a dark witch needs to know.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** I've read one where Harry received a lot of "social distance" during OotP, I think, because he accidentally invoked The Guy In The Sky. (OMG; God,damnit!; or something similar) Nothing happened, really, but suddenly he was all alone.

Why? Because deities are real, powerful and unpredictable, and wizards do not want anything to do with that mess. So, they all try to stay out of blast radius. The fic later dissolved, for the lack of better word, but the beginning was alright, and quite a novel idea too.

** The closest to a crossover I can think of is Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles]])

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

** A Hogwarts student could perform all but two of Jesus's miracles by the time he graduated. Voldemort could do all of them (inferni for Lazarus and Horcruxes for returning from the dead). Jesus would probably not even be a footnote in history if he was a regular wizard.

I feel like the ancient religions have more crossover potential (think Percy Jackson) since there are more fantastic creatures involved there, and you have all kinds of demi gods.

*** I mean, I feel like you're missing the fairly obvious here: Jesus as a Lockhart-esque wizard whose use of magic to grow his fanbase ended in wizards collaborating with muggles to take him down, inadvertently making him a martyr and spawning a cult that lasted thousands of years.

And that's beside that very pertinent fact: he's said to have lived /two thousand years ago/. He'd /predate/ Hogwarts by /centuries/. Judging his abilities by the abilities of modern day wizards is rather like saying "Newton could do calculus? Pffft, I learnt that in secondary school."

**** There is no indication that any of those spells is a modern invention. And calculus was known to the Greeks.
