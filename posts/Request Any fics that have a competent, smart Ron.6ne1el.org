I rarely find fics that feature a relatively intelligent Ron - most have him as an ignorant, sometimes idiotic character without any emotional intelligence whatsoever. He doesn't have to be powerful or Gryffindor's descendant or anything like that (although if you have one of those, please link it), and he doesn't have to take precedence over Harry as the main character; I just want to read a fic that has him as competent enough to not rely on Harry/Hermione all the time, and perhaps come up with ideas/take down enemies on his own. Or, like I said, he could be completely different and be this powerful, cunning Slytherin, or whatever, as long as he's not some bumbling idiot that can't win a duel to save his life. I've already read The Red Knight (which I have conflicting emotions on, but that's a story for another time), so please don't suggest that.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** Near the end of the Harry Potter series, Ron grows more loyal, understanding, and competent. He's supposed to be very good at chess, which, people say, requires a sharp mind. I think that the Dangerverse has a relatively canon Ron, but that, in the Dangerverse, Ron develops these good traits much sooner due to some dubious personal revelations and careful coaching from other characters. It's not the most natural portrayal of him, but if you're looking for a good!Ron, then I believe the Dangerverse series is worth a read.

The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

Or who flung birds at Ron just for dating another girl? (And the triwizard thing could have been dealt with much sooner if Harry didn't insist on not speaking to Ron too.)

Oh yeah, and Harry was jealous for most of year six, too... (although people like you claim love potion at that though...)

He wasn't smart as very few time he came up with a sensible idea his friends gave him the 'did he finally make sense' face at him.

He wasn't hard working as he often left his school work alone. He didn't even trial for his fav sports until his friends became key to choosing new team.

He was bigoted (his whole family was, as he learned those things from family) when he colored Harry's opinion in train. Read book 1. His bigotry didn't get better.

Slytherin? What did they do? Nobody except Malfiy did anything and that was a school yard rivalry between two kids. Kind of like how 4 Gryffs ganged up on 1 slytherin.

That... isn't true. I'd like to see quotes, word-for-word from the actual books, that show this happening. I'm gonna go on a limb and say there are very few. As early as the first book he made himself very useful (see the whole trapdoor ordeal in which he was indispensable in the Devil's Snare /and/ chess obstacles)

#+begin_quote
  He wasn't hard working as he often left his school work alone. He didn't even trial for his fav sports until his friends became key to choosing new team.
#+end_quote

That isn't false, but he still consistently worked hard enough to earn himself passing grades. He was about as hard working as Harry. As for Quidditch, I thought it was made pretty clear that he lacked confidence in himself (see how nervous he was in Order of the Phoenix during his matches).

#+begin_quote
  He was bigoted (his whole family was, as he learned those things from family) when he colored Harry's opinion in train. Read book 1. His bigotry didn't get better.
#+end_quote

Coloured his opinion? Ron mentions Slytherin once on the train, in the following line:

#+begin_quote
  "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."
#+end_quote

He makes no other mention of something that could be seen as colouring Harry's opinion, other than an aside where he says that his father doesn't get on with Draco's dad.

Hagrid and Draco did lots more to colour Harry's opinion of Slytherin before the sorting.

Ron isn't perfect, but he certainly wasn't a bad person. There aren't many signs of him being bigoted, unless you consider disliking a group of people that have always been pricks to him and his friends bigotry.

I have yet to say he is a bad person. He isn't smart, clever, open minded in canon. That's how JK Rowling made him.

I just questioned why would he want to read about Ron that's not exactly Ron? You wnat an OC or OOC with Ron's skin and ginger hair because you don't like how he was in canon? Is it because you have ginger fetish?

And all the Ron's fans got triggered. Seriously! They are more immature and close minded than Ron was in canon. Canon Ron being an immature, dumb(er) and not-very-competent is not necessarily a bad thing. But getting defensive when someone points it out does make his fans come off as freaks with issues. Get your inferiority complex somewhere else people.

********* Making Ron smarter and more competent than he was in canon is not such a big change that you would lose the essence of the character. The fact that you've repeatedly suggested that doing so would make him equivalent to an OC is what made me assume that you considered him a bad person.

He was in fact reasonably competent and smart in canon, about on the level that you would expect from the average person.

I'll ask this instead: why would you want to read a fanfiction if there were no changes from canon?

********** I will read fanficiton that has some divergence point. Why is a character different from his canon counterpart? If there is no reason for change in character development and still he ends up more "competent" (as the Ron fans with inferiority complex like to call it) than canon then I don't want to read it.

Ron had a normal loving family with slight money issues. He grew up with inferiority complex in a house full of over achieving brothers. If his household life is same and yet he is different than canon than I'm not interested in that fic. May be some accident happened and it changed dynamics of their home? Peter affected him somehow? Now that's a valid reason.

I am not a writer but fantasy novels with trio champions formulae often have a dumb(er), underachiever, and slacker in their group to act as a measuring stick for Hero. Sidekicks in such formulae are supposed to be inferior (and mildly opposite) to Hero. Hero is Orhpan? Side kick has family. Hero has money? Sidekick is poor. Hero wants good friends? Sidekick wants glory.

Remember that mirror thing where Harry sees his family? Ron saw glory, a competent, successful Ron with lots and lots of fame, money and glory.

That's how writers do it. That's how Ron was written. That's how is is supposed to be.

You might change him, but at least give a reason. Make it seem real. A smart, competent sidekick doesn't gel with a Hero. It has never worked.

To all the Ron fans: Seems like they like him out of pity. They see a poor underachiever and they jump to protect his dignity. Calm down all of you. It's not end of the world if he is canon like. It's people like you who think that it's bad if he is like canon.

*********** I don't really disagree with any of this. You make a very valid point about the character development needing to be motivated by something. Did you make your original comment assuming that OP wanted to read a fic where Ron was a more competent and smart person without any reason for it?

Slight clarification with regards to the mirror: Ron saw himself that way because he felt pressured to do well at Hogwarts given the precedent of his brothers, and dreamed that he could distinguish himself as a successful individual.

Everything else is pretty agreeable. Certainly, Ron wasn't /as/ capable as Harry, although he was more charismatic. I was just trying to come to the defense of his canon portrayal somewhat because of how often he is hated on for false reasons which are then passed off as canon (like him being super bigoted, but let's not get into that again).

Yes. His requirements were pretty strong.

#+begin_quote
  most have him as an ignorant, sometimes idiotic character without any emotional intelligence whatsoever.
#+end_quote

Most fics do him this way because that's how canon was. Ron was ignorant of culture, manners(?) and pretty much everything despite growing up in magical family.

Idiotic? He comes off as that in canon. Hitting himself with slug spells? Doing stupid stuff? Some call it funny and others call it idiotic. Writers call it comedic relief. Most sidekicks are used for that.

Emotional intelligence (from canon):

#+begin_quote
  Ron said, "One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode." "Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have," said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.
#+end_quote

While I know it's a friendly banter but Ron had pretty low EQ.

Then OP goes on and says:

#+begin_quote
  I just want to read a fic that has him as competent enough to not rely on Harry/Hermione all the time
#+end_quote

This doesn't fit in trio. Ron fixed with Harry because Harry wasn't looking for an overachiever. He would have gone with Draco if he wanted a successful companion. Ron was harmless and easy going. That's why Harry settled with him. That's why Harry cared enough to mutter "not slytherin.... not slytherin.." when sort hat was making decision.

#+begin_quote
  he could be completely different and be this powerful, cunning Slytherin, or whatever, as long as he's not some bumbling idiot that can't win a duel to save his life

And for the exact same reason everyone likes to read Fanfiction. Very few fics have canon Harrys and Hermiones and Ginnys and Dumbledores. Different takes on the same character are interesting, for some reason.

2. He /and/ Harry left their work late, and whenever their marks were mentioned, they did about equally well, except in Defence.

3. What I mean is that his attitude against Slytherin was normal for a magical, and it wasn't 'vitriol' or 'bigotry', more like healthy rivalry. If Ron's attitude was particularly bigotted, you'd at least see a few Slytherins in the DA during year 7, when Ron was away from Hogwarts.

Malfoy was a bully (see Neville) and a sadist (his smug attitude about the Buckbeak case), and his bookends backed him up at every moment. That he was 'prefect material' tells a lot about the other Slytherins in his year.
