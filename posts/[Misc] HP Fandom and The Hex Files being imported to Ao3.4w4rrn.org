** So once they're done, there will be fewer places to search, and stories from those archives will be easily downloaded as ebooks.

** That's neat. From the description they're mostly slash stories, which isn't my taste, but I like AO3's interface and it's nice to have stories searchable in one spot.

*** I think it would be great if a lot of the smaller archives got imported - as you said, fewer places to search, and Ao3 isn't going to go dark from lack of funds any time soon. I hate it when stories are lost because archives die.

Admins of smaller archives should consider it.
