I am apparently following a fic called Basilisk-Born. It just updated with a whole chapter on Harry being the heir of Grim, Slytherin, LeFay, Emrys, Pendragon etc. etc. And Harry repeatedly calling Nic Flamel 'Oncle' rather than 'Uncle' for some reason.

I have absolutely no memories of this fic. My gut reaction based on all of that is to unfollow it and move on. Has anyone read it that can tell me if it is any good despite what the name blitz would have you think? I'm hoping there's some reason I followed it long ago...


** Basilisk Born is probably the only fic where Harry being the Heir (or rather Lord) of several Houses is justified in the story. I can't say it's a perfect fic, but it's a pretty enjoyable one, and from what I saw, it's by far the best "Lordship" one.

As for calling Nicolas Flamel "Oncle", and without spoiling too much,>! he met him when he was mainly speaking French, and kept calling him Oncle as an habit.!<

** I liked it.

Its a slow burn, and very long though, so if its not your cup of tea 10 chapters in I wouldn't read another 50.

** It's good. Harry doesn't get all these names at once but gradually over the time so it's okay for my part.

Dumbledore is bashed here but not because he is evil or malicious, just obtusely ignorant of traditions.

And 'oncle' is the french for uncle, Flamel being french...

*** I think he is bashed because he caused the death of Harry's friends and never apologises for it. I loved the story more in the latter chapters when War against Grindelwald is discussed. The arc of Moody is also very intriguing.

** I also started reading Basilisk Born... but I dropped it because of the clichÃ©s and the pace (which is very, /very/ slow).

After chapter 30 the story loses the quality it had in the beginning, sadly.
