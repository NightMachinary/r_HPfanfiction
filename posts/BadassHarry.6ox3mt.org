** Conversely, could we get Geeky!Harry or Canon!Harry with tattoos because "They looked cool." Not as an act of rebellion or badassery, but simply because they looked nice. Because seriously, who wouldn't want magical tattoos? They can probably move. Or, in the case of /With Strength of Steel Wings/, become real. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]])

Of course, a moving tattoo might end up like [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-021][SCP-021]].

*** Hahah, man, I liked that story, but /boy/ did it escalate in power I wasn't expecting.

It's been ages, but was this the one where he has to attune himself to night/day/oblivion? Becomes a phoenix out in Egypt?
