Looking for a new one to read! what's your favorite Harry/Multi Harry/Harem stories are!

My current favorite is Whispers In The Night

Linkffn(12104688)


** harem stories are always dragged down by the sheer amount of women or whatever harry likes shagging. 2-3, maybe 4 women (or whatever, maybe alien space bats) is the max a story should have, otherwise it's so dragged down by bs.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
