Scenario: Harry time travels to the past, to the moment where he boards the train to Hogwarts for the first time. Harry's goal is to destroy all the horcruxes (Nagini is not one until later in the story), deal with his scar, and kill Voldemort's host body as safely as possible. Assume Harry's knowledge is up to his 17 year self (so he's not using Fiendfyre unless he taught himself in this timeline).

First, what would you do, if you were Harry? Would you tell Dumbledore? Would you free Sirius? How would you deal with Quirrel?

Next, what are things that could go wrong (as is common in stories where the timeline is altered)? Some of my thoughts are:

1) The timeline change enough that Lucius doesn't enact his Diary plan in the second year. With the diary safely and securely stored in Malfoy Manor, the "Horcrux Hunt" is more complicated.

2) Harry/Dumbledore decides to destroy the Diadem since it is the most accessible one. Voldemort/Quirrel somehow finds the Diadem missing, flees Hogwarts, and moves all Horcruxes to different locations. This makes the Horcrux Hunt extremely more dangerous and hard.

3) A classmate dies early (most likely due to the Basilisk - too many students were lucky in the original timeline)

Probably the best choice yeah... but then you'll immediately have to shift PoV because the story clearly can't be about Harry anymore. He's a child (or at least in the body of a child)... there's really nothing he has to do anymore, except maybe get shot by a killing curse or touch Quirrel at some point.

Also, while I think of it: We know that the magic of the world of Harry Potter is/can be incredibly subtle, and that the protective enchantments on Hogwarts are both ancient and incredibly powerful. It is not only plausible, /but likely/ that it is the protections on Hogwarts that led to all the "coincidences" that kept the Basilisk from actually killing anyone.

** I'm one hundred percent sure that Dumbledore would believe that he was from the future as soon as he told him. He wouldn't even need to provide any evidence, I just see Dumbledore accepting it the minute he said it.

After that, Harry would tell Dumbledore where all the Horcruxes are, and they and the Order would quickly gather and destroy them. The Diary might be a problem, but if Dumbledore was to tell fudge that there was a dark object inside Lucius Malfoy's house, then he'd probably send some aurors there. Fudge was an incredibly weak willed person, and as long as Dumbledore didn't mention that Voldemort was involved, he'd probably follow along. The diadem wouldn't really be a problem as long as they gathered all the horcruxes first then destroyed them.

** Advance/future knowledge is the ultimate power or Deux Ex Machina.

A time-traveling Harry should have it EASY crushing Voldemort, especially if he decided to trust Dumbledore. My battle plan for Year 1 is:

Let Dumbledore and Snape in their plans right from the start. So instead of playing out the 'time line', a better and far less risky solution would be to capture Voldemort, force him to spill all his secrets, obliviate him back to infancy, douse him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.

Other Year 1 actions should include:

- Capture Wormtail and free Sirius Black
- Buy a few Goblin made weapons, open the Chamber, use Harry's Parselmouth ability to control the Basilisk, and imbue those weapons with its venom. They didn't necessarily need Gryffindor's Sword.
- Send anonymous tip about Barty Jr to Amelia Bones, that should get Jr kissed and Sr locked up forever in Azkaban (as payback for Sirius)
- Having established credibility with the Barty Jr tip, send another one about Lucy's secret stash under his drawing room. That should net them the Diary and Lucy's extended vacation with dementors. Force Narcissa to sell out Lucius for Draco's sake, and confiscate significant amount of Malfoy assets.
- Next, Dumbledore worked a little politics to have Lestranges compensate Longbottoms. That would get them the Cup.
- With most Horcruxes and Lucius gone, they now had some time to enjoy Hogwarts a little bit and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- Harry, Sirius, Andromeda, and Longbottoms should control large amount of resources by now and would influence Fudge to behave better. Getting rid of Umbridge should also be easy, or if they were more pragmatic, use her as their 'attack dog'.
- They could further invest their money in tech stocks just to maximize future returns.

**** It was NEVER specified in canon that Fiendfyre was this powerful and uncontrollable. A major piece of evidence was that no Muggle villages or towns were ever destroyed by that spell, despite it being a Death Eater's preferred weapon/spell.

There was only one sentence by Hermione describing its effect. When Crabbe unleashed it later in the RoR, it was contained in that room and the Castle never burnt down because of that.

Therefore, readers and fanfic writers have SIGNIFICANT leeway in interpreting the effects of Fiendfyre.

I'm going with the assumption that a wizard of Dumbledore's power was strong enough to use and control it.

Crabbe's Fiendfyre stayed in the RoR because through the Room's magic it sensed that that's what the people in the room needed.

That said, the above doesn't prove that my interpretation of Fiendfyre is correct, it only shows that it's plausible.

But irrespective of what the "actual" effects of Fiendfyre are, from a fanfic perspective, you can't use it as a consequence-free way to destroy horcruxes; it makes for a less interesting story.

You can, in fact, use it that way, and you can do so without it marring your story.

For instance, in /The Problem with Purity/, Hermione offs Voldemort without much trouble. But the central theme of the story was romance rather than the conflict with Voldemort.

Alternatively, if defeating Voldemort is the major point of the story, you might put enough barriers between the protagonist and obtaining the horcruxes that using fiendfyre to trivially destroy them doesn't detract.

It's a good maxim to prefer things that make it harder on your protagonist, but you can take it too far.

Here's a thought; instead of just Dumbledore, what about other adults Harry trusts? Like say, the Weasley parents, or Hagrid?

Granted, if 'boarding the Hogwarts Express for the first time' is where Harry goes back to, that removes his first opportunity to tell Hagrid, and makes Dumbledore (or McGonagall) the first someone he can reasonably tell. There's definitely plenty of proof in the form of Things Harry Shouldn't Know Yet that he can use, like knowing about the Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort's true identity, the Horcruxes...

  what would you do
#+end_quote

As I see it, the player wouldn't have that many choices --- especially if they start already boarding the train.

*Option A:* Go to Hogwarts, decide to trust Dumbledore: The risk here is that you don't know what's Dumbledore's true personality like, and how he'll react to having a time traveller on his hands. If you /do/ decide to entrust in him though, I believe swift plan of actions should be choosen. So:

- find a professor on the train (or a prefect if there are none) and ask them to contact Dumbledore and tell them that Harry Potter urgently needs to meet and speak with him before the Sorting ceremony starts;
- upon meeting him ask him to read your mind and to use Veritaserum on you if necessary. Present him the rest of the plan, and proceed with it if he's ok with it (or change it however Dumbledore wishes, since you're almost completely under his control now);

  - warn the sorting hat to not do anything stupid and to act as it was in canon;
  - once the ceremony is over, quietly move Ron into Headmaster's office and confiscate the rat;
  - (once Quirrelmort is inside the castle premises and can not Apparate away) contact a group of qualified Aurors and ambush him. Kill him, or capture him, if VD can't escape as a spirit until the host is dead. Or design some spirit-capturing trap before engaging him. Maybe also arrange for him to first cast a single AK at Harry, depending on Dumbledore's opinion on this matter;
  - get the Diadem and maybe also the ring;
  - organise an emergency meeting with Fudge (and maybe an unspeakable), show him the horcruxes, make him greenlight an ambush on Malfoy Manor;
  - open the hidden room that stored all the dark artefacts. If it's not there, use Veritaserum on Lucious, get the diary;
  - tell the Minister about the Sirius \ Pettigrew issue, show him the rat, make him exonerate Black;
  - depending on how the inheritance process works between old houses and with the goblins, either temporarily free Bellatrix to use her to withdraw the cup or just kill her and wait until the control over the vault passes to Sirius;
  - Once Sirius is free also procure the locket and the ring (if not already taken by now);
  - destroy all the horcruxes, put Lucious and the two Bartemius Crouches in Azkaban, +give Umbridge to centaurs as a gift,+ etc, the end.

*Option B:* Go to Hogwarts, decide to not trust Dumbledore:

Prerequisites:

- you'll have to somehow either destroy the Sorting Hat, evade getting sorted by it, or manage to deceive it --- maybe Imperio some other first-year while you're yet on the train so they'll somehow destroy the Hat? Not very likely.
- you'll have to somehow both protect yourself from all the mind-readers and also do that in a manner that will not be suspicious to them. Not very likely.
- you'll have to convicingly act like a first-year student 24/7 for 9 months (not very likely).
- you'll have to make the events play out very close to canon at least until you get your hands on the diary (not very likely).

*Option C:* Escape from the train\Hogwarts:

- this plan fails if Dumbledore and the whole magical community have no means of detecting where Harry Potter is (not very likely).

*Option D:* Escape from the train, quickly contact France or some other country, defect to France. Then correspond with Dumbledore and Co. while staying out of their reach and all the crazy assassination plots.

*** In Option B, you disregard the very real possibility that the Hat is bound not to reveal the secrets it learns. I see it popping quite often in time-travel fics, and it's very reasonable. The usual reasoning behind it is that the "Dark" families like the Malfoys would not send their children at Hogwarts to have their oh-so-incriminating minds read if the Hat could just tattle to the headmaster, so a sacrifice was made by the Founders for the sake of the new generation getting a good education. In this case, the worst-case scenario would be the Hat deciding that your time-travel plan is worthy of Slytherin, and thus Sorting you differently than it did the first time around.

By the way, this might sound naive, but you also fail to consider the possibility that the Sorting Hat might simply be benevolent and shut up if you convince him it's for the best.

I disregard these because I can't be sure that they are more than just a possibility, and so can't allow for my plans to be relying on them.

The difference is between a plan that you're writing for your story's character (where you can hand-wave away inconvenient obstacles, like the Hat's mindreading, for the sake of advancing the plot in your designed direction) and a plan that you see yourself developing if you yourself were that character --- without any [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist][Doylist]] means of influencing your environment.

Another interesting thing is that the universe would likely react more benevolently to a more trusting and straight-forward character and react more severely against a distrusting one. Imagine, for instance, Dumbledore's reaction to only finding out that someone was from another universe and the same Dumbledore's reaction to also reading in this SI's mind that they were planning to destroy the Hat, imperio a student to do something, etc. The first SI would likely be seen just as an unfortunate victim of chaotic magic, while the latter would be seen as a sociopath or something like that. The more negative reaction isn't guaranteed but it, as a possibility, is also there.

** Just an inventory, when Harry is eleven the horcruxes are: Diary: Malfoy Manor Diadem: Hogwarts Locket: 12 Grimmauld Place Cup: Bellatrix Lestrange's Vault Ring: Gaunt House Scar: Harry's Head Voldemort: Inside Quirrell.

And these are the difficulties with destroying them all in the first year:

1. Voldemort is at Hogwarts. If he gets wind of any horcruxes being destroyed, he can just leave Hogwarts and go make more- e.g. Nagini. He may also go and move/check on the other ones. If he leaves Hogwarts then it may be some time till he's found again.(It takes another three years in canon.)

2. Harry is only master of the cloak (and then, after xmas.) Dumbledore is still master of the Elder Wand. The ring still has a deadly curse and is in the Gaunt House. Plus, Harry's parseltongue is kind of useful. Getting rid of Harry's scar isn't really possible at this point. Do we even want to know what happens if Harry's scar is the last remaining horcrux?

3. That curse, tho? Is it avoidable? Does it mean someone has to die to get the ring? We don't know, but we know that if triggered, it's irreversible and incurable. It's reasonable to want to leave getting the ring until you're sure you can afford to lose Dumbledore, or try to make sure that whoever you make get it is disposable. (And we know, Snape is actually surprisingly useful!)

4. Bellatrix Lestrange: She's super evil. She also has the cup. If she (and her husband) dies, there's a reasonable likelihood that her vault would pass to Narcissa (see 5). If Voldemort ever came back, she is a valuable piece for him to have on the board, and one I'd want to get rid of ASAP. If she gets to go after Voldemort, she's worse than Pettigrew. Getting her out to get the cup is a huge risk, getting the cup without her permission is a huge risk. Basically, the cup is a bloody nuisance.

5. The Malfoy's are at the height of their power and prestige. Breaking into the manor? Tricky! Breaking into Bellatrix's vault, whether it's owned by Narcissa or not? Tricky!

And here's the problems with waiting till any of these things become more favourable:

1. Not changing stuff is boring and frustrating, and also, that's kind of what canon is.

2. When you change stuff, it has consequences down the line.

e.g. Releasing Sirius embarrasses Fudge. Fudge is largely controlled by Malfoy. Malfoy is the guardian of the diary, and his wife is heir to the cup. Embarrassing/exposing Malfoy is embarrassing for Fudge. Pissing off Fudge leads to Umbridge, and a decrease in Dumbledore's power.

e.g. If the order never reforms, or reforms too early, Tonks and Remus never fall in love. Bill and Fleur never meet. Luna hasn't started Hogwarts yet, so never gets her friends. Neville never gets to channel his inner goddess and be awesome.

Also, there is the straight up problem of everyone he knows is six years younger, which means Ginny is still a child, Hermione and Ron are still children. Relating to your best friends when they're six years behind is difficult. Relating to any eleven year old when you're seventeen is difficult. That changes stuff too.

So here are the chains of dependency for the easiest and quickest route to victory:

1. Diary: Easiest- Wait till the summer of 2nd yr, and let Lucius slip Ginny the diary. Quickest- Send Mr Weasley an anonymous tip about the compartment under the dining room floor in Malfoy Manor, so maybe he can search early. If this happens, Dumbledore needs to be involved, because we need a way for the diary to be confiscated and delivered to our heroes. This is riskier- a search may not find it, and if anyone gets wind that someone's looking for it, something unpredictable might happen.

Diadem: Easiest: Wait till Volde-Quirrell is gone and just go get the bloody thing and give it to Dumbledore. Quickest: Just go get the bloody thing and give it to Dumbledore. Volde-Quirrell might get wind of this and move the other horcruxes/make more though.

Locket: This one is kind of tricky, because it's linked to the Voldemort one. Without Pettigrew, how and when Voldemort regains his body is an unknown. But you need Pettigrew to get Sirius out and acquitted, and you need Sirius out to get into Grimmauld Place. Dumbledore needs Harry to stay with the Dursleys. So these routes take about the same amount of time, it's more a kind of 'choose your adventure'.

1. Have someone tell Sirius to escape, destroy the locket, and let Pettigrew run off to Voldemort. This happens earlier, but in a somewhat similar way.

2. Take the rat to Dumbledore, have Sirius released and Pettigrew imprisoned. This leaves Fudge annoyed, Pettigrew unable to get to Voldemort, no one sure where Voldemort is, him a shade with uncertain powers, and Sirius as a wild card on the board.

Cup: Quickest: Maybe trade sword for cup? Have a bank heist just like in canon? Basically, take it from Gringotts without permission. Potentially pissing off Goblins, potentially pissing off Malfoys and also the Ministry of Magic.

Easiest: Just have Neville sue the Lestranges and ask that he make the cup part of the settlement. He's the potential-boy-who-lived too. Poor lad deserves a part in it.

Ring: Quickest: Just send someone we don't like to get it and then nick it from them when they've been cursed. Easiest: Figure out what the curse is, protect from it, retrieve ring.

Scar:

Once you've got the ring, LOL! SURPRISE ATTACK. Your wand is mine now. Or. Harry is still master of the Elderwand from the other timeline?

Dunno. Basically, I have a lot of thoughts on the subject! :D

I was under the impression the curse only got Dumbledore because he actually put the ring on. Presumably if you just went straight to whacking it with the sword then it would be destroyed much like the locket was in DH.

But the sword is obviously a new problem -- it hasn't yet been infused with basilisk venom, so short of willingly going head to head with the beast you would need to use a different method of destroying the Horcruxes. Although I assume that killing the basilisk (or at least removing it from Hogwarts) would be on the agenda in any case.

Bringing down Lucius Malfoy would be really easy with future knowledge. His secret stash under his Drawing Room would be enough to send him off to Azkaban for decades.

If they could trap Voldemort's wraith, why bother giving him a body back? If they couldn't, Voldemort would most likely still be found in Albania. So if they wanted to give a him body back, just send Snape off to do it. Voldemort would then be EXTREMELY weak in his Humonculus body, and that would be the perfect chance to neutralize him (first pump him with enough Veritaserum to get his secrets, next obliviate him back to his infancy, then dose him with Draught of Living Death, and finally lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard). Now they gained some breathing room and could work on Harry's scar more leisurely.

Also, Harry ABSOLUTELY didn't need to return to the Dursleys. Once Sirius gained control of 12 Grimmauld Place, just slap a Fidelius Charm on it with Dumbledore as the Secret Keeper.

**** Part of the thing is, the wizarding world is twisted and corrupt. His secret stash under the drawing room wasn't enough to send Lucius to Azkaban. We know this because Ron told Arthur about Malfoy's secret stash. I can't find the quote- but I seem to remember that a fine is all that comes of it. And Malfoy is still in a position to get have Dumbledore removed as Headmaster and to have the minister arrest Hagrid. It's also an indication of how the Wizarding World works- Hagrid, who is actually innocent, goes to Azkaban for weeks. Lucius Malfoy, who is actually guilty, pays money and gets away with it. Plus, we know that Sirius's house has a lot of dark artifacts.

Umbridge is a bigot and a sadist. She may not be a Death Eater, but she has a genuine disgust for muggle borns, children of mixed parentage, magical creatures and beings. She doesn't want power- she wants to dominate these groups, and she wants to cause pain and distress. She does well when those in charge also want those things. As long as there was someone else to be an attack dog for, she would be. She's not lawful neutral, she's lawful evil.

"Not difficult at all,"

Well...I mean, it can be as difficult as you like. For example, a civil suit is in some ways a negotiation. It would become obvious quite quickly that they were after something specific, and it would become obvious that the Longbottoms didn't want it for themselves. Plus, it then becomes likely that someone can report that Dumbledore is trying to get his hands on something in Bellatrix's vault. If that gets back to Voldemort, the gig is up. Meanwhile, they're going up against Lucius Malfoy, who has enough political capital to take on Dumbledore. He can certainly take on 11yr old Neville and his Gran, who is rather too forceful to be sympathetic or subtle. Plus, Draco and his two bodyguards are still at school to make things unpleasant for Neville to try and force him to abandon the suit.

Nobody knows if you can trap Voldemort's wraith. Voldemort in a homunculus body is still strong enough to kill Frank Bryce, and torture Wormtail. He's strong enough to torture Quirrell as a wraith. He's not harmless, he's just weakened. He can still use legimancy, and one presumes, occulamancy. Plus, Snape is a valuable piece- he's a great duellist, a skilled wizard and potions master, he protects the students from the worst of the Death Eaters and he acts as a spy. Sending him to Voldemort that early, risks losing him.

Basically, the joy of fan fiction is that you can make the conflict level as high as you like. It can be impossible to get things done, or you can get it all done before teatime. There can always be problems. You can usually get around problems.

You are overestimating Malfoy's influence. When he was captured after Year 5, he rotted in Azkaban for almost a year until Voldemort broke him out. Ron never told Arthur about Malfoy's secret stash until it was way too late. If Dumbledore pushed this issue early in Year 1 personally, the outcome couldn't be more different.

Also, I mentioned that Bones already got a successful tip about Barty Jr, so the credibility was there.

Fudge was just elected to Minister in 1991, so his position was far less entrenched than, let's say 1995. In canon, Dumbledore's own position had been severely weakened by 'a series of very unfortunate events' from 1991 to 1995, so the balance of power should have shifted to Fudge's favor by that time.

****** No I'm not. The circumstances are entirely different by Yr 5, and the crimes are entirely different. We know that Sirius's house is full of dark artefacts and we know there is a shop in Knockturn Alley that sells dark artefacts. One might assume that having a stash of dark artefacts is something that is very common amongst a certain brand of old family. It's the legal equivalent of being found with a couple of grams of coke, a bag of joints and some illegal fire-arms. A man like Lucius Malfoy is not going to prison for that. If he can't get a fancy lawyer who can use Lucius's influence and promises of largesse to get him let off entirely, then he's getting a fine, maybe some community service. He didn't even go to prison for being a Death Eater, the first time! It does achieve the goal of having his stuff confiscated though!

In Year 5, Fudge has doubled down on a 'Voldemort is not back, why you lying'?' position. At the end of Yr 5, it has been proven to be false. Voldemort is back and flaunting it. Fudge is humiliated, his credibility is in tatters. Lucius Malfoy was found in the Ministry (Stan Shunpike got 6mth for attempting to break in), as part of a gang of Death Eaters, doing Death Eater stuff, destroying priceless artefacts and research, with actual facts Voldemort. It's completely different to owning a bunch of dubious stuff.

Plus, after refusing to see Voldemort's return for so long, now it's undeniable, he has to Do Something. And an easy thing to do is punish the Death Eaters he's got. Especially his dear confidant, because he cannot be seen to be soft on Death Eaters.

Then again- as I say. You can make your own conflict levels in fic, and you can decide how the dice will fall. This is just how I interpreted canon.

** - The diary. Dumbledore just tells Lucius that he knows he has it and that he better give it up if he wants to maintain his good reputation. Lucius agrees. No sweat.
- The diadem. Dumbledore goes to the Room of Lost Things and searches until he finds it.
- The ring. Dumbledore goes to the shack and searches until he finds it.
- The cup. This one is a little more difficult. I think that Dumbledore is probably capable of breaking into Gringotts, though.
- The locket. This is the hardest one. Harry has no idea exactly where the cave is. It will probably take months of research at the very least to figure out just where to go. While there, I still think Dumbledore insists on he himself drinking the potion. Hopefully there are no lasting effects.

You destroy all of the above by tossing them through the veil in the Department of Mysteries.

Complications:

- Quirrel. I think Dumbledore would want to give him a second chance, but at what point do you tip off Back-of-the-Head-Voldy that you are onto him?
- Ron and Hermione. Harry will have to assume he's stuck in this timeline, so he's going to want to make sure his friendship with Ron & Hermione develops, but that will be hard. There will be fewer opportunities for adventure, and the troll-in-the-bathroom incident likely won't happen again.
- Ginny. At what point is she old enough that Harry can make a move on her without feeling creepy?
- Harry's scar. Is there a way to extract the bit of Voldy's soul without Harry having to die? If not, then do you let Voldy resurrect himself using Harry's blood?
- Does Dumbledore give Harry house points for sharing everything he knows? If not, does that mean Slytherin's winning streak continues?
- Pettigrew. I assume you transform him back into a human and make him stand trial. Sirius Black is free and is legally Harry's guardian. This means the Protection he had at the Dursleys' will break. So if Voldy does regain strength, Harry is a lot more vulnerable.
- Snape. Is Harry cool with his boy Sev, or does he maintain his distance so Snape can still be used as a spy if need be?

Complication: the Veil doesn't destroy anything. It moves the items into a far-off realm. Now you cannot kill Voldemort.

The locket was in Kreacher's care by 1 November 1981, so that should be one of the easy ones. It only spend a few days in the cave.

*** You have some valid points but I disagree with the first one. The one with Lucius is kinda tricky.

Dumbledore can't prove, nor tell anyone (he doesn't want to anyway) that Lucius has the diary as well as what the diary actually is. Besides, he either doesn't have enough power, or is unwilling to discredit Lucius publicity. If Dumbledore could do that, Fudge would be much less of a pain in canon.

Lucius knows that Dumbledore can't prove the existence of the diary in the first place, so no sweat of him. Even if he was shaken and decided to get rid of the diary, there was no reason to think he would give it to Dumbledore. Most likely Lucius would find a way to dump it on one of his enemies again, which may make finding the diary become the hardest of them all, since Ginny was only ten at the time, no Hogwarts for her.

If Harry and Dumbledore were lucky, Lucius would plan the diary on Ron. Or he could just go to another enemy of his. Given who Lucius is, I'm sure he has a lot of those. At that time Lucius only knew that it was a dark artifact, not the fact that it had something to do with the CoS, so there was no restriction on which enemy he had to give it to.

***** "Legal means" is the problem, is it? Canon Dumbledore isn't very fond of breaking the laws, except for the direst of situations like when he was about to be captured. If he could, he would have screwed Lucius and the "Imperiused victims" over and over in canon. Maybe he could, but his moral didn't let him do so.

But of course, it's the author's AU, he can make Dumbledore behave anyway he wants.
