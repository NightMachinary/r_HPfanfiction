Just curious if there are any stories where some wizard(good, or bad) sees the danger nukes pose, and gets rid of them. Either by transfigurating them into toys, sending them through the veil of death, or into space, or just hides them. Basically just gets rid of them.

The more words the merrier, but it's all good in the end. Also if it's part of some larger goal(magics bidding, time travel from war, muggle subjugation, etc...) that'd be great.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Linkffn(rise of the wizards) has the warheads transfigured into treacle tart iirc

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry

** Alternately, any fics where some wizard makes a nuke? (Think South Africa-style aerodynamic separation, but Accio-assisted.) I think I've seen one where Harry sets off an atomic bomb deep below Gringotts, but I don't recall the name.
