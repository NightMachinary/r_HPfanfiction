Could be a crossover, but prefered not. Just looking for a fic that is funny, fast, well written, and doesnt take itself too seriously


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357627/1/Scorpius-Malfoy-and-the-Improbable-Plot][Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot]] fits the bill, though it's tragically incomplete. The rest of the author's work also qualifies.
