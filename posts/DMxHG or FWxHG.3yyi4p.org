Looking for either DMxHG or FWxHG. Preferably longer stories, wouldn't mind some darker stories too when DMxHG. Recommendations? :)


** linkffn(the die) is probably the best HG/DM fic I've ever read. It also has a much more realistic take on what life would be like for those who participated in The Battle of Hogwarts than I typically see.

** If you aren't picky about which twin, linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel) are going in the GW/HG direction.
