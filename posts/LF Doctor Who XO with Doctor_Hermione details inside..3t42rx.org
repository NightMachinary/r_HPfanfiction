*** Thanks for the suggestion but it is definitely not that. I'm 99% positive Harry Ron Amy Roy and River don't appear at all. It's entirely about Hermione and The Doctor's relationship .

**** Oh. When you wrote "meets him young", I had assumed that she'd join the Doctor pre-Hogwarts.

Now I'm curious myself: post-Hogwarts, Hermione is a powerful witch in her own right, which would mess with the usual Doctor/Companion dynamic.

****** Ah, that makes more sense.

I'm curious but wary. 90% of the time, fics of this sort strip Hermione of personality and competence to make her a tagalong and an occasional damsel in distress.

Does the author at least remember that post-DH Hermione /has/ time-traveled hundreds of times, and is also possibly the only person alive who actually knows how to make a horcrux?

******* It was rather short to get that into it but iirc she had a very canon personality.
