This was inspired by a deliciously delightful comment on this ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f8ona5/not_many_people_know_this_but_just_inside_the/]]) thread by Poonchow.

Somehow, somewhere, somewhy, the Harry Potter world finds out they are, as many philosophers have feared, the fictional imaginings of a terrible Goddess. She is bad at maths, struggles to keep the threads of fate straight, and regularly forgets her own Universal Laws. My questions are... how do they find out, and what happens next? :D

Are there any fics like this? Sort of like the 'Back to Earth' series of Red Dwarf, but good. :D

If not, call this a prompt.


** Two stories, where Hermione and Ginny respectively describe how it was really:

1. linkao3(3867175) ... Harmony type of story, so bit of bashing, however, in the end it is not completely horrible.

2. linkffn(3728284)

*** Uh, the first one seems to be an Elementary fic, not a Harmony story. But the second one looks cool. The first chapter was interesting enough that I've added it to my 'To Read' list.

Thanks for the recs!
