I'm looking for fics where Snape isn't a cruel douchnozle. Or where he actually matures and learns to be better throughout. Though please no Snape/Lily pairings unless they deal with her relationship with James intelligently. And no James bashing.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** linkffn(The Best Revenge) has a fantastic mentor Snape. He's not cruel and petty towards Harry like in canon but still feels in character.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** You're potterforums grrarrgh right?

linkao3(Advanced Contemporary Potion Making)

After war, Snape is kinda nice in this one. It's sshg

linkao3(Remember Remember by suitesamba)

Snape is a mild mannered muggle scientist. He has had a lot of time to forget his painful past

linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot by starcrossedgirl)

It's slash, but only at the end.

linkao3(An Unbreakable Bond by Jaxon)

** Do you care about self-recs, female Harry, parental Snape, or works that are still in progress (but which update regularly)? (if the answer is no to all of those, my fic ao3link(Swiftly Falling Snow) features a good Snape).

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to doâ€• he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

** I like the Redefining Life series by OliverSnape, starting with The Definition of Home. linkffn(5878880) also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][on AO3]].

It's not finished, but The Better Man by Laume also has a good Snape. Also features reasonable Dursleys and Dudley as a wizard. Not sure how you feel about showing James as a bully while in school, because that's canon and not bashing. linkffn(3570937)

  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's Order task, finding a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves. Guardian/Adoption fic.
