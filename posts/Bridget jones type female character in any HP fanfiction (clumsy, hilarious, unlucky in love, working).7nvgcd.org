*** A Tonks/Remus story that was a romantic comedy would be something worth reading.

  'Don't think of it as a marriage contract, I don't! It makes it easier- think of it as ... an amalgamation agreement. Makes it sound less complicated.' Harry/Daphne. EWE.

** Yes: linkffn(She Said What? by Zayz) is one of my favourite Marauders era fics, with Lily turned into a diarising Bridget-Jones-esque character.

It starts off /very/ jerky in style, but the writer gets into her swing with it and develops a better diary style with less blatant swearing, so if you aren't sure of the style, stick it out a few chapters first.

**** Oh right, I'm with you! I'll have a think and see if I can come up with any good ones - although that one I recommended is definitely a bit of an unlucky Bridget Jones type character, not so much clumsy but plenty of other romcom-esque traits.
