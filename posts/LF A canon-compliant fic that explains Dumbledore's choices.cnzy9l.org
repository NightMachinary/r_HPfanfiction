And WTF he was thinking when he made some of them. No bashing, this is the opposite of what I want, because ATM I feel like I could write a Dumbledore bashing fic on the spot. Something from Dumbledore's POV will be amazing. Thanks!


** I like Dumbledore in the linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) and in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack's Resurgence), they make some sense. And yes, explaining his sometime questionable choices is the most interesting job of the fanfic writers. They should not lament it is difficult (or resort to pure Dumbledore bashing), their stories would not be interesting without this difficulty.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343) is the closest thing I can think of. It's the series from Dumbledore's POV and primarily focused on his relationship with Harry, but is sadly incomplete.

  Albus Dumbledore never dreamed he would have such a person on his hands. He had never imagined how quickly even the best laid plans could be derailed by something as simple as love. Snippets of the Harry Potter series from Dumbledore's point of view. Will eventually cover all seven books.
