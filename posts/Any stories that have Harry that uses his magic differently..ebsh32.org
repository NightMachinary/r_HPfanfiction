Similar to maybe Fairy Tale, Fate, etc... Maybe he uses to help strengthen himself physically, or maybe he figures out how to mimic other powers like telekinesis, or flight. As long as it's different, big, and unique. Nothing small like he learnt how to breathe in the water, I want it to be groundbreaking. Maybe thought of as impossible.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) may interest you, since it has Harry being forced to use a completely different mode of magic. Though unfortunately the further into the story the weaker it gets.
