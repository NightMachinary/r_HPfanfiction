** I think it was a mix/verity of things:

1. Snape not really having an age confirmed in the books until I think /Half-Blood Prince./ It was just known that he was the youngest of all the professors. So some people took that as him in his early to mid 20s, not in his 30s.
2. Some people in fanfiction are really into that teacher/student thing or power dynamics
3. Some people just really liked Snape and Hermione was already a character (a main one at that) established in the series. So people would user her as an OC (or self-insert) rather than making up a whole actual character because less people read OC-centered fics
4. Alan Rickman is popular (rinse and repeat no.3)

Personally, I'm not into the ship or any other Snape/Student equivalent and usually avoid fics that have it tagged (unless it's like a really background ship that pops up randomly/untagged in a fic im already invested into- then I skim it over). I can never get over the fact that they met when Hermione (or Harry/whatever student) met when they were 10/11 years old.

Honestly, if Hogwarts was more of a college/university rather than a grade school thru high school, I think the Snape/Student thing would be even more popular than it is now. Since it would be two adults (17/18 and 31) at a first meeting rather than a child and adult (11 and 31).

This has me thinking. Quirrellmort tells Harry that Snape was at Hogwarts with James. So by the end of Philosopher's Stone we know that they're about the same age, and later(PoA?) learn that they were in the same year. But when do we learn that James and Lily were only 20 when they had Harry? I can't recall if it's mentioned in the books at all, but we know about it somehow?

**** Oh right, I actually had forgotten about those facts? possibilities? Idr, It's been a while since I've read the actual series in it's entirety.

Well even with it being mentioned in PS, it leaves a possible 6-8 year gap at max between them depending on birthdays (unknown at the time). Again it's been a while, but I don't recall someone mentioned that they all were in the same year in POA onward, just that they were there at the time time. And even still, I don't think in-book there were mentioned ages for Sirius or Remus. And they were often considered younger than they actually were. I /think/ the first solid showing that they all were in the same year was the pensive scene in HBP. Again, could be wrong.

A lot of information came out outside of the books and even after the series ended.

Also, fandom gonna fanfic. I think if you add in the real life time between books, then the theory or idea that Snape was younger than he was could have spread in popularity for the people that were writing fics while the actual series was ongoing.

#+end_quote

Idk, I think everything in the text implies a closer age, like 2-3 years at most. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't refer to it as similar to Draco and Harry's rivalry; a 17-year old having beef with an 11-year old is just bullying. It's in PoA we learn the details of the conflict, which imo at the very least heavily implies same year.

I guess it's possible people interpreted Snape as younger rather than older, but I think that with the added context of being the same age as Harry's parents without knowing how old they were, the more likely age is 40+. He doesn't really present youthfully, either.

Either way, I don't see the rationale or allure behind a Snape/Student ship, but that's just me :)

Fair enough, that does make more sense contextually. I can't speak for boarding school, but I went to two different school that both hosted grade to high school students so I saw a bit of everything. So anything is possible, but that does make more sense.

Honestly for me, I wasn't into the whole teacher/student thing, but even as I first read the books I didn't really realise how much older Snape was even with those clues. My brain simply read, didn't really think of the finer/unsaid details. Always imagined him younger than he was until I saw the movies/read the wikia. Probably the same with a lot of others.

** I like this ship, but ONLY (and it is a strict ONLY) when the premise is that Snape survived the war and around ten years later he ends up working with Hermione for whatever reason and they reconnect as the people they are now, not the people they were then. She MUST be 25 or older and successful in her own career and they must have not seen each other in the intervening years - in other words, the power imbalance is removed and they are relating as two adults, not a former student and teacher.

I think their characters, their fanon characters at least, are suited. And I enjoy these fics with these specific premises because you get to see Hermione thrive in a relationship with an intellectual equal and generally get to see Snape open up and become a human being with feelings other than blind rage. But there absolutely has to be a situation in the fic that puts them on an equal footing before the romance starts or it is indeed icky.

I absolutely agree that any student/teacher stuff, or even when she's only a couple years out of school and they still relate as "authority figure speaking to to child" are gross.

*** She is? I honestly never got that impression at all, and always found it odd when people made the comparision legitimately (and not just in jest). Hermione is far more studious, and far more socially awkward (Lily was supposedly popular, Hermione is not, and I never got the impression from the little we see of Lily that she was the kind of person to go into a panic for an exam). They're both Muggleborns sorted into Gryffindor, and I've definitely seen people less friendly with Snape in postwar SSHG snark to him about the likeness, but I personally never found them any similar at all beyond those 2 things.

Hermione is intelligent enough to see through (in time) the layers of deceptions Snape puts on. Depends on how you interpret Snape. Evil or broken, but a really strong man? To be a spy and deceit Voldemort... If you can see through his teaching style and get a glimpse on that, you cannot see the man as the same ever again.

** While not a pairing I particularly like, I don't /mind/ it. I mostly browse Snape fics. The vast majority of SSHG fics are teacher/student smut -- which are probably mostly written by people with either a teacher fantasy, a fantasy for Alan Rickman or both. I avoid those fics. Then there are the SSHG fics I actually read -- post-war ones. While I don't /like/ them in the sense that I go out of my way for them, they're common enough when I look for Snape fics in general that I see them crop up a lot. And their personalities are at least a decent match, if you file off Snape's more cruel edges (basically more like the behaviour of movie!Snape rather than stuff like "I see no difference") and focus on his intelligence and academic interest -- something he shares with Hermione. They're both the kind of people to study for studying's sake, rather than merely doing well enough based on just talent, and I could see them get closer as a result of some research project that calls for both of their skills, or similar.

Hell, I've read a couple of Marauder-era SSHG, and I genuinely believe that if Snape was pulled away from DE recruitment camp, a teenage Snape and Hermione would be an almost ideal match.

And besides that -- it's not like you have a lot of options for whom to pair him with otherwise. I've always viewed Snape as really only having 3 non-OC female prospect that I can see him end up with, depending on time period and circumstances. Lily (move him away from being entrenched into junior DE recruitment and I could very well see it happen), Narcissa (if she's portrayed as morally good with Lucius being the monster she wants to get away from, or who met an untimely death) and Hermione (due to above reasons).

** I used to dig it a lot when I was younger, though now my taste lean towards more canon. And I think a big part of the appeal is the older, smarter, misunderstood guy fantasy and equal part Alan Rickman's sympathetic performance.

I'm guilty of a lot of SI when it comes to Hermione and I think the books and the movies do Romione and Harry so wrong that I detest her peers' idiocy and declare (to myself) that no one her age could possibly keep up with her and/or appreciate her. [This is also why my first foray into fanfics really lean into Dramione because at least he was thrown into the bottom end in the last two books and there's no way but up for his character in my head but I digress.]

Enter Severus Snape. The youngest Potion Master, who created his own recipes and spells and just so brilliant. Sure, he was an asshole but it's because he was forced to stay in the job he hates to protect the manifestation of the people he loves and hates the most to atone for the folly of his youth. If only he was given a plot where he can do this while simultaneously open himself up to other people and a lot of early long fanfics delivered this, which only sparks the popularity of the ship.

I've definitely had fantasies about people who were older (read: would know wtf they're doing) as a teen, but it's not like I'd actually have any interest in going after an adult when I was a teen or have any interest in teens as an adult

***** Two reasons, three things.\\
First, you are coming off very judgmental. I'm not sure if you meant it that way, but you should be aware of that. It's fanfiction. People can ship whatever they want.\\
Second, the first reason people like it is because it's hot. There is a lot of really good Snape/Hermione smut based on the teacher/student thing. Top bdsm material right there. There aren't really moral issues because it's just smut. It isn't more complicated than that and they aren't real people.\\
Third, the second reason people like it is because it can be done well once the characters are aged up a bit. Look at Remus/Tonks! Yes, the age gap is more forgivable there, but the concept is still the same, and Hermione isn't just anybody. In most of these stories, she's broken, and is Snape, and they're both just looking for some comfort in a godforsaken war. Where there's war, convention is abandoned and you take what you can get. As for age, the reason that it's a problem is because of the power dynamic created by the relative maturity and wisdom of the elder. In Hermione, we have someone intelligent enough not to be fooled easily, and someone who has been forced to grow up far too fast by Voldemort's war. She isn't just some teenager - she's had to figure out what she stands for and what she believes, because it was that, or die. As a result, she knows what she's getting into if she starts something with Snape. Additionally, Snape is broken, and lacks the maturity and wisdom to manipulate her effectively even if that was his goal. As a result, anything that happens would be a result of organic chemistry rather than manipulation. Finally, it's interesting, although this point you probably don't connect with as much.

****** I meant to be judgmental. Your Remus/Tonks analogy is a bad one, because he didn't meet her/have daily contact with her when she was pre-pubescent. It is MUCH different to say "i'm 40 years old and I met this really great 25 year old that i fell in love with", versus "I'm 35 years old and this 11 year old really turns me on". Even if a story has them not get together until Hermione is of legal age, it is still really, really sinister. /He's known her since she was an elementary school student!/ What about that is hot?

Fanfiction is about wish fulfillment (we write what we wish the original author/creator would have done). That's why harems, OP!, super-rich protagonists are all very popular tropes. What does it say about a "pairing" where a 6th grade teacher falls for his student?

I'm not telling anyone they can't write about molestation/grooming. It's words on a screen, no one's being hurt by it. But yea, I think it's pretty fucked up.

******* It's hot because of the power imbalance, not besides it. She's 17, and he's a teacher. Power exchange is hot. That's the whole reason bdsm exists. Not everyone judges something morally before deciding whether it's hot or not. It's akin to separating art from artist.

Fanfiction is sometimes about wish-fulfillment, but not always. Sometimes it's just because someone was curious about exploring the interactions between these two characters without having any kind of moral angle. It isn't that people think, "this is fucked up, but I'm ok with that." People just don't always think about it, and that's okay. You don't always have to in fanfiction. Just because you can't turn it off doesn't mean everyone else can't.

It's great that you're okay with people taking the action, but I think you should refrain from judging people from reading it in the first place. That isn't right or fair, because there's nothing actually wrong with reading it. Your judgement is baseless once you actually think about it.

Finally, just responding to my Remus/Tonks analogy is straw-manning my argument. If you want to have a productive discussion, you should consider the other points I made as well about Hermione's relative maturity and Snape's immaturity. Here's another argument: Hermione is a completely different person at the end of the books than at the beginning, and so arguments that that gives Snape an advantage are silly. You said that Snape would have to be grooming and molesting her. It isn't molestation if she's an adult, and it isn't grooming, because she's the smartest witch of her age and been through a war, and Snape isn't capable of that besides. He's too broken.

******** Look, i appreciate you writing out these justifications. And i don't think it makes you a bad person or anything like that for reading it.

Here's the issue I haven't seen you address - Snape meets Hermione when she is objectively /a child/. He spends more time with her than her parents do for 6-7 years. It is a TOTALLY different situation than a 17-year old having a crush on a teacher. If you are an adult, just imagine that. You watch an 11 year old child grow up, go through awkward puberty, date other kids, get in schoolyard arguments, etc. It doesn't matter if Hermione is the most mature 11-year old on earth. She's still a little girl.

Snape isn't meeting a teenager at 17. He's watching a child grow up. Now, to be fair: if an author makes Hermione a transfer student, or Snape gets hired her 7th year, okay. I wouldn't be so squicked about it. But otherwise... well, personally, I find it very disturbing.

To each their own, though.

********** I'm sorry but this is absurd.

Your attempt at justification reads as a list of excuses for predatory behavior. Why try and defend the actions at all?

In any modern context the relationship is disturbing. Just like the myriad of stories in which you have a protagonist like Harry rape/mind control women into sex slaves are unsettling.

There aren't moral or in world justifications. The only fesible justification is the fact that it's taboo fetish exploration in a fictional setting in which the negative consequence of it existing are little to none.

You might prefer to read fic that conforms closely to the standards and morality of the real world, but for many people, myself included, fic is a space to explore things that would not necessarily be accepted in our society. It doesn't mean that we want these things to happen, or that we think they are acceptable in reality. It's just interesting to see what might happen if they did.

My issue was the fact that you were trying to justify the relationship with his characters history.

It doesn't matter that women his age aren't interested. It's an excuse for predatory behavior. Not justification that there isn't anything wrong with the idea behind the relationship.

Then why in the world do you keep /bringing that fact up?!?/

What does it /matter/ what she did or how she was when she was younger. /She's not anymore/.

Imagine this: You are 11 years old and you meet another 11 year old. You become best friends. You spend more time with each other than with your families. When you grow up, you hook up and get married. Is that weird?

Listen to your argument: If you know someone from when they were 11 years old and you date them when they grow up /you are a pedophile!!/

Like wtf man.

Did they fuck when she was 11? Did they fuck when she was 12? 13? 14? If the answer is no, /then why does it matter?!?/ They are both adults and they can make their own decisions and if they want to fuck then who are you to say that it's wrong?

********** You can't be that obtuse. Your example is nonsensical and meaningless. Here's what I am saying:

You are 30+ years old. An 11 year old child then spends several hours a day with you for the next 7 years. You see the kid grow up, make friends, be awkward, go through all the weird and annoying parts of getting older. You have authority over the child, more than a teacher would (boarding schools are way more involved than normal k-12). The child, after spending years and years in your care, is now an older teenager.

You're trying to tell me that it is okay, in that example, for the the adult to seduce and have sexual relations with that teenager??? You see nothing immoral or problematic?

How is that at all similar to two children growing up together and deciding to enter a romantic relationship when they're older?

These opinions really must be from younger people. Please believe me, once you're older this concept (grooming a child and waiting for them to get older) will seem really awful to you also.

Like I said in another comment, I wouldn't be grossed out if Snape was hired in her 7th year, or she was a transfer student. But an adult guardian-type figure (again, HW profs are way more engaged with their students than regular teachers) who is in charge of a young girl for years and years is... yuck.

But look man, it's words on the internet. If you like fantasizing about that stuff, you're not hurting anybody. Lots of stuff on the internet is pretty ick, reading about a middle aged man slowly seducing a child is far from the most objectionable thing I have seen online.

You and I have read completely different fics with Severus/Hermione.

I will tell you as bluntly as possible: Snape did /not/ groom Hermione.

How hard is that to understand? An adult and a student can end up in a relationship... /without grooming!/

Do you think that such a thing is impossible? I thought I was plain enough in my previous comment, or did you not read it?

Snape, as a character, has no interest in grooming a child into a relationship. It's Hermione that pushes it. It's Hermione that wants to help Severus out from his depression. All that while Severus is doing his best to push her away. Severus does /not/ want Hermione. He did /not/ groom her.

Is it that impossible for you to comprehend that Severus and Hermione could have a relationship /without/ grooming?

************** It is impossible, yes, based on the context in canon (Snape being in authority over her from childhood). This whole discussion is akin to the controversy over Vladimir Nabokov's /Lolita/, where a middle-aged man gets together with a young teenager. It is considered a hugely influential piece of literature, but is also to this day exceedingly controversial.

Just like we've been discussing, people argue over whether that book is decent or not. There's nothing you can say that would make me feel that such a plot could be crafted in a way that isn't horrifying and disturbing, and I suppose that nothing I say will convince you it isn't problematic.

********* I guess it depends on whether you see her as a different person or not. I combine the fact that Snape never really knew her and that she came back a completely different person after the war to be equivalent to her meeting Snape that 7th year. I think both of them were so used to not seeing each other as people that he hasn't really watched her learn or grow because he didn't want to. For the sake of the ship, I count the first moments when he really sees her in a fic as him meeting her for the first time.
