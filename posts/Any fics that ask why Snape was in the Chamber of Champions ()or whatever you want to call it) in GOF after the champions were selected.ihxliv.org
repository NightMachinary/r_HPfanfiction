I always wondered why Snape was there (can't remember if he was in the books or not). But why would a Potions professor be there and not a Charms professor? I get McGonagall because she was Harry's Head of House and even Moody, seeing that he was an ex-auror but again, why was Snape there? I am sure there was a good reason, just can't think of or find it. Also, feel free to give me your favorite fics were Harry does not compete (including any other tournament spin offs) Thanks!


** There's a short scene in this where Viktor tells him to leave.

  International Pen-Pals. The summer assignment spells disaster for both the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Hate-His-Fame and Quidditch Superstar Viktor Krum. Relieved when they are granted the opportunity to write anonymously, neither is prepared for the quick, easy friendship that blossoms through their letters, or the unexpected wish to reveal who they really are...

** Yes, he was there in the books and I'm pretty sure it was just to cause conflict (by being a dick).

  The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.

  “It's no one's fault but Potter's, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. “Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here ---”

  “Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.

That was his contribution to the scene, along with one mention of scoffing and one mention of looking angry in the background.

I'm not aware of any fics wondering what the hell he's doing there though.

** I assume he wants to keep an eye on Lily's son, who keeps risking his life apparently just to annoy Snape.
