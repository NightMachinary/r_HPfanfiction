Just a little compare and contrast. Note that 'practically a different universe' doesn't include crossovers,just continuity/character changes but feel free to mention them if you must


** Practically cannon:

With the exception of Ginny's name due to when this was written, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary - By Arabella]] by dramadragon) is a depiction of what Ginny's first year was probably like. Nothing about canon is changed, it's just a depressing look at what living with Tom Riddle in your head looks like from the inside.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554][The Years of the Rat]] by kaydeefalls) has all the right events in all the right places. It's just from Peter Pettigrew's point of view. The canon compliance is helped by the fact that there isn't much information on the marauders years.

Different Universe:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911][before the door of hell lamps burned]] by basketofnovas (slashmarks)) has so much world building that it's essentially an entirely different society from the books. It's a fic thats canon divergence is Sirius gets cleared at the end of book three, but the author uses the inclusion to build a new universe out of pureblood society.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] by noaacat) has the Hogwarts entrance age changed from 11 to 14. This leads to Harry being a /very/ different person.

** Practically canon:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] shows that canon Harry and his friends could only be pushed so far, and Magical Britain's establishment totally deserves it IMHO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] is canon compliant and does a good job in developing new plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] is the first HP fanfic I finished reading. Sometimes I suspect it was written by JKR in her spare time.

--------------

Practically Different Universe:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] obviously. Although many familiar characters are making their appearances and their personalities don't seem that different, the new circumstances elicit very different reactions from them or force them into a very different direction than in canon. Ginny Weasley (the author is a fan of her) is well written here, you can still see the shades of canon Ginny here, but she does make a dangerous villain in this new world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] is canon compliant until the end of DH, but boy, did things escalate after that. First they executed Kingsley for being a traitor, before going on to fight half of Europe. The latter third of the fic doesn't even deal much with them anymore, but with the revolutionary war inside Russia.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]] is only an one shot, but a very chilling one. The 'good guys' won the First War and you definitely won't like them. McGonagall is one scary fanatic here.

** Practically canon: Cauterize linkffn(4152700) and You-Know-Who linkffn(9910838)

There isn't much to say about these fics beyond what their summaries always say. Cauterize is about the scars - physical and metaphorical - left behind by the war. You-Know-Who is about the origin of Voldemort's epithet.

--------------

Practically a different universe: Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 series link]], linkffn(11191235)

Holy shit I adore this fic. It has really amazing worldbuilding, the top people on both side actually feel like the legendary wizards they're said to be, etc.

However, if you're going to try to read it, I have a few notes:\\
* I (and apparently a lot of people) dislike the prologue. If you don't like it, try skipping to the next chapter and reading from there. That's the chapter that got me interested in the fic.\\
* Yes, James and Jim start out really shitty. They do eventually get better. Not perfect, but better.\\
* In my opinion, the story majorly picks up in book 2. I obviously liked book 1 enough to get through it, but I only ever get the urge to reread parts from book 2 and after.\\
* It's a lot darker than canon. I feel like that goes without saying, but I always want to remark on it in case some people don't like that sort of thing.

** *Practically Canon*

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) really is canon to me. It's a Marauders story but it's just canon I can't say anything else.

All of TheDivineComedians work is canon Black Family for me. They capture that world perfectly. linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian)

*Practically a different Universe*

linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) was so interesting but the most NotHP HP story I've ever read. It's dark so be careful if your reading it. I really liked it but it wasn't HP, it was a Handmaid's tale story with characters that had a conveniently familiar backstory.

linkao3(Stealing Harry) and that whole universe is also my canonbutitsnotcanon story. Same world but totally different story. It's my go to Naaaaw story 😊

*In Between Canonish*

How the Founders are portrayed in Of a Linear Circle is canon, even if the rest of the story isn't. But Salazar is exactly him, a fiercely protective and brave castellaño man with dark hair and striking eyes. Helga is a tall blonde vikingr and volva. Rowena is a regal basque lady and Godric is a brave drunk with wild hair and huge! No other story portrays them as good as OaCL. linkao3(Of a Linear Circle Part III by Flamethrower)

***** Fantastic characterization on founders as well as main 3. Has a whole set of stories with their headcanons of the founders. That particular story also has a /phenomenal/ take on why salazar left and how he got the bad rap he did although it is very highly canon divergent starting around the middle of the battle at the end of book 5. Author also has a tumblr where they post answers to questions about their stories to keep the readers engaged between updates as those are usually at least a few months for any given fic.

****** Oh I'm a chapter in and already enjoying it! I have so much work to do today this is not a day I should be sidetracked by more stories...

I like them. Good Founders, they're reminding me a lot of the OaLC versions. Strong and protective and veeeery angry at how much Hogwarts has changed! I want to know what his reason for leaving was? And why the school is so crap at teaching anything remotely useful...

You should read OaLC, I think you might like it. It's the 3rd book in large epic (which is brilliant and you should read that too) but part 3 is able to be read as a standalone if you don't want to commit to an 11 book monster. There's a big focus on the history, being accurate for the time period, different cultures and countries and celebrations. So much language and magic lore and politics! I really love it, I just love Salazar so so much, he's great!

I can't wait to read this! It's been a while since I found a story i could really sink my teeth into!! (that's a lie its been 3 days but it feels like forever!) A link since I dont thing yours worked:: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887/chapters/1015938#workskin]]

** I don't really have a favourite practically canon fic, since I don't know or care about canon enough to know what's canon or not.

My favourite practically a different universe fic is and will probably always be 'Wastelands of Time' by Joe. Literally all it has in common with canon are character names and the various things they shout at each other while waving wands. It's so different, he basically used it as a jumping off point for a now-published novel.

But yeah, I love the story (time-looping Harry gets repeatedly fucked-up by everything he runs into while trying to save the world), the setting (slightly grittier than canon, with some fun esoteric eldritch stuff mixed in), and the writing style (I'm incredibly fond of the slightly twisted film noir-style "She walked in, legs up to the bottom of her torso, and smiled that dangerous smile that she knew would make me do anything - like singing Daisy as she slowly crucio-ed my brains out" way of writing.)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Practically Not A Potterverse Fanfic:

- Alexandra Quick: linkffn(3964606)\\
  A fic series set in an OC American magic school, with all-OC characters, that only really uses Potterverse /magic/ to tell its own story. About as far away from canon as you can get while still recognizably being a fanfic.

- Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)\\
  This one expands on Potterverse background lore so much, and puts so much worldbuilding on top of canon, that it /feels/ like an entirely different series - despite the fact that the author went out of their way to keep all the lore-expansions from conflicting with anything in canon. It helps that they also avoid the "stations of canon" like the plague.

Practically Canon:

- Not From Others: linkffn(11419408)\\
  Deathly Hallows from Ginny's POV. Honestly, I think this one /should/ be canon, it does so much for the events from Book 7 and particularly the relationship between Harry and Ginny.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.
