Fics like linkffn(Delenda Est; Timely Errors; Throwing Out the Script by Formulaic).

Preferably Harry is as old as characters like Snape, James, Lily, etc.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

** Timely Errors might just be the best of the bunch. I don't know of any that surpass that one.

** I didn't realize the Marauders were all baseball pitchers, or that whole fanfictions were based on their Earned Run Averages. That particular statistic is depended upon a bit too heavily in modern baseball (in my opinion), but this is still pretty cool to find out.

It seems unlikely that this is what you are asking for, but I can't see any other reason you would capitalize ERA like that.

So, here is the best req I could find for you: linkffn(1742286). It has Marauders and baseball, but no statistical analysis sorry.

EDIT: Ok I felt like a jerk after my "hilarious" comment so I found a real req. linkffn(2386991). Enjoy.

*** Thanks! "Era" was capitalized as I was attempting to emphasize that I don't really care for fics focusing on the Marauders themselves, but rather, fics where Harry travels to their time.

Often, "Marauders Era" is synonymous with "Marauder-centric", something I was trying to avoid.

I can see why it might not make sense, though.
