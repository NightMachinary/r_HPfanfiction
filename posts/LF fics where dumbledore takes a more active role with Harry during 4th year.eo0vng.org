  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

  I could speak for hours about my rotten luck, about how many times I've been close to death. But luck is relative and some would say I am, in fact, extremely lucky. I would have disrespectfully disagreed. That was before I met fair Miss Delacour though; well even for a bit after I met her if I am honest. Follow me trough a year of adventure and discovery, in more than one way.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
