** Linkao3(Dead Man Walking by Cywscross) is a pretty well done fic with Regulus as the protagonist. Although like many of her works it isn't exactly complete... or frequently updated.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** linkffn(8895954)

Regulus does some pretty damn cool stuff in this one. He's not the only protagonist.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** If you don't mind a self plug, Regulus surviving and being part of Harry's horcrux journey is a huge part of this series. It's not purely Regulus centric but he is a big part of it. linkao3(11914698)

** linkao3(5986366) is a marauders-era time travel fic with Harry and Regulus as the main characters. Not completed yet but it's updated semi-regularly and its a pretty good read.
