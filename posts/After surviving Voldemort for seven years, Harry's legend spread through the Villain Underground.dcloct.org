Naturally, other vilains want to take a crack at him, so now every Halloween, Michael Myers try to kill him, every Friday the 13th he is visited by Jason Voorhees and every night, he is chased in his dreams by Freddy Krueger.

Any other horror movie villain (Chucky, Leather face, Candy man, Ghostface, etc.) could join in on the fun, with bragging rights, for the one succeeding in making "The Boy-Who-Lived" into "The Boy-Who-Died", at their local bar.


** Harry woke up with yawn, sleep not being as restful as he'd have hoped. He'd had a weird dream last night, a burned man with claws that wore a sweater even Molly would blanche at, had tried to kill him. It seemed rather random, having no idea what could've prompted his subconscious to summon such a bizarre dream assailant. Still, he wasn't a 5th year anymore and his occlumency skills let him metaphorically bitchslap the errant dream. Harry had left the strange being locked in a classroom listening to Prof. Binns's lecture on the 4th Goblin Rebelllion before he'd finally settled to a restful sleep.

As Harry came downstairs he noticed Lily playing with that horrid doll. Apparently, the animation charms on some poor kid's toy was acting up. The blasted thing had come at him with a knife of all things. Stunning the malfunctioning toy, he'd brought it home with the intention of giving it to Hagrid, his pets were always needing new toys. Shuddering, Harry thought briefly of Norbert's teddy bear. Kneeling down to the little girl, Harry reached out for the doll, "Now Lily, that's not yours. That's Uncle Hagrids."

Lily clutched the doll tightly in a hug, "No! My Uncle Ron!"

Harry blinked. Now that it was pointed out, the doll did have a certain resemblance to Ron. Maybe she could keep it. "Well... we'll see."

Lily squealed taking this for a yes and ran off with the doll. Harry noticed the doll over Lily's shoulder, if he didn't know any better he'd say there was an expression of panic on the thing's face.

** Harry had absolutely /had it/ with the odd muggles that tried to ambush him. Honestly, this midget on a tricycle was the worst. He had woken up chained to a /loo/ of all things. There was a hacksaw nearby, and apparently the only way to escape was to saw off his arm. He scoffed and used a wandless unlocking charm. As if he'd never been kidnapped before. He rolled his eyes. A muggle telly was on the other side of the decrepit bathroom, and it showed the idiot in the mask that tried to kidnap him.

"That's not how the game works!" The man yelled. Harry smirked. He apparated into the room where the man was sitting. Another quick spell saw the man bound.

He had Hermione look into urban legends after a nearly disastrous camping trip ended with them being chased by a wanker with a machete, and she had found a few interesting things. A search on the internet, a marvelous muggle invention, and judicious use of his inheritance had seen him the owner of a puzzle box. It was meant to punish evildoers, and after that idiot in a ghost costume had terrified them at Albus' first birthday, he had decided to fight fire with fire as it will.Sure enough, the contents of his pockets were nearby. He grabbed his wand, and summoned the mokeskin pouch. He reached into the pouch and summoned the puzzle box. It floated in midair. Its presence seemed to make the shadows lengthen, and the lights dim.

"Tell me, do you want to play a game?" Harry asked his captor, With a wave of his wand, and an ominous click, the spell designed to solve the lament configuration activated. It wouldn't be the first time he summoned the powers contained within, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. As the creatures contained within the box appeared and dragged the muggle off to its macabre doom, Harry fought back a shiver of cold pleasure, and he gave a grin that was all sharp teeth. These killers needed to die after all. For the greater good of his family.

** "I don't understand..." Ghostface stared in dismay at the cooling corpse of the Wizarding World's Chosen One lying facedown in the grass of the Burrow's yard. For once, the expression on his mask matched his true face perfectly. "Who could have done this? Who finally got him?!"

There was a horrible grinding noise as Leatherface's chainsaw finally ran out of gas. The crowd of killers and monsters shifted uneasily. Jason Vorhees scratched his head with his machete. A few peels of dead skin fell off the Look-See into the pattern of a skull - Final Destination's Death had been eager for a crack at what this universe's Death hadn't been able to kill. Nosferatu and Amanda Young exchanged worried glances.

"Wait..." said Damien Thorn, slowly. "What day is it?"

"Thursday," said Patrick Bateman, checking out his reflection in one of the Mayflower mirrors he'd brought along. The reflection winked and smile back.

"No, you idiots," snarled the Leprechaun, who was very sensitive about passing holidays unnoticed. "It's the third Thursday in November! And that means-"

"Sorry about gobblin' your kill, cluckolds," came a smug voice from inside the Burrow, where the last of the Weasleys had been dispatched by their own Thanksgiving dinner. Turkie, the demonic turkey animated by an ancient Native American shaman, strutted into view. "At least now we know who's got the good stuff-ing, huh?"

But even the killer turkey's legendary bravado quailed at the rage expressed in the visages of the most deadly killers in the multiverse.

"You know, it's not my usual fare," said Hannibal Lecter thoughtfully, "but I think I could adapt one of my recipes for... the other white meat."

Chuckles, growls, and giggles of appreciation and anticipation were heard as the crowd closed in on the unfortunate bird.

The end...?
