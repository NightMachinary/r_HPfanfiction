Basically looking for any story with different magic systems from canon. It doesn't have to be complete, or even good, as long as the system is notably different. Or where Hogwarts is more modern like... linkffn(10730005). Really anything goes, though I'd have a strong preference for stories that focus on the magic itself. :D

  In 1727 the Prime Minister Robert Walpole appointed a squib named Sir Isaac Newton as the new Headmaster of Hogwarts. By the time Harry Potter arrived there in 1996 the curriculum had changed a bit.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** Off FF.net, [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] takes place in a non-magical AU patterned after the /James Bond/ films and /The Secret World of Alex Mack/ (though not a crossover), with magic replaced with skill and superscience of the sort you see in those franchises.

"Harworts" is a boarding school for spies, commandos, analysts, handlers, hackers, and other personnel for United Kingdom's tumultuous intelligence community; noble families like "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants" send their children there, but some commoner children --- like Hermione --- who distinguish themselves in cunning and/or violence at young age also get an invitation.

Half the fun is how the author "maps" the elements of Potterverse onto this new setting.

** linkffn(8629685) It's kind of a different system? Tbh, it's more like the magical people themselves are inherently different (1st chapter so no spoiler). No offense, but a story that fits this perfectly is [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/]] the main character is kind of similar to Harry.

**** Ah, I just thought recommending a non-fanfic was a faux pas since I'm new to this subreddit. You're welcome, hope you enjoy it.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
