*** To your time turner question: As far as I understand it, a time turner “loops” back time, so if I travel back 1 hour , then there are two of me. Me 1 (the me from the future) and Me 2 (past me). Me1 will do whatever I traveled backed in time for, while Me2 will do whatever I did 1 hour ago. When the hour is up, Me2 will travel back in time 1 hour while I stay, effectively becoming Me1 in the “loop”.

**** Thanks for explaining. I thought it was something like that, since the HP concept of time travel was used as a closed loop in PoA.

It was the multiple alternate timelines in Cursed Child that messed me up, because they use a whole different system of time travel.

*** I think this is the right answer. Polyjuice must be reapplied every hour, so at that reapplication, the person is renewed back to the original and that original was not pregnant.

** I'd like to believe that the transformation would freeze itself until, at the bare minimum, the child was born. It would probably draw on your magic and ensure that you can't change back essentially making you a pregnant squib until you give birth.

There are other explanations i've seen in a few one-shot fics where the change becomes permanent and you're forever stuck as a twin of the person you polyjuice'd into.

Then again the easiest explanation is that pregnancy simply wouldn't be possible because magic would prevent it.

** It'd be pretty horrific if a woman polyjuiced into another woman had sex in that guise, became pregnant (as in the egg fusing with spermatozoa) in that one hour time-limit... and remained /stuck/ that way until she carried the baby to term or it died/was aborted.

The moment it's out of her womb, she reverts.

Now, whether the child would look like a mix of her natural self and the father or that of the witch she'd impersonated is another matter.

Same deal with a male-polyjuiced-as-a-male: would the father's features be that of the guise or that of the user's true form?

As you can imagine, the above could lead to some /very/ disturbing plot bunnies.

** Hmm...does the Polyjuice Potion change someone inside-and-out? Or is it only a cosmetic change? It's pointed out in the books that someone's voice doesn't change under the potion, neither does their mind, so implicitly internal organs/tissue like the brain, vocal chords, etc, don't change.

So, if we assume that that holds, and a polyjuiced person's sexual organs are only changed on the outside...nothing? A male polyjuiced into a female still wouldn't have the egg cells, a female polyjuiced into a male wouldn't have a proper 'access point' for sperm to reach her eggs, and presumably a female polyjuiced into another female would still have the same DNA on the inside.

Alternatively, if you don't find that interesting, you could say that once sperm and egg meet and a zygote is formed, polyjuice wearing off results in the zygote's DNA radically warping, resulting in the baby mutating into some kind of ginormous chest-bursting tentacle monster.

The voice absolutely changes. How would Crouch Jr. trick everybody, even his friend Dumbledore, into thinking he's Moody, if he still had his voice?

It was just a visual convention for the movies, same as milky eyes under Imperius, which does not happen in the books.

** It requires a bit of the person's DNA, and based on what we see in the books I'd say it's a full on change. If it's a woman polyjuicing into another woman I guess you could say the DNA of the zygote changed back with the rest of the person. Or that it doesn't. If it was a man to a woman, I'd say the pregnancy disappears with the uterus...

** If you're talking about someone who already has a uterus polyjuiced into someone else, presumably the fertilized egg would change back with the rest of them, unless the changes are permanent past a certain stage if the polyjuice is taken regularly.

If you're talking about someone without a uterus/eggs who gained them through the use of polyjuice, it depends on how long they were using the polyjuice and how you decide the magic works. Just an hour? Nothing, because implantation into the uterine wall doesn't occur until 5-10 days after conception. Without that stage, it's unlikely anything would come of a fertilized egg, even assuming it didn't vanish once the polyjuice wore off. If you're asking about something longer term, like someone who was taking the polyjuice regularly for months (even sleeping, somehow), then it all depends on how you think the magic would act. Maybe it's a messy disaster, the fetus getting pulped during the reversion. Maybe the polyjuice can't wear off until the baby is born, or the unborn child reacts to the impending change by using accidental magic to make the change permanent. Maybe magic somehow allows the baby to remain viable outside of a uterus. Ultimately, the decision is up to writer.

Although I wouldn't put it past JKR to weigh in on this if she hears of it, so...

** Hah, polyjuice isn't the fun case: What did poor Teddy Lupin have to go through in his mother's womb?

The traditional answer to this is form locking, where pregnancy temporarily or permeantly locks form into the pregnant form. Usually justified by magic (the spell or the mothers) acting to protect the unborn.

A less used answer is the baby shifts with the mother. This is more common for animal transfigurations.

A third, relatively uncommon approach is to 'pause' the pregnancy until a future transformation back into the mothers body. This is usually for transformations with only two forms. (Animagius, Ramba genderswap like situation)

A (generally unused) other option would be for the shift to terminate the pregnancy. Likely with no noticable consequences for an new conception, but negative effects for the transformee if the baby is big enough to cause a problem if suddenly without a womb.
