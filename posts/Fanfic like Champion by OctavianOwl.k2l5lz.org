Hi, the summary of Champion by OctavianOwl is exactly the kind of fanfic I'm looking for and I really want to read it, but as it was deleted from the internet (believe me, I searched ðŸ˜…) would anyone know a similar fanfic? Thanks in advance!


** Just in case you also want to read Champion by OctaviusOwl itself and not just similar fics:

As usual, the sayings "the internet never forgets" and "once it is on the internet, you can't ever delete it" hold true.

** The summary for those that don't want to search for it: Voldemort won the war. Harry Evans attends Hogwarts where discrimination is rampant. Voldemort rules Britain but a Resistance movement is fighting back. No one knows much about them for sure, except for their name: The Marauders. Fourth Year. TriWizard Tournament. AU.

**** Is he Harry "Evans" because Tommie won't allow half-bloods other than himself to hold pureblood names or because he's hiding from being found out as a Potter?

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying. Very AU. Hunger Games inspired.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
