Looking for a fic where Hogwarts is actually a nigh impenetrable fortress.\\
Basically when death eaters show up, they actually had to prepare, make battle plans, make massive preparations, spend time and skilled people unraveling wards and paying in blood for every inch of the land they took, and not a lame theater performance.\\
Here is an idea: shields that take weeks to take down, towers that shoot spells at attackers and endless supply of auto-transfigured stone warriors.


** I suspect it would help if the defenders fought from inside the castle rather than out on the lawn like +idiots+ canon.

**** To be fair, the Dothraki wouldn't have been particularly effective inside the walls. If they'd fought like the light cavalry they were rather than trying to pretend they were heavy cavalry, they could have done some serious damage to the wights. There's some argument to be made that the version of Winterfell portrayed in the show was too small to hold the defenders' forces, but even just keeping them in the baileys as reserves to reinforce the walls rather than outside would have been smarter.

***** The dothraki would have been most effective spending all their energy foraging the countryside in the days before the dead arrived.

I have no idea why the dead bothered with an assault, they have waited 8000 years for this, have an army that only replenishes, is alert 24/7 and requires no sustenance, just lay siege and wait them out.

********* Things like the Battle of Blackwater were amazing episodes, but most people will tell you GoT peaked when the majority of episodes consisted of people sitting in the small council offices talking about things. One of the few things people agree was good about S8 was when Brienne was knighted.

Sure a climatic assault on the castle will look good, but style of substance is what killed the show.

***** I have seen some reworks on YouTube where they fortified the whole open area around Winterfell by placing lots and fallen trees and digging trenches to impede movement of zombie hordes, also using Dothraki in hit/run attacks on their flanks and setting the whole forest on fire for improved visibility.

** I liked the description of the siege in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14281440]]) - chapter 77 in the second work. The siege is over fairly quickly but the opposing sides do make use of magic artillery, tunnelling spiders and animated constructs.
