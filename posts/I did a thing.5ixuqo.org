So, I have been super frustrated with the lack of F/F pairings.

In resolution to my dilema, I decided to make my own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12276429/1/A-Soul-in-Need]]

Here is the link if anybody would like to read. I'm two chapters in thus far, and hope to make a decently long fic. (50,000-70,000 words ideally, but that's a hope.)

My goal is to capture what a lesbian relationship is actually like, but within the Harry Potter universe. Also: Genderbent characters are cool.

I'm a super new writer, so please deliver any criticism as nicely as you can? Suggestions for the story are welcome too.

All in all, I just hope to make something people can enjoy without toooo many complaints.

Thanks.


** Alright so two main concerns of mine, I'll start with a bit of a Brit-pick, the golden trio would not refer to Malfoy as Draco to their face, especially as enemies. They would call them Malfoy. Secondly, I'm not sure why you're writing a F/F, genderbending a male character, keeping their name but exclusively referring to them as a new middle name.

I would also encourage you to increase the length of your chapters generally, but that's only if you're comfortable doing that. I feel like there is a lot more you could expand upon, fill in blanks if there's differences in the timeline from Canon, etc. Best of luck in future chapters, though, not intending to be attacking, just not sure I understand.

Edit:. I'm on my phone, so I'm not conveying my question very well, I'm cool with a gender bent character, I'm just not sure I understand the alternating between Draco and Dres seemingly at random. I mean at that point you might as well make it Hr/Pansy and you'd have the same set up. Slytherin who hates muggles/muggle born, in a rival position, etc.

** Two (and a half) things I noticed in chapter 1:

Draco is referred to as Dresia. I get that you want to genderbend him, which is alright. But don't refer to her with her middle name. Rewrite her name into, maybe, Dresia Draco (would be the easiest solution, as you could just keep the rest of your work almost unaltered)? Or make it Draconia Druella - Draca? I don't know, but referring to her middle name is kinda weird.

Hermione Granger referring to Harry, Ron and herself as "The Golden Trio". You write in her thought, or at least use her perspective for exposition. Hermione would /never/ use this term (not to mention that it is a completely fan-invented term with only referential roots in canon, much like "Leader of the Light" is). I'd advise a rewrite of that part of the last paragrpah of chapter 1.

Just a pet peeve of mine: Characters who sneer a lot. Draco does it almost every time you describe her facial expression.

To chapter 2:

Yeah, get rid of the term "Golden Trio". It made no sense in Hermione's perspective and makes no sense in Draco's. In the scene when Draco's Mark is seen, maybe use "Potter's cronies" as a better term?

And if Hermione remembers seeing Draco leave the Hall and following her, with only black in her mind after it, wouldn't she be able to conclude that she had been obliviated? If yes, I'd add that conclusion to Hermione's written thought process.

Anyway, I like it so far. I'll follow it and hope you continue with it.

*** These are really great suggestions, and I appreciate it!

I think I'll go back and edit Draco's name to make a bit more sense, because you're right about it seeming a bit off.

I meant to use the reference to them as the "Golden Trio" in a more sarcastic manner, but editing it out may be the best bet here.

Again, really appreciated!

** I despise genderbends, so I can give you no feedback on the fic, but one tip I do have is that "I did a thing" is not the way to grab people's attentions on the /r/.

Don't worry about putting detail into the title of the thread: say what kind of "thing" it is to grab people's attention.
