1) Harry and Tom are mates. Harry spends his summer partying & making out(sex maybe) with his new muggle friends. Tom comes to his house or maybe they meet in cafe first but ultimately they end up in his room. After couple of days talking they become friends I guess. Tom knows that he is Harry's mate. But Harry doesn't. Tom can see his memory or live his memory (feelings). He gets jealous seeing Harry with other people but can't do anything about it. Later Harry finds out and gets mad. More like hurt thinking Tom doesn't want that why he didn't told him. To get back at he decides to seduce Draco and Snape (who is Draco's godfather). Tomarry eventually get together.

2) The only thing I remember is somehow Harry and Voldemort end up staying in a hotel room together. Or Harry is staying there and Voldemort visits him regularly. I think Harry runs away or maybe he contacted Voldemort first. Malfoy are involved somehow maybe because of finding hotel for Harry to stay or something. I'm not sure. I think they did that so order don't find him. Or maybe it was ministry. Or could be both.

Both of them are post GOF but I'm not sure if they're post Order of the Phoenix. But they could be I'm just not sure.
