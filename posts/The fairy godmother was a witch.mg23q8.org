Ok, an idea just came to mind. The fairy godmother in Cinderella was a witch from the Harry Potter universe. Think about it! The fairy godmother waved a wand and did transfiguration magic on the shoes, the pumpkin, the mice, the dress, and the horse. And the wand, it was so white and sparkling. So unicorn hair core, white oak wood, and it looked short so 7 inches? The midnight time-limit was because that's only as long as the spells could hold. Maybe Cinderella's father was a squib or Cinderella's mother was a witch too.
