Anything that's rather long (or completed) and without slash. I need something that'll feed my soul for now. I've been living off Dark fanfics and those are all well and good, but I'm looking for a somewhat shift in tone. Preferably Harry-centric and nothing of the typical titles like Circular Reasoning, A Cadmean Victory, The Nightmare Man, etc. which means that I'm looking for something 'original.'

*sigh

This is probably too much to ask. If that's the case, then just something. Anything. Please.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.

*** I've just read it. The author clearly hasn't finished the story, but with the cliffhanger in the last chapter, it has a decent ending in my opinion. It is quite easy to speculate what the rest of the story would be like, were the author to finish the story.
