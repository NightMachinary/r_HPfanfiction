There are fics that top your shortlist when someone asks for "good stories for a roadtrip", but there are also fics that make you laugh when someone calls them "good", and fics that, when you see other people recommend them to first-time fanfic readers, you immediately want to anti-recommend them for various reasons that aren't just "stop liking what I don't like".

.

Some examples are:

- *HPMOR*, for featuring Rapist Draco (why?), Trollnicorn Hermione (WHY??), "Hilarious" Harry that makes all the characters in the story chortle at his cutting wit, but creates dissonance in the readers when nothing he says is remotely humorous. It's also written by an author who wants to "deconstruct" fandom tropes and critique JKR's illogical worldbuilding, without having read the entire series. This lends itself to a strange reading experience when every character is either deliberately written to be OOC (Harry, Draco, Petunia Evans-Verres) or narratively irrelevant (McGonagall, Ron). I have seen this one recommended in the HP fanfic starter pack in the main sub... and this isn't a good fic for new readers, at all.

- *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.* Leaving aside the x-treme gory content of the actual fic, the author is a certified creep and manipulative cult leader. "He uses a lot of pseudonyms and sockpuppets, convinces some of his fans to move in with him, claims to mind-meld with fictional characters, insists his fanfiction is better than Harry Potter itself, and has questionable views on women. Oh, and he was involved in a triple homicide and used the girl's death for fun and profit." [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/][Source.]]

- *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.* Behind the cheesy premise of the Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived Indy!Harry repeating his past life to get back at his arrogant twin brother, with cool fights and magical worldbuilding, there's a haremfic that centers on an adult man grooming pre-pubescent girls to be his sister-wives. To be clear, there's nothing explicit, but the tone of this fic, and the narrative rewarding Harry for using his foreknowledge to collect (read: /manipulate/) a harem of "Harry's girls" is incredibly uncomfortable, as the girls are essentially recruited into being his child soldiers and their character motivations boil down to "helping Harry". And it's just gross when you have a 12-year-old Luna commenting on how she can't wait until she's developed enough to have sex with a grown man.

Tl;dr - fics that give you a kneejerk reaction when people recommend them. Not just for the fact that the content isn't to your taste (eg, slash, genderbends, muggle AU, mugglewank), but because you have a legitimate or moral reason not to read them, and not to want other people to read them.


** Ugh, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. I've seen this rec'ed so many times as a "good" harem that my curiosity won and I decided to check it out. Not that I'm going to read those anyway, but at least in your usual harem Harry is the same age as the girls. DPaSW is about an adult man grooming kids.

*** I've tried three times to read it and always give up around 3 chapters in, when Harry negotiates with a father to arrange a marriage with the father's 11 year old, then the father lets Harry go off on his own with said 11 year old. It still boggles my mind that the author kept writing after that without it delving into creepy, weird smut.

*** I enjoy DPaSW, but I enjoy it in spite of the harem elements rather than because of them. The worldbuilding is really interesting, and it plays with a lot of tropes in interesting ways. It's one of the only fics I've read with a manipulative/evil Dumbledore who isn't just bashed nonstop and is an actual, threatening antagonist. I like the deviation from standard time-travelling tropes by having the MC try and avoid "preserving the timeline" while at the same time, there's another time-traveller who wants to do just that.

** */Black Queen Series/*

Right, so, look. I've complained about this series [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cmr198/lf_fem_harry_fics/ew4w89v/?context=3][at length]] before, and have brought up what about it irks me, but I'm just going to reinforce that here. It is a fic that, if it had been written with nuance or an understanding of its content (child sexual assault and child prostitution, to begin with) it would be, in my own opinion, a /good/ story. It has everything I wanted in a vent-fic for myself, I could relate to it, but it falls apart so fucking quickly. It fundamentally misunderstands what it's like to be a victim of childhood sexual abuse, it fundamentally misunderstands the circumstances in which kids become prostitutes (it's never voluntarily) and it fundamentally does not understand how to characterize a victim of this sort of abuse who has been using dark magic to feel safe, trained by an amoral witch.

It's just /wrong/ in so many ways, it misses how it could've been a gritty story about a girl coping in the worst ways and Dumbledore just /not/ understanding what she's gone through. Everyone heals differently, yes, but for the life of me I will never forgive the series for starting out with a character I could, potentially, relate to, only to then show me someone who is entirely at-odds with her past and has been wildly mischaracterized as a consequence of the author not doing their research about sexual abuse survivors.

It had everything going for it, had the chance to be what I think would be a great exploration of the darker side of healing, and throws it all away because, in the end, the author couldn't cope with having a genuinely weak or emotional character and had to make one that, instead, took the idiom "own your fears" literally and ended up with a childhood sexual assault victim owning a goddamn child brothel.

Ugh.

*** All according to plan is the fic the Black Queen series wants to be instead of the edgy trainwreck it is. You still have a raped MC, but instead of "Oh hi Narcissa, remember when you bought me as child prosititute" it handles the subject reasonably well (the reason the MC made a pact with "the devil"). A significantly better "dark magic" approach as well, not just some grimdark shit for the sake of having that.

It is tagged Harry/Hermione, but as far as I have gotten (Chapter 33/35), it has Harry and Hermione crushing on people of their own sex.

*** (in response to your other rant) Try antithesis, not exactly what you want, and at first it reads like another edgy wrong boy who lived fic, but after a few chapters it starts going deep into how psychologically FUCKED Adrian/Harry is, it sort of dives into dark magic addiction, while all the while Adrian who is relatively strong(above average) is so throughly convinced that he's weak and useless allowed himself to be convinced and manipulated. (SPOILERS) and the most absolutely fucked up part is, that literally all the pain and sadness he goes through could literally have been avoided if his parents noticed him more.

Besides, it's pretty normal for 11 year olds to sometimes say horrible things that they'd never really do and don't really mean. I do remember when I was around that old, a friend told me like "I hope you die", then I was mad at him for the rest of the day, and the next day it was like it never happened.

Still, unlike that guy Draco is not YET a rapist - and most likely (but not 100% sure!), despite what he says, he wouldn't rape anybody even if he could. Treating him like it's a done deal will only push him down that road faster - which is very counterproductive for the students' safety.

Remember, though, if all we saw was how Harry reacted - he could be wrong, and he absolutely could be missing things, as you say. That's just inherent in the attempt to write a consistent character; they have flaws. Given that Harry, in his social ineptitude, was probably never going to handle her fears sensitively, how would you propose that the story address them?

***** Hermione's reaction was understandable and normal, and it's reasonable for her to stay away from Draco, but insofar as she thought Harry should do the same, it was also a product of narrow thinking. Based on her own upbringing, she was neatly categorising people into good and evil based on whether they do what she would do. And it's not that her moral compass was a bad one; she's quite possibly the most stalwart and incorruptible character in the whole story. It's just that she held everyone to the same standard, /even when their childhood experiences and education were the ethical polar opposite of hers/. As Harry pointed out, it would have required a supernatural intervention for Draco to have her morality, given his environment.

So, Hermione's view that Draco is irredeemably evil and not worth spending time on - that is bigoted. And Harry doesn't resent her view, but he finds it upsetting that she would write people off so easily. His own experience is that Draco responds very well in a setting where ethics are actually taught.

His motivations are pretty clearly laid out: he considers what he has just heard to be an abomination, a sign of a thoroughly corrupt system, and he intends to tear that system down. However you choose to apportion the blame for that system, surely not much of it belongs on the shoulders of an eleven-year-old with no broader life experience.

Incidentally, Harry's other motivation for claiming he wanted to marry Luna was so that Draco would back off from her. And he was pretending to be casual because he had just found out that a thoroughly corrupt court system could easily be aimed at him if he caused trouble.

You can dislike the character, the writing, and the author, but to suggest that the story shrugs its shoulders at rape is to grossly misrepresent it.

"It would have required a supernatural intervention for him to have your morality given his environment."

This is an eleven year old raised by a /Death Eater/. Someone who sincerely believes that non-magical people are merely dirt-scratching apes, who considers torture and murder to be both recreational and morally praiseworthy, but who loves his wife and son. Draco has been taught that magic makes him special and superior, and he's lived in a mansion that would make such claims easy to believe.

  "Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I'd be in trouble," Draco answered smugly. "Since I am a Malfoy... Father has the votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess not easily, since you are the Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is pretty good at that sort of thing."

SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, rape was actually illegal then, too. Rape has been considered one of the most awful and inhumane crimes possible to commit for all of recorded history. This hasn't prevented it from happening, because some people are horrible. Nevertheless, society as a whole condemns rape and always has. Yudkowsky conveniently pretends this is not the case.

I'll note as an aside here that Luna isn't a Muggleborn, nor is she even so much as a 'blood traitor' like the Weasleys. The only thing she's guilty of is printing an nonsense story in a nonsense paper. Also Malfoy doesn't feel this way in canon, so this is just Yudkowsky coming up with stuff to create a masturbatory scenario in which it's everyone else's fault that they're not as enlightened as his self-insert, so obviously they're all rapists waiting to be cured by his magical brain. Not that I can really blame him for not knowing that - it only really becomes relevant in the last two books, which Yudkowsky didn't read before crapping out his fanfic.

It has /always/ been condemned. It has /never/ been treated as something to aspire to or something that one is entitled to, at least society-wide. There were certainly shitheel families and at times even organizations that did indeed rape as a matter of course, but never a society.

The entire philosophy espoused is about thinking Muggles and Muggleborns are lesser, not fellow purebloods.

No space after the exclamation point.

He could easily have done so without the kid who gleefully discusses the legal intricacies that come with avoiding rape to his new friends. In fact, I'd argue that he has a moral duty to do so.

Playing along with a rapist-in-training is a /bad/ thing to do.

Malfoy even gives him a graceful out! He says that he's sure that Harry's parents have taught him that rape is wrong. He's /suspicious/ that Harry might not be okay with casual rape. Harry /hastily reassures him that he's not./ He could easily have just said that he's not comfortable with that. Malfoy literally admits that the fact that Luna is a child means that Harry's assumed-to-be-serious death threat is much less appropriate. Harry could have ducked out there.

Malfoy advocating rape is his own fault and his own responsibility. It is a problem that comes solely from the mind of the author, just so he could wank himself silly about "muh subjective morality!"

"There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly. "There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and -"

"Stop," she said.

"- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione, the way people are built to /feel/ inside -" Harry put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see their /friends/ hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't /learn/ otherwise. So, no, it does /not/ indicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"

"If you believe that," she said with her voice unsteady, "if you /can/ believe that, then you're evil. People are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter what anyone /tells/ you to do, you're the one who does it. Everyone knows that -"

"/No they don't!/ You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something /everyone knows/ the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was rising. "Do you think you're, you're just /genetically/ better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd realize /all on your own/ that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd /finish/ realizing all that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever /told/ Draco he was personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up in. And /despite that/, it only took him four months to get to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building." Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him.

This after Malfoy describes in detail exactly how much they could hurt Luna during the rape and get away with it.

No, Malfoy has a developed sense of right and wrong (he even notes that there's no chance someone would believe that Harry and Malfoy raped her together), and knows that Harry's parents would have told him that it was wrong, showing that he understands a value system where rape is wrong. He claims that you are either a Slytherin or a Hufflepuff, and that were Harry to give himself fully over to Malfoy's side, he could 'get away with' things even Malfoy himself couldn't.

Harry literally considers murdering every blood purist like the French Revolution, only deciding not to based off a vague recollection that something didn't work out so well in the end on that count.

  Now, the observation Harry makes in this situation is that draco is just a kid, spouting off things he's heard his dad's cool friends say without understanding the depth of his words at ALL.
#+end_quote

Not quite. It's not that Harry doesn't think Draco is serious. He just doesn't think it's ultimately Draco's /fault/. Because if you look through history, you'll find that whenever there is an upper class of society that is largely immune to prosecution, it becomes /normal/ for members of that class to rape and otherwise pillage the other social classes. Harry doesn't condone it at all, he just recognises that Draco is a product of his environment - "exactly what you'd expect an 11-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father." And he makes plans to turn Draco to the light side.

*** HPMoR has rapist /pureblood society/. And the comments from several people, suggesting that Harry brushes it off, are deeply misleading and in flat contradiction to the chapter where it's brought up, as well as further developments in the story. He is stunned and /horrified/ to discover Draco's attitude, and immediately starts making plans to change things. I recommend actually reading [[http://HPMoR.com/chapter/7]] and seeing for yourself, but here's a summary:

- Harry's initial reaction to Draco's announcement of intent to rape is, he's so shocked that he chokes on his drink and spends several seconds coughing.
- When he recovers and realises that Draco is serious, he decides that this is the natural result of Draco having been raised by, basically, Darth Vader.
- Questioning Draco further, he learns that the purebloods basically own the court system, there's no DNA testing, and memories can be modified to support the case the purebloods want to make. This gives Harry a cold chill and he decides that he needs to overthrow the government as soon as possible (hyperbole, but also a bit serious).
- Draco confirms that if Harry spoke out, those same forces would turn on him and destroy him.
- Harry makes excuses for having started the conversation, while thinking "I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms."
- As a way of getting Luna off the hook, Harry indicates a desire to get revenge on her by someday marrying her, instead of Draco's rape plan. Draco thinks he's crazy, but agrees to back off.
- Harry reflects on how Draco's behaviour has actually been depressingly normal for far too much of human history; it doesn't take a psychopath, it just takes the wrong kind of social norms. He isn't sure whether the French Revolution approach of guillotining all the leaders could be made to work out better this time than it did in France, but he certainly intends to do /something/. And he starts by introducing Draco to the fact that Muggles aren't as backward as Draco had assumed.

It gave Harry unbelievable godmode way too quickly. I had to stop reading at chapter 60 because there was simply no way Harry could possibly have any sort of real conflict with Voldemort that went beyond "Fuck you voldie you're dead now". Seriously, there's no reason for Harry to be as strong and skilled as fucking Merlin, master wandless magic, master oclomency to the point he made a mindscape to pull friends in and time dialate to give them time to practice magic, have mastery over mage sight, able to heal any wound, and able to alter his body however he wants, all before he even shows up for his first year at Hogwarts.

** Anything written by JacobApples. He has interesting outlines and generally decent writing, but he shoehorns a rather poor Draco and/or Snape redemption into all of his fics. I am the first to admit that I don't like those characters, but their "redemption" is not even done in the interesting way where something gets them to change on their own. Instead, it almost always seems as if Harry makes it his mission to fix them or is unreasonably nice to them for some reason and that suddenly makes all the difference (which I do not like because it implies the blame for their shitty behaviour on Harry).

I don't agree, since I think it's a peripheral issue at best and Draco and Snape in his fics are usually consistent with canon and reasonable, at least for me. The redemption plots make sense and they avoid the Draco in Leather Pants cliche. There's a journey from point A to B for them, even if it's very short, but then again that's JacobApples.

Even if you take away their membership in the magical Nazis and all the crimes they commit along the way, neither was a pleasant person. Snape was a petty dick to Harry (and Neville) and Draco was calling for racial purges at 12 and only got worse afterwards, just ask Hagrid. They were not someone you'd take on a pub crawl. And Jacob takes that away and implies that it was all avoidable if Harry put more effort into his relationship with them. Which is victim-blaming IMO.

If you want a decent Draco, have something that gets him thinking why that Mudblood aced all exams after the first year and go from there. Snape would be more difficult because he has plenty of opportunities to take a different path when Lily begs him to reconsider his shady friends and he rejects them all, so using that as divergence would be way OOC.

In canon HP Snape didn't sabotage anyone's education (apart from Harry and Neville, dropped vial and testing the potion on Trevor, doesn't excuse him from being an all around douche though), he gave fair grades or Hermione wouldn't be able to get an O on her OWLs, or be considered very good at schoolwork if she didn't score high consistently on his exams. As to limiting the numbers of Healers and Aurors, well... that's fanon.

In other words, they argued that they were not part of the Death Eaters at any point, and were merely being controlled by the true Death Eaters.

*************** Yes and no. What you say is true, but it has no relevance on the discussion I had with Vonpelt. Our discussion was about canon. In canon the Death Eaters either claimed the Imperius, got off by selling out their comrades or were pardoned, for lack of the better word, by Dumbledore. Neither of those are applicable in a normal, muggle, court of law. This means that magical law must be different (the real reason was that JKR was lazy and just wanted to write a book about magic spells and children).

  In canon it's not, since several Death Eaters escaped punishment, some for claiming the Imperius Curse, others by cooperating (Karkaroff).
#+end_quote

I'm saying that they claimed to /not have joined the Death Eaters,/ and as such escaped punishment. In other words, if you join the Death Eaters, then you have actually done those things, and the only question is whether or not the prosecution can prove you're guilty, not whether or not you're actually guilty. Malfoy, Karkaroff, and Snape are guilty, but escaped punishment.

So we /do/ know that Snape did those things, because he was a Death Eater for some time before turning double agent.

#+end_quote

Not so. Naming names doesn't get you off (or, at least, it's not supposed to) but prosecutors are empowered to make deals for lesser charges or ask judges for lesser sentences. We see that Crouch is empowered to do the same in canon, as he takes the names Karkaroff gives (only one of which is useful) and orders him away so that they can consider lowering his sentence. At that point, Karkaroff names Crouch, Jr. as another Death Eater, and everything goes to shit. It's likely that this commuted a large portion of his sentence, and possibly fucked up everyone that Crouch had convicted to this point (as would happen if a prosecutor's close family member was found to be in the mob, for example).

Criminal informants (as Snape was) can sometimes receive similar deals, and undercover operatives (such as criminals who wear wires in sting operations) are given lighter sentences still in recognition of risking their lives to help the DA. Since Snape's arrangement was similar to the latter, it might have helped. It might have explained why he got off so lightly, especially if there wasn't any hard evidence linking him to a crime.

We see Karkaroff's trial in the book. Karkaroff names names, Crouch says he'll think about a lesser sentence as a result, then Karkaroff names a much higher-profile name. He tries to implicate Snape, but Dumbledore steps up and says that Snape had been acting as his criminal informant/double agent since before Voldemort was defeated.

#+begin_quote
  But it did. Karkaroff went from being an arrested Death Eater to a Headmaster respected in public by Dumbledore and English Ministry of Magic officials.
#+end_quote

We don't have all the details there, but Crouch-acting-as-Moody, at least, treats him with the same suspicion he treats all suspected Death Eaters. It's possible, as I noted, that revealing that the son of the prosecutor was involved in the crime might interfere with their ability to charge him with the crime in question, but that actually is a headcanon. All we know in canon is that he was offered leniency in exchange for naming high-import names, and he names the highest-import name possible, which might have resulted in either a drastically reduced sentence or actual clemency. It's entirely possible that Bulgaria doesn't recognize Magical Britain's conviction. It's also possible that he has the magical equivalent of a tracking anklet and/or a parole officer.

Dumbledore, the Supreme Mugwump, told everyone that Snape had been acting as a double agent. In the trial in GoF, he notes that he'd previously said so to the Wizengamot. It WAS an official thing, we just don't see the part where he makes it official.

#+begin_quote
  At the age of five Harry turns into a snake. Five years later he saves a girl named Hermione.
#+end_quote

Ugg, what can I say about this one.

Well first, It is not actually completed. When the author's life got busy they just uploaded a chapter with future plot points and a epilogue and called it complete.

Two It feels mistagged, Adventure/Friendship it is not. Depressing things often happen like, Hermione gets locked in azkaban for 6 months because the petrifications in second year are blamed on snake Harry.

Three, It makes me understand why people hate fanon slytherin.

Four It doesn't get to the interesting part, The whole story the author is like "Hermione won't know about harry until 4th year" and then 1. does not write 4th year, and 2. Makes fourth year extremely depressing in the plot summary (Hermione Shuns Harry for a year.)

Five The future plots are full of angst. That person you thought betrayed Hermione? Yeah that was Hermione's only true friend... The rest of her "friends" convinced Hermione to kick her out of the group... And what does the once true friend do in retaliation? Irreversibly Binds Hermione's will and sells her into slavery...

All in all, it's a unfinished angst fest that pretends it is a finished adventure story.

** This was way too long of a post, but here's one that I can't in good conscience recommend for ethical reasons, and hurts me when I see it recommended to others who don't know the truth behind the story.

*The Historical Importance of Runic Warding*, one of the most popular Fem!Harry/Voldemort fics on Ao3. Without the genderbend to liven up the premise, it's a bog-standard, circa-2005 Indy!Harry tropefest. Harry inherits the Black Lordship after the events of OotP, discovers she has a creature inheritance, and that she is the soulmate of Voldemort. Who is turned into a cardboard "villain" when he unironically explains that he murders people because the muggles are destroying the environment and muggleborns are diluting /"the olde ways"/.

This would not be out of the ordinary, except for the part when the author is a self-admitted plagiarizer, who gave credit retroactively, and only when called out for it by the author she plagiarized. [[https://i.imgur.com/o4P66Ur.png][Source.]]

Here were the plagiarized parts called out by the other author:

Nocturnememory:

Here's the rest of them:

*Theme: The master soul being referred to as a "home" to the lesser portion belonging to Harry.*

From Nocturnememory:

#+begin_quote
  He wonders how she can place such importance on other people when she has his fucking soul in her chest. How much more of a home can one carve out in another person? How much more of himself---

  How infuriating it is to know the succession of her thoughts, the succession of affection she holds for other people when he---

  How much more of a home could that be?
#+end_quote

From Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  /Now you need to accept us, all we are and are not, and accept that once you made a home in me. Open up your eyes and ears and your nose Harry, your heart and your mind and everything you are, so that I may in turn make a home in you as well./ He told her all this with solemn inevitability, holding the waiting dark in his red right hand.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Harry feels safest in the dark.*

Nocturnememory:

#+begin_quote
  In the cupboard, in the welcoming dark, in the snick of a lock, Harrie presses a wet face into a musty pillow... Harrie learns early that darkness is often safest. That there's nothing to fear as long as that lock stays firmly in place.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  "I've always felt safest in the dark Headmaster, for as long as I can remember. Because when it was dark I was safe from the Dursleys."

  It was a sad but true fact that the only times in her childhood Harry could actually remember feeling truly safe was when she had been locked in that fucking cupboard.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Voldemort uses the soul link to "phantom touch" Harry when she's sleeping.*

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  He scrapes a farewell pass of his teeth over the ticking of Harrie's pulse, wishes it were more than phantom canines against the rising tremor of it.

  Harrie wakes, a phantom brush of a movement, sliding over her hip.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  After the third time waking up sweaty and frustrated from the feel of phantom hands and teeth somehow the distinction didn't make her feel any better.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Innocent young fem!Harry compared to the empty monster Voldemort.* Voldemort is repeatedly described with metaphors and imagery using the terms /darkness, voids, vacuum,/ and /emptiness./

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  And of course, his little girl, that tiny little spot of uneven light and uneven hair; the first time he ever felt anything shift inside his chest, inside any chest at all; whether half full, half empty... Twelve years old and ruining pieces of a man who had been alive for decades, dove into darkness with no thought to his soul or humanity. A boy and a man and eventually a monster; soulless, empty.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote

***** I get what they're complaining about, but the similar nature of the stories leads to some common conclusions. It's obvious that Nocturne has a boatload more style in the prose and anyone reading both would see the artistry in comparison to the duller but more direct language of Runic Warding. It makes me think of all those plays retelling and remaking old Greek stories with their own spin. You can compare the works and call one superior, but they have equal merit as their authors' own work.

****** I'm biased because I also hate this work, I think it's bad on multiple levels, even ignoring how much inspiration I think is obvious she got from Nocturnememory's works. But the author also took a lot of inspiration from Ellory with her pureblood culture and didn't credit until Nocturnememory called her out for not crediting anyone at all, even when it's clear she was using other's ideas. There was another author as well, and the only one Samvelg ended up actually crediting properly, who wrote a story about runes and fabric witchcraft, which was clear to have been an inspiration point. (again, not until she was told to) I understand why people go, hey that's really not a big deal, it's just similar themes and word use etc... but Nocturnememory really had something different that wasn't seen in the fem!harry side of this pairing and a lot of people wrote things after she started posting that followed her style/prose and themes, and while a lot of people credited, samvelg did not. It's dishonest and just rude, especially because Nocturne attempted to actually write something new and complex, and Samvelg essentially stripped it down to crack!fic but kept all the really interesting allusions and themes and just...threw them into her weak writing.

But regardless, even without the copying aspects I 100% believe that Samvelg was 'inspired' by fics that they had literally bookmarked... this story is just really bad. Badly written, incredibly corny, absolutely nothing has happened and it's literally all tell and no show. How it's so popular is absolutely beyond me.

- turning in someone else's work as your own

- changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit

- copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on "fair use" rules)

.

Plagiarism isn't limited to writing songfics and quoting song lyrics wholesale, or writing "The cast reads" fics and copying excerpts from JKR's original books. If you take someone else's words and use them in your writing, certain turns of phrase, metaphors or motifs - that other people */can immediately recognize as having been derived from someone else/* without credit, that's plagiarism. It doesn't need to be a case where someone can profit monetarily (which the author of Runic Warding /did/ do, by starting a donation page and linking it to her fic, until Ao3 admins took it down for violating their T&C), or start a legal action to sue. And this whole deal could have been solved by /crediting/ the person whose ideas were used as inspiration.

Fanfic writers write for free. They put their time and creative ideas into producing content for us to enjoy. Outside of the ethical aspect of not crediting other creators, it's just basic courtesy and respect to give credit where it's due.

I do agree with you that plagiarism is a serious offence. Which is why I can't justify it with the reasoning, "Oh, this person is young and inexperienced", or "It's just fanfiction, not an academic paper".

BUT, more crucially, cut the pureblood culture part (aka Daphne). Harry can have a wife and another couple whom they get up to naughty times, there is no need to dump 100k of unnecessary words and see-through drama just to justify all relationships.

** A few anti-recommendations I have:

"The Real Us" by Seel'vor: it takes what would have been some interesting plot premises and completely fucks them up. That's all I'll say, aside from noting there is some rather creepy writing involving Harry and Hermione's relationship.

I used to like "Backwards Compatible" by Ruskbyte, but then on one of my re-reads I really stopped to think about a segment in the fic, and it struck me that the scene where Harry nearly has Draco's limbs ripped from their sockets to coerce a confession - in public, to boot - was completely unnecessary and over the top.

Also, anything by bellerophon30. The problem is more mechanical than anything else: the author does not have a grasp on how to structure dialog and character interactions, so it works like this:

Character A said, "Speaking." Character B reacts in the same paragraph.

Also, b30 overuses epithets to the point where they're like sandpaper on your skin: "the bad man", "sports fans", et cetera, et cetera.

Another reason to anti-recommend, this fic also has Draco threatening Hermione or prepositioning her right? Also, when Harry recollects what happens to Hermione in future. Rape threats or assaults are one of my pet peeves in fanficiton, for some reason I always see this in Hermione fanfiction, more than fics with any other female protagonists..

** The Draco Trilogy by Cassandra Claire which you can still find if you know where to look/ask. Or read her first book, because it's just the same story.

All the best lines are from other, better written TV shows and books, straight up plagiarism and the basis for Draco in Leather Pants. No one acts anything like their canon counterparts.

It's still held up as something like the perfect characterisation of Draco.

** I read Hail Odysseus by Brennus on a rec from here; it is a fic where Harry is raised by Grindelwald, which is generally well-written if a bit eye-rolly in its Dark!Indy!Badass!Harry way, but also had some content that meant that I had to stop reading the story partway through because it was enraging me.

First of all, there are exactly three male characters who are explicitly presented as gay/bi, and all three character happen also to be cackling, mustache-twirling, murderous villains. No non-evil dudes who are into dudes.

This wouldn't have stuck out to me so much except that Grindelwald also canonically had some kind of relationship with Dumbledore, but since he is a “good guy” by the standards of this fic, we never get a reference by him to his relationship with Dumbledore, and in fact we get his long backstory on how his TRUE love was a good heterosexual relationship later in life with a random Muggle woman. As far as I remember, the only mention we ever get of Gellert being in a relationship with Albus is Harry throwing it in Dumbledore's face as an insult during a fight, after Grindelwald has died, because haha men who give it up for other men is a great insult, amirite

So all the gays are evil, and the one good guy in the fic who canonically had a thing with a guy must have a random hetero “real” love interest introduced and his relationship - with one of the main villains of the fic - never referred to except to insult said villain.

(Of course, the gays may be ew icky but lesbians are HAWT and so there is lots of Harry's female friends teasing him about them making out with each other and how it makes him horny, so horny, etc.)

Speaking of horny Harry, this is less of a dealbreaker content issue for me but definitely a pet peeve: it goes to a very specific heterosexual relationship well that I see unfortunately often in fic where Harry and Ginny's relationship is “flirty,” by which I mean “he says explicitly rude and sexual things about how parts of her body get him hard, and she acts offended on the outside but secretly she's flattered, because having clearly unstable guys you barely know ‘banter' with you about how your tits give them a boner is the way to a woman's heart and into her panties.”

I have other issues with the fic - I don't love the way Harry's and Ginny's first time together is of dubious consent (and in animal form?), or the fact that it's explicitly set up that all the Slytherin girls are used sexually by the guys except that Ginny manages to stay a virgin because of course she is the main character's love interest and so must be properly untouched for Harry, and of course the other major female character who DIDN'T stay properly virginal has to die to motivate Harry and Ginny (and killed by two of those murderous gays!) - but in general it boils down to the fact that I have never read a fic before that was generally decently written but where I came away with such a clear distaste for it.

I know putting something in a story does not imply that you condone it, but this fic seems to be built on a series of assumptions that make me feel that if I knew the dude who wrote this in real life (and I have no doubt it is a dude, and a very particular type of straight dude at that), I wouldn't like him very much. (I hope I'm wrong, though, and that he is a perfectly lovely person who just happens to write terrible fic!)

** *A Butterfly Effect*.

It's a fem!Harry Harry/Ginny retelling of canon, and it makes Harry and Ginny unbelievably unlikable. Not only are they having obviously fetishized sex when they're 11/12 (or possibly 12/13, I refuse to check), but there is this constant cycle of fem!Harry 'losing her mind' and mindlessly hurting or even murdering a bunch of people, and then Harry feels sad about it and Ginny fiercely defends her girlfriend to all those mean grieving relatives of the people who died who dare be mad at Harry, and then fem!Harry threatens to murder the rest of their relatives for daring to argue with Ginny.

I couldn't finish it because I ended up loathing the two main characters. I actively wanted Ginny and Harry to die in a fire, and I don't understand why it's a go-to recc.

Basilisk born - I really don't understand the popularity of this. Not only is essentially half the fic a backstory, it's a backstory in which time travel can't change the past. Beyond that it seems to try and hit every boring contrivance it can. Harry is related to Merlin oh and Arthur and Morgana too! He taught Modred! He owns Hogwarts which is Camelot! He's also Slytherin and not prejudiced! And he and the other founders were tots cool and related! And he's a legal expert! He has all types of ancient magic! He's adopted by goblins! He's a healer but a special super rare type! All the lordships! It was kinda ridiculous.

Somewhere near the end, Harry spends chapters on end agonizing over Hermione. And the family magic was one thing, but the supernatural fetus thing was the worst bit of fan fiction I've ever read and I wandered into a Harry/Hermione/Snape threesome once.

The rest were totally introverts. Sirius especially didn't really care for any attention he got. There are so many plot threads that didn't add anything. Like Sirius' first girlfriend in the story.

The creepy bits that seem to sexualize underage characters (including, as noted in the OP, the subplot of Draco the aspiring rapist), the HARD MAN crap, the shear narcissism of the author, the bait and switch of selling it as a rationalist in the Harry Potter world and then the author completely rewriting the rules of that world to fit his story/biases, the author using the world and characters as his personal soapbox for a philosophy that runs almost exactly opposite to Rowlings' own on various points, the utterly preposterous power-fantasy ending, and probably a whole bunch of other stuff I'm missing. It practically personifies a lot of offensive Potter fanfic tropes, and the worst part is, if you can force yourself to read through the dreck, there are actually a few neat concepts and well-written bits, and you get these frustrating glimpses of the brilliant story that /could/ have been if its author was... well, see the above.

And because it was such a big, high-profile story, it had an outsize impact, to the point where I feel a lot of other fics just imitate it, and it has arguably /measurably reduced the quality of the entire fanfiction medium/ single-handedly.
