"Given foresight, it was obvious. Slytherin are for those who like to play polotics, usually ending up as some dull politician or the head to a dying family. Ravenclaw was for the researchers and unspeakables. Gryffindor was for those who live their lives to the fullest. Hufflepuff was a bunch of duffers. At least that's what they want you to think. It's no coincidence that 78% of The time The minister of magic is a Hufflepuff, it's no coincidence that the top positions in the ministry are Hufflepuff's 78% of the time.

When one Elizabeth Baker Fortier, a french muggleborn decided that she was to take over the world, that she did. There was no hate speeches, no group made out to be inferior, no marks of master and servant, for puffs are loyal, and when one goes to war, they all do.

May 13th, 2005 One week, that's how long it took for the ministry to fall. After three weeks, the remaining auror forces were forced into retreat out of britan, after a month, The Constitution of Magical Britan was drafted, signed, and enforced throughout Britain. After 3 months Ireland fell next, followed by Denmark and Norway. Spies infiltrated Spain, Portagul was routed.

There were attempts at counter attack, such as the battle at the Pinensula of Cardigan Bay (July 27th 2005), where French hit wizards, along with the remaining British Aurors (still loyal to the old guard) tried to invade Britain and knock out supply lines running through Wales, only to be stopped by a brigade of Irish demolitions and the 37th Silent Battalion (Unspeakable Forces).

After 5 months, and days of negotiations/blackmail magical Spain officially allied with the "Dark" Lord Elizabeth and joined in the joint invasion of Magical France. The fight was tough, with cassualtys in the thousands (Fairly large for the population at the time.), but Lord Elizabeth prevailed.

One year after the beginning of the war, Italy, Germant, Belgium, and the Netherlands were taken.

The war came to a close when peace talks were arranged between magical Sweeden, Poland, The Czech republic, Slovakia, and the combined government of Africa.

Peace was declared after twelve long days of negotiation, reaching terms of agreement which I have put a simplified of below.

--------------

One Elizabeth Fortier would give up all claim to present and future leadership of any group or movement, political party, gathering, etc.

Magical Creatures with enough sentience to wield one properly and without actively endangering the lives of others may wield a magical foci (Wand, Staff, Chakram, Stave, etc.)

Any magical creature with enough sentience to send a representative forward is to be classified as a magical being, and is held to the same code as human, adjusted on a case by case basis.

The constitution's instituted by the respective governments concured during the war must be abided to and stay in place for 343 years, and any person or being in a position of major power must abide by it during their tenue, lest they lose their magic.

Any and all affeced goverment positions under constitutional contract must be randomly vetted twice per year for any signs of corruption, and if found, they give up their magic.

All government positions in office under the reign of one Elizabeth Fortier must be immediately be put up for re-election.

When asked to picture a dark lord, most people will describe a figure dressed in the finest black robes, with slytherin green accents, a snake at their side, dark magic radiating of their figure. That is the case most of the time, In the last 57 times a dark lord had any semblance of success in taking over europe, 18 times, It has been a Slytherin, once it has been a Gryffindor, 3 times it has been a Ravenclaw, 9 times it has been a student from Drumstrangs, twice From Bauxbeatons, one originated in Africa, and one from over the pond. The origins of 3 dark lords have been lost to time. That leaves 19 times historians have known a Dark lord to come from hufflepuff.

And people me why I'm so scared of a bunch of duffers."

Give me any fics where the house of loyalty really shows how they stand up for their own.
