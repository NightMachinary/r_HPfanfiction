** Snape is an interesting character. A prick who held a grudge most of his life and took it out on a kid, but also a prick who spent most of his like atoning for /some of/ his sins. Lily was his childhood friend, James was his school rival. He knows a lot of magic and is talented. All of this together makes him interesting. Seems natural this leads to the mentor!Snape.

** Severus Snape was a brilliant man. He was a prodigy in potions, a master duelist having an extensive knowledge of the Dark Arts, a master occlumens (which in spite of what fandom makes you believe, requires a tremendous discipline to master). In fact, I believe that had his life been a little easier (no ruthless prankings by marauders, no neglect from his parents and no obsessive love for Lily) he would have no doubt become a most talented wizard of all time. Perhaps this intellect of Severus Snape is what makes him attractive as a mentor for Harry.

But, as others have pointed out, Snape is not a good natured man. He has very little patience with children, he basically abhors Harry for being a mirror image of his father, he is biased towards his own house and has other petty quirks about him which clearly does not make him a good mentor for anyone, let alone Harry. Fanfics are all about experimentations so I for one am not so put out by somebody's idea of mentor!Snape.

** Because fan fiction thrives on interesting characters. Harry is not particularly interesting - he's a normal kid that has extraordinary things happen to him. Snape on the other hand is /not/ normal, and the farthest away from normal there is in canon that doesn't require an inordinate amount of skill to write (like Luna or Hagrid). All you have to do is channel your anger into very few words, and that's all people really need to recognize it (which is also why he's misrepresented so much).

I think that the other (easier, and therefore more popular) is to show Snape as evil and torment him. Instant 200 likes on FFN for that. 1000 if you make it a super/indie/Harry that proves how superior he is in every way while calling Snape Snivellus, especially if he teams up with Sirius.

The fact is that Snape is a childish man from what little we see of him. There really is very little to go on. Would he be equally childish if he was put in a different situation? We don't know. Does he still love Lily romantically? Probably not - and we don't know. Does he still hate Sirius? Obviously, and it was mutual. They were complete jerks to each other, as Sirius showed gleefully starting in PoA (where he slammed the head of an unconscious Snape against walls) and until his last breath. But is this all there is to him? We don't know because we are limited to Harry's POV, and see the absolute worst of Snape.

Even with everything in the Harry Potter Wiki (which aggregates everything: interviews, Pottermore, the games, etc), there is very little known about who he is rather than how he acted. It's very open to interpretation. And most of the fandom is split among the extremes: Snape was pure evil made of scum and deserved everything bad that happened to him, and Snape was a misunderstood tortured soul that was a good man at heart.

That flexibility makes for an easy out for development of a story. And seriously, making someone else Harry's guardian would just make the story less interesting, not more so.

** Because as awful as Snape was, depending on how early this happens, it /forces/ him onto a path of growing up that he should've been on like twenty years prior. And often these stories have it happen in the relative safety of Hogwarts, or have people like McGonagall checking in.

In these stories, Snape often starts out in character, but then changes. He becomes horribly out of character compared to canon, sometimes a bit too quickly, but sometimes it'll take the full 200k+ word journey. His character changes to someone deserving of that redemption arc he was given in canon, or at least close to it.

Plus, it's alternate universe anyway.

(Edit: and its usually /not/ something like being a good guardian makes up for his choices and treatment of children, but it'll be something like being a good guardian affects his treatment of everyone around him in a good way)

My explanation for Severitus is\\
1: [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][The Severitus Challenge]]

2: Just the role Snape plays in the series. He's the outsider on your side, the one who doesn't quite "get" how normal humans act. If you like Spock or Data in Star Trek, Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Vegeta in Dragonball Z, etc., etc. you have a high chance of liking Snape.

And liking Snape, you'll want him to forge connections. Most books or TV shows deliver on this. Not Harry Potter. Snape goes to his grave misunderstood and hated by everyone. Fanfiction just wants to make things better for him. You want him and the other characters you like to get along, to have a mutual respect for each other. Canon shows this is /possible/ because Harry does respect him after he sees the pensieve memories.

Harry is another character fans want to make things better for. He's a poor little abused orphan who really needs a family quite badly, he was ready to go with Sirius like ten minutes after he found out the man wasn't a mass murderer. That was literally the only qualification he needed to go and want to live with someone who was a complete stranger to him.

So knowing all this, why not put the two together? All it takes is Snape seeing past Harry's looking like James, and Harry finding some things out about Snape's motivations a little earlier.

** It's from people who didn't read the books, or who first saw the movies and only read the books much later.

Book Snape is an evil man with an unpleasant appearance. He is shown six years terrorising Gryffindors, with a special hatred towards Harry and Neville. Then it is revealed in the last book he lusted after Harry's mother until she dropped him when he called her by a vicious racial slur, yet 'still loved her'.\\
He hates the Marauders, and seems to carry a special hatred for Sirius Black and James Potter. He is directly involved in making Sirius' last years miserable, and of course his hatred towards James is transferred undiluted to Harry. I believe that only his vow to protect Lily's child is what was keeping him from /directly/ harming Harry -- the emotional torment he put him through was allowed, though.

Film Snape is Alan Rickman. He is a stern teacher, but not an outright evil bully. While his relation with Harry and Neville is not pleasant, he is shown in a much more human light. His heel face turn at the end is actually somewhat plausible and you can somewhat believe the whole 'being such a jerk was a front' narrative that 'redeems' him. Unlike the book version this Snape doesn't seem to particularly enjoy Harry being in distress and even his hatred for the Marauders is toned down.

Snarry fans are in love with film Snape and reason that since he always loved Lily, he must've always loved Harry, too.

*** I've read the books, way to many times, (and they definitely stick in my head much more than the movies) and Snarry definitely can come from the books too.

A lot of fanfiction deals with AU stuff where they're 'fixing' or exploring things that /might/ have happened in canon. For example, Harry never going to the Dursleys, different pairings, Dumbledore not dying, Riddle redemption fics. In that light, a Snarry story makes sense. Maybe Snape managed to get past his emotions in first year, maybe he found out about the Dursleys, maybe he and James at least came to an understanding - who knows? However, it's all up to the fanfiction author to make these decisions, and that's the whole point of an AU story.

Also, Snape's story, even in the book, is pretty poignant. It's pretty clear that much of Snape in the earlier books derives from his childhood. Additionally, he does show courage, and loyalty to Lily, and in doing so shows that he has good traits, and might be, deep down a good person. That opens up a what-if question for writers to exploit.

I don't think anyone could be in love with either film Snape, or even book Snape. But people are in love with the idea that if Snape was /just/ a /bit/ different, he could be someone they could love.

Nonsense.

Sure, there are Rickmanites who swoon over his version of Snape and pair him with everyone in the HP universe, but most of the Snarry folk I know - and I've shipped Snape/Harry for 10 years - vastly prefer book!Snape. His love for Lily threw a serious spanner in the works and was much harder for some people to accept than his death was. It threw the fandom into turmoil for a while.

****** I'm pretty sure they met when they were both aged nine (I'd have to doublecheck the chapter), and no, lusting wasn't part of the equation. In fact, even at Hogwarts it seems dubious to me that Snape lusted after Lily. Partly because he was so poorly socialized, I'd venture to say he lagged behind Lily developmentally and hadn't yet hit the point of dealing with relationships when the rift between them happened. He was obviously immature. But Lily was special to him - Lily represented everything clean, pretty, successful, well-loved, well cared for, financially secure - everything child Severus wasn't. Having Lily choose him as a friend was proof that he was special, too. He needed her friendship in a way she didn't need his, and losing her must have been devastating to his belief that his life would ever be validated by /that/ world - the world Lily navigated so effortlessly.

Of course he loved her. She was probably the only person who ever took his peculiarities in stride.

Remember, JKR called his expression "greedy." I think he wanted, in a sense, to possess her because he was greedy for everything he didn't have, and she embodied all those things. She was born to them.

Also, I don't see how anybody could say Snape lusted after Lily following her death. He was mad with guilt and grief; he knew he was responsible for what had happened to her, even though he didn't actually kill her. Guilt ruled the rest of his life. Lily's death also was the death warrant for any ambitions or personal dreams Snape might have had. He submitted to a life he hated in order to destroy the murderer of the only person who'd ever loved him, even if ultimately even she had been unable to tolerate his bigotry and horrible choices.

Oops, lunchbreak over. I can talk about this for hours, so I may be back to blather more later on.

Do you remember where this is? That actually does sound familiar now that I think about it but I can't find it now.

(edit: is this the quote: "Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy."?)

I think you nailed it with the greed thing. I think that Snape's feelings for Lily were always possessive. He subconsciously wanted to possess Lily in every sense of the word, including romantically. He wanted to be Lily's sole best friend and her sole confidant, and anyone who displayed romantic interest in Lily was a threat to that. It's like he wanted to be her boyfriend because he didn't want anyone else to be her boyfriend.

I also agree with you about Snape supposedly lusting after Lily post-death. At that point, I think she stopped being a real person that he could lust over and started just being a general idea. He wasn't sitting there staring at a picture of her or swearing off women.

******** I agree with the "greed" idea, too. Everyone who insists on lauding Snape for having a huge capacity for love are simply taking a couple of events in the book at face value - self-reported statements from a couple of characters as if they were incapable of lying or self-delusion.

Actions speak louder than words, so what /actions/ indicate that Snape truly loved Lily? He asked that she be spared, and that's a great thing to do, but... what did he expect the next step to be? That she'd fall in love with him once her husband and son were gone? That she'd actually be happy that she survived?

Love means putting another's interests ahead of your own. Was it in /Snape's/ interests that Lily live while her family were murdered, or /Lily's/?

Snape's, clearly.

He protected Harry, but it was clearly under duress and he abused the boy as far as possible. So that's the opposite of an action showing love.

His patronus changed, but that's not necessarily love. It's grief, but it could be grief over losing something he wanted badly.

Before he died, he wanted to see Harry's eyes... except not. He wanted to see Lily's eyes one last time. He didn't care about Harry.

In the end, what Snape cared about most was how Lily made him feel: special, good, wanted, cared for. Quite understandable, given his home life. I find it hard to criticize that.

But there's no way in hell that that can be called "love".

And there's also no way in hell that he can be treated as an appropriate "mentor" for anyone. He clearly hates teaching and children too much.

I totally get people exploring how canon can be "fixed" with little changes or how characters can be "fixed" with little changes, but when you so fundamentally change a character like that, it's no longer a fix - it's an admission that the original character was too awful to be redeemed and needed to be replaced with an alternate universe version that didn't grow up to be monumental ass. And that's OK, too, just acknowledge it.

********* Um, I actually do think Snape loved Lily. It was a love hampered by the fact that he had no prior experience of it, no model for it, and that it began when he was a fairly inarticulate child who simply submitted to his own feelings and longings and who never grew into a self-examining adult.

But it was love, no question. Love is not a pure thing, philosophy and literature to the contrary. It's shaped by the personality of the person loving, by the slow understanding and changes on each side, by social context and skill in communication.

#+begin_quote
  Love means putting another's interests ahead of your own.
#+end_quote

Hmm. Maybe in /your/ experience. But let me introduce you to my parents. Let me tell you about some ex-partners and friends of mine. I know they love(d) me, but by your definition, they wouldn't pass the test. Using that kind of strict idealization romanticizes the reality of love. People are selfish, often unconsciously so. And they have different degrees of self-awareness. And backgrounds. And assumptions. And so on.

I've been both incredibly selfish and incredibly generous towards people I love. If you try to insist I didn't love them, I will tell you where to shove your moral high-mindedness. (That's not a personal 'you,' by the way, but a rhetorical one.)

Snape's love for Lily did him no good. In some ways, it crippled his life. If he'd been able to stop caring, he might actually have thrived - might have wrung some pleasure and satisfaction out of his career as a Death Eater. Instead, he lived in a state of frustration, hopelessness (at least in the sense of anything ever getting better), heartbreak, and servitude. He stewed in malice and resentment, bound to a place that had witnessed his humiliation, his besting in love, his ultimate mistake in choosing evil. Nor did his love help Lily. Snape /tried/ - I wouldn't take that away from him. But one of the interesting moments in the confrontation between Snape and Dumbledore during the hilltop scene is that JKR describes Snape as bewildered that Dumbledore thinks it important to save James and Harry. Clearly this is a young man with no concept of right or wrong. He doesn't understand why his callousness is so horrible. He's had no training in being good. His entire life, with the exception of his joy in finding Lily, has been about clawing his way out of his miserable beginnings.

Snape is /passionate/ about everything that matters to him - love, hate, magic, knowledge, power - but he is never, ever pure. That's one reason I rejoice in his character - he's a gift to writers everywhere.

Also, greed and love do not cancel each other out. Child Snape was greedy, with or without Lily - and he was right to be so. He was an incredibly deprived child, practically feral, certainly unsupervised and apparently unwanted. He presumably envied and hungered for the easy, happy things other children possessed through no virtues of their own - and that hunger was a hundred times more admirable than curling up and submitting to fate. Young Snape fought, in the only way he knew how, to better himself - but all the odds were against him, and he was his own worst enemy. Despite that, he was capable of love, even if it was an ugly, desperate love, much like Snape himself. It's both irony and poetic justice that his capacity to love - what the books consider Harry's saving grace - was inevitably the catalyst for Snape's death.

IMO, Snape deserved his redemption arc, because redemption, like love, is not a straight, unsullied line. And for me it's signalled by a telling exchange in The Prince's Tale wherein Snape gives one clear, sharp proof of the fact that he's finally acquired a conscience, and in the process comes out looking far more sympathetic than Dumbledore (this is not one of DD's finer moments, because he teases Snape about something that isn't funny):

#+begin_quote
  "Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?"

  "Lately, only those whom I could not save," said Snape.
#+end_quote

Too little too late, but Snape has more dignity here than the sainted Albus, and demonstrates his hard-earned grasp of right from wrong - with, I would argue, very little support from Dumbledore, who stood in the position of mentor and commander to him but appeared to view him as a useful resource more than as a human being. (Necessary disclaimer: no, I don't hate Dumbledore, in fact I find him as complex and fascinating as Snape. But I think his goodness is a very murky and ambiguous thing, whereas his greatness is undeniable.)

Shite, this is what happens when I start discussing Snape - I ramble on for paragraphs. On topic, I'd say Snape would be a nightmare as Harry's mentor, partly because it would be something forced upon him, and because, as you point out, he hates children. Being around children and stuck in Hogwarts is one of the things that keeps him stunted. (I personally believe Snape would have been a brilliant if harsh university professor, spurred on by students who were as focused and smart about the subject as he was.) And of course, despite being loyal unto death, he carries a fucking grudge like nobody's business, and it would take months - /years/ - for him to admit that Harry isn't James reincarnated, and that Harry isn't to blame for the fact that Lily died for him.

But that's what makes the idea interesting to me. Yes, it requires a long, careful development and slow evolution of change between the two, and it doesn't automatically suppose that one will ever feel affection for the other. But respect? That I can imagine. And I think the impression each makes on the other - the potential within Harry to humanize Snape and the possibility that Snape can show Harry the advantages of magical knowledge - plus the fact that both of them are Olympic champions at enduring all the shit that fate dumps on them - would create the kind of bond that gets forged in wartime. You may go your separate ways afterwards, but there will always be something that ties you to the people with whom you risked your life. /That's/ a story I would like to read.

Are you saying that they never, ever put your interests ahead of their own? Never, ever sacrificed for you? If so, then no, they didn't love you. You might consider that moral high-mindedness, but I consider it common sense that if a person doesn't treat you better than those they hate or are indifferent to, then it's not possible for them to genuinely love you.

I never defined love /always and only/ putting another's interests ahead of yours, but if you /never/ do it, then you don't love them - such an attitude would be indistinguishable from indifference at best. And that is especially true for something really important, like in the context here.

#+begin_quote
  Love is not a pure thing, philosophy and literature to the contrary.
#+end_quote

True. But it does require appropriate corresponding actions, absolutely none of which we see in Snape. Not a single loving /act/ that is performed /for others/. We mostly only see selfish acts which, at best, suggest that he loves himself and wants to satisfy his own desires. Occasionally we see grudgingly performed acts that he is obligated to do.

As I wrote before, actions speak louder than words.

Oh, and if it helps, defining love as sacrificing for others is the JKR canon definition - it's how /she/ is defining love in the context of her story. I'm not going nearly as far as her with that, and Snape fails to fit the definition. Under JKR's use of love, Snape falls even farther short of the mark. So far short, in fact, that I doubt his attempt would even register. So even if you personally rejected the idea of sacrificing as having anything to do with love, you wouldn't be able to ignore it entirely.

Curiously, I don't think there is a single example of Snape ever saying he loves or loved Lily. Others infer it, but he never says it. So it's not even a case of comparing his actions to his words and finding his actions wanting. Instead, we are comparing his actions to /others inferences/, and finding Snape's actions wanting. At that point, it's time to ask whether those making the inferences really know what they are talking about.

True, which is why love takes work... work which Snape never actually invests. You have to make an effort, sometimes on a daily basis, and that's another example of Snape's actions shouting from the top of the Astronomy tower that he doesn't actually love anyone. Possibly not even himself.

******** Yes, thank you, I'm aware of that. But that's not really plausible at age nine.

Later, yes of course, Snape clearly had a crush on Lily. But that's not at all the same thing as being ready for a relationship or even understanding what your feelings mean. Compared to James and Lily, Snape was distinctly behind the curve. And I find the phrasing "lusting after Lily" distasteful and reductive. James also lusted after Lily. Yes, and? Presumably Lily lusted back. But what Snape lost when he snapped and called Lily a mudblood was the friendship, the innocence, the trust, the pleasure and reassurance of being considered worthwhile by someone popular, someone he thought the world of (insults to the contrary). He lost the feeling of being loved, and he lost his one chance to learn how to love back. Remember, this was a boy no one had ever thought worthwhile before. His parents obviously didn't. He lost his only link to anything 'normal' when he drove Lily away. It must have hurt like blazes, and not because his 'lust' was thwarted.

Snape's grief and his obsessive focus on Lily after her death were unhealthy. But they gave him a purpose. And Dumbledore certainly benefited from his spy's inability to live with his guilt. He contributed to Snape's failure to grow up, because he needed Snape to stay true to the cause, and his power over Snape was directly connected to Snape's grief and guilt.

I actually think Snape's motives - his love for Lily - diminished him as a character, but the latest wave of Snape interpretation, which throws around the terms Nice Guy and friendzoning and lusting after a dead woman, take an interesting character with complicated issues and turn him into a one-dimensional creep. Snape may be a creep, but that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what makes him complex and genuinely tragic to so many readers and fic writers. He brought about his own downfall, but 'lust' had nothing to do with it. Twisted as Snape's love may have been, it was clearly genuine, just as his hatred of James was genuine. He was, emotionally speaking, an obsessive, and it was only at the very end that he showed signs of learning how to depersonalize his responses.

But this has wandered rather far from the post topic, and I apologize for that. My time would probably be better spent packing, feh.

it does create a myriad of complications, doesn't it?

it's also interesting to think about snape's affection within the fabric of the hpverse. jkr consistently lists his love for lily as one of his greatest strengths; she repeatedly praises him for it and speaks of it as wholly positive, without the caveat of it being 'obsessive', 'creepy' or 'twisted', etc. i think it's implied that dumbledore and harry think the same. the only person that reduces it to lust is voldemort, which is done to show how blind he is to 'love'. if we accept that, socially and culturally within the hp world, his love for lily is perceived as positive, and everyone (dumbledore) reinforces that idea, even his creator, how/why would snape think he's doing anything creepy? or jkr has loopy ideas about the sanctity of love

******* I got the impression that Snape befriended Lily within a year or so of them starting school, but maybe I'm wrong.

Both of them were born in January 1960, which means they would have turned 11 in January 1971 and started school in September 1971. If he had befriended her a year prior to her getting her letter (summer 1970), they would be 10.

**** I am not sure lusting is the correct word here. A lust does not last years after somebody has died. Can't speak for others but I for one believe that Severus Snape's love for Lily was, albeit a little obsessive, pure.

***** Yes. Check out the weekly "tattoosday" posts on [[/r/harrypotter]]. A lot of them are Deathly Hallows signs, simple lightning bolts or Marauder quotes, some of them are sleeves, I once saw a very large blue Voldemort, but a lot of them are "always" in a fancy font.
