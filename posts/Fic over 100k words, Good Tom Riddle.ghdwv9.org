I thought itd be interesting to read a fic about tom riddle growing up good instead of turning into Voldemort. If anyone has read one like that, that is long please let me know XD


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]] by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) is exactly this. Tom still has a grayish moral code and did some terrible things as a teen, but is a respectable adult.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) is sorta like that. It's pretty dark and it's less grows up good and more grows up not to be Voldemort.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

**** In October it's really small. Tom is attracted to Harry but it's unrequited. There are a few scenes where he thinks of Harry like that, then a scene where he gets rejected. Much later he marries Lily Evans and they are happy. Really recommending it, it's very good.

** Not quite the same, but linkffn(The Impostor Complex) has the diary fragment gaining its own body, deciding that the original is completely insane, and switching sides. He's still not exactly cuddly, but he's genuinely committed to doing the right thing.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** linkffn(A Riddled Universe) by hazeldragon is not per se about him growing up, it starts when Tom is already middle-aged and Harry falls through the veil and lands in his universe where he is a respected healer and even on friendly terms with Dumbledore. Chaos end intrigue ensue and everybody has to come to grips with the differences between the two universes.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
