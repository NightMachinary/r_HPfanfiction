Random thing; does anyone watch Primitive Technology on YouTube?

I do, and I find the videos rather soothing to watch. It's all quiet, leisurely-paced construction montages.

With that in mind, does anyone know any stories, where there's a focus on Harry making things?

For example, Harry learns wandlore, or develops new prank products and anti-Dark-Arts inventions with Fred & George, or teams up with a group of house-elves to bring Christmas to everyone (toys and presents, that is), or helps to rebuild Hogwarts after a magical storm, or tries to get wizards into space, or just enchants magical objects to show off the things he learns in class?

No dramatic or suspenseful fanfictions please, nothing with an independent Harry fighting Death Eaters with magitechnology.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** I would suggest linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). Don't let the name fool you. It neither involves the lord Potter trope or politics. The title is quite literal.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

*** Eeh...chapters 1 and 2 aren't so good, I think. Flamel's hypnotizing of Malfoy managed to set off my revenge-plotting habit.

Still, chapter 3 seems alright so far.

** Maybe linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig)? Harry takes the remaining magical population into space, and they settle on new planets. There's not much with just him making stuff, but it does involve quite a bit of building new settlements and stuff.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5625616][Stop and Stare]] has this. In this fic, Draco runs an animal sanctuary at the manor and Harry owns a company designing/building magical tents and sheds and stuff. Draco hires him to build a shed (much fancier than this but if you read it you'll see) and they become friends. This is a really unusual love story where they both know they are falling in love but do not address it hardly at all until the end - I really loved that. It's slash but really not at all until the last couple scenes. Definitely worth the read even if you usually don't read slash. Linkao3(5625616)
