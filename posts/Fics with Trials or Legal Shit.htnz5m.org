So, I'm looking for fics that involve trials specifically or the legal system in general.

Could be the fifth year trial (a la, Heart and Soul, link below), could be anything else. I remember Daft Morons did one where Harry got Sirius off from a No Enchanting Muggle Objects violation with some legalese and snide bullshit. And there was one in Long Live The Queen where the Queen had to judge Magical Britain for something. And that weird judgeship thing in the one where Harry goes by Dantes (as in Count of Monte Cristo) and closes Hogwarts and turns Ginny into a small dog (can't remember the name of that one, and not sure I want to, so I can't provide a link).

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Linkao3(4267422) - there is violence and gore in the crime but you can skim. There is smut but you can skip that without losing the plot. Not sure if the author highlights the parts or if you have to do the skipping yourself but it's a very intrigue filled story and hinges on courtroom/legal system drama.

*** First off, thanks for the warnings! I'm never quite sure if anyone actually reads my little boilerplate disclaimer thing - it's a little long for just "I'm okay with anything, but please warn me about smut and I apologise if I sound rude but I'm not I swear" :D

How much of a sin-washing do Lucius and Snape go through? Are they leather-pants-ed or is there some development from being Death Eaters? I'm imaging not much, from the tone taken on 'Death Eater' in the first chapter, but Snape and Lucius in post-war romances does tend to get accompanied by some big-time sin-washing. No complaint either way, I just like to know what I'm getting into in that regard. :D
