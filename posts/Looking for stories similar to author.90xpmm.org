Have read everything ⚯͛ by KeiraMarcos and I love her writing. Yes there is tropes like lord Potter, some Weasley bashing, manipulative Dumbledore, powerful Harry, but I find it wonderfully done. Sadly there is no more stories of her to read so I'm looking for authors who write in the same style. Pairing doesn't matter as long as it done involve Snape. Everyone who has read KeiraMarcos and like her style knows what I mean.

So thank you! I hope to get some response


** This! I'm glad I went through other posts before making my own because I was about to make one asking for story reqs similar to her writing. So I hope more people can give some recommendations!

That said, if you want to keep up with what Keira is writing and whether or not it is within HP, you should check out her rough trade website. Currently, she is writing within HP and it is a Little Black Dress challenge. She has finished one of her two stories and posts pretty regularly for her second.

You should also check out her EAD posts if you haven't yet as they aren't on her website, but the link is.

Sorry for the excess info if you already knew about both and fingers crossed for many recommendations!

** I love her work, I respect her too much to say it out loud because I'm pretty sure she hates hearing it but in my head I fervently wish I could access all her temp works that she takes down after events. I just found out about Darkly Loyal and I can't read it because it's gone. I'm sure there are so many more I'm missing out on. So for now I'm re-reading Soulmate Bond series for (no joke) the 6th time beginning to end. She's my HP goddess. Well, her and Colubrina :)

I also just found out about dreamwidth so I'm exploring that at the moment!

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
