Hey guys.\\
I was looking for some fics where Harry is paired with some female character that has a very questionable personality.\\
What i want is to see him, with someone that would basically be a villain, y'know, cold, ruthless agressive, really fierce maybe short tempered and wicked or even possessive.\\
Basically the type of person that almost everyone would evade, but not Harry because he knows how to deal with her.\\
I don't want one of those cliche ice queen Daphne fanfic, if the character's "Dark" trait is to be cold, than she has to REALLY be cold, not just a kind girl that ignores everyone to create an image but really someone that has nearly zero emotions, maybe just deep down loving Harry but never showing it, and he just knows that she likes him and keeps arround.

A good example is the Bellatrix from Delenda Est: She acts cold most of the time, has a really wicked temper is ruthless and agressive most of the time.

No FEM Harry\\
No Slash\\
No Harem or Multi\\
No Harry/HErmione or Harry/Ginny\\
Im okay of OCs\\
I'm Okay with crossovers.\\
Im okay with bashing if is well written.\\
Must be a little long, at least 40000 words\\
I would love something completed.

** SeriousScribble's /Unatoned/ fits this perfectly. 103k words, complete, and reads like a noir or a hardboiled work. It's on ffnet. Has a brief Astoria/Harry scene, but is mostly Daphne/Harry (it's not multi). Daphne isn't you're standard Ice Queen. This Daphne is colder than the Bellatrix from Delenda Est.

** Taming Demons by dirtyuncle is Harry with a demon girl who has "special" morals. The cursebreaking arc in particular is dope. BUT to reach it you have to go through Harry's rape dungeon arc so YMMV.
