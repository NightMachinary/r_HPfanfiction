:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfiction where Harry had initially been raised by the dusleys but vernon at some point snapped and punched him in the face, breaking his nose. He's later taken in by both Mcgonagall and Dumbledore. This is a Mcgonagall x Dumbledore fic where they are actually a couple. For the life of me I can't find this fic again and if anyone knows which one it is, I would really appreciate the help.


** Do you remember the word count or if the story was completed?
