It starts in her office, and someone has just made a floo call I think, but Umbridge does get her comeuppance at some point later in the fic? Not 100% sure.


** Are you sure you're not thinking of canon? That's pretty much what happens in OotP, except she doesn't succeed in using Crucio on Harry.

*** I know it's a fanfic I've read, she does indeed succeed in casting. The title's unfortunately eluding me, though it may be an H/Hr fic, could be wrong.

** “Error of Soul by Materia-Blade” linkffn(8490518)? If not for anything else, this story is remarkable because it is one of very very few having at least somehow acceptable Dolores Umbridge.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** There's a couple where Harry becomes the headmaster of Hogwarts due to Umbridge's crucio and one or two down to the blood quill/black quill.

linkffn(11364978) - Headmaster Harry Potter by Mage Myrddin

That's one, presuming the auto link works. I think the rewrite has Colin's blood trip things, but it's been a bit since I've read them so I'm not entirely sure how far they got.

  Harry and Co. are caught just as they're trying to floo to the DoM and rescue Sirius. Harry doesn't give into Umbridge's demands and in her rage, she curses him. Unwittingly, she sets something much larger into motion [rev3].
