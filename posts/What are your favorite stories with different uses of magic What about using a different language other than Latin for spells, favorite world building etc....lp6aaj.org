** I always thought the doggerel verse from Alexandra was pretty brilliant.

The essence is that you can do very specific magic by using rhymed verse (e.g. "Mirror, mirror on the wall) but you can only use that verse once.

**** I think it's one of the best currently running epic fantasy series out there. It has fantastic characters, including tremendously well written teenagers, a dark tone and complex plot that's still pretty optimistic at heart, several really interesting ideas and surprises, great structure to each individual book, and a really well-read, supportive and engaging author. (You can read his book reviews on his LiveJournal and I highly recommend them). The setting feels genuinely American in the same way Rowling made HP feel uniquely British.

I said epic fantasy because AQ is not written in the tradition of Harry Potter fan fiction. It doesn't have any of the tropes you'd really expect from a darkish gen fic, doesn't give you the satisfaction of seeing canon characters, and the characters aren't as sympathetic as they are in the books. It's also not written serially, which creates a pretty intense pace, and the first four books especially are structured like proper novels. Most of the complaints I see about the series are either about how Alexandra is unlikeable in the first book, or how it's not really Harry Potter fan fiction. If you go in with an open mind I think it's a pretty appealing series for anyone.

** Hands down The Archeologist is my favorite story that discusses magic and does a really good job of world building. Though be warned that the story does contain dimensional travel, time travel, a Harry who turns into a femHarry and some other stuff that I might be forgetting. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290]]) it is also on FFN if you prefer that to Ao3.
