  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did ‘gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Ok, here we go. First, my favorite. Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

linkffn(harry potter and the methods of rationality by less wrong)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) It's long, which seems to be good for you.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel)

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Vault of Time) A rare well-written manipulative!Dumbledore.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Junior Inquisitor) Another manipulative!Dumbledore, this one's kinda cracky.

linkffn(Oh God Not Again) True crack, time travel.

linkao3(In the Bleak Midwinter) Time travel, sends Hermione back to New Years Eve, 1925.

linkffn(Flight of the Stars by darkladyswan) Sends Hermione back to 1945, where she turns Voldemort and Voldemort turns her. Hermione/TMR if that's a turnoff.

linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) Honestly on the border of OP!Hermione. But it's still good, I think.

linkffn(Trolling the Toad) Pure crack.

OK, that's 5M+ words. Should be good for now.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
