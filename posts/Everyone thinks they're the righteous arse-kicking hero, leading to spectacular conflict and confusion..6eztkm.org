Super!Lord!Harry has received a letter from the goblins about his inheritance and right of conquest and whatnot and goes to free himself from under Manipulative!Dumbledore's thumb.

But this Dumbledore isn't manipulative, he's the kickass war-wizard who beat Grindelwald and is waiting until the time is right to begin training Harry, his friends, and the Slytherin love interest in Battle Alchemy to destroy Voldemort. He doesn't know why Harry's turned against him.

Amelia Bones trusts Dumbledore, she doesn't know why these allegations against him, the Weasleys, etc, are on her desk. Looking closer, she decides to investigate to see if the Dark Lord's followers are running a smear campaign against the ones who opposed them before.

The Dursleys are fighting their way to London. They know the wizards sent to arrest them for 'child abuse' are lying, Vernon taught Harry how to wield a gun himself in case magic ever failed him. Now he's using his old soldier abilities to try and reach the Prime Minister and prove to him that the magicals are waging war against muggle-kind.

Ron Weasley, master of chess, Hogwarts prefect, expert Keeper at Quidditch, and powerful enough to wield magic with a broken mismatched wand. In Harry's absence, he runs Dumbledore's Army to train the students for Voldemort's return, and he doesn't know why the goblins are demanding he be extradited from Hogwarts for fraud.

Hermione Granger, muggleborn prodigy, knows this story inside out; she dumps dumbass Ron to get with Harry, whoops the butt of the pureblood establishment...wait, Ron's not dumb, what's going on? Why is the Wizengamot being reasonable? Why aren't the answers in the Hogwarts library as always?

Later on, ooh, Horcruxes! Let's quickly zap them and remove the one from Harry's-what the HECK! Just what are those things made out of, invincibilium?!

Speaking of Voldemort, he's actually from the future and thinks he totally has good reasons to destroy the muggles before they wage war on wizardkind.

Lucius Malfoy, arrested Death Eater...but he really was under the Imperius, he really is a philanthropist, and he's quite pissed about being 'kidnapped' by Aurors.

Severus Snape, just wants to brew the lycanthropy cure in peace. Why is everyone accusing him of being a backstabber and a reverse quadruple agent? Why does Lupin want to snog him?

--------------

You get the idea, right? Everyone thinks they're the hero, everyone thinks they're in a plot starring them, and it gets confusing when each and every plot goes off the rails.

Does anyone know some ludicrously crazy subversive fics in this vein? Even a basic one, where a story primed for Ron!bashing is disrupted by having a smarter and more mature Ron? Or a Manipulative!Dumbledore who denies the allegations and doesn't say 'Greater Good' once?

Pure comedy gold.

The only /remotely/ similar fic I can think of is (unfinished) about lots and lots and lots of time travelers coming from the future to save Harry and the day. With the first few, they are suspicious of each other. When more and more still come, they realize the horror they've created and that nothing is going to work out.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
