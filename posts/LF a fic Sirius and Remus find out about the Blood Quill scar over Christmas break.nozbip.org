:END:
So I know how many fanfics fit into this description but I distinctively remember that it was not a fix it.

After dinner Harry's scar started to bleed again while he cleaned the dishes and he couldn't hide it any longer. Sirius (and I think Remus as well) took him to another room where they tried to get Harry to talk.

It wasn't a fix it because Sirius interrupted him before Harry could really open up.

Hope someone can help me :)
