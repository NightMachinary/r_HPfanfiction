I'm looking for any fic where Hermione and Draco have a kid together.


** Have you read (potential spoilers just by me reccing these but...) linkffn(Aurelian by BittyBlueEyes) or linkffn(The Request by redhead414)? They're both a little different, but by far two of my favourite fics!!

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.

*** Oh my thank you for recommending The Request! I absolutely loved it, and even went and read the "extras" story the author has up. I'm actually thinking of rereading this instead of starting something new to see if I missed anything the first time through, and that's a rare thing for me with fanfic. So yeah, thank you!
