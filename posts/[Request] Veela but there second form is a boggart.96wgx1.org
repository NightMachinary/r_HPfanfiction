************* If you look at my most recent post(I am a karma whore) garlic bread makes us immortal apparently. And I'm selling lots in my corner of the stone. Great prices but cash only unfortunatly. I do make a exception for precious metals such as gold(14k or higher) or diamond(at least .45 carots)
