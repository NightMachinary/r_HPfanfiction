:END:
I'm looking for a specific HPDM fanfiction, I believe it was a oneshot so relatively short. Draco organized a Quidditch match - or maybe it was even a tournament? - against Hogwarts alumni and professors and Harry was sort of the surprise on his team? I think Oliver Wood was the captain of the other team. It was really humorous and a great read. It'd be great if anyone remembers and knows where to find it! thank you! (I'm not sure about this but I think the author had Snape in their name)


** I don't know the story you're looking for. Both of the ones I know of with this theme are HPSS. Maybe they can provide you some fun reading while you wait for somebody to find your story.

Masters vs Students Quidditch by IIBNF linkao3(292832)

Ghost of a Memory by Phoenix Boy (the quidditch game is only part of this longer story) linkffn(2114791)

Just FYI, this subreddit is not overly friendly for slash pairings. You might want to post your search to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] instead.

  Based on the Monty Python sketch: Masters vs Students Rugby. This is not quality story telling, it's based on a Monty Python sketch, and it's just as daft and unbelievable as you'd expect something like that to be. Written in one day, 12,000 words (personal speed record!).
