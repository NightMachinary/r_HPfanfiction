** In "A boon for Bill", Dumbledore places tracking charms on Harry's pubes. When found out, Harry has them hidden at various places with ridiculous names like the ones in the picture.

** I have been to Pity Me a lot, it is fairly bland and full of post war pre fabs, but the surrounding area makes for some great eerie, suspense building landscapes.

I grew up near somewhere not mentioned on this map - Snape. It's beautiful in a very haunting sort of way, a very old village in marshes with a quaint quay.

**** It's also basically a sentence describing the location.

#+begin_quote
  Literally translated, the name means: [The] church of [St.] Mary (Llanfair) [of the] pool(pwll) of the white hazels (gwyn gyll) near [lit. "over against"] (go ger) the rapid whirlpool (y chwyrn drobwll) [and] the church of [St.] Tysilio (Llantysilio) of the red cave (-ogo[f] goch). The latter element has also been translated as "the cave of St Tysilio the Red".

**** Some names changed their meaning over the centuries. Kummerfeld would translate to field of sorrow today, but in medieval German it simply meant poor land, and it was named that way because the soil wasn't very suitable for agriculture.

Others are purely coincidential. Ekelsdorf is actually not named after disgust (Ekel in German) but after its founder, a knight called Ekolf.

Fegefeuer (Purgatory) might have a more sinister origin though. A local legend claims that either alleged witches or the bodies of plague victims were burnt there.

***** Wow! This is fascinating! Thank you so much for educating me. What are people's attitedes to living in Fegefeuer? Is it a reason for pride cause their town's name is so unusual? Are they annoyed/embarassed? Or are they indifferent?
