One where she has sex (preferably with Harry) if you know of any please let me know


** Sadly,

Because I tend to be an omnivore when it comes to fics... I do know of at least one. Harry basically sleeps with every Weasley partner. It does get weird. But you asked.

#+begin_quote
  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.
