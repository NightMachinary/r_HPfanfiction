Outside of Luna Lovegood and Cedric Diggory, he doesn't interact much with people in other houses. (Not counting Draco and Pansy, since they're the negative kind of interaction). Though he can interact positively with Draco and Pansy in the story, not saying he can't

I would 100% prefer Harry to be sorted into Gryffindor, NOT in another house.

It'd be nice if Harry tried for the house unity, can interact positively with Slytherin/Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.

Not expecting everyone to interact positively towards him, but just some people do is fine

Not really looking for pairings, honestly. But am fine with het/slash/femslash

NO Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche/No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

I'd rather not have Dumbledore be evil either. No stealing Harry's money, etc. Him making mistakes is perfectly okay, but I don't want him to be 100% evil.

This series has Harry doing a lot more interhouse activities. The first one (the one I linked) is kinda odd, more like a setup of the premise than a story, but it's quite short, and the sequels where Harry is at Hogwarts are really good.

FYI, the premise is that the Dursleys are abusive and Harry reacts to this a bit more realistically. Or maybe I should say typically instead of realistically.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.
