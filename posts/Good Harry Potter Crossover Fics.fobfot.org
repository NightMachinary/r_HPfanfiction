I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13366763/1/No-Rest-For-The-Weary]] and am looking for other good crossovers to read. Please recommend your favorites.


** A couple of my favorites are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future]] This is a Harry Potter Marvel crossover. well over a million words and still going strong , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher]] By the same author as A Third Path and is a DXD crossover. ,[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12853038/1/Swords-and-Roses]] this is a crossover with Game of Thrones/ A Song of Fire and Ice. It's complete and very well written , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12397161/1/Same-Song-Different-Verse]] The idea of this one is borrowed from an unfinished story by Plums from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3136818/plums]] . It's a star wars cross over about what if Harry appeared on Felucia right as order 66 is given.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

  AU. Harry Tyrell the counterpart to Harry Potter, born the second son of House Tyrell dares to dream. He will not be a sword at the side of his brother, a knight of the Kingsguard or what else his family plans. He will make his own destiny and show the world what 'Growing Strong' really means. Image is curtsey of NyxxNoxx.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10884033][Ninja Wizard Book 3]] can be read as a stand-alone if you are willing to accept that this Harry is ooc. It is a crossover with Avatar the Last Airbender and is complete at 185k. Harry is not romantically involved in the story but it sets up his pairing for the sequels. The series as a whole is complete (and really long) and is one of my favorites.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255][Whispers in Corners]] is also complete at 64k and is a crossover with Sherlock. It is slash.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] has a few HP crossovers, some complete some not.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

** The stories of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Black-INK/71873/][Mr Black]] are very entertaining if you haven't gotten to read them yet. There are crossovers of Naruto, Marvel and StarTrek just to name a few. I'm sure you can find something to catch your fancy there. The story that spawned all of that world it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]].

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034223/1/A-Discordant-Note][A Discordant Note]] is a HP/GoT crossover. But you may want to read the first part, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]], before you jump into that or you'll be lost otherwise since Noodlehammer changed *a lot* of the canon.
