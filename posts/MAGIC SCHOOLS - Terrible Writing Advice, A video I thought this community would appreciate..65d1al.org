*** There are several themes consistently derided around here that I enjoy, but I don't feel the need the explain the circumstances in my life that make them satisfying reads. So I don't generally make requests myself.

I wish people on this sub would just ignore requests for things they don't like rather than questioning the taste of the requesters and writers. Fiction can be used as a form of catharsis.
