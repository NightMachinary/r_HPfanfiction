***** If you're talking about Harry and Voldemort being equally matched, instead of wizards, versus muggles, try linkffn(At the Hands of the Other by The-Caitiff). Voldemort kidnaps Harry, and they agree to duel to fulfill the prophecy.

Also, in linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux by Clell65619), one of the stories Harry and Neville tell Dumbledore is that the two kept killing each other, but it didn't "take" because they weren't equal.

  Summer after fifth year. Voldemort kidnaps Harry and they agree to fulfill the prophecy once and for all. What starts as a simple duel to the death gets complicated real quick.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

***** Maybe have Voldemort pinned down by some sort of heavy machine gun, sort of a contest of whether his shield can outlast the gun's magazine? At first he's having no trouble, but as the stream of bullets keeps coming, he starts to strain and sweat...

****** Eh, that sounds boring. More like

"Voldemort evokes a swathe of Fiendfyre, which twirls towards the enemy bunker in a helix shape. Inside, the men begin to sweat as the hellish flame licks at the fortified concrete, managing to burn through the flame retardant, but massively slowed. Those who were stationed on the roof die almost instantly in the blaze. Suddenly, he loses control over the spell - In his surety, he stepped into an electrified grid hidden in the grass. He manages to withstand the thousands of volts coursing through his reinforced, alchemized body, the electricity taking the path of least resistance, which are the steel reinforcements in his bones. The three he had with him are not so lucky, and two of them fall to the floor, charred flesh smoking, while the third remains standing, until he is dispatched by a bullet that echoes across the distance from a nearby tower. Voldemort laughs as his own shield deflects the bullet meant for him back, striking the would-be sniper through his own scope. He lifts his wand, and with a commanding gesture, the electrical energy rises from his body, turned into flickering lightning under his comamnd. A series of jerky, unnatural wand movements send bolt after bolt hurtling into the bunker, the electrical grid sparking with every shot as his spell redirects the energy. Suddenly, the lightning becomes unguided, latched on to a large antenna relay on the roof. The arc thickens further and further, and Voldemort screams as the entire output of the base's small nuclear reactor is directed through his body, wand, and finally back into the bunker, whose wiring begins to spark and smoke under the assault. He manages to suppress the flow, and steps back, fingertips singed and eyes bloodshot, figure crackling with unrestrained fury and residual electricity. A wide arc of his wand has the grid become hundreds, thousands of snakes, all of which fixate on him with a hissed command, then plow towards the bunker."
