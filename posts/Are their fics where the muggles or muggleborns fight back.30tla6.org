I'm looking for fics where the muggleborns are a lot more pro-active in the war and even fight back. Bonus points if they include muggle weaponry and/or tactics to deal with the purebloods.

So something similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]].

Does anyone know fics like that?

This is more about muggleborns fighting for their rights within the wizarding community, during and after the war with Voldemort. It was really interesting to me, as I don't read much Hermione POV fic, and was interested in the civil rights aspects. The plot is a bit similar to the one linked, about how those in power can create laws or imprison muggleborns without consequence; it eventually goes into the political aspects and how to fight back or change the system. A few words of warning, it starts out Harry/Hermione and ends up Harry/Severus, but you can easily skip the Snarry scenes without missing anything if that's not something you want to read.

  /'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'/

  Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

Eventually becomes a muggle aid sort of fic, although with the passage of time, this fic isn't really holding up for me personally. I still think it's fairly original though.

I knew of another one at one point, involving a time travelling Hermione, but as I recall, I stopped pretty quickly, finding the fic pretty unbelievable and hard to read a result. The story begins with the muggles nuking the last remaining wizards just as Hermione blasts herself into the past.

I mean.... It's not open warfare, but it is muggles fighting back... And I can't stand this genre (trope?) and it made even me laugh at some points, so I'm assuming it's good...

** there's an hpmor spinoff called following the phoenix in which the muggles do fight back quite effectively (maybe not realistically - up to you)

unfortunately you have to read all of hpmor for following the phoenix to make sense
