** Are you looking for only Harry Potter/Halo crossovers or just good fanfictions in general?

**** some good ones that I can recommend are linkffn(11898648 ), harem fanfic where Harry is a savant at runes and he utilizes them more than his wand.

linkffn(Delenda Est) its a time travel one where Harry goes back in time and tries to change the future while working alongside a younger less insane Bellatrix

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) Harry Tonks romance fic. deals with unspeakable and training to defeat Voldemort. Ending was kinda open if I remember correctly

linkffn(Heart and Soul) Harry/Fleur/Hermione fic. Sirius makes a contract for Harry to marry Fleur to try and get allies. Very good slow build romance.

linkffn(Honor Thy Blood) Author is very good at expanding the use of the Black Family and has Arcturus Black training Harry to beat Voldemort. Would recommend all his fics.

linkffn(FILFY teacher) crossover with High School Dxd. Very long ongoing fanfic. Author puts out very long chapters. Has 2 other Harry Potter fanfics. One a crossover with starwars and another that is almost 2 million words that is a crossover with Marvel.

These are just a few of the ones I've read. Here is a link to my fanfic account to look at my favorite fics and authors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11858817/]]

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
