How much money is a lot of money?

How much money does the average wizard or witch earn?

What are some good starting jobs?

What's the minimum wage (if there even is one)?

How much is the cost of living?


** I usually don't get into details or exact numbers. "Rich" is enough for me, with "richer than" used when needed. I also think that a wizard's standard of living depends on their personal skill with a wand as much as on their job, since they can do so much themselves with spells.

*** A wizard with a penchant for transfiguration like Dumbledore could be considered rich simply by way of so rarely needing to spend money.

**** Exactly. That would make a nice detail/divergence, for those "Lord Potter" stories: Hermione is widely known for learning and mastering every spell she finds, and therefore is seen as rich. She wouldn't be able to spend gold on bribes, but she won't need much gold to live like the Malfoys.

** I think about this alot when reading fics that talk about exact galleon values. The idea that anyone would be a billionaire in the wizarding world (without haviing made money in the muggle world) is completely ridiculous to me, since there aren't really enough wizards to have an economy large enough to accommodate a billionaire. Even having over a million galleons would be pretty crazy.

This is a vague guess, but I'd say that alot of jobs might pay about 100 galleons a week. Living in the wizarding world isn't all that expensive. Travel is free, school is free, there are no power (and water?) bills, labor work would involve fewer people and take far less time than in the muggle world. The only regular costs are food and clothes and maybe rent.

JK freely admits that she didn't plan out the economic part of the HP world, so if you're going to be canon compliant, things aren't gonna make alot of sense.

** 13 old sickles for a bus ride. 6 galleons for a wand(which a managing family can't afford and gives an old one to their youngest son) I'd say Mr. Arthur Weasley earns around 100 - 150 galleons/month. Good starting jobs: Quidditch professional, auror, DoM Unspeakable, "complicated" potions maker. Let's have the minimum wage as 30 galleons / month(Weasley family had 7 kids to support before the twins entered school).

** The only semi-canon number I've seen is 700 galleons a month for a starting job in the DMLE. But, the wizarding economy doesn't really make any sense, since on one hand, that still wouldn't be enough to rent a place in London (which is where the MoM is), yet on the other hand, unicorn horns cost 10 galleons and a wand, 7, so I'm not sure how the Ministry is actually collecting enough tax money to pay hundreds of salaries like that.

** I've spent some time ruminating about this stuff. Take this as one writer's perspective.

There are pieces of information provided in the text that conform and other areas that contradict, so in my thinking I tried to fit things in a relative way.

We have three coins with static values relative to each other.

1 Galleon = 29 Sickles = 493 Knuts [1 Sickle = 17 Knuts]

In relative buying power, you might see that as dollars and cents and little cents, but that doesn't help with large denominations and is impractical for small purchases. As a baseline, I took the Sickle as the base, which makes a Knut roughly having 6 cents of buying power and the Galleon equaling 29 dollars or pounds sterling if you prefer. I realize there's a difference, but in this we're talking about relative buying power. No one uses cents for individual purchases, but a nickel is still good for a gumball and a newspaper like the Daily Prophet being 3 Knuts per copy, 1 Knut for subscribers is still a meaningful deal.

This is a start, at least.

*** 20th century floating average of Gold:Silver (despite being set as 1:15 by Revolution-era US govt) is ~1:47

The historical (like since birth of Christ) Silver:Copper ratio is ~1:110

Assuming the goblins would abide by something near these practical ratios...: .1 oz gold in a Galleon, .2 oz silver in a Sickle, 1.3 oz copper in a Knut

[1:58 Au:Ar, 1:110 Ar:Cu]

Since a Washington quarter weighs ~.2 oz, those hubcap-sized [more like drink coaster-sized] coins were actually Knuts!

"Err... keep the change."

Or... a 'bronze' Knut is .01 oz silver + .194 oz copper As we're talking about relative purchasing power, the actual valuable metal content in goblin-made coins may be half of what's represented, the other half counted as anti-forgery charms and craftsmanship. Either that or they run the conversion from muggle cash at twice the metal value. A Galleon may be .1 oz of gold, but it may cost you $80 to buy one in the 90's when gold traded ~ $400/oz.
