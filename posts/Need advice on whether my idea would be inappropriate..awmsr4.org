I just re-read Miranda Flairgold's Akren Series for the umpteenth time. It's one of my favorites. I've always wished it was finished, but at this point I've accepted it never will be.

This re-read, the grammar and spelling issues annoyed the hell out of me. I tend to forget in between re-reads how glaringly bad some of them are. I want to go through and edit the story. Fixing only grammar and spelling issues, and maybe the occasional nonsense sentence. I normally wouldn't hesitate to do this and just give proper credit where credit is due, but the author specifically stated at the time of writing that they didn't have a beta due to wanting to use the ideas in original stories. I'm unsure what the relation is there, but it's what they said.

So, would it be shitty of me to do an edit and re-upload of the series? It's been 10 years since last update, and 5 years since the author marked a story as a favorite on FFN.


** Since you reread them frequently, save the stories on your computer and then correct the spelling and grammar for your own personal use. As long as you don't republish, you are not infringing on the authors works. I have done this a few times for interesting stories; mostly due to translation from a different language.

*** I might do that. But for me, it's weird recommending someone read it when I know it's issues are pretty glaringly bad in the first few chapters especially.

**** Editing it and keeping it to yourself on your own computer is fine. Re-uploading it without permission could either be construed as plagiarism or even copyright infringement. Do not do that.

***** Plagiarism would be if I didn't cite the original and give all credit to the author. Copyright infringement on fanfiction is a laughable idea. That would imply that it was copyrighted in the first place, which it isn't. Also, all fanfiction could be construed as copyright infringement if that were the case.

If it's a crappy thing to do that's fine. Say that. Don't try to pass it off as way more serious than it is.

****** It's not as simple as you claim. Fan fiction and copyright status is actually a rather complicated and unclear issue. Thus, I said it /could/ be construed as such.

Most arguments in favor of the legality of fan fiction rely on the fact (among other things) that the works are in some way transformative, that is, they're doing something new and original with the source material. What you're talking about is not transformative, but simply editing and reposting someone else's work. The legalities are not very clear and there's not much case law to look at, but it's probable that if you posted something like that to a site like FFN, they would see it as grounds to either delete the story or even ban your account. They don't like messing around with copyright law.

** I could see it being a potential problem. A good place to get further input is [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]. I suspect the experienced people there could give you excellent advice.

** Give credit to the author just say you fixed spelling mistakes. Worst that can happen I'd think is you get told/asked to take it down.

#+end_quote

Some authors use a beta purely for spelling, grammar and such. But others also use a beta to bounce ideas off of. Maybe the author is referencing that.

Do you have a way to contact the author? Have you tried to PM their FFN account for instance?

**** I'd personally not be opposed to you posting a fixed version with express mention of the original work and that the author can contact you if they want it removed/they want the fixed version.
