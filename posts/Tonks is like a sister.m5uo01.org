hey everyon, can you send some fics in which tonks is sort of a sister to harry, even better if andromeda is also in there. preferably 60k+ words.


** No Longer Alone by VonPelt on AO3. Andromeda Tonks gets custody of Harry and Nymphadora takes to big sistering him. If I remember right (binged it at the start of February and it hasn't updated since December) Sirius signed custody over to her at the end of PoA, but it might have been that he brought Harry to the Tonkses instead of handing him over to Hagrid...

**** It's definitely worth a read, as there's a lot of great stuff within. Excellent characterization all around. And honestly it covers everything in the exact right amount of detail. Just a bit too much explicit sex for my liking. Most of the time my opinion is 'set the scene and fade to black.' But I understand why it's written the way it is.

***** Yeah, I feel the same. Tbh I tend to kinda scroll past the sex scenes for the most part, but still, she's an incredible writer.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
