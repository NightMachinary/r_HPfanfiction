I read couple ones and I like the idea. students, enemies, professors would be weary/scared of harry instead of admiring him.

no slash / no harem please


** Weary=/wary

Wary is to be cautious of someone or something is an alert and possibly fearful manner.

Weary is to be tired.

This is repeatedly wrong in so many fics I come across and drives me crazy.

**** No worries, I only speak two myself. Props for being twice as multilingual!

It's just one of those persistent mistakes and pulls me out of the story every time because it's almost the opposite feeling that the author is meaning to convey.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079][The Art of Self-Fashioning]]

He's a feral transfiguration master and terrifies many people.

In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

It's the only one I can think of where he is just genuinely unnerving. That's a shame though. I'd love to see more of stuff like this.

*** I totally agree with you, I would seriously love to read more of a bad ass Harry. He managed to unsettle both Dumbledore and Voldemort in "The art of Self Fashioning" and subsequently vanquished them

  When a game of revenge is taken too far, Bella is sold into marriage to a man she despises. While struggling to fit society's mold of a weak woman, she must navigate the treacherous waters of being a mob wife without drowning in the process. Mobward. Possessiveward. Sexyward.

** He's bloody fearsome in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12692794/1/Whelped][Whelped]], though not necessarily in the way you might expect, and it's also a one shot, but goshdarn it if it ain't good.

  AU - Harry defeats Voldemort in fifth year, so why is Dumbledore now dead set on sending him to Azkaban? The lies force him to take matters into his own hands. Now he's after revenge and it starts with the aurors trying to take him to the horrific prison. For some reason Snape is one of he few he doesn't kill. Time travel. No romance or pairs.
