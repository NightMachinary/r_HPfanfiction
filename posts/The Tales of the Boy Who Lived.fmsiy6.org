The Boy Who Lived series is a massively popular book series in the wizarding world. There are few children that haven't read them, even adults seem to enjoy them. The author of the books has made no attempts to hide that these books were merely fiction, but all stories carry a grain of truth.

I'd like to read a story where Harry actually had the crazy childhood described in the Boy Who Lived series. He joins Hogwarts already having saved princesses and already having destroyed undead armies.
