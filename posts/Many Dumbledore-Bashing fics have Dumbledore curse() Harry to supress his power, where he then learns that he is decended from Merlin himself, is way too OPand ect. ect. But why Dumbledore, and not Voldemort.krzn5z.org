#+TITLE: Many Dumbledore-Bashing fics have Dumbledore curse(?) Harry to supress his power, where he then learns that he is decended from Merlin himself, is way too OPand ect. ect. But why Dumbledore, and not Voldemort?

** I think most of it is based around accessibility: Voldemort's body was destroyed from the rebounded killing curse so unless he did it before casting the killing curse, theres not much chance for him to do anything to Harry. Dumbledore on the other hand knows where Harry is put and has some sort of access to him pratically everyday once he starts Hogwarts.

*** Pretty much this. And since Voldemort intended to kill Harry every time they met, from that Halloween night to the end, not mess about with his magic, what would be the point?

Now, I could accept it being an unexpected side effect of getting hit with the Killing Curse as a toddler (if written up properly) with Dumbledore being "merely" negligent in not seeing it or doing nothing as opposed to malicious.

*** Yeah, why would you bother with somehow bindng harry's magic if you're planning on hitting him with the killing curse. He has better things to do with his night than waste time on pointless spells/rituals.

** Well, bashing Fics are usually stupid in the first place. In most case, the author just wanted to write a specific scene (like Harry monologuing in front of an audience how Dumbledore tried to control him, and how he broke free bla bla bla . . .) and just write a quick plot to "justify" this scene.

** Because Voldemort couldn't do anything other then possess people while in his wraith form.
