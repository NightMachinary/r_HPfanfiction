Potter! Tell me, what would I get if I added isopropyl alcohol to an infusion of aloe vera? “I don't know, sir” You don't know? Well, let's try again... What, Mr. Potter, would you do if I asked you to create a synthetic sponge? “I don't know, sir.” And what is the difference between bleach and sodium hypochlorite I don't know, sir. Pity... clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?

For your information, Potter, isopropyl and aloe vera make a hand sanitizer so powerful that it doesn't matter if many stores have sold out of commercially produced brands. A Synthetic sponge is made of three basic ingredients: cellulose derived from wood pulp, sodium sulphate, and hemp fiber. Other materials needed are chemical softeners, which break the cellulose down into the proper consistency, bleach, and dye. It can be used quite successfully when toilet paper is unavailable. As for bleach and sodium hypochlorite, they are the same thing, which also goes by the name of Clorox. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?

**** "What should we do, Lucius?!"

This was the perfect opportunity. "Minister, the muggleborns and those who associate with the muggle world risk not only exposure to the muggle world at large but also our very lives! We must further separate from the muggles and forbid contact with them...until the crisis is over."

"Yes, I'm sure that the Wizengamot will understand that we must temporarily quarantine ourselves away from them. Then, when this is all done with we'll return to normal."

"Of course, Minister." /Over my dead body/, Lucius thought to himself.

***** Yes. This. This would be an excellent opener for a story set in this time. Hermione would organize some study groups that can be done using in an “online” fashion utilizing a modified protean charm. I could see Lucius seeing this as an opportunity to meet his goals without Voldemort and Draco swaggering around “my father says a Muggle started this whole plague by eating a bat! Can you imagine?” This is great stuff. Thank you for responding

*** I'm working under the assumption that it's some how being taught in a Wizarding version of an online class. I also did a Public Service Announcement where Hermione busts Ron and Harry using the Marauders Map and invisibility cloak to sneak out of the castle and violate the stay at home order. She then educated them on how irresponsible they were and that they could infect and kill Dumbledore. Snape then compares Harry to his father who he says during the swine flu outbreak James spread germs too.

****** I was like 12-13 at the time, and my brother had to go to the camp medical site to get tested cause he was warm. Apparently they made him go sit in the local creek/river to cool off so he wouldn't be so hot.

What happened to bring it to said camp was a group of scouts had been in Mexico like a week or two prior, and just came to camp like nothing happened.
