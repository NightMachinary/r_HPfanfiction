Hey all, looking for a particular Severitus fic. From what I recall, Dumbledore made Harry and Snape stay in Dumbledore's vacation home over the summer before Harry's 6th year to learn Occlumency. They end up forming a bond but have to keep pretending to hate each other at school, so they write letters to each other over the year. Oh, and Snape is a huge Beatles fan.

Thanks in advance.

  An accident the summer before 6th year puts Dumbledore's plans for Harry in motion sooner than planned. Will an unexpected truce with Snape better prepare Harry for what is to come? A Snape mentors Harry fic with all the regular players. AU after OOTP.

**** Hi! I was searching for something similar and stumbled upon your post and ended up reading Moments of Impact and it's 4 sequels. And I have to thank you! It's probably the best thing I've ever read!

From your description Moments of Impact was what you were looking for, because if there is another fic out there with the exact same plot then they copied this one! I don't think anyone could come up with a plot that included a vacation home, Snape and Harry bonding while learning occlumency and most of all /Snape being a huge Beatles fan/ !!

***** Hey, this comment made me take another look at that fic, and it is indeed the one I was searching for. I don't know why but it was seemingly unfamiliar when I tried to read it. Thanks for pushing me to take another look!

****** Ahaha, did you like it? Did you read the sequels? I think you just were confused because of the start, as it took many chapters I think to get to the actual plot! It has happened to me many times throughout the years!
