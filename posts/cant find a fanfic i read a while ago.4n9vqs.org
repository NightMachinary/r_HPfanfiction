I can't find a fanfic that I read quite a while ago. Its a post war fic. Harry has low self esteem because of having previous lovers who didn't really think he was very good in the sac. He then meets Draco who is astounded by his hangups (caused by those failed relationship). I would like to read it again but can't remember the name of it. Help!!!

  HPDM slash, HPOCs as background. Harry, told that he's too ugly and not good enough at sex to keep a wizard lover, tries to compromise by getting better, and then by one night stands with Muggles. He's not happy, but he's content, until Draco Malfoy proposes a casual relationship. Trust Malfoy to ruin everything. COMPLETE.
