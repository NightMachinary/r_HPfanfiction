I'm looking for fanfiction where the main character has psychic-like abilities (visions and sensations of the future or present brought on by touch or channeling; odd abilities slightly tangential to canon magic). I'm not talking Luna Lovegood's wrackspurts or Trewlany's tea leaves, I want a character to struggle with being weird in a world of magic (not awesomely super-powered. weird.)

I'm excited to see if anyone can think of a fic like this! Thanks in advance!

PS No not like linked souls stuff (IE Harry and Voldemort, or soul bonds).


** There's Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent), I really liked the premise and the beginning but the ability was way underutilized when it'd have actually mattered.
