I'm wondering if anyone knows of Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger stories similar to Whom the Gods Would Destroy by ianthewaiting.

Pretty much, I'm looking for dystopian-like stories that involve Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger fighting and falling in love throughout the course of the story itself. In my opinion, Whom the Gods Would Destroy is excellent but being that there aren't many (good) Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger stories to begin with, finding stories like Whom the Gods Would Destroy is proving to be very difficult. Any help is much appreciated!

  The end of the world has come. Millions dead, magic waning, Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley are the last people left in Britain---left to pick up the pieces of their once great civilisation. Why were they spared? Who is responsible for the death of a nation? These are the mysteries left as a legacy for two lost and lonely people. DH-EWE, character death, non-canon elements
