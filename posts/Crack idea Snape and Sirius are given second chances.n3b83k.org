[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/my2xmc/cornelius_fudge_is_actually_sirius_black_in/][I'm following my previous post about Fudge being Sirius and a comment on that thread about Umbridge being Snape.]]

Death can manipulate time after-life. It runs in hus whim.

So when Severus Snape died during Hogwarts battle and Sirius Black died died in DoM battle, they met and Death gave them second chance.

They are both send to 1990 one month after Fudge started his ministry. So every position is already filled up. Sirius replaces Fudge's soul and Snape replaces Umbridge's soul. In this new timeline there exists another version of Snape and Black as well. (ie, OG Snape and Sirius looks like Umbridge and Fudge in the new timeline).

Now that Black and Snape are minister and undersecretary, they still argue all the time. The whole ministry is utterly baffled and thinks they are like the old married couples who bickers all the time.


** *Snape takes one look in the mirror and sees who he is, before killing himself*

edit: in fact, make this part of it! Snape constantly trying to kill himself and Death constantly getting annoyed by reviving him.

*** Solution: Death takes their ability to kill themselves. They can only die after Voldemort is dead.
