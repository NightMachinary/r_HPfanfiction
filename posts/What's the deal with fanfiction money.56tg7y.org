In the actual stories, we see the Weasley vault having only a few sickles. So, therefor we can assume that is enough to support a family, if only barely. Owl post is only a knut, as shown by Hagrid. So, why do people keep making everything cost galleons? I think it's far more likely that the majority of things cost sickles or knuts, while Galleons are reserved for the higher-priced things, like houses, wands, ect.

So yeah. Why do you think they keep blowing up the money system to unbelievable proportions?


** Because it costs 5 Pounds to buy a Galleon. This, regardless of the actual worth of a Galleon on the wizarding market, makes many people think that it must therefore be that it actually is worth 5 Pounds and no matter what you did something that costs a Galleon must be worth exactly 5 Pounds.

It does not help it that, both in the books and in some extra material, there are ... amounts of money, being thrown around that would seem rather implausible had a Galleon actually been worth much. The cost of the Firebolt is one example, and the given salaries of hit wizards and aurors are another (hit wizard /trainees/ are supposed to earn 700 Galleons per month to start with). So, in the end, it boils down to the fact that Madame Rowling is not very good at maths and it shows with things like these and some people take that at face value instead of rebuilding it to actually fit what they are writing.

** The Weasleys are essentially living month-to-month. The small amount in the Vault isn't to show that Arthur makes nothing; it's to show that he barely makes enough to provide for the family, with almost nothing left to save in case of emergency.

If you saw a family of nine people in the UK today and observed that they had a hundred pounds in their bank account, that wouldn't mean that a few hundred pounds is enough to support a family. What you observe in the account is prior income, minus prior expenses and cash on hand.

For instance, it's possible that they had to gather their school supplies a few days before Arthur got paid and a few days after most of their other expenses hit, and that much money is barely enough to keep them fed in the meantime. Or maybe it's just after Arthur got paid and the sum represents the bulk of his salary.

Or maybe they keep most of their money at home and the vault is primarily for school supply money.

It does suggest that "a very small pile of silver Sickles and just one gold Galleon" is a non-negligible amount. I usually give it on the order of 200 USD today, but only as a rough guide -- some things are trivial with magic and difficult without.

Also, it might be incredibly cheap to run a household with magic. What expenses do you have? Rent, food, health care, new clothing? Her Majesty's government probably doesn't assay taxes against the Burrow thanks to muggle-repelling charms. Food can be increased in quantity with magic, so a ten pound grocery bill to feed a family of nine might be reasonable. Charms can handle many injuries, and with children like Fred and George, you can bet Molly Weasley is adept. Clothing can be repaired and possibly refitted with magic. You're mostly left with potions supplies -- and the Burrow has a large garden, so perhaps they grow their own more often than not.

It could be the case that purchasing school supplies is the biggest expense the Weasley family normally has, since it requires purchasing items from other people.

So just making /good/ food out of /nothing/ is impossible. Which implies you can make bad food out of nothing and can turn something into good food.

The way this is set up it seems most likely people with the right abilities would just have some preserved food and make more to eat when they need it.

Which is something I have played with in the past. For instance, I've had a fic where duplicating food isn't high fidelity enough to maintain its nutritional value, and a locked-in sect of purebloods don't start producing new food until it was too late and they started dropping like flies. (Though that was in the background, not explicitly stated.)

Another idea I've toyed around with is: mages get more than physical nutrition from food. Duplicated food doesn't give you magical nutrition. Muggles could live on it with no ill effects, but mages would get sick and die.

Or a mage exodus where they sustain themselves with just a little bit of food endlessly duplicated for the decades until they get stable food production, and it just works.

But that's not canon.

** Agreed. The idea that wands (monopolised by Ollivander and containing valuable ingredients) cost 35 dollars each is absurd.

A subscription to the Times 7£ a week, or 1£ per paper. (Obviously this is an imperfect approximation to the Prophet, but considering economies of scale and the cost of owl delivery, I'd say 1£ is on the low end.) Then 1£ = knut. So by that estimate a galleon is 500£!

That estimate means that a wand costs over 3000£, which explains why the Weasleys generally can't afford a wand, even on a department head's salary. Also, 1000£ for school supplies for five kids, which I'd say is on the low end for a year's supplies at a fancy boarding school. It also means the Triwizard reward is a respectable 500,000£, which might be enough capital to set up a business in the wizarding CBD. The omnioculars are now a truly eye-watering 5000£.

This valuation does mean that there's probably no Potter family vault lying around for an angsty sixth-year to claim over summer. The 'mounds of Galleons' in vault 687 would be worth millions--hardly what you'd put in a trust vault.

~

In the end though, these are internal inconsistencies: a set of omnioculars is always going to be more expensive than a wand. We want to how much purchasing power muggles have.

If you go by the 5£ exchange rate, muggleborns would find Hogwarts to be very cheap indeed. A well-off middle-class family would be Lucius Malfoy-rich, to say nothing of Finch-Fletchley, who could probably lay waste to the wizard economy if he wished. I'm personally kinda uncomfortable with that (it reminds me of all the 'lol aren't wizards stupid' fics out there).

A >100£ exchange rate would even things out a bit, but make Hogwarts too expensive for the worst-off muggleborns.

*** I've always found wand prices ridiculous. Phoenix feather, dragon heartstring, and unicorn tail hairs.

Those three things are so rare we only see one each in the books, with the exception of the Dragon's.

So, they're rare.

That alone should cost ton's of money, and we haven't even gone into wood prices.

Add that to the fact that it's a /magic wand/ for god's sake, and you have a /lot/ more than $35.

An exchange rate of £25 or £100 works for the wand, but doesn't work for nearly any other price in the books. Is it really likely that Harry would casually shell out £5000 for each of his friends, or that Hermione would take such a gift in stride?

*** Cash flow is king. I imagine Arthur's job pays decently well -- it's just that he's supporting a family of 7 (9 before Bill and Charlie left) on a single income. The Weasleys probably live paycheck to paycheck, so they spend a fair amount on a weekly basis, but extra expenses beyond that like school supplies can be a big problem for them. I also imagine that the end of the summer is a VERY lean time for them because for most of the year it's just Arthur and Molly. Since Hogwarts is free there would be a big difference in expenses during the year versus during the summer. They probably save up all through the year and then blow through their savings feeding the kids when summer comes round.

**** Not by a huge amount. Mrs Weasley withdrew something like two galleons to pay for school supplies for five children. At 500 pounds to the galleon, that's two hundred per person, which is a fair amount but perhaps not excessive if you've got to give them everything they'll need for the next ten months. Especially since that includes supplies for Ron and Percy's pets and a potions kit for Ginny.

The larger problem is that it prevents you from making transactions smaller than a pound or so. The least granular currency I'm aware of is Norway's, whose smallest increment is worth around 10p.

**** In the 1990s, gold prices were around 200-250 GBP/oz. A 2 or 2.5-ounce pure-gold coin is on the large side for a coin, but not terribly so (maybe 2 mm thick and 5 cm diameter?).

On the other hand, if a galleon is only 5 GBP, that implies a pure-gold coin would be about 1/40th or 1/50th of an ounce, which would be miniscule (a third the diameter of a penny?).

There are other options of course. They might not be pure gold, the exchange rate might be fixed by law rather than metallic value, etc.

** The fact that the Weasleys are poor only makes me wonder how the heck wizarding economics work in the first place. They don't have traditional utilities like electricity or water to pay. I don't recall anything similar to a mortgage or home insurance is ever mentioned in canon as existing in their world. They literally can make many of the mundane things they need appear out of thin air. The only real expense they seem to have is school, and JKR has said that Hogwarts doesn't charge tuition, so then we're only left with school supplies.

Books are easy to share, and I believe there's evidence that except for Chamber of Secrets when Lockhart had them buy his entire series of expensive books brand new, the books don't change much from year to year. So their kids would be using their older siblings' books and robes as well.

So unless the wizarding world has some insane tax rates or something, there's no reason the Weasleys should be as poor as they're portrayed to be. Especially after the older children get jobs of their own and become self-sufficient.

*** Just because things like electricity/insurance/etc aren't mentioned doesn't necessarily mean that none of these costs exist. I wouldn't be surprised if they owned their home and didn't pay for electricity, but the concept of insurance has existed for millennia and insurance has we know it has existed for ~400 years.

Plus we don't know if there are other costs associated with running a wizarding home. Things like clothes and home items were a lot more expensive prior to industrialism, the wizarding world is too small to support the mass production of magical radios.

The problem is that the Weasleys were supporting 9 people on the income of a mid-level manager. And they seemed more financial comfortable with each passing year. The most difficult year seemed to be when they had 5 kids in school with 1 kid starting school, and needed multiple sets of textbooks

** Ok. Let's do some math. [[https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/police-officer][Starting police salary in 2016 is around 21,000£]]. A pound in 1995 is worth 1.80£ today. So if pay matched inflation, a police officer made £11,667 in 1995. Trainee Hit Wizard salary is 700 galleons, or £3,500. So pay for police- which I am assuming is roughly constant compared to average pay between any government and economy- is 3.33 times larger in the muggle world compared to the wizarding world. However, given Britain's Gini coefficient of 36.2 in 2004 (the closest year I could find to compare). More experienced economists than I could probably use that to find the highest pay possible for a person in Magical Britain. Just from looking at it though, there definitely won't be any billionaires, and possibly only one or two magical millionaires.

*** Checking your math, the previous claim said trainee HWs make 700 galleons monthly, to which you're comparing a yearly salary. So Trainee Hit Wizards would make that £3,500 monthly, or £42,000/year to a rookie plod's ~£15,000 (since cops based in London, as Hit Wizards likely are given wizard rapid travel methods, get a cost of living bonus).

Hit Wizards, by that note, are making a little less than three times as much as a cop -- which, given that their duties may, in fact, be more intense than a rookie plod (given the reserved bed at St. Mungo's that comes with it), may be accurate.
