[Request]

Does anyone remember some fanfic by an author Grimhook? They wrote a couple short stories, one about a day with H/R/H/G, one about a fight between Ron and Hermione, and then 2 "books" after Book 7 with Ginny in her last year being taught by a vampire at school, and one with Harry and Ron as Aurors hunting Nightshades?

I remember them pretty fondly, but can't seem to find them anywhere again.

** I first read it as "Griphook", and I can kind of see it: /Griphook of Gringotts and the Sword of Gryffindor/ or /Griphook of Gringotts and How I Almost Got Our People's Ancient Relic Back/.

** Update...I actually found it...Stories written by Grimmrook, so I was pretty close....am I allowed to post a link to muggle net? The author's stories are excellent, albeit 2008-ish.
