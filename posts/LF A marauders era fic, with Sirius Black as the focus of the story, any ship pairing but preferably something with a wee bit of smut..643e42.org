  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  When the Marauders fight, fangirls cry and teachers take a breath of fresh air. "You don't mind me sitting here, do you?" I looked up and found my crush staring down at me. "I - erh, what?" Sirius Black winked. "Good. Don't need bloody James anyway. Hi," he said, turning to me as he sat down, "be my new best friend?" Don't judge me, but I might have fainted a little bit there.
