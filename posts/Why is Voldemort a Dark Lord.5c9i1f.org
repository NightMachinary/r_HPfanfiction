In the books near as I can tell his main goal is immortality. And then there's linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) where he wanted to be a teacher, and became a Dark Lord because of a drunken escapade. Yes it's a comedy but I feel it brings up an interesting point. Why wage a war and try to take over the country when your main goal (immortality) has been accomplished?


** Good point. I think immortality was indeed one of Voldemort's main goals, but definitely not his only one.

He was obsessed with his heritage, wealth and power. That culminated into a quest for domination; in his eyes, pureblood wizards were superior to muggles and muggle-borns. Because of his sociopathic tendencies and his abilities to manipulate people, he was able to quickly attract followers and thus enforce that ideology. And that, of course, ultimately led to the first war.

Immortality was a big part of what made Tom Riddle Lord Voldemort, but his hunger for domination was what made him the Dark Lord.

Does that make any sense?

**** Not sure about pureblood supremacy, but I think that he believed in there being power in bloodlines (see the Chamber of Secrets). Pureblood supremacy is based on that to an extent and it was quite useful for Voldemort to gain power, but I wouldn't be sure that he actually believed in pureblood supremacy.

The choice of the halfblood Harry Potter over the pureblood Neville Longbottom is an interesting one. Part of me says that Voldemort saw something of himself in Harry's heritage and thought that he could be a more powerful opponent than Neville and thus must be eliminated when he's a toddler.

  "Well I think it is often the case that *the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects*, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does."

he despises his own muggle heritage and constantly tries to get as much proximity to magical and pureblood society as possible- appropriating slytherin's ring and locket, storing the cup at gringotts, etc.

**** I believe he thought himself superior and more special upon finding out his heritage (being special and unique are important to TMR). That belief likely stems from the idea that old families equal power with Slytherin being the oldest and greatest and as such other old families must also be powerful (or at least more so than muggleborns).

However, that doesn't rule out that he awknowledged the power that purebloods had polititically and financially, both of which would help in his desire for domination as well as the darker books and information that purebloods may have access to that would assist in his desire for immortality.

The fact that he ends up as a Master over pureblood familes that now, kneel and grovel at his feet likely reinforces his belief of superiority.

One thing to note is that Voldemort went after Harry Potter, a halfblood, and not Neville Longbottom, a pureblood. Whether this is because of power (or potential power & chance of becoming a greater threat) or because HP is closer to the end of September ("as the seventh month dies") is never mentioned (afaik).

**** Well, yeah, I think he despised muggles: hate brought on early because of his miserable stays in the orphanage and the death of his +muggle+ mother, which in his mind could have been prevented. I believe he considered anything less than pure blood as weak and despicable.

But that's just how I've always interpreted it. There are looooads of other motives (thank you, jkr) and I think you can absolutely make a case for the 'means to an end'-scenario.

** Voldemort is a Dark Lord that was set on becoming something horrible from his childhood and I think Dumbledore only enhanced these traits. If you look at Voldemort's interactions and life, you see very clear signs of serious personality disorder, all very high-maintenance in themselves. Taken together, you just get a toxic cocktail of dysfunctionate individual completely unable to relate to anyone else. (Narcissism, ASPD, BPD, PTSD)

I think it's also important to mention that Voldemort's goal is not necessarily immortality. Immortality would be his ambition, on the same term as Power or fame would be considered ambitions as they are too broad a term to consider proper goals. Rather, consider Voldemort under the angle that he's someone with serious abandonment issues. He /wants/ to be recognized and acknowledged. His top marks, his facade, and every single thing he did was overdone.\\
Being a teacher was not what he wanted, he wanted the fame and recognition brought by teaching, he wanted to feel wanted and powerful, which one would get when in the ability to teach young, malleable minds.

Immortality became his ambition because Voldemort developed an thorough phobia of death (his boggart would be his death self), but also because it represented the ultimate abandonment, and he could not cope with that. But his goal has never been Immortality, is goal was to be recognized and acknowledged.

** I've always believed making a horcrux, tearing apart your soul and stuff equates to tearing apart your humanity and all that jazz. With that in mind there is nothing stopping you if you decide to kill, if you decide people aren't worthy and all that. Basically if you became a giant rage monster with no limits what would happen? Now what happens if that was a paitent, cunning but insane monster who uses his brilliance to achieve whatever comes to mind.

I've often wondered about a fic where Voldemort tears out his remorse, guilt and other redeeming things and places them in one horcrux. If this horcrux would possesses someone then you have a good Tom Riddle without the evilness but drowning in guilt due to the possession.

** This brings up another question I like to ask, why the hell did the Death eaters even follow Voldemort? Like what could he possibly promise them that they couldn't achieve by changing the law the legal way?

Obviously it had to do with muggleborns, probably a lot more than that realistically as I don't really imagine the death eaters as the magical KKK.

Magical society is:

- *Not accepting of minorities* - Werewolves, Lupin quit in book 3 because he knew he would get shit for being a werewolf. Hell the werewolf law passed at some point by whatever the law making body is. Hermione was mailed poison because someone thought she was dating Harry, so there might already be a large anti-muggleborn sentiment, or just a bunch of retarded moms who want their daughter to marry Harry, or people who just want someone to hate on.
- *Really stupid legally* - The entire board of governors was somehow threatened into submission by one man. It was an open secret the minister was accepting bribes, no one tried to get him fired for that to our knowledge, so it's not too much of a jump that anti-bribery/corruption laws don't exist. Hell book 5 Umbridge manages to get about 50 stupid decrees passed which most made no sense and made school worse. They let umbridge massacre muggleborns in those trials in book 7, you could argue that was because the ministry was under death eater control, but I'd go on a stretch and say not that many people really cared and let it happen as there was no Dumbledore to say "Wtf people?".
- *Really stupid legally: The Press* - It's blatantly obvious they can legally print lies as long as it was once the truth, Hermione had to threaten skeeter to get the Prophet to stop printing slander. Book seven we see the ministry prints the Prophet, a few lines make it appear that might of been a new thing, but I doubt it. Chances are the media is completely state controlled considering the slander Harry faces in book 5.

Conclusion: Magic society is xenophobic and retarded or very inefficient about passing actually useful laws (so a normal government). Hogwarts was in no way an accurate representation of average magical people except for the Slytherins.

Realistically I assume Rowling didn't use the legal system that is fanon, so rich land owning purebloods probably didn't have absolute control over law, just a large amount. Still means that the rich controlled the vote. We never properly learn who is absurdly rich other than presumably the Malfoys, and the Lestranges based on their vault. Either way that's a lot of bribery and threatening power, so the rich purebloods still had control of the law making body.

Literally following Voldemort (at least the second time) was the worst choice the purebloods could have made. They could have legally gotten away with killing the muggleborns if they were so inclined without Voldemort. So again what the fuck could Voldemort have promised the death eaters to make them all become terrorists as it clearly was not only the death of muggleborns or they are really that stupid.

The death eaters could have made Voldemort the legislation writer or some shit and they got his bills through the law making body if he was a smart villain. And in that case he could of probably gotten exceptional pay to write those bills and used the money for research allowing him to further his quest for true immortality.

Now to really answer your question: Rowling hadn't thought out just what the villains existed for, and was forced to choose an answer which became killing muggleborns.

Also one last major assumption if you are like me and only consider the books cannon as you haven't read any of the other stuff: There is no evidence to say they are not still killing muggleborns for stealing magic in the epilogue, in theory the government is still allowing that and all the MC's just don't care anymore as magical society is too xenophobic and refuses to give them their rights back or it's just too much effort to give them their rights back. (Fyi I don't believe this, I just realized under my assumptions it totally works.)

TL;DR: No one would ever follow Voldemort to only kill Muggleborns.

*** Holy shit thank you these are my thoughts too. Rowling has made the wizarding world entirely inconsistent and it's not at all rational.i agree that the purebloods could have done so much harm to the muggleborns through the legal system and other means, the entire wizarding society of Britain is controlled by these pure families. The ministry is incompetent and I get the feeling that most in the wizarding world look down on muggles and muggleborns(eg Mr Robert's in the world cup etc) and it's ridiculous how they can just erase anyone's memory without consequences. I would love to see wizarding America or Japan, or at least a rational world.

*** I think you have it backwards, actually. Oh, I think you are right about their legal system, government, and media being fucked up, but in terms of Voldemort's motivations and why people follow him, I think it is the reverse.

I view Voldemort as someone who wanted beyond anything else to be powerful, in control, and recognized by others (in the sense of feared, rather than respected). He learned to accomplish this growing up in the orphanage by using his magic to dominate and terrify the other children. Applying this to the magical world, he was a powerful wizard, but he couldn't just terrify, torture, or kill everyone on his own.

I think that ultimately he saw the existing prejudice in magical society against muggleborns as a means to an end. It was something that he could use to twist and manipulate others, like Malfoy, into following him, with promises of what a world under his rule would be like. Whether that was a promise that they would be allowed to kill with impunity or would have privileged status or have some other benefit, it doesn't really matter.

** I think his obsession with beating death lead to everything else, but his lust of power also played a big part - from what we've seen of him, he was always trying to maximize his power, be it magical, influence on others, social, and so on.

My personal headcanon is that after he started making horcruxes his lust of power and fear of death went to overdrive - that's why he started on the path to conquest, to destroy all his enemies (Dumbledore, the ministry) so that would accomplish both of his goals - he would rule and he would be safe.

But the horcrux process apparently had unforseen side-effects (especially repeated 6 times, lol). He slowly lost his ability to reason and after his disembodiment, it's anyone's guess what was going through his head. But yeah, my feel is that his mind slowly unraveled, that his thoughts were only on how to survive, how to kill his enemies and flashes of insight of half-cocked plans to accomplish those two goals.

** Here's my take on him:

Voldemort does not actually care about blood purity (he's a half blood and he knows it) or wizard politics, only power and revenge. The blood purist faction was simply easy to manipulate to achieve his goals and had a ready source of monetary assets. He despises being weak and will do everything he can to secure power and ease his fear of death and enhance his sense of superiority and security. He also feels he's special and better than everyone because of his talent. He was also simply angry at the wizarding and muggle establishment for how he was treated (he was essentially a muggleborn in the wizard's eyes) and simply wanted to lash out, which is another reason he chose to pit the opposing old families against each other rather than rally the muggleborn. Opening the CoS and attacking muggleborn was one of his opening moves used to incite the latent conflict that he would use to manipulate his chosen power base. His ultimate goal was to force all of magical Britain to choose sides while tricking them into killing themselves off by prolonging the war before massacring his own (conveniently marked) followers, eliminating the competition (Albus and the Prophecy Child), and usurping control of what remained, thus creating a society free of the blood-purist bigotry he was subjected to as a teen while securing himself a position of ultimate power and wealth. However, due to the damage to his sanity caused by his horcruxes, he has gotten far more invested in the whole ‘evil dark lord' act than he intended causing him to risk his grand-plan in favor of satisfying his increasingly worsening anger issues; not to mention he never really expected his death eaters to so handily win their war.

I do think its a bit strange the route he took... especially with the knowledge of Grindlewald. I would think he would aim a bit more "grey" in his goals, and try and play both the lighter and darker, pureblood and muggleborn sides of things.

** Imagine if you would, that everything you ever had was taken from you. You'd be pissed right? Now imagine that you never had it all.

That was Tom Riddle's /life/ until he had magic. He was a number, a kid who no one truly gave a damn about, and when he got magic, people started to listen. People obeyed, they understood, and they /feared/. Riddle, when he was first found by Dumbledore, should have NEVER been allowed into Hogwarts. If we assume that Harry's years at hogwarts (Excluding the events that threatened Harry) as normal, then it doesn't surprise me that there is a whole Department of Magical Law. Bullying, favoritism, and a headmaster who doesn't give a fuck. I mean seriously? A basilsk is out in the castle, and there isn't a damn thing done? But I digress.

Tom Riddle goes to Hogwarts. He /excels/ like we are talking Doing things with a wand that Dumbledore would be able to and not much else. At the same exact time, he is surrounded by a professor who wants to use him (slughorn) another that from past evidence plays favorites with The Gryffindors, and at least a headmaster who is never really present.

Not to mention the kids. The kids who are going to be children, loud, mean, arrogant, and at times confusing. Especially to a kid who probably has a genius level IQ, several mental issues that would probably be an issue anyway, and is surrounded by kids who will push his buttons, constantly.

So we got a potential sociopathic genius, who is surrounded by people who will grate his already failing mental facilities, and we expect there not to be a mass murderer who enjoys the pain, suffering, and death of those who are against him? Im more surprised that the kid didnt snap completely, and murder absolutely everyone. Instead he turns his hatred on the population that in honesty could take it can still recover. is it terrible? yes. is it wrong hell yes. But its the difference between a Stalin, who murdered over 10 million people because they fucking existed, and a Hitler, who murdered at best 7 million because they didnt share his perfect world view.
