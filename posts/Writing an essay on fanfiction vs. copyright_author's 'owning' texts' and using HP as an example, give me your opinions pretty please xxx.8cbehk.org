** Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc][Everything is a Remix]] by Kirby Ferguson.

I also like the takes that Overly Sarcastic Productions has on works like Dante's Divine Comedy (It's a Historical/Religious Self-Insert with heavy amounts of bashing) And the Arthurian Mythos (Again, fanfiction to the point of the Star Wars Expanded Universe)

*** Cannot recommend this enough. We watched this in my Entertainment Law class, even. The copyright system is really what's to blame here imho; the problems go way back. There was just a court case last year where a cheerleading company copyrighted a certain stripe pattern on the uniforms and furthered the boundary of what is copyright-able which is insane.

  HOWEVER: how can JK trademark words like Muggle and Hogwarts, when she didn't invent them?
#+end_quote

By the simple fact that a trademark is NOT related to copyright and does not require original invention.

  So obviously, fanfic writers are free to use characters, trademarked words (e.g. Muggle, Hogwarts, Expelliarmus) settings from a piece of source material under the Fair Usage policy AS LONG AS they are not making money off it.
#+end_quote

IANAL, but I am pretty certain that this is a misconception. Noncommercial use is not automatically fair use, nor is making money of a story automatically not. In fact, I doubt that whether or not someone makes money off the fanfic would have much bearing on its legal status. There are special consideration for educational and scholarly use, but they don't apply here. That said, as far as I know, the question of whether fanfic that doesn't reuse the original's text but reuses characters and settings is fair use has not been tested in a US court, so the answer is really that we don't know.

Also,

#+begin_quote
  But if someone is making money off distributing/publishing a fanfiction or selling fan art, they risk being sued for plagarism.
#+end_quote

Plagiarism is not a crime in any jurisdiction that I am familiar with. False advertising or fraud might be, but that's different, and in any case, a prominent disclaimer can address that.

--------------

Now, regarding the way things ought to be, I don't think that copyright ought to extend to abstract concepts like characters and settings in the first place. The text ought to be covered: reprinting a chunk of /Philosopher's Stone/ would be a breach. Whereas, a fanfic that doesn't use a significant amount of the original's text ought not require a Fair Use defence in the first place, because it ought to be, for legal purposes, an unrelated creative work.

*Edit:* Reorganised.

More fundamentally, this point confuses the moral and the legal. Is this essay an essay about the morality of intellectual property, or the current legal status? Either way, it should be remembered that "fair use" is US law only. Other jurisdictions approach the matter differently.

To answer the question on the moral level:

Ultimately, I see no fundamental difference between mental and physical labour. If a person makes a physical object, society ought to recognise that the object belongs to them and other people can't take it. I apply the same rule to the product of mental labour such as creative writing.

People will often raise the point of deprivation: if you take a physical object, you deprive the original owner of it. They say there is no such deprivation in intellectual property. But I disagree: the deprivation is that you're depriving the author of the right to maintain a single, authoritative version of the works. Just think of how many times people on this sub have uttered the phrase "I suppose X is technically canon but I prefer things like in fanfic Y" or "I didn't realise X wasn't canon because it's so ubiquitous in the fandom". If you write a character or world, and then another person uses that character/world in a way you feel is wrong, there is a definite feeling that your work has been damaged by the inferior use - a kind of intellectual vandalism.

This is doubly true of "fanfic of a fanfic". At least JKR has some level of "intellectual protection" by virtue of the fact that everyone recognises her as the original source of the universe, though there are many fans who are now rejecting that authority and (for example) declaring new HP works non-canon simply because they dislike them. A fanfic writer has none of that protection - all fanfic writers are on the same level, all of it derivative of the original author's work, and if someone takes your idea there is no sense in which the fandom recognises that yours is the authoritative version. The derivative can and does supplant the original - consider Darkness Within by Kurinoon and A Shattered Prophecy by Project Dark Overlord. A Shattered Prophecy came first, then Kurinoon wrote Darkness Within, which copied A Shattered Prophecy scene for scene, conversation for conversation, only in new words. Kurinoon's story now sits among the most favourited and well known in the fandom, and no one has heard of Shattered Prophecy.

Yes, everything is inspired by something else. And there's nothing stopping people from writing stories where characters use wands, or attend schools of magic. Those elements are general ideas that do not belong to one person. But fanfiction is transparently *not* that kind of borrowing. It is taking the product of a person's labours wholesale and tinkering with it.

Fortunately, JKR has given her explicit permission for people to do this. Permission, for me, is key.

*** Plagarism is considered unlawful under UK law (I'm from the UK) and can cause the plagarist to be sanctioned, fined and potentially given a criminal record. It's possible to be sued under UK law for plagarism as Rowling has been multiple times, but it may be different under US law, I'm not certain!

Thank you for your response though, I hadn't thought about disclaimers or how copyright law holds up in the US court, so that's something to think about when writing my essay! Thanks so much!

Are you sure about this? A bit of googling (e.g., [[http://www.thepsa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CopyrightAndPlagiarism.pdf]]) suggests otherwise: copyright infringement is a crime, but plagiarism isn't.

Under UK law, there is no /Fair Use/. There's /Fair Dealing/. Since you were talking about "Fair Usage", I assumed that you were talking about US law.
