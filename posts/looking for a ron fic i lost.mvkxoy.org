:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
basically from what i remember it was post war and ron got kidnapped. i dont really remember what happened in between but im guessing he was tortured (??) because the next thing i DO remember is that he had such a bad leg injury that he had to use a cane (ihdk if it was permanent or not) to walk around. anyways i think after he was rescued people started calling him the man who survived or something along those lines. any help is appreciated :)


** It might be this.

  Hermione tries to cope with life after Ron's death, but what if all she thought she knew about what happened to him so many years ago was a lie?
