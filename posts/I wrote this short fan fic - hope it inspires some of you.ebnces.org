*Neville sighed.*

He put down the paper, the front page announcing that the Minister of Magic had just won re-election. Almost everyone in the magical world knew what was happening. Almost everyone knew the election was just a sham at this point. Almost everyone knew the Ministry was still really being run by Voldemort behind the scenes. But it was so draining to think about those things. People preferred to just act like everything was normal. That nothing had changed. To just focus on their daily lives and try and ignore the rest. After all, what could they do?

It wasn't hard to have the wizarding world accept the new normal. It was surprisingly easy. It doesn't require a lot of energy to do nothing as things around you change. It requires surprisingly little.

First, the Ministry started passing regulations that seemed a little odd and weird, like the Muggle Registry. Then, they followed by refusing to allow muggle-borns and those of mixed blood to “infest” Hogwarts or the Ministry. There was a little bit of protest at that, but it was a small number as after all it only affected about twenty students a year. Next, they started separating the muggle-born kids from their parents, stating that the kids would be better off “adopted” by magical parents than being raised by “dirty,” “illegal” mudblood parents. There was a larger protest for that, but after some time, that also died down, except for a few persistent voices, some of which got silenced.

And who could forget what had happened near the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States? Emboldened Death Eaters had openly marched in the streets, proclaiming that mudbloods would “not replace us.” They dreamt of a world where wizards openly used their power to dominate muggles. Might makes right, and wizards needed to start using their might. It was only logical. Most people were horrified when this happened. And many even in the Magical Congress openly spoke out against it. But the Leader of the Magical Congress of the United States of America asserted that there were “very fine people” amidst the Death Eaters. And the outcry eventually died out. And they just let that stand. Neville couldn't believe the time that had already passed since then.

‘It takes no work to get used to things changing around you,' Neville thought to himself. ‘That's the problem. Doing something requires conviction, effort, sacrifice, and risk. The majority of wizards are good people. They don't want harm to come to muggles, they don't want them treated as second-class citizens or muggle-born children separated from their parents... they actually disapprove of all of this. But they feel alone and helpless. They are too afraid to speak out and find the others who agree with them. They don't know what to do. It's uncomfortable. It's out of their comfort zone. They haven't done something like this. They are accountants, and Quidditch players, and scientists, and store clerks.'

As he thought all of this, Neville made his decision, and got up. He knew there were others like him at Hogwarts. They had gathered once before. He had to go out and find them and stand up against all of this. Not because he thought he could change everything by doing so. But because he felt that if he didn't stand up for what he knew to be right, then he would be giving in to a growing sense that nothing mattered. He was not willing to give in to a world like that. He was not about to “get over it.”

It was time for Dumbledore's Army to rise up again.

** I can see Harry doing this, even if he wasn't a half-blood.

But Neville seems the sort to join in someone else's war or rebellion, rather than start one himself.

**** The war vs Voldemort and the DEs had been going on for decades, and Harry had been so selfless, and had trained and inspired at least some of the people including Neville himself. (or were you referring to something else and I misunderstood?)
