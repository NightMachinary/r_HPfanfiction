I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'm looking for what I'm fairly certain is an avengers fanfic. Is features fem!Harry and I think tony stark, where she is famous in the muggle world for either science or business. I do remember there is a scene where they talk about her scars, because she glamours them I think. I can't really remember many details because it was kinda long ago, but any help would be appreciated
