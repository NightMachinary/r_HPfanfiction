Ok so I read this fic a long time ago, but I really liked it. Basically, Lily's parents die (I believe it happens the summer before 7th year) and so she moves out into her own apartment. I'm pretty sure Sirius finds out where she works or something and one day, him and James go to her workplace (a bar?). James is shocked to see how she is living and to make sure she is safe, he follows her home under his invisibility cloak. He does this ever night for a while, until she realizes what he is doing. I don't remember the name of this Fic and I can't find it, but if anyone knows, please let me know.
