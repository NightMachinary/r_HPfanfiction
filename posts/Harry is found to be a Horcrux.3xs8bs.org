Hi I'm looking for dystopic fics where at the end of Deatly Hallows, Voldemort find out that Harry is a Horcrux and has him captured and kept alive as he takes over?

Anything?

Thanks in advance.


** That is the premise of linkffn(The World I Leave Behind).

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.

** or the reverse, where harry being a horcrux expresses itself as a little voice in voldies head that leads to him creating a utopia..

*** linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen) touches on this idea. The connection between them has an effect on Voldemort.

The whole idea behind this fic is just incredible. I really wish someone would take over the story, or just take the idea and write their own. Also the OC, whose name I can't recall, was a wonderful addition.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

**** To Persevere is an excellent alternative DH story, and from memory isn't slash (or it is very minor, I can't remember). It does get very dark linkffn(10175118).

Mine is slash and only just complete, but is pretty good (warning, not a happy ending) linkffn(11538927).

Not really dystopian, but certainly excellent is Fates Favorite linkffn(5725656).

I would also recommend Some other beginning, which is slash and does have Mpreg mentioned but not in detail linkffn(9591343).

The Vitruvian Man isn't really what you describe looking for but... well it does have LV ruling and a link between LV and Harry. linkffn(9214710).

+Dark Times isn't finished, and hasn't been updated in a while and is slash, but started out with a lot of promise linkao3(2615639).+ After re-reading isn't what I remember and isn't what you are looking for.

  He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by an icy statement that caused the hairs on his entire body to stand erect. "I know what you are, Harry Potter... Death will never touch you." SLASH, HP/LV. Darkly disturbing and all sorts of tragically twisted... this is not for the faint of heart.
