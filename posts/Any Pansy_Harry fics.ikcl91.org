I know it's not really a popular ship-but I came across a one shot that I saved years ago and it got me interested in the pairing. I mean both haphne and drarry are huge-I have to imagine there are some decent pansy/Harry out there. Unfortunately I'm having a heck of a time finding them. Thanks for any recommendations!!!

*** You have it right. I remember enjoying it quite a bit, but there are a few of the more common tropes from the early days (I believe it was finished pre DH).
