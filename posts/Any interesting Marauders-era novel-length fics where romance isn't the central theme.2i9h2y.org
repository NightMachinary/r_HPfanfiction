I am looking for something that follows James (mainly) and the Marauders either through their Hogwarts years or during the first war. Preferably I would like to follow the creation of the Map or the Animagus transformation.

I would like something that doesn't have the romance between James and Lily as a primary plot and definitely no Remus/Sirius (at least for Remus - his canon counterpart is identified as heterosexual). I know that Life and Times is a reference work for many but I've tried reading it and it seems very much like a soap opera. Also I know about the Shoebox Project but I don't like it that much either.

Thanks a lot, guys.

I'm currently a third of the way through rereading this, it's been a while. So far romance isn't important, and there's a decent focus on the animagus process. I can't remember the rest (since it's been a bit) but maybe it'll work? Or someone who remembers can let you know :)

** It's not novel-length (more like a novelette), but BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] has zero romance to it. 13k words, complete.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
