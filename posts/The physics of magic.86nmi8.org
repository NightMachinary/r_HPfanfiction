There was a fic that I read many years ago and lost track of.

The most memorable element was that Harry was studying the physics of magic and how energy was transferred. It started summer before 5th year.

Does anyone read/remember that story? Know where it is now?


** This sounds really cool, I'd like to read it if anyone finds it!

** Blindness sounds similar but has a different start date.
