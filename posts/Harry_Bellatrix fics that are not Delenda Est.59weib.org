** That's the problem of Harry Potter and Turning of the Sun. The writer had overall a good plot with canon-ish Harry & Dumbledore. A different type of time travel story. But writing up is not upto level.

*** I think the only way to make Harry/Bella work is by making it utterly messed up. Any relationship with that woman is bound to be dysfunctional as fuck.

***** I hate it if that happens, it just ruins the character. A bella that in reality is really nice and loveable and only does bad things because she got forced just is a annoying OC. Why even use the character then?

  'Corrupt Potter; make him an agent of the darkest arts'. The Dark Lord's contingency plan was far easier said than done. Stranded in the past, isolated from her master and with a child of unparalleled potential, Bellatrix begins to question whether the person that was once her mission could become something better. Sanity is fragile. Loyalty, more so.
