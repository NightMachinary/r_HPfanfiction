These types of fics are my guilty pleasure (preferably with a huge extravagant shopping spree?). I'd love to see one that's more or less well written and that's not just four chapters long. Preferably no romance, as it's always “harry saw a girl with huge boobs at the beach and decided it was time to flirt with every 12 year old around him,” but if it's reasonably well written romance I'd be happy to read it. Thanks!


** There's mjimeyg's linkffn(Ah, Screw it). There's no real romance to speak of, but it is a harem fic(most of the romance, what little there is, comes from the girls in his harem trying to seduce him, and him doing his best to make them happy without actually allowing himself to be seduced. It's a Peggy Sue fic. He thinks he's too old, they don't care.)
