Almost every Dumbledore bashing fic I've read are utterly horrible. They have typos, bad grammar and a boring plot. Show me I'm wrong and there are good Dumbledore bashing fics.


** linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao) is a crackfic, so it might be cheating a bit.

I'm not sure if linkffn(Does Voldemort Even Lift, Bro? by zugrian) really counts as bashing, but it feels close. Harry thinks Dumbledore is an evil mastermind, but he's really just a stoner. It's also pretty cracky.

linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) could probably even count. Dumbledore is a pretty minor character in it, but he'll probably show up more in the sequel. I'm not sure if it's really bashing either, since I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore was well-intentioned and tried his best, he just happened to fail spectacularly, and the main character calls him out on it. He's also justifiably mistrustful of the main character, which sets him up as an antagonist of sorts, and makes him seem worse than he is.

*** Does Voldemort Lift is hilarious. I love a crack fic that really leans into it. And Luscious Malfoy! The author took a common misspelling that pisses people off and turned it into a great running joke. As per OP's request, I dont know if I can classify this as Dumbledore bashing. Maybe that's because I'm too busy laughing in all his scenes.

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?

** It depends on the definition of bashing. [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/on-bashing.html][I think]] that every bashing is a poor attempt how to cover for underdeveloped plot and poor storytelling, but it doesn't mean that it is impossible to have story with evil!Dumbledore, and even less that there is nothing to criticize on him. Some of his actions are really difficult to defend even if it was because of normal human problems of laziness, conflict avoidance, etc. (leaving one-year-old child outside in English November, not checking up on a child left in the foster care, to start with the earliest ones). And if the author goes for outright evil!Dumbledore without bashing then she must develop the plot so that it is real. So, I rather like ‚ÄúThere Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel‚Äù linkffn(13137899), where Dumbledore certainly doesn't smell of roses, but it has its own well-developed AU story very different from the canon, and it seems to work for me.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life.

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.

  Dumbledore had tricked him into becoming a Champion but Harry wasn't going to take it lying down. He may be forced to compete in the tasks but who says he has to complete the tasks?
