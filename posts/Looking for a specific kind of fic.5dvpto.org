In this story, Dumbledore replaces his counterpart in an alternate universe and works to correct the shit done by his alter-ego, who in the afterlife is called Wulfric to differentiate the two.

Anyone know of a story with the same or similar premises?


** linkffn(The One He Feared by taure) has a Dumbledore body transfer.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Maybe this one, Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure by dunuelos . This Albus Dumbledore makes some different choices than cannon and when he dies he gets switched with an alternate him that the author calls Wulfric.
