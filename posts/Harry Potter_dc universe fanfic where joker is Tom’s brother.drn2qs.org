I can't remember the name but it was a hp, Batman/dc universe cross over and Riddle was the jokers brother and he raised Harry and I know that Harry was bi and that he did the resurrected soul piece from the diary but I don't remember the other pairings. if y'all know it comment I think it was incomplete but it's been a while,


** Is this it? I haven't read it all the way through but know the joker is toms brother...
