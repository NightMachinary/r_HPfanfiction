Not much else to add, not a big fan of Ginny ships and slightly dislike Harmony, although I'm open to all recommendations.

  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** Really difficult to find any in this sub-genre in which Harry isn't treated inexplicably badly. Would love to read something that deals with the trope in an honest manner, ie. like a potentially tragic family drama rather than a grand conspiracy in which everybody from the 'light' is seemingly implicated in treating a kid rather inhumanely.

Ps. Aside from Santi's story.
