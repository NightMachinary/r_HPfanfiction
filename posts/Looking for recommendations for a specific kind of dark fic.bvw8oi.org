So I like reading stories where there's a lot of nuance, a lot magic to explore, that sort of thing. More often than not, this means it's some kind of dark or grey Harry.

My question is, are there actually any fics where Voldemort or someone similar isn't completely insane - where being a pureblood traditionalist actually makes sense within the context of the story?

Literally 99.999% of stories follow Canon in that all the death eaters are just stupid and bigoted; because there's absolutely no difference between purebloods and muggleborns, nor is there any reason to preserve "traditional" heritage and practices because they're outdated or whatever. Oh, and the main leader of this faction (as well as his followers) are sadistic terrorists that literally get off of killing and torturing people, on top of everything else. Because they're evil, or something.

This whole setup gets just so fucking tiresome.

Is there any dark!Harry fic where the opposing faction isn't written to be the devil incarnate, but as a group of people that are fighting for an ideal? An ideal that makes sense within the story, that's not just "hurr durrr pureblood supremacy, we hate mudbloods and want to torture muggles just 'cuz we evil!"?

Voldemort was written to be a charismatic, intelligent, and powerful figure, a leader! and instead all we get is some deformed monstrosity that kills random people and loves torturing even his own followers for /absolutely no fucking reason/.

Seriously, is there a fic with legitimately interesting, dynamic sides to the conflict, one where there's no easy choice and no easy villain?

If there isn't, then I might need to get off my ass and write something, because I'm at the end of my rope with these cliches


** !linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles)

This fic has a very unique justification to Voldemort's goals. Without giving away too much, the goal isn't explicitly blood supremacy so much as it is the preservation of ancient lines.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** I think people like the death eaters being born of an ideal does not contradict with them being evil.

For example, I'm working on a fic were a combination of a long rift throughout history is the grounworks why even most regular witches and wizards feel so very different from muggles. It's not unimaginable, seeing how they're actually different whereas all real life racism isn't even that. The witch hunts, religion, a relatively recent shift towards muggle culture, the growing fear of the muggle world in the future and so on. Mob mentality being mob mentality.

However, the death eaters are still very much a combination of terrorists born of frustration, desire to be included in some revolution, genuine belief in a cause just as much as a desire for blood, cruelty and sadism.

*** Long reply, be warned!

Well, if we ignore points like there being no differences between races - there certainly are many quantifiable differences - and focus on the HP side of it, then I don't really think you quite get where I'm coming from.

Take Skyrim, for example: you have the Nords, and the Stormcloaks, which is essentially an centered revolution of Independence from the Empire. They want to be free of Atmer (high elf) influence, and they hate them.

Yet they are respectable, because they still fight for their people and the ancient traditions they believe in with honor, they don't go around indiscriminately torturing the very people they claim to be fighting for; other Nords.

Whereas the death eaters are all painted as psychopathic sadists, killing and brutalizing those when magic, as well.

Hell, the vast majority of subjects and soldiers in fascist regimes in Germany, Italy, and Romania conducted themselves with infinitely more honor. A good book following the life of a Romanian soldier in WW2 is "For my Legionnaires", an amazing autobiography. The men fighting had principle, virtue, and loved their people and country, regardless of what might be said of their ideology.

Contrast this to death eaters, who have absolutely none of these things. Hell, they don't even have any political positions, much less holding true to them. They're written to be the worst possible people you can imagine, and it's a cheap copout.

It's fine to have the antagonists be evil for the sake of evil in a children's book, but it's poor writing outside of that. When I read fanfiction, I'm looking for less of these childish elements, not less.

The best books and movies are where the line between good and evil isn't clear, where you can sympathize and even understand both sides of the conflict; it makes the struggles, the development, and the journey of the protagonist that much more visceral and meaningful.

It's easy to decide to fight against a group composed entirely of psychopathic sadist murderers, led by a literally evil man that split his soul.

It's much harder to fight against a group that is composed of good men and women that have some legitimate grievances and methods other than terrorism, than indiscriminate murder and torture.

That requires the protagonist to really butt heads with the world, and to first determine what they are even fighting for in the first place, despite all the costs; maybe a friend or people they know are part of this group.

Do you see at all what I'm saying here? It's that I'm tired of Harry being framed in a two-dimensional plot of obvious good vs obvious evil. Like no shit you fight against a Bellatrix, against a Voldemort. It's so boring, it doesn't feel real, it doesn't have depth.

**** But why doesn't it feel real? Truth isn't always somewhere in the middle, and very often one side is indeed right, while the other is wrong.

If Voldemort was a head of a terrorist organisation of muggleborns, then you could write it that way. They do terrible things, but they genuinely believe it's their only option. But purebloods are at the top of wizarding world's hierarchy, and there's no reason for them to become Death Eaters unless they are ready and willing to hurt other people just because of the circumstances of their birth. You cannot spin it as a fight for justice, because purebloods are the ones with priviledge and in position of power. Maybe they aren't bad people, but were indoctrinated since childhood or angry at their lot in life and maybe later they even wanted out, but it doesn't make doing what they do right.

  But why doesn't it feel real?
#+end_quote

Because it's a comic book characterization. In the real world, you don't get popular political movements in first world countries whose members are all sadistic, unsympathetic murderers.

#+begin_quote
  Truth isn't always somewhere in the middle, and very often one side is indeed right, while the other is wrong.
#+end_quote

Nope, it all depends on perspective and your value system. Even if this was true, simply skipping all the steps and just painting an irredeemably evil cartoon villain that loves to torture for the sake of it is lazy storytelling.

#+begin_quote
  If Voldemort was a head of a terrorist organisation of muggleborns, then you could write it that way.
#+end_quote

No, you couldn't, because he wouldn't last a single day acting like he does. Fuck, you think Sadam Hussein or any other terrorist cells had leaders that indiscriminately tortured their own members?

You think the Irish Liberation Army went around killing other Irish, you think they would have survived for a single hour if their leader started whipping random people because he liked it?

#+begin_quote
  They do terrible things, but they genuinely believe it's their only option.
#+end_quote

Again, with the lazy writing. Instead of trying to rationalize these ridiculous cartoon villains, why not actually write human characters....?

No, you are not going to convince anyone with two brain cells to rub together that going out and raping and murdering random muggle villages is the only option.

#+begin_quote
  But purebloods are at the top of wizarding world's hierarchy, and there's no reason for them to become Death Eaters unless they are ready and willing to hurt other people just because of the circumstances of their birth.
#+end_quote

There could be plenty of reasons for them to join a group with certain, similar goals. You don't know how much power the Wizengamot has, or anything else. Rowling didn't know jack shit about politics, clearly, and yeah, if Malfoy and Co. Own the ministry, then there's no point in then joining. That's shitty writing on Rowling's part than anything else.

Of course, the rest of your point about only the insane ones joining the death eaters falls short, since you are already taking for granted the assumption that all it could ever be is a place for sadists. That kind of thinking is exactly what I find boring.

You had real people in the red shirts and brown shirts in various communist and Nazi groups quarreling in the streets in the 1930s across Europe. It's disengenous in the extreme to say that they were all evil. And while there were deaths from the fights these groups had, neither openly went around murdering and torturing passers-by just because they were pleased by torture.

Utterly ridiculous.

#+begin_quote
  You cannot spin it as a fight for justice, because purebloods are the ones with priviledge and in position of power.
#+end_quote

Of course you can. It doesn't need to be justice, it can be self-autonomy, a fight for heritage, anything. Not to mention that we know very little of the actual political system. Maybe this is a group of purebloods and half-bloods - with muggleborn sympathizers - that see how decayed and corrupt the ministry and society is, and don't believe it can be changed from within.

Maybe they want to throw away the red tape and corruption of the ministry, and institute a more traditional and active government, led by someone charismatic. There's very good reasons to be critical of democracy, and whatever thing they have in canon is infinitely worse. I can see why people would want a return to more basic, direct forms of governance.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe they aren't bad people, but were indoctrinated since childhood or angry at their lot in life and maybe later they even wanted out, but it doesn't make doing what they do right.
#+end_quote

No shit, if they're going around torturing people because it makes them giggle (i.e. Bellatrix and every other Death Eater) it isn't right. That's my bloody point. To make a believable and understandable enemy, you first have to do away with literally every single one of them being a *fucking* sadist for *no fucking reason*.

****** But they aren't *all* sadists. Ammounts of raping and murdering every individual DE does is greatly exaggerated by fanon. Snape implies to Dumbledore when asked to kill him that he didn't kill anybody before ("But what about my soul?"). After all his bluster Draco couldn't kill in cold blood either. Voldemort himself wasn't always a lunatic, he used to be a charismatic leader who didn't crucio his followers left right and centre before he spent 10 years as a wraith, and even after that, the amount of pointless crucioing is overstated in fics too.

Lucius Malfoy is probably a model husband and a doting father, and thinks about himself as a men of principle, thinks that he knows what's best for the country and how to protect its heritage (which in practice translates to "Hogwarts shouldn't be polluted by mudbloods and halfbreeds")

My point isn't that all Death Eaters are complely evil and irredeemable people (JKR doesn't think so either, since she wrote redemption/possibility of redemption arcs for Snape, Regulus and arguably Draco). My point is that even if they aren't, it doesn't make what they are doing as Death Eaters any less wrong. Even if they wholeheartedly believe that they are fighting for the worthy cause. You mentioned communist and Nazi groups and how individual people there weren't all evil. Of course they weren't. But communist and Nazi regimes absolutely were and were worth fighting against.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe this is a group of purebloods and half-bloods - with muggleborn sympathizers - that see how decayed and corrupt the ministry and society is, and don't believe it can be changed from within.
#+end_quote

But then you'd have to rewrite Death Eaters as a completely different organisation with different goals, different actions and different members. Because as it stands now, the old purebloods themselves are the system. Why would Lucius Malfoy fight against corruption if he is the one lining Minister's pockets with gold? And it sure isn't muggleborns they are fighting against who are causing it and benefitting from it. Even if some purebloods believe otherwise, good old "scary outsiders are coming and taking our jobs, look, this mudblood is a high ranking Auror while I'm living in a shack, and my daughter is looking at that muggle as if he's not a vermin, how dare she turn away from our heritage, Salazar have mercy on our souls".

** My fav is Out of the Night by RainingInk (author removed from ffn, you'll have to find download).

Writing is good, first chapters short and quick. Don't be put off by the means of transition, as Harry soon learns there is a lot more to being a Dark wizard. Warning: Abandoned. But well worth it IMO.

Voldemort and Death Eaters are still bad news, but it touches briefly on them being misguided Dark wizards fighting the Ministry/Light wizards the wrong way (where there is a lot of good reasons for Dark wizards to feel aggrieved).

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Voldemort has a lot more sympathizers in the government, the order can't do much without antagonizing the ministry, so it's up to Hermione to give the death eaters hell.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
