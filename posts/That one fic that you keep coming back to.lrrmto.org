For me, I'd say it would have to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize by Lady Altair]]. When I first got into HP fanfiction, I was fresh off the ending of Deathly Hallows and canon extensions and missing scene fics were my jam. Cauterize gave me everything I wanted in an epilogue and provided closure I didn't know I needed. Sometimes I wish I hadn't read it just so I could experience it again for the first time.

What's your fic that you come back to read every now and again?

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

This is my favourite post-war fic, it's one of the very few fics which deal with the direct consequences of Harry's impromptu King's Cross visit in DH (the implication that Harry literally /died/ and came back can't mean anything good and it must've fundamentally altered him somehow) instead of fixating on the Hallows and having 'Master of Death' actually be some bizarre job position instead of the meaningless title that it is in canon. Harry gets a very believable 'fall from grace' arc in this and the parallelism between him and Riddle is excellent, except Harry has the exact opposite problem this time. I believe "beautifully tragic" sums up the entire thing quite nicely.

** I haven't seen anyone mention Marauderlover7's Innocent series yet, so that's definitely my choice. The pacing, the dialogue, the plot and the divergences from canon jut seem to come together so well in that fic. In my opinion, it is the most 'harry potter'-esque fic in the entire fandom, meeting all the expectations that come with such a tag.

If anyone wants it, linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

** 'You Meet in Paris' is this melancholy, gripping one-shot that had me enthralled from start to finish. It is punchy and does what it sets out to do without any frills and the emotion it invoked left an impression.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13328397/1/You-Meet-in-Paris]]

Additionally, on a brighter note, 'On the affectionate nature of Veelas, A Study by Harry James Potter,' is a beautiful piece about simple, quiet intimacy. The prose is decadent and the character's love is splendidly written. All of the author's works are similarly lovely.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** I actually have 2 to recommend. There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] by Vimesenthusiast, a crossover between HighSchool DxD that takes place after the epilogue. Being a DxD fic you would normally expect mostly shameless smut... not in this case. Harry has a young daughter, and he is the greatest father ever. The amount of wholesomeness in this fic is astounding, partially because Harry essentially adopts most of the children in the show. It also adjusts canon events willy nilly to give them more impact and (I can't believe I'm saying this about a DxD fic) has genuinely compelling and realistic relationships. It's also just over a million words long and is still ongoing (note, the entire original Harry Potter series is roughly 1,080,000 words long). Also check out the author, this is only his 4th longest fic. Then there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12378425/1/Blessed-Blood][Blessed Blood]] by AngelSlayer135. Significantly shorter at just under 230,000 words, this is an AU instead of a continuation where Harry has an additional power, but things go much worse for him than in canon. What I adore about this fic is how by the time that Harry has had enough and is willing to strike back at the people who have tormented him, the reader despises them and has been wanting them to pay for several chapters. Every act of retribution feel reasonable and justified, instead of over the top and angsty like in most fics. On top of that, it never detracts from the overall plot or the other relationships in the fic, something which is very difficult to do.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
