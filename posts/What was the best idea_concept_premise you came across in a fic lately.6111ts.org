For me it was an abandoned story where Harry and the Basilisk from the CoS end up in the world of Ice and Fire.


** linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is easily my favorite AU reimagining. A very competant and sinister Lucius Malfoy has brainwashed a legion of Janissary Muggleborns and Hermione Granger is one of them. On the other side is Ron Weasley, a spy for Britains in Exile. Against everyone comes the Dark Lord, and boy howdy is he more competent than in canon.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

**** Agreed. I've only read four chapters but it's basically a fix it fic. I have a variation in my head where instead of meandering through Harry's life, it's a quick, violent sequence of all three end-of-year adventures. BAM Quirrelmort BAM basilisk BAM dementor swarm. Once it's over, half of the occupants of the great hall have fainted, a quarter is catatonic/vomiting/sobbing, and a quarter is staring at Harry in fear and awe.

Trauma FTW

EDIT: and Harry sees how everyone's reacting and starts to wonder if there's something wrong with him for being so OK with it.

It was really just a random idea that I more or less wrote out of spite after being told not to, and now I'm nineteen chapters in and people actually seem to be enjoying. And while I know what happens, my plan for it's length is already out the window, and I feel like I'm waiting for the bottom to fall out, more or less. I just never thought it would be a fic that intrigued people.

And now I'm a chapter away from writing the whys and letting Voldemort be Voldemort. I feel like her motivations make sense. I feel like how muddied I want the conflict to be makes sense, and I wonder if it will be taken that way.

I've been looking for a character that's like Bellatrix from Delenda Est for a while and there hasn't really been another good contender for a female lead who is talented, confident, and pretty much gets everything her way because she knows how to work the people around her to accomplish her goals.

Then again, this all could change depending on the ending because although the epilogue of TPP was decent/good, the ending preceding it I found mediocre/terrible. Hopefully this fic meets my expectations!

** I didn't read this one recently, and the first person writing feels a bit off at times, but linkffn(7452425) has always been one of my favorite concepts for a fanfic, and this fic personally is still in my top 10.

Tldr; If you use polyjuice while poly juiced it makes it think the first form you took is your real form.

** Something involving SCIENCE^{tm} that changes harry such as linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth) or linkffn(Vulpine Wizard) where harry is injured and turned into a cyborg and smokes some really trippy shit and turns into some sort of fox human thing respectively. I love those. and damn gotta make a fic request for more of those.

also non angsty badass harry like linkffn(8551180) and linkffn(3415504) because we CAN have a slightly violent and super insane badass without all the woe is me bullshit and the "I wuz ABUSEDED by de durseys so you shall KNEEL before and give me a BLOWJOB while I recite MEMES and SHAKESPEAR for I am a +dumbass hypersexual loser with a complex+ GOD!!!!!"
