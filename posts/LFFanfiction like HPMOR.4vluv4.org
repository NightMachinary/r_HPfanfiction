** linkffn(The Arithmancer) is pretty good. It explores what would have happened if Hermione was a mathematical genius instead of a bookworm. The author is on this sub under [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]].

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
