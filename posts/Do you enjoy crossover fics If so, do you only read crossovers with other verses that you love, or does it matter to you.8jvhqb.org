** I enjoy HP characters visiting other verses, but have less interest in characters from other universes visiting HP's verse. Those tend to take away the agency of the HP characters without actually introducing new plotlines (for example, Naruto goes to school with Harry, easily solves all their problems, yet the plot stays exactly the same for seven years). Though that's a problem with any overpowered insert, not just cross-overs.

*** oh yeah Harry Potter going to the Narutoverse works really well not the other way around tho, I really Enjoyed Uchiha Fukurou until I lost interest when I realized I hadn't been updated in years and Auryn while it still was up.

Also, Harry Potter/Stargate works really well because both universes are extremely compatible one of the best examples is Crumpets aren't my style

*** This is what I was wondering. I know a lot of crossover fics assume you already know the extra verse, so they don't take much time to introduce new characters. It would be cool to see someone only get into the extra verse after reading a crossover and being introduced that way.

***** Honestly, as a massive SG1 fan, I would really recommend giving the show a proper watch. It's long sure at 10 season, 2 spin-offs and 3 movies, but the whole franchise never really dips in quality except arguably mid season 3 of SGA. It really is up there with the other syfy greats like ST and SW. But only if you can handle the disappointment of ending on a cliffhanger that will never be resolved.

******* I'd say it has aged about as well as, if not better than, TNG. The special effects can look a bit cheap sometimes, practical or otherwise. But the cgi can still look good, especially in the later seasons/spinoffs. IMO the cheapness of the practical effects from that era of Sci/fi is what makes me love the shows so much, makes them feel more grounded, don't know why tho. For the story, I guess it's just a matter of opinion. Re-watched all three shows recently and I can't say I remember anything that broke my suspension of disbelief, so I consider that a win. Would still defo says its one of the best sci/fi franchises ever, and a solid recommendation.

** I love crossover fics. Easily some of my favorite stories have been found when dropping Harry into another Universe.

I would read a crossover fic about a Universe I'm unfamiliar with as long as it's well written. I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] before I read/watched GoT though I've seen it since. Then I've read a few Sand Man Xovers and Star Wars fics that make use of the animated show characters that I've never seen.

So it really just depends. Mostly, you often get a pretty competent and confident Harry in crossovers and those are the ones I gravitate to.

** Crossovers are my bread and butter... They are literally all I write... :o

One of my many WIPs include a crossover between Harry Potter and my rewrite of Sarah Jane Adventures (It's also kind of a crossover with the Librarians) where five of the main characters of Sarah Jane Adventures (Luke, Maria, Clyde, Rani and Sky) find themselves inside the first book. They have to make sure it stays on-plot without giving too much away. They also don't have magic, but Maria and Rani own the Water and Air totems (Based on the Zambezi Totems from Legends of Tomorrow) respectively, so they have a limited magic. Luke and Clyde don't have anything, but Sky can feel the vibrations of the magic (Hogwarts has a background hum to her).

There's gonna be a bad guy they have to defeat who wants to trap them in the book by causing it to go off-plot.

I haven't written much of it, other than the first paragraph which has them arriving at Hogwarts.

*** I don't know about the world of HP itself, but HP magic provides a great vehicle for throwing characters into other dimensions. Lots of powerful magic that can be paired with drastic mistakes to make unintended consequences. For example, breaking the time turners /just/ right, the Veil being an actual gateway, unstable rituals, etc.

*** I think hp magic meshes really well with other universes. I just think that the magic traditions went down different paths of development. Like the force and HP magic. Modern Hedi and sith just don't use foci and concentrate on the pregognition and wandless magic. Hp has the pregognition too, but less developed(how do you think they dodge buldgers while riding a 100mph vekile in a three dimensional playfield or hole trying to score points.) and the wandless magic like levitation and force lighting are just not practiced (jedi undergo years of training). Dark side of the force is unfocused dark magic(both corrupt). In addition in the old EU we see things like sith alchemy and other supernatural things that could fit in the HP verse.

** I love crossovers. They are literally the only thing I read 99% of the time because I always have problems finding new things to read that I like in this fandom most of the time. There are some that go together so well in some contexts with certain points of the HP universe.

Like my current favorites HP/Game of thrones <3 <3 <3 , HP/Jurassic Park Universe, HP/Pokemon, HP/Elder Scroll series especially Oblivion and Skyrim and HP/Walking Dead. Since i love MOD!Harry i read those a lot and certain bits can mesh well with almost any fandom. I even like some of the HP/Star wars fic.

It literally doesn't matter to me what the crossover is. I get introduced to other fandoms I can enjoy that way. It's the best way to explore and find something new to love about the Harry Potter universe.

So long as it doesn't involve some kind of weird anime, and it looks well-written, I'll probably read it - I've actually discovered other fandoms and works that I otherwise likely wouldn't have found or looked into through reading interesting-looking crossovers with HP - stuff like Worm, Chronicles of Amber, Abhorsen, Labyrinth, and the Dresden Files.

It's refreshing to find HP fanfiction sometimes that isn't a retread of the books, or yet another cackling evil Dumbledore story, or weird gay porn.

** I love crossovers, they're what I read the most and I love crossover pairings as well. I usually like to read crossovers between verses that I love or I know at least a little bit about, but if the fic looks interesting enough then I'll just google the characters as they're introduced. I've actually been introduced to a couple of new fandoms this way because the story and what I saw on Google was interesting enough for me to start watching a few episodes.

The magic in Harry potter gives a lot of ways for Harry to accidentally fall into another universe or time and those are the crossovers I like best. I don't like it when the other characters go to Hogwarts, they usually follow the Harry Potter plot and having the Crossover character "fix" everything.
