How does genetics work in the Wizarding World? It is quite different from the Muggle world wherein children carry traits from both of their parents whereas in the Wizarding World, Tom Riddle Jr. and Harry Potter are said to be clones of their fathers ( save for Harry's eyes) and Lucius, Draco and Scorpius Malfoy look disturbingly alike ( as if they have reproduced via parthenogenesis).


** There's the Pureblood Pretense series that touch on it.

** I like fanon idea of magic travelling down family lines resulting in similarities between parent and child but regular genetics playing a role as well so all the children that should have genetic disorders don't simply because most of their magic is tied up in keeping them functional and as a result they are weaker than “pure bloods” who interbreed with muggle borns and half blood resulting I greater genetic diversity meaning less abnormalities

*** Yes, that explains Crabbe, Goyle and Gaunts. Even squibs can be thought of as witches or wizards who cannot do magic because all of it is used in keeping them alive.

**** Exactly and that squibs marrying muggles results in the magic going dormant until their descendants marry another descendant whose children will be able to awaken magic

** Can't for the life of me find it, but there's a Tumblr post that details a potential method of magic genetics- trinucleotide repeat expansion, such as with Huntington's disease. To my knowledge, once the inherently unstable number of repeats crosses a certain threshold, the individual could use magic. Therefore, squibs and muggleborns are caused by increases and decreases in this gene. Of course, I am not a biology major and I am explaining from memory. Take this with a grain of salt.

** HPMOR does, for a chapter. At an 11 year old level, though.
