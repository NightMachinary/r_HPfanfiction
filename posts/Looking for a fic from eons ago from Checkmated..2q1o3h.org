I think it was called Before the Dawn and it was about Ron (who had been turned into a vampire) and his hot affair with Hermione. I don't think it was ever finished but I'd love to reread what had been put up. The author, I believe, was Sara...maybe SaraEK?

Anyone know what I'm talking about?


** I did some looking for you. Unfortunately that story was on a website called Checkmated which was unfortunately shut down. Your best bet may be to see if anyone downloaded the story.

** Sorry - looks it was only ever posted to Checkmated. Other stories by SaraEK are posted here: [[http://thequidditchpitch.org/viewuser.php?action=storiesby&uid=6&offset=0]]
