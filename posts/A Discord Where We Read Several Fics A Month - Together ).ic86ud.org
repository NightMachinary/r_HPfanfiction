We are a growing community where we read several HP fics together per month. You can pick and choose which ones you want to partake in. We also have channels for writers, just to chat the fandom, and to get in on some games and memes. We have some upcoming awards too.

There's about 80+ of us right now, and plenty of room for you!

Give us a join! [[https://discord.gg/8bNRdtq]]

Edit: Wow! So many of you have joined! I'm humbled by the response and so happy to now have well over 100 members. Still plenty more room, and we can't wait to read with you!


** This is cool
