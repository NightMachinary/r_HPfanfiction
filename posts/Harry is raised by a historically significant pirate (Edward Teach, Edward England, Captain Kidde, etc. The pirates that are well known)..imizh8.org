Harry goes to Hogwarts with a cutlass strapped to his hip, and a brace of pistols to match. The North Sea is only a few miles from Hogwarts, just a lovely jaunt through the Forbidden Forest. Hermione will not leave Harry alone, having been obsessed with pirates, especially the one that raises Harry, from a very early age.


** "Good night, Harry. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."

Edit: Okay, not historically significant, but it was the first thing I thought of!

** I've only seen three-ish fics where Harry is pirate-ey. One is Rocking The Boat, another has him raised by Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and the other was something anime-ey that I can't find right now.

Seems to be a very under-subscribed genre to write in. I hope someone picks up on this prompt. It'd be a good niche to take over. :D

**** We definitely need more sailor-ey things. The only good one I've really read is The Sea King. None of the others really get the watery feel quite right. :)

** Well, now I want to see him raised by Hook, from Once Upon A Time. I could all too easily see Hermione loving Peter Pan while younger.
