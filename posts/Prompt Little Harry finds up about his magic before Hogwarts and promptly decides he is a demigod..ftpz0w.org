A subversion of the wandless magic at four troop in which while Harry finds up about his powers he makes a different connection than assume he is a wizard. It was always something that bothered me about this kind of stories, while the clues are at the little we see of cannon pre-Hogwarts at that point he actually could come to quite a number of conclusions from fairly tails, pop culture, scy-fi, mythology, or fantasy. Yes he could discover he is a wizard and train himself from there, he could also think he is an alien or a mutant to name a few.

The idea is that Harry finds out about his powers but instead of realizing he is a wizard he remembers some myths and thinks he is actually a demigod (but in truth he isn't) and then try to emulate his chosen mythology. Because of the lighting bolt scar he could think himself son of Zeus or Thor; or he could discover that it can also be a rune and think himself son or champion of Odin; he can think about his ability to re-grow his hair in a single night and decide he is a son of Loki because he can alter his appearance like him. Or he could think apparition is just him moving really fast and believe he is son of mercury or Hermes; alternatively he could discover his abilities are magic and think himself son of a god or goddess of magic, like Loki, Hecates or any others.

This would have effects both in his magical skill and in his personality. In his skills he would specialize in what his supposed magical parent do, wether manipulation in the case of Thor or Zeus; runecraft, enchanting and necromancy for Odin, transfiguration with Loki... It would really be in the air, he could turn out very different skill-wise, specially if he keeps thinking himself a demigod through Hogwarts.

Personality-wise things would also get out of norm petty quickly. He thinks he is a demigod, so beyond what the “mortals” should be able and thus losing to one of them would suddenly be beyond infuriating to him, hence long hours of practice and study so he don't let his supposedly godly parent down. He would also try to shape his personality by the myths including his god parent and his half siblings, the mythological ones and his historical ones (Like Alexandre the Great who believed himself a son of Zeus). I can totally see this Harry using his conquerors pseud-brothers in measuring his worth and deciding to conquer the world. He would seek out immortality ASAP as lots of mythologies around the world has immortality as a criterion in being allowed to live in the world of the god, thus being the only way Harry would be able to let the mortal world behind (by all accounts his live at Little Whining was bad, so he would like nothing more than put as much distance between himself and the world he dislikes as possible) and live with one of his parents. He could possibly also develop a superiority complex in which he wouldn't accept the idea of a mortal being better than him at anything, which could clash nicely with Hermione's intelectual dedication.

Would also be cool if he actually believed some fictional works that uses the mythology he adopted and tries to emulate its powers, like Percy Jackson for example. Not crossover thought.


** I know you said no crossovers, but if you did want a PJO crossover, you could make Harry a metamorphmagus, and since he truly believes he's a son of Zeus (or any other god), his body subconsciously changes itself into a Demi-god, thus allowing him into the camp. Thus his godly ‘parent' is all like “I don't have any memory of having any kids. Huh, must've been drunk.”

I'll hunt down the posts and re-post them here when I can.

I've also been a bit thoughtful on it again in recent days, so I might write some more snippets based on the concept.
