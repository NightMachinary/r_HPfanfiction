After his rebirth at the end of the Triwizard Tournament, and knowing (from Wormtail) that the Potter Cloak is the legendary Peverell cloak of invisibility and having Potter blood ( thank you Barty and Wormy) , Lord Voldemort goes to Gringotts where the goblins acknowledge him as Lord Potter and he acquires all the Potter heirlooms. Having done that, under the name Thomas Marvolo Potter, he makes a public announcement in the Daily Prophet disowning Harry from the Potter family for spreading 'false' rumours about Voldemort's return to destabilize the Ministry of Magic. Basically, a fic where the Goblins are friendly with Voldemort.
