I think the title is pretty self-explanatory: what do you do if you dislike one of your own fics? I have multiple finished fics posted on AO3 and dislike one of them tremendously. It's almost a year old, but I still think the thing is silly, badly written and not a good representation of the kind of writer I aspire to be, so I'm considering to either delete or orphan it. However, it's also my most popular fic by far. It has received so many lovely responses and I've even made a few friends because of it. I may hate the fic itself, but I'm proud of everything I've achieved with it and would regret throwing all of that away, so now I'm torn about what to do.

Is there anyone here who's ever been in a similar position? Did you eventually decide to keep or delete the fic? And why? Any thoughts are welcome!


** I have not been in the exact same position but I have had the following experiences:\\
1. I read through a fic I had completed a few years ago and though I don't hate it, I realised that it was pretty badly written. (It has happened with a few fics actually) I had gotten good responses on it then. I decided to let it be for now (Not sure if people still read it). The first reason for this was that I could not find it in myself to delete something that did take a lot of effort to write. Secondly, I keep them as a benchmark to see how far I have come as a writer and to be able to identify the places where I go wrong.

1. I was writing a fanfic where I started disliking the turn the plot took. I abandoned it then, since I wanted to focus on another fic that I was writing and liking. But I am planning to rewrite it as soon as I am done with my current fic and then delete the first post.

I think what it should come down to is what YOU like. For me, writing has always been personal, especially fanfics, and I have heard the same from other writers. The object of writing is to lose yourself in that story and that world. Being told by readers that they like the fic is pretty great because, of course, it is nice to be appreciated. But at the same time, I would not continue with a fic only because other people like it unless I had a way to make it work for me again (hence the rewrite I mentioned above).

At the end of the day, if you want to delete it, I don't see anything wrong with not wanting to be associated with that piece of work. I would, however, advise to keep a personal copy for yourself.

*** Thanks! That's some helpful advice. It's a good idea to keep the fic online as an example of how far I've come and a stark reminder of the kind of writer I don't want to be. However, the fic can also serve that purpose perfectly fine when it's on my computer only. When it comes down to it, however, I just don't want that fic to be associated with my name anymore. I'm happy that people are enjoying it, but they don't necessarily need to know that I wrote it. So I think that orphaning might be a good middle ground. I won't be reminded of the fic anymore every time I visit my profile, but people will still be able to read it.

** I dislike the Aurors a lot so very nearly didn't write a sequel but I'm glad I did because it's much better. I think when you hate something you should take a look at why, and balance it with what other people think is good. Then with future writings keep perfecting that balance.

*** Really? I wouldn't have guessed. I've never read The Aurors, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. Thanks for your advice! It's really inspiring to hear from someone who's been in a similar position and found a way to work with it. Your advice doesn't quite apply in my case, however. My main reason for disliking that fic is because it's crack and I don't like crack very much, so it's not necessarily the technical aspects of the fic I have a problem with, but more the genre. I don't want to write crack again and definitely don't want to be seen as a crack!writer, so that's why I'm considering to orphan/ delete that fic. Your advice is very helpful, however, and I'll keep it in mind for the future.

**** Hated writing it and nearly deleted it several times haha - it was a new genre for me and it stressed me out a lot planning it and dealing with people nitpicking and stuff. My new one is back to my old style and is more mystery than police procedural so works a lot better I think.

I definitely see that, I've never really "got" crack fics. It's considered a sin round here but I think it's completely acceptable to abandon a fic if you're not getting along with it - you can come back to it later if you want but at the end of the day you don't get paid for this.

***** Aw, damn :/. Yeah, crack was also a new genre for me and I thought it would be fun to experiment with it, just to see if I'd like it. Well, clearly not. In a way, I'm glad I experimented though, because I now know a lot better what I like to write and what I don't. Hope it's the same for you!

I've now decided to orphan the fic. Orphaning is a nice feature on ao3 that removes every connection between the fic and my account, but keeps the fic itself online so that people can still read it. Thanks for all your thoughts!

** Oh, I hate plenty of my own fics. When I look back at the majority of my fics, they all seem tremendously bad to me. That said, even the fics I'm working on now end up going through rewrite after rewrite because I think they're shite. It's fair to say that I might be overly-critical of my own work nowadays.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's usually a sign that you're maturing as a writer; long before you develop the skills to write effectively, you develop the taste to determine what's good and what's literary rot. I used to delete the fics that I didn't like, but now I keep them up for two major reasons: the first reason being that while I may not like it anymore, there are people out there that still enjoy these fics; and the second being that I can use them as a benchmark of how my writing style has developed over time. It's amazing how much different stuff I put out in the last year is to stuff I wrote four or five years ago, and sometimes it's good to be reminded of how far you've progressed.

** I don't want to set you on a path you're not ready for or anything, but in my experience, when i'm stuck on a fic plotline or I'm not quite sure where to go next I'll throw in a romance or two. It kind of resets the timer for the reader to be interested and when they forget the original plotline you can "refresh" them so to speak after a romantic xXx pairing (sfw), something non canon like RonxHermione, etc. After the romance you can make basically anything happen next! writing a good fic is like writing an soap opera. You have to constantly introduce drama to keep your readers interested. Hopes that helps! :)

*** Thanks! I appreciate your advice. However, it seems I was unclear in my post. I'm not stuck on the writing itself: the fic was finished and posted almost a year ago. I suppose I could take it offline to rewrite it, but honestly, at this point I really don't want to put in the effort anymore :/. I've been wondering about that damn fic for months now and it takes up so much of your time and energy, which I could spend so much more productively. I'd love to be able to decide once and for all whether to keep or delete it, just so I can move on to other things.

**** Okay, understood. i think writers have to live with what's been done even when they eventually hate it, but that's okay. your writing clearly affected people positively and since you can't take away the impact that left, why take the fic away? I know where you're coming from though. sometimes writing is a selfless act! :) be at peace with the stories you tell! sometimes they take on a life of their own.

All the best, Ben Mears!

** I rewrote mine. I didn't want to delete it because it was a lot of work and I still got the occasional praising comment, but those same comments made me cringe every time because I knew the story could be better, so in the end I rewrote it. It took me ten months, but I consider it completely worth it.

However, you mentioned not wanting to put further effort into rewriting, in which case I would suggest leaving it. As you say, it's made you proud in many things and gained you friends, and I don't think you should discard something like that. If you're worried it'll put readers off checking out your newer works, you can always put a disclaimer at the top mentioning that the story is old and doesn't reflect your current writing skill.

*** Oh, that is so recognisable! All the positive comments I got for this particular fic made me cringe hard, even though I would have squeed like mad if I had received them on any of my other works. That's another reason why I'm considering to delete it. What's the point of keeping it online if I can't appreciate the kind words of my readers?

Rewriting is not an option, no. I dislike the whole premise of this story (it's a silly crack!fic), so I'd have to write a completely new story to turn it into something I'd be happier with. I'm glad rewriting was a solution for you, however! That disclaimer is a really good idea. If I decide to keep it online, I'll definitely do that. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

** I have a fic I wrote many years ago that I despise. As with your situation, it's the most popular thing I've ever written. It was so popular that it was translated into multiple languages and archived in more places than I can remember, so it's essentially not in my power to remove it now.

â€‹

But even though the decision is out of my hands, I don't think I would remove it if I could. I don't want to take away something that has given people pleasure. And on the other side of the equation, there are a lot of silly fics out there that I've loved. Sometimes I'll go back and re-read a fic I enjoyed 10 or 15 years ago and appreciate that the author left it up regardless of how s/he has changed in that time. So I leave my nonsense up in karmic return for other authors leaving up something that maybe embarrasses them, but feels like coming home to me.

That's just what I did, though. There's no wrong answer.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts though! I really appreciated them. Partly because of your response, I've now decided to orphan my fic. That way it will still stay online for everyone to enjoy, but I will be removed as the author completely. It sounds like a good middle-ground.

** I regularly start loathing my fics long before finishing them. But since I know that I tend toward that, I've built rules for myself. I will never delete anything. I will not go back and endlessly rewrite the beginning without finishing first. I will not abandon stories.

Finishing my first fic was such an uphill battle. It had taken two years, and the beginning was bad. Terrible. Atrocious. Loathsome to the extreme. I'm astonished anyone read it at all. But I was only four chapters from finishing, and since I have a rule to keep going, I did. And I finished, and it's done, and now I don't have to think about it.

Now I need to finish my second fic, which is much longer and farther from the end, and it's only slightly less hateful, but more popular.

That's a familiar conflict! A compromise might solve your dilemma. Maybe you could keep your old fic, then do a rewritten version. That way you can keep up something that has been worthwhile to both you and your readers, while also showing (with the new version) how much you've progressed.
