Read Letters and now I'm reading Vitam Paramus and while I like them I really wish they were both Harry/Daphne. I throughly enjoy TE7's Greengrass, and in both stories I feel the Harry/Daphne teaser overshadows the main pairing. Anyone else have similar thoughts?


** For me it's less about how great Daphne is portrayed in those stories (which she is) and more about how boring and wooden the Delacour love interests are. Daphne's uniqueness and voice stand out more in contrast to how lifeless and bland Fleur and Gabrielle are.

**** It totally is! The more interesting characters in a story the better.

Daphne is more interesting and has a more unique voice than Fleur AND Harry in Letters and they are the two main characters.

******** I actually am working on one now. It's part Haphne, part OC/Fleur experimentation. I literally based Daphne off of Eri Sawachika from School Rumble. It's called Hogwarts Rumble. I'm currently on a break from writing till May though, so it won't be updated for a bit.

*** People that think Daphne is an option or an interest in VP are looking at the story with ship goggles and not paying attention to what's in the text.

It's my fault for recycling names, but people that assume Letters Daphne is VP Daphne is QWC Daphne is VP Daphne is Princess Daphne aren't paying attention. At least [[/u/Rpeh]] picked up on it while reading VP.

**** To me it was pretty clear that Daphne was not a romantic option in VP. VP Harry is much more emotionally distant, jaded and cut off so the potential romance is nonexistent as he is not interested/available for such a thing. I got the impression that Daphne at one time may have carried a torch for him when they were younger but quickly thought better of it based on Harry's personality. She's got too much shit to do in life and doesn't have to time to babysit him. That's what I got out of it anyway.

And while it is clear that the Letters and VP Daphne are not the same they do share a lot of characteristics beyond just the name...it's easy to see why people draw parallels.

** I think part of the problem with reading stories JUST on the focus of pairings sake is you lose some of that mystery about what could happen. If you read those alternate endings and you don't know if you like the fleur or daphne ending then you need to look at why you like either. Both are mostly AU characters. Fleur did have some time in the books but honestly she was a side character at best. Gabby was mostly AU same with Daph.

If people hate on thembeing lifeless and can't stand that love interest its mostly due to the writing not the pairing per say IMO. All 3 girls are blank slates, Fleur and Daph are both off putting and hide emotions, Gabby is just young but full of joy and want. I think they are both interchangeable to a degree and you could find and replace a lot of stories with swap fleur to daph and you still get the same story and you fall in love with the same couple.

The ice queen bit is a over done meta mask. I hate hearing "Ice Queen" or "Ice Princess" in stories like this is some kind of Frozen Disney thing. I think its up to the author to make them interesting and very few try to go far outside of the box in creating unique personalities for each of them. I don't think we have really found anything mind blowing in the last 5 years giving any of them a new spin on something that catches the fic world on fire... yet.

*** I found it interesting that in both stories I was surprised by how much I preferred the potential Harry/Daphne paring over the main paring. The Daphne in both stories isn't the typical “ice queen” instead she's more open, fun and flirty. With letters I read it because it was Harry/Fleur and found Daphne the more compelling character.

** I sort of agree with you about Letters. [[/u/Te7]] has said elsewhere (and often) that he dislikes the story. I wouldn't necessarily go that far but it's definitely his worst, and the main pairing is one reason (the fact that there IS a deliberate pairing is another). Harry/Fleur stories while they're still at school always skirt the edge of creepiness: we're talking about a 17yo girl feeling happy with the idea of a relationship with a 14yo boy after all. If Harry had ended up with Daphne they'd have at least been the same age. On the other hand the fantastically Slytherin plan that Daphne hatches to ensnare Harry didn't really have "happy marriage" written all over it.

VP Daphne/Harry is totally different. Let's start with the way Harry arguably exploits their professional relationship. In chapter 4 Harry says "I think she has a whole four clients" and in ch 6 we get him and Titus described as her "two main clients". Later still in ch 10, Harry says "I'm her biggest client". It could easily be claimed that he's basically using his power in that relationship for sex. She sees it as something more but when she tells him she thought they'd end up married he literally laughs out loud at her. Then there's the pretty cruel way he punishes her for telling her sister about Ellie. The way Harry gradually falls in love with Ellie shows how differently he behaves when he has genuine affection for someone. The relationship with Daphne definitely doesn't overshadow the other one to my mind.

*** It sounds like Daphne is more into the sex than Harry is, but you're right the relationship doesn't exactly overshadow the main one. I did feel like I preferred Daphne over Gabrielle, and although he laughed I could see what see meant about them getting married. Without Ellie showing up they could have easily slid into a comfortable relationship and possibly gotten married. To me it just feels as if he writes Daphne better than he writes whoever the main love interest is.
