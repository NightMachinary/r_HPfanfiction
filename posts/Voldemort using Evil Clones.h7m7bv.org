I'm trying to find an oldish story and I can't seem to find it. All I remember is at some point at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle used magic to clone himself to make a friend, fucked up, and that clone hid him in the Chamber of Secrets under stasis while becoming Voldemort. Voldemort then used the magic that made him to make Clones of Narcissca and Bellatrix.
