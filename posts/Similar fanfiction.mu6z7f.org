​

I wonder if there's any fanfiction that is very similar to 'I, Alone, for a quick summary. It's about lonely and shy Harry being friends with three witches(not harem), but he's worried that he'll hurt his friends, since that they're his only friends that he has.

​

Note that the story is on hiatus since it was last posted in 2019. Anyway, I really enjoy this story, and having Harry with a group of female friends that is not a harem lemon story is very refreshing, I want to know if there are any stories have that kind of similar with loneliness and have multiple female with no problems, shy or very shy Harry, bullying, comfort, with added dark feel, and no lemons.

(Also note that this's my first post, so correct me if I made any mistakes or if anything is unclear.)
