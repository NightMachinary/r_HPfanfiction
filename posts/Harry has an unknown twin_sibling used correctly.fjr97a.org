Anyone have this fic done correctly? I mean like, harry an only child with no family suddenly discovers in his 4th year (or whatever) that he has a sibling/twin that's been hidden from him all his life by our resident Dumbledork. You would assume he would be a bit angry. Pissy. Mad as all hell. But no. He's all fine with his only family being hidden form him and he's just indifferent about it, except maybe an "oh wow, really" then goes back to normal with one other person in his gang.

I want a fic where when harry discovers his long lost sibling has been kept from him on purpose by Dumbledore he loses his shit, the entire castle shakes with his anger, he blows up the quidditch pitch, apparates straight through the Hogwarts wards to a safe haven, whatever. I just want a propper reaction, then he really takes his sibling in, learns all about them and tries as hard as he can to become a good brother (who will do literally anything to keep their only family safe).


** Well, if you want Dumbledore bashing, then I cannot help you (well, there is really no help for you), but I am just in the process of writing a story like this. [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html]] Any comments, objections, and insults will be taken into consideration. Thank you.

*** Not necessarily bashing, more like justified anger

***** To be fair in this scenario anger would be the realistic consequence, even more if you understand that Dumbledore is basically only his headmaster and until the sixth book is more an cool but distant figure than anything else, I mean, by the end of the fifth book they had talked only like 5 or 6 times tops over Harry's whole life. It would be like a stranger coming up to you and saying that he had hidden your grandmother from you without any good reason and expect it to go okay.

Don't get me wrong I am honestly quite tired of Dumbledore!Bashing and think there are much simpler, less convoluted and less monstrous reasons for his actions -like JKR needing him to be the type of character capable of fighting Voldemort head-on without nerfing Voldemort or stealing Harry's thunder for the story. If you want to read a fic that actually justifies in a realistic way Dumbledore's character I would recommend Albus and Harry's world trip, it's a good read if you are tired of the old “Dumbledore is Hittler 2.0” trope like me. linkffn(13388022)

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

****** I mean, I agree, anger is the realistic consequence, and if you noticed there is a lot of anger canonically released, when Harry demolishes the Dumbledore's office. Also, in the end of my the “Uncovering more of the story” (the working title of a chapter, if there was ever one) chapter, Harry & Ginny leave his office, because they don't want to demolish it for the second time. (Also, Bill later in my story is just one step from demolishing the office as well, and we don't even know what happens when McGonagall and Molly Weasley come to call, the latter promises fate worse than death).

I just think the canonical Harry (and mine as well) are in that point mature enough, that when they cool down, they are able to rationally came to the conclusion that even if they don't like him, they need Dumbledore for his knowledge and power, and that people don't have to be the best buddies to stand on the same side of the war front (see also Sirius Black and Severus Snape).

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.
