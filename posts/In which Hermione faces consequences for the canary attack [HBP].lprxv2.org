I'm looking for something where, after Hermione sics the bloodthirsty canaries on Ron,Harry and/or Ron and Lavender report her to Professor McGonagall. I've already seen one where Hermione faced consequences for confounding Cormac McLaggen linkao3(13490793), but I've not found many satisfying ones for the canary attack.


** Commenting cause I'm tired of Hermione getting away with everything and people bashing everyone but her. She's not perfect

** To Be Wanted. Its Luna x Ron instead of Lavender x Ron though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27899653/chapters/68318989]]

** Sorry, could you re-link the fic you mentioned in your post please? Also, I wish you the best of luck. One thing the fandom does not like is Hermione facing consequences, big, small, middle, etc.

** Honestly, I'd love to read any story in which Hermione actually faces consequences for any of her actions and actually grows from it. There are too many that already exist that praise or martyr her.

*** There's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13279982/5/][this fic]], where Ron talks to McGonagall about Hermione not doing more about Crookshanks.

** Kinda happens in Variations of A Scene ([[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-23806-56/Greywizard+Variations+On+A+Scene.htm]]) where one of the canaries /pokes Ron's eye out/ and Harry has to lie about it in order to keep Hermione out of trouble.
