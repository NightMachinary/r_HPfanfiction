:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic at least twice that was Drarry centric. I don't remember where I read it although it had to have been either Ao3 or FanFiction.Net. Harry goes back to Hogwarts for eighth year and for some reason starts sleeping on Draco (like on his lap) because he's comfortable and has issues sleeping. They build a relationship throughout the fic. Then at the end Harry takes his NEWTS, has a PTSD episode then ends up in Draco's arms which is how everyone finds out they're together. Anyone have any ideas what fic this is?
