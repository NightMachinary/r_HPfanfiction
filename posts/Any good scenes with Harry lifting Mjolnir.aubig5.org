Though this request is inspired by rewatch the MCU Age of Ultron scene where everyone tries to lift Thor's hammer, it doesn't have to be a re-do of that specific scene. Really just looking for any scene that does a good job with it.


** Linkffn(12968125) Probably in here some where. It's been a while since I read it.

  In 1998, Mj√∂lnir was sent to Midgard due to Thor being grounded. The hammer landed in Harry James Potter's hand. This is the tale of Harry and his godson, Teddy, visiting Thor fourteen years later and not only does Harry meet the Avengers, he also tells them his story... Notes and Warnings inside. Probably OOC characters. Eventual and only slight Harry/Steve.
