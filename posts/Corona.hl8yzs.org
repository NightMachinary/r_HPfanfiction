Out of curiousity are there fics about how the wizarding would handle the pandemic? Would wizards try and help muggles find a cure that kinda thing


** I mean the very first book has Hagrid explaining to Harry that wizards do not help Muggles solve 'their' problems, and that it is a major reason for the Statute of Secrecy. So I doubt they would. Whether they withdraw EVEN HARDER would be interesting to see.

*** Whilst that is true i would think a pandemic that could affect both worlds and possibly destroy the muggle world would kick them into some sort of action to help them whilst they want there world separate i doubt theyd let something like a pandemic completely wipe out the muggle world without helping them

**** This pandemic isn't going to completely destroy the muggle world, it's just going to kill a lot of muggles, and most wizards don't care about muggles.

If you have wizards help with this, that raises the question, why didn't they help with our various other problems before this? It's hard to keep the story consistent if they choose to help with this but not other stuff.

***** While some Muggleborns would want to help, I feel there would be a bunch of purebloods hoping the pandemic does wipe out as many Muggles as possible.

** Pepper-up potions. Magic overrides mundane nature. Pepper-up potions cure the cold. Cure COVID-19.

It would violate the statute of secrecy, though, and so I doubt they would. The UK isn't obligated to help other countries, though they might choose to do so out of benevolence just like the Ministry isn't obligated to help the muggle government, and would most likely not choose to do so given the Statute.

*** Would love a story where they try to stop something akin to a pandemic and the icw is like nah, statue of secrecy.

Or have muggleborns try to help and have People prosecute them

** Wizards are immune to muggle diseases. They have their own diseases that are exclusive to wizards, like spattergroit and dragonpox.

As for whether they'd help, probably not.

** Boris Johnson: Thank you saving my life the other day, Minister Granger. But can you scale up the production of your cure to save more of our people?

Hermione Granger: I'm sorry, Mr Prime Minister. Our numbers are rather limited. Even if all of our healers work 24/7 to make this cure, we can only produce 300000 in a year, not nearly enough to cover all of Britain. However, if we push really hard, we should be able to make 15000 over the next year, which would be enough to help those who work with us, and some of the critical patients you want us to save. So, is that good enough?

Boris Johnson: Yes, and I thank again for your assistance.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

** There is a very good COVID-19 FIC on ao3 that deals with the virus mutating to target magicals. It's a bit of crack, but a great read.
