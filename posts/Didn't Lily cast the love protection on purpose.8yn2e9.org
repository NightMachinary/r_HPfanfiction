She was clearly talented enough to do it and anyone who says otherwise is wrong.

*** It's not easy, ridiculously hard which is why only Lily could do it. Not even Dumbledore can do it. Lily was Morgan Le Fay reincarnate. She's the most powerful and intelligent and talented and skilled character in the entire series. It's literally in the books. No one can argue James and Sirius were more talented, canon makes a stronger case towards her while the Marauders are idiots.

**** -71 comment karma in 5 days is actually somewhat impressive.

Good job, I guess?

** Talent had nothing to do with the sacrifice. Look at how Harry invokes the love protection in the Deathly Hallows. He only has to willingly give himself up and accept his death, with the strongest desire within him to protect his friends and the other Hogwarts fighters. It has nothing to do with talent, and everything to do with one's capacity to love.

... Of course, this also leaves the question of why there aren't more people with the love protection, as I'm sure it isn't only Lily and Harry that have willingly given their lives for someone they loved throughout the course of Voldemort's wars. That, though, is probably a plot hole of Rowling's making, unless I'm missing something in this picture.

*** It's not (just) about dying for someone. The protection only appears if the murderer explicitly allows someone else the option of saving themselves so they can magically kill someone else. Should that then give themselves up to save the murderer's target. That's something Lily and Harry did.

*** No, you haven't read any fanfiction? She set it all up because of how talented she is

** We don't know. Given Diary Riddle knew about the effect, clearly it's written about somewhere (Restricted Section, most likely). And it's not like knowing about the effect prevents it from being brought out, you just have to meet the requirements of taking someone else's place in dying despite being given an explicit chance by the murderer to save yourself.

So it probably has nothing to do with talent, just moral character. No one can really argue that Lily isn't talented, it's just unclear if that's what the sacrificial protection is a result of.

*** Rowling had to say this, so she didn't know and she didn't cast it on purpose.

  MA: Did she know anything about the possible effect of standing in front of Harry? JKR: No - because as I've tried to make clear in the series it never happened before. No one ever survived before. And no one, therefore, knew that could happen
#+end_quote

She didn't know about it

**** About the potential of blocking the Killing Curse, that's what never happened before. The sacrificial protection is known to exist, Riddle says so and he was only sixteen,and mentions having known it existed but having not considered it at the time:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice ... this is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter. I can touch him now.'
#+end_quote

Edit: nvm, I think you're right.

***** It's just I don't have a problem with Lily being talented but the people like OP who post that she did on purpose and knew about it while ignoring what the author says are frankly being ignorant on purpose (or are trolls). I mean, the post history is a bit... trollish.

But what I do want to know is why people constantly make Lily the Magical savant and not James, while we know he was the top of his class. I don't have a problem as long as its an AU but my problem is that they forget all about James being 'exceptionally bright' as though they do it on purpose.
