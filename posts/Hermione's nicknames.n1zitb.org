In many stories, characters sometimes call Hermione names like Mia, Mio, Herms, Hermy, and the dreaded 'Mione.

Thing is, there's no decent nickname for her, and 'Hermione' is a mouthful.

I propose throwing away her first name entirely and just calling her Jean.


** "Hermione is a silly name. From now you, you shall simply be known as Her."

Five minutes later.

"Ok, the grammar structure of this converstation is giving me migranes. Let's go back to Hermione."

***** I have another one that is secret, ha ha. But sometimes you need to be able to share pictures so I have a smaller public one too!

Also I sort of brainstorm using Pinterest so the secret one is a bit messy where as the public one has more refined ideas, you know how it goes

**** Ninny might too based on Krum's mispronunciation of her name.

Or maybe something ridiculous like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_(Argolis][Argolis]]) based on the Ancient Greek city with the same name.

** Maybe I'm just contrarian, but honestly the name 'Hermione' isn't that much of a mouthful or all that difficult to say, from an anglophone perspective at least. If you are going out of your way to enunciate each syllable sure 'Her-my-o-nee' is a mouthful, but most people don't speak like that. In my accent at least, it gets contracted to 'Hurr-my-knee' and takes less than a second to say clearly.

I thereby petition that the only in character nickname for Hermione is 'Hermy-own-ninny' and I think it's a wasted opportunity to develop the trio's friendship.

**** I respectfully disagree with the implication that it couldn't be used regularly since nicknames are entirely contextual. If it's a serious or semi serious conversation, use her full name. If its common room banter, â€˜Hermy-own-ninny' is perfectly acceptable, especially when she's getting a bit uppity.

** I kinda like Hermy, though. I think it's cute. I've also seen a few fics use the term â€˜Hermy-Hugs' for when she gives a really big hug, and it makes me feel happy fuzziness. :3 And I intent to use it in my own.

** Mia is by far the one I like the best but I cant help myself from pronouncing it like Me-a (rhymes with Kia) when logically if it's a shortening of Hermione it would have to be pronounced Maya (like Mayans).

Since I'm just reading I guess it doesn't really matter but I'm always annoyed when I know I'm wrong ðŸ˜‚

** I was best friends with a girl called Hermione when I was younger, and her nickname was Marny. It was born because I actually couldn't pronounce her name when I met her, which was like 2 years old, and so that's what came out of my mouth and it stuck until we stopped being friends at 12.

To be fair, I wouldn't nickname Hermione Granger 'Marny' though. I actually quite like 'mione.

** I have some of my Harrys using â€˜Miney', but it only works in a cute sibling way because it's so possessive. To me Harry has so little family himb being able to say â€˜you're my person' is nice.

Otherwise I think Mia, but then again. Just realised that I've used that only really as an alter ego, rather than a nickname. It just downs t feel like canon Hermione is a Mia.

Doesn't she canonically hate nicknames? I do too, so it's understandable. some names are just awful for people coming up with ugly names for you.
