Could I get some help please? Knowing the decade is important because it's helpful for setting the scene, and if somebody really loves a topic that relates the that decade, it can really annoy them if you get all the facts wrong, or mishmash a bunch of different decades together, but I don't know how to pick a decade.


** What century did you pick? The medieval age covers roughly a millenia.

*** I was gonna do the 1370s, which is the later part of the era, but I had a /really/ hard time trying to research the fashion, so I was just like “heck it. I don't give a crap about historical accuracy.”

** You could set it sometime during the Black Death (1346-1353) and have Harry be a doctor going around helping people who have the sickness, maybe Arthur has it and that's how he meets Ginny?

*** Actually, I already started it. That's a great fic idea that I might use sometime, though.

** Well, the simplest thing to do is to set it in whatever decade you were the age the characters are, it'll certainly make research a lot simpler as you can more or less use your own life.

But of you want something interesting, you could try either of the world wars? Harry being a soldier let's him keep his heroic tendancies from canon.

Or if you you to be more unique, you could go back further to the Napoleonic Wars. I'm not sure I've seen any fics set then that weren't cut and past Dramione into Pride and Prejudice.

*** No, the medieval era. It ends in the mid-1400s.
