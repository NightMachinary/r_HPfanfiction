Now I really want to see a cheesy story like this.

** I imagine it starts with Albus discovering the only thing that calms Ariana Dumbledore down is quality cheese. Him and the cute german boy bond over perfecting their mad cheese skills.

*** After many years of research and experimentation, they finally produce a vintage with a perfect balance of sharp crumbly flavour and the ability to hold its shape when sliced. The Grater Good.

*** Using their combined talent, they create cheeses that are so good, they can treat or cure otherwise incurable ills.

Cue Albus and Gellert creating incredibly powerful cheeses between them that can cure the cruciatus curse, allow treatement of the Dementor's Kiss, or absorb the Killing Curse when eaten before being hit.

** Finding and tasting the many types of cheeses around the world was more of Gellert's thing. Albus was interested in procuring unique sweets from the Muggle world and introducing them to young witches and wizards. Their brilliant minds came up with business, sales and marketing strategies to create and trade goods from all over the globe in a way that would not to turn off the 'pureblood traditionalists' from their wares.

Years went by and their shop expanded from selling just high-quality cheeses to wines, jams, candies, and more. But while their shop was well known for its wide range of artisan foods, its heart was really Ariana, Albus' soft-spoken younger sister. Rumors of a troubled past leading to squibhood were still whispered from time to time but anyone who was greeted by her gentle smile as they entered the shop would be ashamed of even thinking about those. She was the fountain of stories for every single good in the shop and the people and families that made them. Her presence put people at ease. Those who spoke to her felt that even if she no longer had magic, she was content to have been healed from the trial that she had been through.

While Aberforth did not join his siblings Albus and Ariana in the business (something to do with how he couldn't stand that foreigner, Gellert), he ran the nearby pub and kept a herd of goats that produced milk for Gellert's cheese creations. Although he would deny it, Aberforth's experiments in brewing his own [[https://thegreatergood.co.uk/][beer]] was inspired by the foreigner.

The family had indeed come a long way from what they just referred to as "that day."
