Is the idea that occlumency is one method of resisting veritaserum canon or fanon?


** I think fanon had to invent a way to resist veritaserum, otherwise it's overpowered. Neither the Death Eaters nor the Order would have been infiltrated by spies if they could just catch them with veritaserum.

** Depends on how much weight you give JKR's post-published interviews and such. Here's the reference from her pre-Pottermore website: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221637/https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=105]]

** It's canon in the sense that JKR has said so outside of the books. Some might take this as reason enough to disregard the tidbit, but I think it makes sense in canon's context (being a clear reason why no one used it on Sirius, for one example). IMO it's canon because the books were evidently written with such in mind; Veritaserum's fallibility is implied in the limited use and import the story and characters placed upon something so apparently potent.

The only times we see it used to effect (or attempted to) are on students or a wizard recently incapacitated (Crouch Jr.). It works well on the defenseless, yet not so well on the prepared, like a Jedi mind trick. That's how I think of it. Edit: the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/veritaserum/][lexicon]] has a quote from JKR to this effect.

Preemptive edit: according to the HP lexicon, chapter seventeen of HBP apparently has reference to the possibility of resisting Veritaserum with a well-made antidote on hand (someone who is prepared to be dosed in the first place). If anyone cares to, I'd like for someone to find the relevant passage if it exists. I don't have the book.

A quote from JKR lists the several ways there are to foil Veritaserum including Occlumency, antidote, transfiguration, and sealing one's own throat. No, not written explicitly in the books, but yes, the books were written with this lore behind them. Sorry for the rant.

*** The exact quote:

#+begin_quote
  Harry stared at him.

  “But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as pos­sible, “you don't need me --- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...”

  “Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex­pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston­ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
#+end_quote

So if anything it confirm that Occlumency doesn't protect help against Veritaserum, that Dumbledore knows of anyway.

**** Interesting, thanks for finding that. I don't think the wording really discounts Occlumency as an option; it may just be that an antidote is more reliable, or that the point of Slughorn's proficiency at Occlumency pertains to both suggestions (Legilimency and Veritaserum) and the potential antidote simply compounds on the long odds of success. I see how you could take it like you did, but I don't think JKR would have Dumbledore of all knowledgable characters contradict her own thoughts on the scenario.

** As others have said, there's not a ton of evidence of resisting Veritaserum in canon via Occlumency.

Fanon Occlumency does seem to be able to do absolutely everything, from providing superb spellcasting abilities to a perfect memory.

** It is fanon, Dumbledore did mention that Slughorn was accomplished at Occlumency, but it was more to explain why he could not just extract the information for him with Legilimency. For Veritaserum, he said the Slughorn probably had a vial of Antidote on him all the time.

Then it depends if you consider it canon or not, but Rowling explained in a later interview, when asked why people didn't use Veritaserum all the time (outside of the obvious morality issues) that, while nobody could "resist" the potion, there were several ways around it :\\
For example, an able Wizard could transfigure the potion into water the moment it touches his mouth, or "seal his throat" so he doesn't drink it.\\
Another possibility that can be used to explain why they didn't use it on Sirius (outside of they put him in jail with no trial because he looked like guilty and that was Crouch method) is that the Veritaserum doesn't make you say the truth, but what you think is the truth. In a world where memories can be erased or changed with a flick of hand, it would be so easy to make a criminal think he is innocent, and an innocent think he is a criminal. Hell, we even have a canon example with Voldemort making Morfin thinks he was the one who killed the Riddles.

** I'm pretty sure it's fanon, at least I don't remember anything about it in the books. I think that it was mentioned there isn't a way to resist Veritaserum, but I might be wrong..

*** It's the exact opposite, it was mentioned that there was ways for Slughorn to resist forceful interrogation about what he told Tom, I don't remember if they mentioned Veritaserum directly but it was implied.

**** No, it's fanon/retcon. Here's the passage from the 6th book where Dumbledore explicitly states that Slughorn would be carrying an antidote to Veritaserum, and Occlumency being a defense is only for Legilimency.

#+begin_quote
  “But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as pos­sible, “you don't need me --- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ..."

  “Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex­pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston­ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
