Alot of the Marauders fics I see are focused on romance especially Jilly and I love them but I do want to see more focused on their actual friendship. So ya Marauders fics with either no romance or where romance is like a very minor thing. The main focus is on plot or character relationships that are platonic or both. It doesnt matter what the ships are if there are any as long thats true. It can be focused on all the Marauders as a group or like any duo in the Marauders.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  Mr. and Mrs. Black, of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, were proud to say they were perfectly pureblooded, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to give birth to a blood traitor, an abomination, or a filthy stain of dishonour on their (quite incestuous) family tree... (UNDER REVISION)

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.
