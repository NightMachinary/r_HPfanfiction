** At first I thought you wanted a fic about Fluffy the three headed dog:)

** There's the "It's only love" series from Marvolo666. A nice, fluffy Harry/Luna fic that has teenagers act like teenagers. Since the smutty part disappeared from FFN here's the AO3 link.

  After Slughorn's party, Harry Potter realizes he likes Luna as more then a friend...then Luna tells Harry how she feels, in a way only Luna could. Both characters confronted with the nature of love, is it really that simple.

  Sequel to It's Only Love. It's the uncensored and slightly more comedic version of It's Only Love's second chapter It's Only Natural. Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood have just confessed their love for eachover. Now they do what everyone on this bloody sight does. The two characters overcome their emotional barriers to share their love in a smut filled scene that is as award as it is hot. Not my typical chose of writing but frankly I feel rebellious
