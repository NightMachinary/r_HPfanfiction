Video game fics, which are the ones where Harry suddenly find his universe obeying the rules of a videogame, usually after he dies, are a guilty please of mine, but all the ones I've seen are abandoned. If you know of one that's either complete or still being updated please link it. Any particularity good examples from another fandom would be fine too.

** Linkffn(11798236) is one, although it's very new and I can't guarantee quality, although the author is excellent when it comes to consistent updates.

  A thoughtless comment during the final battle, and Voldemort realizes the danger he's in and how to avoid it. Harry appears in Limbo alone with his regrets, until he finds a strange game... about himself. What happens when Harry decides to play, changing things in the process? Second chance, gamer!Harry, girl!harry(?), fanfic cliches used and/or twisted.
