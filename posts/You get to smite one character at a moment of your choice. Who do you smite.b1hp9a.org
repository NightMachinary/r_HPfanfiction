Pettigrew at the Graveyard? Merope Gaunt for being a rapist? Umbridge? Voldemort before he can make a Horcrux? That one background Hufflepuff for his ugly haircut?

Also, what consequences do you expect?


** Merope before she can rape Tom Riddle Sr.

Or, if we're going with "Grindelwald was behind Hitler", Grindelwald before that duel that kills Arianne happens.

  */Merope before she can rape Tom Riddle Sr./*
#+end_quote

I was gonna say "Tom Riddle before he can create his first Horcrux", but upon reflection, I like this idea better.

Now, as to the consequences, let's see. If Merope is taken out before she can date-rape Tom Sr., Junior is never born. So we have no Voldemort, meaning no Death Eaters, and no subsequent Wizarding War. The Longbottoms, the Potters, the McKinnons, the Prewetts - all of Voldemort and the Death Eaters' victims are fine.

Harry grows up a happy, normal wizard, raised in Godric's Hollow by his loving parents and equally devoted godfather. At the age of 11, he goes to Hogwarts, /doesn't/ have to deal with someone trying to murder him practically every year, gets to cheer on Cedric Diggory with his friends as the latter wins the Triwizard Tournament in Fourth Year, graduates, and goes on to whatever career path he has chosen, which may very well be quite different depending on his experiences during those seven years.

*EDIT:* Actually, while I still like the idea, I'm gonna go back to my first idea: */"Tom Riddle before he can create his first Horcrux"/*

To be more specific, I would do so just before his Basilisk kills Myrtle Warren. That is probably the most morally defensible choice because:

- There is probable cause to assume someone controlling a giant snake is out to attack and possibly kill someone
- The act is taken in the defense of an otherwise defenseless girl, while there is a clear and present, direct threat to her life. That still leaves, of course, the snake to deal with, but that's another problem.

The basic outcome is still more or less the same. Without Tom Riddle/Voldemort, the odds are that his gang of friends never becomes the massive threat that he turned the Death Eaters into, which still prevents the subsequent Wizarding War.

I dont believe wizards would be affected in high enough numbers for them to waste Aurors on jobs like this, even if there were 1000 wizard casualties(which would be the highest amount I could imagine) it makes more sense to recruit some civilian wizards than to use Aurors which are important for the nations safety and you dont have that many of.

I think I wasnt clear enough, I dont think Wizards ever based their borders around Muggle ones. Like why would the Wizards Council for example ever care what muggle king rules over what lands in the British Isles.

No they didn't, the general wizard avoided muggles, it was notable when Wizard mixed with muggles and even then they often stayed in hiding.

The wizards didn't just create their magical governments overnight when they created the statue of secrecy, they already had established theirs and had no reason to keep changing their jurisdiction because of the claims of some muggles.

Probably not that much, accidental magic seems to stop with age and I really doubt that many kids would be hit and even then most accidental magic tends to be harmless, but because of the trace it would become even easier to locate magic around them.

I still dont see them recruiting aurors for jobs like this, like even if it was the HRE I doubt they would have more than 50 Aurors, it makes more sense to send literally anyone else, rather than the ones protecting the nation form dark wizards.

Petunia-without that hostility, does Lily's warmth nurture Snape out of a Slytherin sorting? Alternatively, who raises Harry?

(Can you imagine the horrors the marauders would wreak if they included Snape?)

Greyback-who is Remus without lycanthropy? What influence does this supremely skilled wizard and teacher have, when not on the fringes of society? Obviously he needs a new name. Name like that he was destined for wolf-dom.

And not every wizard would be able to brew that potion, so you couldn't even look at the total amount of wizards for that. I doubt even a fifth would be able to do it. You'd honestly probably be looking at some tens of thousands of wizards brewing.

And that's just cancer. There are over twice as many HIV cases (37 million in 2017). There are 50+ million alzheimer's cases. There are about *200 million* malaria cases worldwide. And I'm not even listing a tenth of all the diseases.

You would need to enslave every capable wizard and have them work around the clock to keep up with all the diseases, nevermind all the other problems muggles would ask to be solved, such as world hunger or wars or poverty or whatever. And they probably /still/ wouldn't be able to keep up.

  ‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?'

  ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.'

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  ‘He took my blood,' said Harry.

  ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. *‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!'*

********** It's a bit more complicated than that:

#+begin_quote
  “Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected.

  “He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.

  “I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?”

  “But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry.

  “My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.

  Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here.

  “He killed me with your wand.”

  “He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry.

  “I think we can agree that you are not dead --- though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.”

  ‘Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself on to the only living soul left in that collapsing building.

Because for the soul piece to move on the container has to be destroyed, that is how Horcruxes are described to work. The point of a killing curse is to kill, Harry was killed, that means the container for the soul piece was destroyed and the soul piece moved one.

Voldemort stirred up fear, hatred, and pride to lead people on his path, but there had to be fear, hatred, and pride to stir up. It may not have happened then and there, but the most probable cause of taking Voldemort out of the picture is some other dark lord or lady rising during Harry's childhood/school/early adulthood.
