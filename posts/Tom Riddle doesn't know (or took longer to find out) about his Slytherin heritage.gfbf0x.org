Was just wondering what would have happened if Tom Riddle never found out about his heritage, for some reason couldn't prove it ("you're a parselmouth??? HA, big deal"), or only found out much later (maybe he just.....never met a snake. I know I haven't)

Like, at school he was a nobody muggleborn orphan, but still a talented power-hungry death-fleeing megalomaniac, so would he still try to take over the world but without relying on blood purity politics? Would he fight for muggleborns? Would he go at it alone, him against the world? Would he be more subtle about power, maybe trying to become Minister or something? +Would he learn humility and become a good person lmao who knows?+

Or something where he's (secretly?) adopted by another wizard family, so his blood status is less of a problem among his peers but he still doesn't know he's a descendant of Slytherin?
