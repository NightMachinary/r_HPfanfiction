This had annoyed me for ages. The cloak is a contraption that let's you hide from Death itself, apparently. Yet the cloak can be summoned (if I'm remembering correctly) with a simple "Accio", Albus Dumbledore can see through it, animals can detect a presence within the cloak and a simple magical eye can let you see through it.

This cloak was a gift from Death itself. It ensured the survival of the youngest Peverell and was thought to be the smartest choice out of the three brothers. Yet in Canon its only virtue seems to be the fact that it wouldn't wear out.


** I saw it as not being expanded on to play into the idea that nobody really knows much about the Hallows in general besides the wand.

In my head canon I always thought of it as one can literally avoid death (but just barely) by being under the cloak. Suffering from starvation and don't know if you'll be able to find food in the next month or so? Stay under the cloak and you'll live. You'll still be hungry, weak and miserable though. And if you take off the cloak before eating, you're on the train to the next great adventure.

** Except it wasn't really a gift from Death itself, in reality it is a showcase of masterful enchantment and crafting on the part of the youngest Peverell brother. Dumbledore can see through it because of Homenium Revelio and Super-sensory Charms , Moody's eye doesn't see through but instead sees a gap that he identifies as Harry's cloak, and animals can smell people. Simple as that. As for the Accio, is that something shown in the books or that you read in fanfictions? Because the ones I read tell you can't use a number of spells and charms, including Accio, on it.

** Rowling's writing is all about the plot, and she will make contradictory or illogical changes and additions to characters and the world in order to make plot happen. This leads to loads of interesting concepts, like the cloak and horcruxes and portraits and rituals and time turners that never get explained in more detail than is absolutely necessary for story.

As one example, this is why in Philosopher's Stone, Harry nearly dies because he's waiting for Dumbledore to fly by broom from London, and then every single book after that mentions a faster and more efficient form of travel he would logically have used instead - Floo, Apparition, House Elf Travel, Phoenix Travel etc. Because in PS, she needed a means of transport that felt "wizardy" and allowed a sport for Harry to play, but also needed it to be slow enough that Dumbledore not being at Hogwarts made sense. In later books, she needed travel to be quicker and lead to things like Dobby rescuing the Trio in DH, the Knockturn Alley scenes in CoS etc, so she invented them and didn't care about the retroactive effect.

Over 7 books, this leads to worldbuilding which is incredibly wide and has loads of interesting things to pick out, but without real depth of understanding or logic to those things. They're window dressing or plot makers.

Like Love Potions, which are simultaneously portrayed (rightly) as essentially magic rape drugs, and their use factored into the main villain's tragic backstory but also Love Potions are a fun prank that the Weasley twins sell.

When they're relevant to the plot, they are highly powerfu,l dangerous and scary. Characters are rightly worried about being dosed with them and rightly angry when others are.

But when they're window dressing, they're just another item in Fred and George's shop and so the ethical and legal implications are unexplored.

It's minor in the 4th because the Weasleys didn't need the portkey to travel to the World Cup (certainly the Diggorys didn't) but Rowling needed to introduce portkeys. It's much bigger in the 5th book since the Order could've transported Harry using side-along instead of brooms.

Another one that's obvious is time-turners - if Dumbledore could get one in 3rd year for Hermione to take extra classes, he could get one in 2nd year and use it to travel back after a student gets petrified, then watch it happen and know what the monster is early. And that's off the top of my head. But they were necessary to make Book 3 end properly, so they were introduced at the end of Book 3 and never used or explained again.

Rather than creating a world, and telling a story in it, she wanted to tell a story and so built the world to fit. This works, and because you're never expected to focus on the inconsistent or flawed world elements for too long you can still enjoy the story just fine in spite of them.

But of course, a fanfic community wants to tell new stories in the same world, so we are hypersensitive to world flaws that are papered over in the canon.

** It is canonically questionable wether the cloak was a gift from death, or just made by one of three talented brothers.

And assuming the latter, it's an invisibility cloak that doesn't go bad with age, unlike any other. And that's worth something.

Also, from a storytelling perspective it makes it much better if Mrs. Norris can sense the presence, as it raises the stakes, and makes the scene more exciting for the 11 year olds reading the books.

Yes, this does mean that the world does appear to be not perfectly consistent in parts. But the cloak isn't part of some MMORPG where every artifact has to make sense and be balanced. It's job is to enable the telling of an exciting story, and it does fullfil that purpose.

To the guy that Rowling "isn't that good of a writer" and HP was just a fluke: of course there was a tremendous amount of luck involved in the success of the Harry Potter series. It had nice marketing, came at the right time, and had brilliant movies.

However, Rowling is good at writing stories, and building a world that feels real and exciting, and tells a great story in it. That takes skill. Maybe she isn't the best writer (whatever that means), but if you claim she's entirely unskilled, you just show your own ignorance.

But look at how many people say "I want to go to Hogwarts", assign themselves a house, have bought robes, ... vs. in LOTR. Crafting a world that people want to live in is a skill unto itself.

It's the same with George Lucas and Star Wars: maybe not the most consistent world, but light sabers and jedi are /cool/.

Which is why there is a Harry Potter world theme park, and why there's big Star Wars section at themeparks.

Compare this to the MCU, which has a world just as big if not bigger, also has urban fantasy elements, but is just way less cool, imo. What would you put in "MCU world"? The Stark tower?

******* IMO, I think her approach is kind of like being a really good tour guide. You show the best and most interesting things in a place, make the people on the tour want to explore and do things in the place, but miss out a lot of the 'day-to-day' substance that actually makes a place work. No city tourist-tour will cover the sanitation plants, for example (though I'd really like to go on one that does :D), but they'd cover the cool castle and the government building and that place that singer lived that one time.

That's the kind of worldbuilding Rowling is truly phenomenal at - her world is a flimsy cardboard cutout coloured in on only one side by a mildly drunk six-year old, but she sells it incredibly well and makes it feel 'magic'. She's great at conveying emotive context, not so much the logic and structure.

Those are two very different parts of writing, storytelling is what most people notice but world building is all about avoiding plot holes and many major writers aren't great at that.

I mean, that's just wrong. Firstly, it's called "plot hole" not "worldbuiling hole" for a reason. And secondly, the only way to stay completely consistent is to not build any significant world at all -- no matter your skill. So a good world-builder needs at least some semblance of creativity, which Rowling has in spades.

*********** I just listed two things that were stated to be hard rules, just because Rowling doesn't remember her own rules doesn't mean they don't exist.

Here's some hard rules that I can't think of a violation of:

-It's not possible to bring back the dead

-Food cannot be created from nothing

-You cannot go more than a day back in time

-You cannot use time travel to change the past

-Parseltongue can not be learned

There's probably plenty more but I don't feel like looking them up, however these are all HARD RULES even if Rowling struggles to explain a lot of them.

The world of Harry Potter is considered a fantasy with hard rules because they cast actual spells with consistent effects and their magic can be measured or predicted. In comparison, Lord of the Rings has soft rules because they just make vague comments and gestures about their magic and something unexpected happens.

** The story about Death was just a fairytale in canon. It arose because of the legend about three extremely talented brothers, who presumably all hand-crafted these objects. The wand and cloak are, possibly, the very best of their kind but not perfect. The stone is very clever but doesn't truly bring anyone back, which is part of the moral of the story.

The moral is that you can't beat death by outsmarting or being more skillful. The Peverell brothers were possibly the best inventors and craftsmen ever and they tried to beat Death and couldn't. You can only ''beat' Death by accepting your faith and coming quietly. That way you die a dignified death.

This is why Dumbledore thinks Harry truly was the right person to unite the objects (their unification carries a lit of symbolism especially for Dumbledore who once in the folly of youth believed in their powers and wanted to collect them all with Grindelwald). Harry did walk up to Death and let Voldemort kill him. And then of course he lived.

So that would be why lots of people like to think that it's the mastery of the three objects/death's equal that saved him, but that's not what the story meant at all. Equal to Death meant braving Death and not tryi g to find ways of being immortal. we know it's lily's sacrifice in Voldemort's blood that saves him, we know that the death thing is just a story and didn't make any difference.

It is very symbolic, though, and fits with the themes of the books.

** As is always the case, J.K. Rowling is far better at writing an entertaining book than at producing a coherent plot. The Deathly Hallows are introduced as though they will be an interesting element of the story, but Rowling then goes on to violate the Chekhov's Gun rule by introducing them, making them seem like they'll be of enormous importance (especially the notion of the Master of Death) and then shoehorning them awkwardly in to the plot.

I don't want to give the impression I don't respect Rowling's ability to write. She's one of the best authors I've ever encountered; her commercial success is well deserved. She can't write a coherent plot, though. All the Harry Potter stories suffer from having idiotic plots in which huge elements make no sense. The fact that Rowling produces a wonderfully readable story in spite of this is a testament to her capacity to write well.

I read a fic once that had them experiment with the cloak, and they discovered that in the area the cloak covers and essentially "mimicks", light doesn't combine into other colors as it should.

If it did, it'd be called the Undetectability Cloak or the Immortality Cloak.

"Death itself" doesn't even exist in canon (or no more than the Easter bunny exists in the real world).

The only real plot hole around invisibility cloaks in canon is that we don't see any of the regular ones. They're just as useful and would be worthwhile in a major war, despite how expensive they are.

**** It's quite interesting to see a world get taken apart and put back together so many different ways...... It's like watching a God work.

** None of the hollows are fleshed out The wand is supposedly unbeatable but is t explained as to how The stone conjures phantasm of loved ones but can it show those that the user doesn't know? Is it pulling souls from the afterlife or creating an illusion based on the memories of the user I think the hallows are something jk came up with near the end of the series so didn't really flesh them out as well as she could have

** Honestly I ignore JK's cannon when it comes to the cloak, among other things. I usually say that the cloak is able to fully conceal a fully grown wizard or witch, even from below. They can even stick their hand out and grab something without being seen. As long as it is properly fastened and worn, amd the user doesn't want to be seen, this applies, but if a bunch of young mages get under one cloak together, it has to reach down to all of their feet and cover their heads completely, along with all of them wishing not to be seen.

** The myth is that death gave the three brothers the gifts. But history tells that the peverell brothers were skilled artificers. Its entirely possible that they created the three hallows and the story sprung up later. Note that the tale of the three brothers does not make an explicit connection to the peverells.

** Moody's Eys isn't a simple magical eye, it was created by Dumbledoer using another Hallow.

*** Yes and no: in universe, the Tale of the Three Brothers is very much a fairytale, but that doesn't make the Hallows themselves any less powerful, it just means that they were made by wizards, rather than being gifts from Death itself. Besides, by that logic, there should only be one wand.
