” my snake here tells me some amusing tales Mr. Malfoy” Harry said

”Ah and what would that be Mr. Potter” Malfoy asked

”He tells me that you soiled yourself”

This was in a fic where Salazar Slytherin was re incarnated as Harry Potter (kinda)

Also in Dumbledore's office with Amelia, Kingsley, Albus, Minerva, Severus, Draco, Narcissa and Proudfoot (an auror i think)

Most people there laugh and Severus is hiding his amusement well

Linkffn(courage and cunning)

The fic is amazing go read it now

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
