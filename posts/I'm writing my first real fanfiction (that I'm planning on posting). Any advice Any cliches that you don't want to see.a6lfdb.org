It's a Marauders Era fic, centered on Lily's thoughts and memories right before she walks down the aisle. Here's the copy if you're curious. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CVoPPDD8ruBM4F3_DAMyF83c1Kqch1OXw2zSXe5RMcI/edit?usp=sharing]] Is there anything you think I should change? All criticism is welcome. If it's terrible, please feel free to tell me so.


** I think it's pretty good.

If I were going to nitpick, I would question whether 11-year-old Wizard-raised James would understand an insult centered on a condom breaking before a student with Muggle family reacted.

*** I doubt most 11-year-olds would get that, regardless of upbringing.
