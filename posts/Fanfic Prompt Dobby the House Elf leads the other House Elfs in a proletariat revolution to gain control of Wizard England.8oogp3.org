Extra points if at the end of your fanfic Dobby ends up successful.


** When you say successful, do you mean that he actually runs "wizarding" England as a Marxist nation or do you mean something like out of Animal Farm?

** So what, in this fic Dobby is essentially Vladamir Lenin taking over the Soviet Union? Imagine if he dies, there was now a casket with a preserved body of Dobby on display in the Ministry of Magic atrium. Winky would be like Trotsky, and finally Kreacher takes over as the Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, and brings them to heel and purges huge swaths of the government and population, both out of fear and due to governmental mismanagement.

Also, by proxy, does that make Harry their version of Erich Ludendorff? After all, Ludendorff smuggled Lenin across Europe into the Russian heartland as a way to undermine and topple the Russian government. He regretted his actions afterward, because in nearly destroyed Germany when Bolshevism spread across Eastern Europe too. I can just see Harry being totally ripped apart afterward for not understanding why house elves were treated the way they were. And then Hermione, ironically, tries to lead a rebellion afterwards. I guess that makes her something like wizarding Hitler. No...wait...Voldemort already has that job.

*** Yeah but if you want Harry to 'win' his war then comparing him to Ludendorff may not work.

**** No no no! This scenario supposes the house elves take over, so both Harry and Voldemort lose. So Ludendorff still fits, and I think Dumbledore is Hindenburg (that only sort of works).

I guess that makes Hermione the crown prince Franz Ferdinand or Gavrilo Princip (either one could work). They both got this whole thing started anyway, and Hermione spent all this time banging on about house elf rights. She even has her own organization for their rights willing to take drastic measures (The Black Hand = S.P.E.W. for those of you not following me).

***** So the elves take over 'Germany' instead of 'Russia'? Because Ludendorff was from Germany.

I'd totally take Hermione as Princip. She starts the ball rolling mostly by accident because she doesn't even start her crusade until Crouch (who could be Ferdinand with a bit of hand-waving) treats Winky poorly.

****** The house elves are a different species, they might as well be from a different country. They have their own rules and customs, almost a separate culture even that wizards barely know/are even aware of.

And Winky goes on to become "the Voice of the House Elves" kind of like Trotsky afterwards, severing sort of as their head of propaganda.
