Looking for Harry being a big brother to two siblings. A younger brother as well as even younger sister. Anything else is pretty much a go, but would like to see Harry's protective side brought out in regards to them. Thanks!

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
