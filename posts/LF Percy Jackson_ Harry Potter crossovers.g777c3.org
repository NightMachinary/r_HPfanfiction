I've read a lot of these, and I was wondering if there were any anyone on this sub could recommend, considering that most of the PJOHP crossovers seem to be written by hormonal preteens. LF something long, and with a good plot. Nico is one of my favourite characters, so if he's in there that'd be great. slash/gen whatever is fine. No fem!Harry unless it's not weird. Thanks.


** The only one I'm aware of is linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter) - where Harry finds his way to Olympus after being abandoned in America as a child. It's basically a pretty cute fic, so it's worth a try.

**** This is a really great story, with an interesting plot. Was truly one of my favourites, unfortunately the author, while amazing, has only finished a single story, and this one is abandoned.

  Gabriel Herrol's The Squatter of Olympus Response: Stranded in New York, Harry wandered alone with no idea what to do, where to go or who might help him. Maybe he should do the first thing anyone does in New York: look up! Grey Super Harry/Thalia; Magical-Percabeth;
