I've been looking for a good HHr fanfic for a while, that fits either of these criteria. tbh, I'm suprised I'm having such a hard time with the Minerva fic idea. But, if you can find one, please link. I'd prefer them to be 60,000 words+. Thanks so much!


** I tried reading this a while ago and while I couldn't finish it, it has both a supportive Snape and McGonagall. linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities)

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.

That probably fits your criteria, I can't stand Snape so I didn't read much but it didn't seem like a bad fic.
