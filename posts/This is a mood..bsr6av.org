Currently eating string cheese at 1:43 AM while trying to find some good Harry Potter fanfiction to read because some of the better ones never end up finished.


** Some long (~500k words each) and completed fics from my favorite list:

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

All are highly recommended!

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** My feelings exactly. Especially on the Denarian Lord series by Shezza. Read through 1, 2 and 3, loving it, and then I just get hit with a 2 chapter book 4 and no update since 2011 :/

** Some of my favorite Harry Potter fanfics are The Mudblood on Quotev it's an OC insert that covers all 7 years and sometime after (completed and super long by Kirstin I believe is the authors name) and the other is called Veal and Venison Tom x Hermione on Wattpad (also completed and long) and the last I'll talk about is a series of long books on different characters that all intertwine on wattpad. The first book to read is called Tightly Knit and from there you'll find the rest of the books in the series. (There are a lot of them)

** Like someone once said, it's either a fic with good characterization but unfinished or finished but not so good. Apparently you can't have all the good things at once. But it's frustrating.
