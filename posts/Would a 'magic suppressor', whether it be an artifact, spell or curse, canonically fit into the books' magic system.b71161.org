*** Not necessarily, if they're hard and expensive to make. Don't forget that mass-production of magical artifacts is largely impossible in the Wizarding World, since you can't just expect a low-wage worker, let alone a robot, to be able to cast complex enchantments.

In other words, you might as well ask why Saint-Mungo's doesn't just keep a stock of Philosopher's Stones and use /that/ on their patients, or why everyone doesn't just take a big swig of /Felix Felicis/ every morning. Those things are /hard to make/, and there's less than a dozen wizards, worldwide, who have the necessary skill --- and they might not be willing to spend every working hours making them, either.

***** Well, all this tells us is that Broom enchantments are not that hard to cast. It does not preclude that, like Philosopher's Stones, our hypothetical magic-sapping manacles are significantly harder to make --- in much the same way that in the Muggle world, the ease with which electrical toothbrushes are mass-produced does not translate to easy mass-production of moon rockets, particle-colliders and atomic clocks.

***** Is this a quote from somewhere? At any rate, I find it entirely plausible that /Felix Felicis/ is as refined as it can possibly be and no amounts of luck would allow you to make it any more efficient than it already is. Think speed-of-light-type limitations on the fundamental laws of the universe.

And for the record, I don't think "luck poisoning", or any other side-effects of "overdosing" on /Felix Felicis/, exist in book-canon; IIRC Harry didn't act as though he was in a daze, or otherwise negatively affected, because of the dose he took in the books.

****** Nah, not a quote. I was just making it up on the spot. But on the poisoning thing:

#+begin_quote
  It is meant to be used sparingly, however, as it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence if taken in excess. Felix is highly toxic in large quantities, [Blah blah blah...]. It is very difficult to make, disastrous if made wrong, and requires six months to stew before it is ready to be consumed.

******** Huh, maybe the reason Felix Felicis is so complicated is that you're not just brewing a potion, you're brewing a potion that continually re-brews itself over the course of 6 months. A potion that automatically performs the loop of 'make a potion-enhancing solution>use the solution to make a stronger potion-enhancing solution' for you until it produces a top-tier luck potion at the end.

** Cannonically there are many ways to supress specific magic. Anti-apparation wards, anti concealment/imperious (Thief's Downfall), many counter curses can be interpretted this way. However, the only thing in cannon that seems to affect a variety of magics is in fact the Thief's Downfall. I highly doubt it would be considered reasonable that a device could in a non permanent way prevent the casting of magic.

As to permanent ways, I still find it unlikely. Hagrid can still do magic after expulsion. Sirus, Bella, and assorted death eaters can still do magic after life sentances in Azkaban.it doesn't seem plausible.

Gonna stop you right there: this is fanon. In canon, it is specifically /Hogwarts/'s magic which messes with electricity, not just a great concentration of magic anywhere. You could use a cell phone in the heart of Diagon Alley if you liked.

The reason for this is ambiguous; Taure has the headcanon (based on his well-known "symbolic" magic system) that magic and science are on some quantifiable level antithetic, and so a place of magical learning repels science. Another headcanon which I really like is that the Founders put a specific spell on Hogwarts to nullify electricity within its bounds; the idea at the time was to ward off lightning, which seemed like a necessary precaution considering the Castle had such high towers; what they hadn't expected was that hundreds of years down the line this would become a great inconvenience to milder uses of electricity.

Well, we don't know that.

This is what Hermione says: /â€œAll those substitutes for magic Muggles use --- electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things --- they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air."/

So it sounds more like any place with a significant amount of magic in the air disrupts electricity. But you are right that magic alone does not do it. It's only when there's "too much" magic. We see Arthur Weasley use magic to fix an electric fireplace, for example. There is also the Bond of Blood Charm placed over the Dursley's home.

*** I don't know if /they/ do, though certainly you could redefine them that way in an AU with a minimum of fuss. I saw the inability of wizards to cast magic after prolonged Dementor exposure more of apiece with the way Merope lost her magic when she sunk into depression --- it seems a modicum of self-confidence is required for magic, which you lose when you get too severely depressed. Therefore Dementors' magic-removing abilities would be a simple side-effect of their regular old "aura of misery" shtick.
