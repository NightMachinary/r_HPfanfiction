Hi everybody, i was recently listening to old episodes of potterless podcast and finally grasped how terrible can Hermione be as an enemy. When i first read HP&the goblet of fire, i thought Rita Skeeter deserved to be threatened, and the fact that Hermione actually took her in hostage in her bug form didn't shock me that much. But rereading this as an adult, i'm terrified. This is not ok!

Then there was the part with the DA meetings and the secretly enchanted parchment that gave Marietta (was that her name?) acne all over the face 'cause she snitched to Umbridge. And although i agree that this was useful, Hermione actually tricked everyone into signing an enchanted parchment. I doubt that is how you treat the people who are on your side...

These two things are presented as absolutely normal by JKR, because it was "for the greater good". And it scares the shit out of me to imagine Hermione grown up and in politics. She could do terrifying things "for the greater good"...

Given that she's a teenager, maybe that's not what's going to happen, this is just a possible scenario. What do you think about this side of Hermione's personality?


** It's like the only reason she is such a stickler for rules is because she knows it's her replacement for actual morals. As soon as she is required to break the rules there is no sense of right or wrong anymore, so why not set the teacher on fire, imprison someone for a semester or obliviate her parents? I'm only partly joking.

Yes. And no.

In both the books and the films Hermione alters her parents' memories to make sure that they a) move to Australia and b) don't know and don't remember they had a daughter.

However, in the books the effects of Obliviating someone seem be irreversible, so Hermione only says that she modified her parents' memories, not that she erased them.

** Harry considered the DA curse brilliant, he said as much into Cho's face. And given that Marietta effectively sold them out to Voldemort's tender mercies by proxy and a torturer of children directly, well acne is a very mild punishment for treason.

Rita was out of line, but as we saw the next year, there's hardly a reliable legal system, so it's not like there were any other options (Dumbledore repeatedly couldn't keep a death Eater out of his school for a year, nevermind a "journalist"). I mean, what else was Hermione supposed to do, squash a bug? There's neither a legal alternative nor a "tell a person of authority" route available.

#+end_quote

Given what we've seen of magical Britain, a good amount of house cleaning is necessary after the war. Something between the NÃ¼rnberg tribunals and the French revolution. You'd need someone like Hermione at her peak ruthlessness to make sure the aftermath of the Voldemort wars is properly dealt with. Sometimes a doctor will prescribe you ice cream and painkillers, sometimes you have to amputate a limb. And postwar, there's need for a good bonesaw rather than the sugar free lollypop dentists give children.

Rita, well the other alternative was "turn the other cheek" and we see in OOTP how well Harry deals with the media campaign when he has no way to fight back until the interview. And again, short of sabotaging the prophet or bombing the Ministry, what could they realistically do? Little resistance tactics are not effective against the likes of Umbridge, who isn't above the cruciatus curse and assassinations.

A friend shouldn't do that stuff, and though she meant well, she shouldn't have gone behind Harry's back when she thought his firebolt was cursed.

** linkffn(The Girl Nobody Knows, A Soliloquy by Technomad) explores this from a humorous angle.

More than one fanfic has run with this, characterising Hermione as one of those sorts who doesn't /get/ the whole social-functioning thing because she's somewhat neurodivergent. If she'd had a difficult childhood, she'd be some flavour or other of antisocial personality disorder. As it is, she's a carefully and patiently /socialised/ personality disorder - had Mr. and Mrs. Granger hired a /slightly/ less competent nanny, she'd be a serial killer.

But Hermione's quite empathetic, understands social nuance, and has no trouble interacting with other people. The fact that she's a bossy nerd who's sometimes (justifiably) ruthless doesn't make her anything like a serial killer.

**** I've ranted about this before, but we really do need more fics in which Hermione becomes the full-fledged antihero of the trio. Her questionable actions should, of course, have consequences; but there is more than one way to respond to consequences.

What Harry and Ron don't know can't hurt them. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Memory Charms, Legilimency, Confundus, and Occlumency are a girl's best friends. The ends justify the means. Dark Arts... are probably still too dangerous to practice without expert supervision, but it's important to know the theory, just in case.

I would like to see Hermione lose out on the Prefect badge not because of what she did to Marietta, but because of worse stuff that McGonagall and Dumbledore strongly suspect but can't prove.

For that matter using Stations of Canon as points of reference (and keeping in mind that the story would probably diverge long before then), I would like to see her "punishment" of a traitor to be something Harry and Ron might deem a bit excessive, rather than celebrate. I would like to see Harry be worried about sharing Half-Blood Prince's Potions book with Hermione, because of how she might use the knowledge in it---and then learn that Hermione had already copied and examined it, as a part of her "Protective Big Sis" routine. Have Harry and Ron learn that both Dolohov and Throwle committed suicide a few months after Hermione obliviated them at the diner---and then wonder whether they should talk to Hermione about it or whether they'd rather not know.

Here's a snippet.

--------------

The "Half-Blood Prince's" book was presently sitting at the bottom of the chest in his dormitory room. Still, Harry could not stop thinking about it, as he tried to study in the Gryffindor Common Room.

On the one hand, Hermione was a close and loyal friend who meant well, and she probably wouldn't use it against him or any of their friends. On the other hand, there was some nasty magic in that book, that she would likely use against people who might not deserve it. (He shuddered at the memory of what had happened to Marietta only a few months prior. The girl did tattle on them, but even she didn't deserve /that/.) On the third hand, if he didn't share the book and Hermione found out anyway---and she always found out---then, well, she probably wouldn't hurt him, but she would probably trust him less as a resort. Which was pretty hypocritical, since she had no compunctions about keeping secrets from him and Ron. But on the fourth hand...

"I would be rather more willing to share secrets with you if you didn't slack on your Occlumency practice, Harry," came a voice from behind him, causing him to jump.

"You are leaking thoughts half-way across the Common Room," the witch continued. "And don't worry about the book: I copied it a week ago. It's a fascinating reading. Professor Snape really is brilliant."

"How did you... Wait, Snape?"

"You didn't know? I could've sworn I'd told you about his mother after I did a background check of all our Professors back in 1993."

How was she not a Slytherin, Harry wondered, not for the first time. Still, using the book was suddenly a lot less appealing.

"You are leaking again. And to answer your question, did you know that Dumbledore was literally planning to take over the world when he was our age? But, he was going to do it for the greater good, not for selfish reasons, so he was a Gryffindor, as am I.

"And do read the book. There is some useful magic there, but be careful about getting caught casting it. You are a powerful symbol and an inspiration to our side. We need to preserve that."

In contrast, when Hermione does questionable things, they are almost always planned and premeditated, with malice aforethought. (The most impulsive thing she's done all canon was probably send birds after Ron.)

*** Just finished that fic. Is it finished? It feels like it's sequel-baiting.

Also, I have no idea what I just read in those last chapters.

**** I think it is finished just a very downbeat ending with Magical Britain destroying itself.

At any the author died unfortunately so there won't be a continuation.

** One more dark note --- she is fine with using gang rape as a punishment for Umbridge --- read how the Greeks portray centaurs. Hermione is a fascinating character with lots of hints of undertones that quickly get read out of a teenagers' book.

** Let's just say that given a choice between Harry and Hermione being out to get you, pick Harry. Harry would try to hex you to your face with a fairly predictable spell. Hermione, you won't see coming, because she has a huge arsenal of magic and can plan ahead.

I think that her ruthlessness is an important part of what makes Hermione an interesting character, and I wish that canon had developed her into a full-fledged antihero of the group. However, that would have probably clashed with its ethos.

Instead, we have, in this fandom of ours,

- Myriad Gray!Harry fics---in which Hermione is reduced to compliant arm candy and perennial damsel in distress or an obnoxious moraliser who harangues Harry when he is being a Hard Man Making Hard Decisions (While Hard).
- Another myriad Dramione fics, in which she is a flighty ingenue. (Interestingly, Snamione fics are more likely to portray her as mature and powerful.)
- A myriad well-wishers who would like Hermione to experience "consequences" and "character development" to become nicer, more considerate of people's feelings, and more restrained in her actions---yet, oddly enough, don't seem to be interested in similar evolution for Harry or Ron.

It's gotten to the point that people---like the OP---are surprised when they actually realise that in canon, Hermione is probably more ruthless and dangerous than Harry, Ron, or, for that matter, Draco.
