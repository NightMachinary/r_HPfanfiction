Petunia and Vernon love magic and are psyched to know that it's real. They genuinely love the Potters and mourn them as is natural. Harry, on the other hand, believes it to be a fiction and can't stand it. He doesn't despise his Aunt or Uncle, but he is known to get into heated fights with them about living in fantasy lands.

When he finds out he's a wizard, he believes he's gone insane.


** Harry stared at the pigtail. "That can't be real," he said.

Dudley was laughing, poking at it. "I can wiggle it!" he said, delighted.

Uncle Vernon was less pleased. "/Mr/ Hagrid, I appreciate the demonstration, but Dudley needs to be able to fit into his school uniform. Please tell me you can undo this... feature."

"Daaaaad... it's /wicked/. I want to keep it!"

"Meant to turn him into a pig," Hagrid muttered, but not so quietly that Harry didn't hear it. "I can't, but pop over to St Mungo's, they'll fix it, right as rain. Er... don't say how he got it, I'll get in trouble."

"Before you go to school, Duddikins," said Aunt Petunia, with a long-suffering smile. "So, there you are, Harry, magic /is/ real, and you are going to be a wizard."

"A right thumping good 'un an' all," Hagrid said proudly. "Parents like yours."

"My parents were ordinary people," Harry said, clinging to the past he'd worked out. "They weren't.... magic isn't real!"

Hagrid rounded on Petunia and Vernon, who crowded together. With the misunderstanding around the door on their holiday chalet being knocked down - a seaside treat for Harry's eleventh birthday - Petunia and Vernon were somewhat nervous.

"Yeh didn't tell him?"

"We /did/. Over and over. Then the letters came."

"Pranks," said Harry.

"He thinks we put one inside his breakfast egg," said Vernon with despair. "He was looking for strings. Then we don't actually have an owl."

"I can't even find the right place to get one," said Petunia. She gave Harry a look. "We tried," she said again.

Hagrid was mollified, and turned to look at Harry. "Well, then, yer in fer a treat," he said. "Yeh'll love Diagon Alley, Harry."

"Just like Lily did," Petunia said, with remembered sadness.

"Can I go? I want to go! Why can't I be a wizard?" Dudley asked, his tail forgotten.

Vernon and Petunia looked at each other.

"We'll go off in the mornin', nice and early," said Hagrid. "Might as well get ter sleep now, eh," a change of subject that Harry's aunt and uncle firmly welcomed.

Setting Hagrid up to sleep was rather diffiicult, but they managed to set him up in the sitting room by the small fire, and bundle the two boys off to their respective beds. Harry's room was barely more than a cupboard, but that was the trouble with chalets, and, well, Dudley was a big eater like his dad, he needed the double.

Harry was finally alone, the door closed, the room dark, and he could think. Magic was real. Everything his idiot aunt and uncle said was real. Everything he believed was false. His world was absolutely shattered.

Well, he might have to go to Hogwarts, but he was sure he was going to hate every single minute.

*** While this is great, I can't help but get a visceral reaction of pure /nope/ when I read it.

Nice!Dursley I can handle. But this ain't my Harry.

**** First of all, thanks for the comment, feedback is cool!

Secondly, well, no, I feel that he wouldn't be. He had a very different upbringing. I mean, they aren't, actually, nice Dursleys, they're still Dursleys, just they like magic and they like Harry.

You'll recall they liked Dudley a whole lot too.

Honestly, it's so cool you picked up on that, even if I'm sorry for the reaction. Although mostly right now he's upset and angry, and he always did have a sarcastic streak. I doubt he's actually a bully, and probably his pure qualities would shine through, but no, he's not book!Harry, especially not right at this point.

I would redeem him in later chapters! If, you know, I did not have a gazillion other unpublished fics.

** Vernon sighed to Himself, he figured the teenage rebellion with harry when he was an actual teenager not when he was almost eleven years old, harry had always been the arguementative sort, Vernon had wanted to punish the boy more for his Attitude but his dear petunia had stoped him saying it reminded her of lilly. Vernon had always been a lover of fantasy though in his youth he had often hide such stuff as a person good at sports should not be reading about wizards and other intresting stuff he even attempted to learn magic himself, though he knew it was not real and merely illusions and trickey he had great fun with it. then he had met petunia and when he opened up to her about his love of magic, the response he got was quite shocking and he honestly thought she was quite barking mad, demanding to know if he went to hogwarts and where his wand was, and why he was working in the muggle world, they argued of course and then broke up a few weeks later vernon decided he could put up with a bit of madness as the rest ot petunia was quite loveable. petunia then invited him to meet her witch sister and to vernons shock magic was actually real and it was amazing, though vernon could not help but snicker when he learnt wizards actually did fly on brooms> He had later met James potter and instantly felt like he had gained a friend as it turns out James potter was just as fasicanted by non magical stuff as vernon was by wizard stuff. Vernon took great pleasure introducing him to starwars and James had responded by letting vernon fly on a broom.'

and now here Vernon sat listening to James son insult him and call him crazy for beliving in magic, petunia said it should only be a few more weeks till the hogwarts letter arrives, and then hopefully they can owl the school back demanding to send proof to finally get harry to accept it

- a few weeks later-

Vernon rubbed his hands together in glee, hogwarts had finally sent a professor to prove magic was real and she was now demonstrating magic to harry and finally harry would accept the truth about who he was and accept his parents as the heroes they where. ''its just a trick, uncle vernon does magic tricks all the time, this one is a new one though''

It was in this moment vernon was happy he had a boxing bag in his shed as he quite needed to hit something and scream in frustration
