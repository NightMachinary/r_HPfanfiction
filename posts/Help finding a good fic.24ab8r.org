For the most part canon compliant, certain background information about Remus made up (because there are non in canon), no Charlie/Tonk fanon background

** Check out Consequences by Pandora Jones. It redefined my Remus/Tonks head canon and also sold me on the idea of a Charlie/Tonks relationship during their Hogwarts years. It's a bit racy in places, but the sex adds to the story rather than distracting from it.

#+begin_quote
  Remus Lupin has long believed that love is a luxury beyond his means. Nymphadora Tonks has been too busy proving herself as an Auror to pay any attention to romance. Their strong if unexpected friendship is a source of comfort in difficult times---until it threatens to turn into something more. (Eventual RLNT. Sirius Black, Order members. Set during OotP.)
