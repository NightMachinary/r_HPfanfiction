I've always thought this could be interesting especially if done correctly. Bonus points if the fic has some weird relationship interaction going on (Harry/Hermione pairing meet an alternate reality Ron/Hermione pairing etc.)


** /The Red Knight/, linkffn(12141684): Canon Ron reborn in a different world, and met Violet, the Girl Who Lived.

/Para Bellum/, linkffn(9754483): Harry/Bellatrix from the /Delenda Est/ world found the canon dimension 20 years to their past. Hilarity ensued. Bellatrix was actively shipping the other Harry with the other Ginny.

/Deepest Reflections/, linkffn(3959072): Harry from the /The Darkness Within/ world found the canon dimension 3 years to his past. Lots of angst.

/Children's Crusade/, linkffn(6989327): Hermione from an alternate dimension requested help from canon dimension to defeat Voldemort in her world.

** Stunning Shifts (Which I believe might be abandoned?) has a little of this. Harry and Harry interact a little via notes but never officially meet, although others in the dimension-hopping team do meet alternate Harry. I think the author was building up to that but stopped writing before the actual meeting. linkffn(7534131)

Even as an incomplete story, I enjoyed what was there.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** There was this one fic where a fem!Harry switched over to a different universe and met more or less canon!Harry (and by met i mean they had sex and then she left). It worked through some kind of mirror similar to the Mirror of Erised.

male!Harry becomes obsessed with fem!Harry and delves into the Dark Arts trying to find a way to go to her universe. He does some pretty horrible things, including more or less raping Tracey Davis (with Love Potion in order to get something from her) and Tonks (although iirc that's more of a fetish thing for Tonks).

I can't for the life of me remember what it was called though...

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

** /Be Careful/ , linkffn(4537729). Draco-centred. It helps to know the very, very extensive Dangerverse, but one can do without, for once.

  Starts after Ch. 1 of DH, crossover with Dangerverse AU, short chapters. Draco Malfoy, trapped in a life he never chose, wishes as he falls asleep that he were somewhere he could start over. Maybe he should have listened to his proverbs. Now complete.
