** Reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One]], though that involves Sirius taking Harry prior to Hogwarts. It's one of the less-insufferable "Sirius takes Harry" FFs, without unnecessary bashing of anyone (except Krum, if that matters to you). Harry does eventually return to Hogwarts and canon characters, it's not just him and Sirius running around the world together forever.

The changed characters are fascinating. It's sort of a combination of "no harry" and "sirius takes harry" in its effects on the canon characters.

***** It's disappointing when people comment pedantic shit when a writing prompt contains a common error without contributing anything to the actual discussion. This isn't a story making an error because the author was lazy, and most people aren't gonna look in depth about every word of a writing prompt for errors before posting it.

*** Well, it's not in any particular book, is it? The prompt says "after his name is cleared" and Sirius doesn't put it that way in PoA. So why shouldn't it happen, say, by owl when Harry is with the Dursleys? Then they could leave England together.
