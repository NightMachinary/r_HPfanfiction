** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived). Amazing fic, but a slow starter. Until it gets to Hogwarts (several chapters in), there's not much to keep the reader's interest. It's just going through the motions, and the characters feel one-dimensional. I think Santi wanted to avert the 'abused and neglected brother' trope, but that meant we end up with ... idyllic family life, which really isn't so interesting.

(Also, it's never explained how Nathan survives without Lily's sacrifice. Every WBWL story irks me for that reason.)

Honourable mentions to:

- linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB). A great, complete fic. But the first chapter is a choppy fight scene absolutely dripping with grammar and spelling mistakes. Fortunately it quickly finds its feet.

- linkffn(Travel Secrets: First). Honestly, this one is bad. But the start deserves a call-out for being extra abysmal. I've never seen a time travel fic set things up with such a trainwreck. The later chapters are at least fun, in a Peggy Sue way.

*** I was curious so I just read the first chapter of Travel Secrets.

Its fantastic.

Is it good? All indications point towards no - but I'm super hooked already. Its like a first year English major has just discovered drugs and is deep into a 3 day bender. I hope its like this after the first chapter.

To be fair - I've been reading fanfiction for 10 years and have read 10's of millions of words, so to protect itself my brain has an ability to not read grammar, spelling, and sentence structure and only concentrate on the story. And this story is compelling so far.

Good recommendation - it definitely fits the brief.

The author is trying so hard to be pretentious by undoing the abbreviation, except that they undid it all wrong! I love it. I love it so much

Also we somehow manage to get all the tropes of a post-OotP Indy!Harry, including Helpful!Goblins, Manipulative!Dumbledore, and Malicious!Ministry in the first chapter, except that Harry is a grown fucking adult.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** linkffn(13041698) What's her name in Hufflepuff - the beginnig is kinda meh, as of now serves literally 0 puprose in the story, and gives you the impression that the MC is a whiny wuss that's gonna be a chore to read about due to lack of general self-worth and generous amounts of wallowing in self-pity.\\
And then it hits you with good humour, neat characterizations and general feel that's close to the original 1st book.

** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]

Starts with Hermione and Harry inexplicably banging and declaring their true love for each other. Then Hermione becomes a vampire, there's a five year time skip, and it becomes a really fun action adventure romance story with good world-building, cool villains, cool OCs, the works. I actually started and dropped it a while ago because the beginning was so strange but I'm glad I eventually picked it up again.

** I really struggled with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) due to the writing quality at the start, although the author does agree with that, and it was written when he was fairly young.

But by about half way through, the world building really kicks in and I really enjoy it.

Edit, got the name wrong I'm a fucking idiot...
