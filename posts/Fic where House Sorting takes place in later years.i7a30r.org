Haven't come across this before but I'm looking for a fic where Sorting doesn't take place at the start of first year. Preferably from Harry's perspective but I'm open to other perspectives.


** I've never read a fic like this before, but it sure sounds interesting. I'll be keeping an eye on this to see what other people will recommend.

*** Maybe I'll resubmit it as a Prompt if no one else responds
