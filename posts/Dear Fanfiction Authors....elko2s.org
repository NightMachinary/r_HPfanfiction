Please stop using American phrases and words in Harry Potter fanfiction.

Or, at least stop using them when the story is set in Britain. If its set in America with the MACUSA, then go ahead. Thats fine. But when the story is focused on Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore, McGonagall, etc etc, all BRITISH CHARACTERS, stop using American phrases.

I instantly close any story that has Harry trying to blend in with Muggles in London and telling a pedestrian to call "911" instead of the British emergency number "999". And before you Americans say "But I don't know that was the number!" then GOOGLE IT. /I/ didn't know that it was "999", since I live in Australia and our number is "000" but I searched on Google "British Emergency Number" and got a handy little box that told me the information, as well as the EU Emergency Number (112 for those wondering).

I also instantly close any story where the Harry Potter characters are in the Muggle World and they go to get food, only for the cashier to ask for the money in AMERICAN DOLLARS. Now this I can understand, as its what people are used to in the states and Australia. I am guilty of this, having done this in a fanfiction. But I caught it in my re-read of my chapter, and you guys should be able to as well. If you don't understand the British Monetary system, GOOGLE IT. We have this tool available to us that will literally convert American Dollars to British Pounds, and even explain how the British Pounds system works if you're willing to sit down and read for a few minutes.

Other uses of American phrases in place of British ones in a British setting peeve me off. Like using vacuum instead of hoover, lemon drops instead of sherbet lemon (its heartbreaking how fucking rare it is to find a fanfic that has Dumbledore enjoying SHERBET LEMON) and so on.


** Oh get over yourself.

** Pssh, don't you keep up with the news, the UK is splitting up, Scotland is going to rejoin the EU and we are letting England and Wales join as the 52nd and 53rd state.

Tbf, this one is also a brand name vs generic thing.

I agree with your points as a whole though (britpicking is a hobby of mine at this point). I was reading a fic once and the Weasleys suddenly started celebrating thanksgiving. The author didn't realise how wrong that was until a few chapters in? I stopped reading it instantly. I also hate American slang in HP fics.

Nothing can beat Americans not knowing how to use wotcher probably though.

** Its their story so they can write what they want.If u don't want to read a story that has American phrases,then go ahead.But the thing with the emergency numbers and dollars is correct and the author should have basic knowledge about Britain.

** Brit here. I mean, on a slightly less... rage-inducing level I totally agree with you. It is a little irritating when you see English people blatantly doing American (and often Christian-American) things with no acknowledgement of UK Culture, but it is really hard for people to pick up on the differences or even that there are differences at all. There's a kind of implicit assumption that Britain and America are basically the same except the latter has guns and dollars while the former has knives and pounds - that whole 'special relationship' bollocks. If you have that assumption, you're not going to bother googling because you think you know the answer already. They'll plow ahead until they come up against something telling them that they're wrong, upon which they'll either double-down in stubbornness or correct themselves. Not everyone has the time to learn an entirely new culture for their fandom (looking at you, Weaboos) so they're going to make it as easy for themselves to write as they can. Write what you know and all that.

The Sherbet Lemon thing is a Philosophers-Sorcerers stone issue. Apparently the American prints have the Lemon Drop while we have the Sherbet Lemon, so if they're literally reading it in the book they're going to make that same culturally-synonymous assumption.

And even at the big level, sometimes we're very unfamiliar to most - the difference between England, Britain, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom being most obvious to us, but other cultures often use them as synonyms without really being aware that there's specific differences in the same way that I'm sure most of us from the UK couldn't name all the states and associated US territories.

Using Dollars is rather lazy, I'll give you that, but at that point you've got to start blaming the US Public School system rather than the American themselves. If they're not taught that the world is more than just 'America, land of hope and freedom!' and 'Not-America, land of sadness and tyranny!', then that's what we'll end up with. Heh. Fix the school system so we get better fanfic might actually work. There certainly are enough Potterheads to get a decent voting influence. :)

** It's not always that easy. Most of the time I put in an Americanism it's because I didn't know there was a different term or phrase in British English. Over time an American author will have a growing knowledge base of British words and even develop an eye for picking out words that "sound" American. Having a britpicker go edit your chapters is ideal, but that's not always possible. I try to give writers some slack in this area just because I know how hard it is.

Then there's the stories that are particularly egregious and obviously not trying at all to sound British at all. Sometimes this is a design choice. It's actually a pretty big overhead trying to make dialogue (or even narration, sometimes) sound British, and I can understand the decision to not even try. Of course that comes down to preference, obviously some people will find this unreadable, and that's fair.

Sometimes authors are completely oblivious to the fact that there are differences between British and American English. I generally assume these are either teens or writing novices. The writing quality of these fics are usually bad enough that style is the least of their problems, and certainly not the first thing one should focus on when trying to improve.

I get your frustration, but I also see the other side of it.

** I did not know the number thing but I do always try to go off of JK Rowling terminology like POUNDS and stuff at least! :) So yes I hope I get some of it right just by noticing what words got used in the books. :) :)

  Adam glanced down at his old gray t-shirt and flannel pants. “You mean, I shouldn't go to class looking like this?”

Yes, you should get some trousers. And it is “grey”.
