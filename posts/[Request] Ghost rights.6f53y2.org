People treat ghosts like they're dead and just haven't realized it yet. I'd like to see a story where someone becomes a ghost, and then tries to continue their life. They'd still drop all their practical classes, but try to continue their academic ones, insist on people just saying that they're disabled instead of dead, and that sort of thing. Does anyone know of any like that?


** ~shrugs~

Don't know any yet, but you've given me a thought. Ghosts make the area around them colder, right? It's remarked upon that visiting the Deathsday Party in Chamber of Secrets is like stepping into a freezer.

Well, cold is a physical function, a change in temperature caused by the reduction of whatchamacallit heat energy in the local molecules. For such a physical reaction to happen, the ghosts would have to be physically present...

Well, of course they're physically present, I guess. You can see them and hear them and everything.

So yeah, given that ghosts are entirely capable of physical influences on the world...I bet they're totally capable of continuing to study.

*** Sir Nicholas was sufficiently physical that they could move him using animated fans after he was 'scorched' by the Basilisk. That such an ancient ghost could speak and be understood by kids in the 90's suggests that they retain enough memory of events during their afterlife to learn.

*** You don't need to be physically capable of influencing the world in order to study. It's a largely passive process. It helps to have someone to turn pages for you though.

There's also jobs they can do, like teach. Although Professor Binns already does that, so it's not like it's anything new.

*** I imagine that the more powerful a ghost is, the more it can affect the world. Almost all ghosts can meet the base threshold, which is dropping the temperature and gathering water vapor to make a think fog, which they shape to look like themselves. That is why ghosts can go invisible, because they can drop the fog, and whenever they go through walls, there are little puffs of smoke(in some of the movies I think).

Obviously the more emotional a ghost, the more powerful it is, similar to how magic works. Older ghosts, like the Fat Friar and what have you, are old, more content with their existence, and so we don't particularly see them affecting anything.

On the other hand, Moaning Myrtle is a very emotional ghost, prone to fits of anger and depression, and we know for a fact that she can move physical objects and flood the bathrooms whenever she feels like it.

***** It is headcanon really, so take it or leave it as you will. The books don't particularly have any Muggles around ghosts to see them anyways, so it could potentially be written like that and not be too out of place.

****** [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ghosts][Pottermore]] says muggles can't see ghosts. Although I thought it was mentioned in the books, so I guess I was wrong too. Unless the wiki just didn't bother to cite that.

I feel like I'd prefer a fic where ghosthood is more debilitating. Partially because the way ghosts act is just too ridiculous if it's only a minor problem that could easily be solved with prosthetics, and partially because a ghost trying to continue their life is much more interesting if they have to rely on other people helping them.

******* It might have been mentioned in books in passing, but I think it more likely that you got them confused with Dementors, which we know Muggles cannot see and we were told that in the books.

Personally, I would prefer to see ghosts being more ghostly. Rattling chains, being able to appear to whoever they want, opening and closing doors just to mess with people. Scary ghosts and what not. But that is a personal preference.
