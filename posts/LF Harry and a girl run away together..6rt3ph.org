Looking for any fics where Harry and a girl run away from the wizarding world and start a life together.


** For some reason, I rather enjoy this genre though I don't find many that I actually think are good stories. So, in no particular story, here's some fics that play around with Harry and some girl running away together from the British Wizarding World (variable permanency of departures present):

linkffn(The Unbreakable Vow by Ash Darklighter)

linkffn(Perilous Journey by sbmcneil)

linkffn(Without a Trace by sbmcneil)

linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy)

linkffn(Finding a Place to Call Home by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas)

And that's all I can think of at this moment.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria
