I mean something like: Harry is the researcher, Ron the leader/talker and Hermione is the main fighter/has the greatest power


** I do not have such fics but I disagree with your characterizations of the characters. In canon the dynamic is Hermione Researcher and Spell, Ron Emotional Strength and extra competent wand, Harry, Leader Rww power. I would personally believe having Hermione as leader would work with her sometimes bossy attitude, she also is the best at negotiations since Ron is the short tempered one with Harry, I think giving Ron the role of Powerhouse would be great giving him something to stand out of his siblings with. Harry on the other hand is extremely oc but, if you thibk about it it is very possible. Had a yound harry abused by the dursleys turned to books for a solution rather than inner courage Harry couldve been a Researcher, Powerhouse and secondary fighter.

​

This way Ron takes his gyriffindor traits and enchances them with is strength, Harry is very good with magic but his strengths lie in his intelligence, Hermione becoming the Leader/Manager of the group making sure everything is proceeding fine.

​

Hermione may be getting the short end of the stick here but that is because in canon she is overbuffed. She literally is the Smart one, person who knows most spells beforehand and can cast them, not to mention her flaws are quickly resolved. She is also always seen as more sympathetic unlike another character even when she was in the wrong. Hint *Half Blood Prince setting birds with sharp talons in an attack because she was jealous* and then people depise Lavender and sympathise with hermione.
