** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) literally just reread this today lol. That scene is minor and occurs in the last chapter (not counting the very last one, which is an alternate ending).

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Is it that precise wording? I googled for that exact phrase, but nothing showed up except this thread.

Do you remember any more details? The site the fic was on, like Fanfiction.net, Archive of Our Own, a forum like Sufficient Velocity, etc...?

Was the gods asking the goddess of fate the intro to the story, or an interlude? Were said gods recurring characters or just a one-off appearance?
