  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid.

Maybe in the first story, Harry has to overcome the reigning champ, Draco.

Then, in the second story, Draco helps him train for the next bout, because they learned to respect each other after their grueling fight. At some point, they can race on a beach, and then end up splashing each other in a totally not-homoerotic way.

In the third story, the Russian boxer, uh, I mean the Dark Lord fights Draco, and mocks him by saying, "If he dies, he dies". Draco dies, but his platonic life partner is motivated to train in a cabin by running in the snow and dragging hippogriff corpses around. Naturally, when Harry faces Voldemort, his training pays off and he wins after a tough fight. Then he gives a speech where he says something like, "If I can change, and you can change, maybe we can all change!" Then the remaining Russians, er, Death Eaters give him a standing ovation, and the Cold War is ended for good.

True, but you can speed someone up quite a lot. There is an immense difference between being taught everything by an expert, and needing to travel the world to piece everything together yourself.

The situations are also different. Voldemort was operating entirely on his own motivation. Harry has a fire under his ass in the form of Voldemort killing him and everyone he cares about. Voldemort had multiple goals - solidify his immortality, learn about magic in general, gather followers and take over Britain, probably more. Harry could have a single goal: get better at magic now. Voldemort had arguably a far less advantageous starting position compared to Harry.

Teach Harry everything he can in that year, plus mind arts speed boost, before losing the elder wand in a duel at the end of the year and leaving him the resurrection stone in his will, which turns out to be an awesome resource for unlimited tutoring.

A prepared Harry works with a prepared order of the Phoenix (obviously rational Dumbledore formed a council of Moody, Arthur, Remus, Minerva, Snape and Kinsley (+Harry=7) and gave them access to all his information and resources.

They recruit, go on the offensive, the war escalates, the ministry falls after Dumbledore dies, but the order defends Hogwarts and eventually drives the death eaters out of the ministry, but not before Scandinavia and the Baltics fall to their own dark uprising and Voldemort moves his power base to Durmstrang.

International war breaks out, Grindelwald who everyone sort of forgot about because we already have the death stick in pay, starts shit of in macusa. creature, muggleborn, light and dark factions arise and a network of alliances is formed.

Giving us more than enough opportunities for Harry to catch up.

Also I doubt Voldemort spent all his time on gaining power: he had to do politics, research, learning by himself, become immortal, and torture people for fun.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
