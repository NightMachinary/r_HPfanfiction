No Slytherin girlfriend, no Hermione is spying for Dumbledore, and no lordship's/super friendly goblins.


** [SELF_AD] Yeah, that would be nice. I have wrote just opposite in linkao3(20141410) (Hermione breaks up with Ron after The Battle), but that is exactly what I was after ... just normal break up between two normal humans. No crazy conspiracy, dramatic story of betrayal, other being a horrible subhuman being, just admitting that we are just not into each other that much and we can still stay friends or at least be polite to one another.

#+begin_quote
  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.

*** I like that self-ad tagging you did.

Eh, I'm not particularly fond of the character as she treats everyone else.

  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.
