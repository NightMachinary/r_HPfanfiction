Anything where Sirius is found innocent from the beginning and raises Harry, so no dursley abuse. Any pairing, preferably complete but I'll take everything.


** There are lots of such fics, but the real trick is finding one that doesn't try to rehash the same canon plot!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is such a rare fic meeting this criteria. The plot is also fairly unique as it features a three sided war between Dumbledore, Lucius Malfoy, and Voldemort.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** There was one trilogy wherein Sirius and Remus took Harry around the world in books 1 and two. I forgot the name of the series but i had an acronym of OWL or something. I cant remember the name sadly. Harry learned alternative magicks and became powerful during the journey. It was an HHr iirc.

** "Papa, where's dad?"

"Dad is cooking, Harry." said Sirius.

Sirius then ran to the closet as soon as he saw Harry's face of but-I'm-bored-and-hungry-and-I-wanna-play and dug out a small yet similar to the Nimbus 1989 broomstick model. Harry's face lit up as the small toy broomstick was in Sirius's hands.

"Remus, I'm gonna bring Harry out to practice kid quidditch!"

Then, a familiar voice came from the kitchen. "Be careful! And */DON'T/* let Harry fly out of the backyard!"

"Ok, sheesh, I won't."
