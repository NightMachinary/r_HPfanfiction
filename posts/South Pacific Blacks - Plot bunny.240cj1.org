Was wondering if any authors were looking for a plot to flesh out into a story. If nothing else I can get this out of my head. :)

Sirius parent - Harry general story

Sirius takes Harry away instead of giving him to Hagrid. Sirius assumes death eaters will be hunting for Harry for revenge so decides the safest plan is to leave Britain with him. They end up in Australia Byron Bay. Sirius falls in with the surfing crowd and essentially becomes a beach bum initially living off Harry's inheritance. Harry grows up in a very relaxed friendly atmosphere with some interaction with magic families in Australia.

Around 10 years later Sirius is contacted by Gringotts with news that he is determined the last direct Black hier. This comes has Sirius finds he loves sailing. So he buys a live-board seagoing sailboat. They travel SE Asia visiting various magic communities. In Thailand they are found by Death Eaters through Gringotts gold transfers and sailboat title. With help of a female Polynesian friend (Arihi) and sneaky wandless pranks from Harry they manage to fight them off. Sirius is spooked and decides it is time to really get away and heads to the South Pacific with Arihi. Getting caught in a violent storm the sailboat hits a reef and flounders. A petrified Harry lets out a very strong magic pulse that acts as a beacon to a local magical community on an isolated island.

This island community is very isolated by choice. They ward their island from detection by non magicals, but historically help any ships nearby that are stranded or in need of help. They save lives, but obliterate memory of their small paradise from all before arranging for them to be found / saved by outsiders. The presence of Arihi with Sirius and Harry, along with them being magicals, grants them time to explain what / why / how. They are granted asylum due to strong astrology signs that point to a significant change in the flow of magic. These signs indicate that Harry is the one that keeps magic in this world.

Harry is taught Polynesian magic that centers around weather, stars, sun, moon and water. Chants and a highly personal approach to magic are center of their magic. Instead of wands each caster creates their own focus as a ring or hand net jewelry. Frequently made from logs found in the ocean surf. Harry ends up making a ring for each hand and become exceptionally proficient with moon and water magics.

In turn Sirius teach Harry and the local community magic as taught in England and Europe. The best local focus creators make basic wands based upon study of Sirius' wand. Almost all of the magic Sirius was taught is considered dark and disturbing by the local community. However, ends up being very useful when Sirius and a group of students are attacked by pirates when they go on a sacred journey. During the attack Harry ends up in the ocean and is given a vision. He sees their old sailboat, mermen and one of the local girls that he is developing an interest in. He is told this is very prophetic and he must follow this vision with the girl.

They end up find the boat and the mermen. But the mermen consider them intruders into a sanctuary that is the sunken boat. They are taken into custody, tried, found guilty and condemned to being staked to a coral reef to be eaten by the local fish. To allow them a defense they are magically taught to communicate with the mermen. Harry explains his vision and that he is following this. In telling of the story he casually makes reference to a work crew that are destroying a reef. This incites the mermen and they demand to know where this is. Harry leads them to the site and helps the mermen sabotage the work through his knowledge of muggle machines and how they work. He leads a group that was going to destroy the machines and drive away the people working there. He ends up instead enchanting the workers to leave the area, destroy their records of the site and decide the area is too dangerous to safely work. The mermen are impressed by his approach and peaceful actions instead of the destruction that was originally planned. Harry puts himself directly into harms way to save several of the mermen from being hurt when a machine is accidentally activated. As a reward he is given his freedom and the rights to the sailboat.

Sirius, Harry and Arihi make plans to repair the boat and bring it back to the island. Working with the mermen they manage to salvage the boat and get it floating again. One of the mermen asks to spend time on the island in human form to learn the culture and magic of the people. Harry and his now girlfriend work to make that happen. Get it approved and then act as his guide. While visiting the volcano Harry sees his first Voldemort related visions. He feels the glee and happiness as Voldy regains his body in a graveyard. He sees Ron being tortured and then killed.

The community sees this as another of his visions that he must follow. They explain the astrology that first allowed Sirius and Harry to stay with them. That this is the darkness that he was meant to fight and hold at bay. At this time he also starts to feel the magical summons of the Goblet of Fire, as Dumbledore has entered his name as a way to bring Harry back to England. The merman with them offers a way to sail their boat to the mermen that live in the lake in Scotland.

Hope this all sparks somebody's imagination. If so please let me know so I can follow your work!
