Gimme all your favourite ‘Harry Fucks Off' fics :)

Harry runs away, Harry goes to a new school, Harry is kicked out of Hogwarts, etc

Crossovers would be great, slash preferred but gen and het are fine too so long as it's not Harry/Ginny, Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape

Also if anyone knows of any gamer!fics - as in character wakes up to find reality has become like a video game - in any fandom I will love you forever if you share them with me :D

Thanks!


** Linkffn(2318355) is one of my favourites!

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

The only Harry!Gamer fic I still remember ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/][the michelsuave one]]) got posted already, but here's a few Worm ones.

- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-dovahkiin-without-dragon-souls-to-spend-worm-skyrim-gamer-complete.513694/][A Dovahkiin without Dragon Souls to Spend]]*, in which Taylor Hebert works off Skyrim mechanics in the grimdark world of Worm. 140k words, complete, has two sequels.
- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-maid-of-brockton-bay-worm-maid-gamer-taylor.766552/][The Maid of Brockton Bay]]*, in which Taylor Hebert wakes up to a floating popup, becoming... a Guardian Maid! 24k words, last updated at the end of July.
- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/reader][The Paragamer]]*, a quest featuring an OC with Gamer powers getting caught up in the aftermath of a Leviathan attack. 250k words, apparently still updated regularly.

The Maid of Brockton Bay is hilarious, and A Dovahkiin Without Dragon Souls To Spend is also pretty enjoyable.

**** Just as a heads up here, "The Paragamer" is dead and is your typical "grind to nowhere" fic where no actual story happens. And "A Dovahkiin" is teeth-grindingly bad writing. If you're okay with grammar and spelling mistakes and diction that sounds like an over-enthusiastic 13 year old, then "Dovahkiin" is fine. But if you're looking for anything like good writing, give it a pass.

"Maid" is good so far and I recommend it, but it's a WIP and if it's anything like 99% of /Worm/ fics it'll die before completion.

It has a continuation, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][Changes in a Time of War]]. Word of warning, they're LONG, and they might get a bit over the top sometimes with the blood magic and the vampires and demons. It has everything: blood magic, multiple animagus forms, dragon blood, time travel, you name it. I personally started reading them quite some time ago, but I haven't finished the second part yet. I only plan to do so out of commitment. But who knows, it might be what you're looking for.

  What normal person would ever want to stay in a world that treated them like scum. Harry unfortunately has it in both the Muggle and the Wizarding world. 5th year Harry decides to step out, or is the decision made for him. M just because

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).

  An edgy hardcore Skyrim Player completes what he believes to be an amazing feat in game, only to wake up the following morning realizing that he had become far more intimate with his character than he ever dreamed of being. Now, if only someone could explain why he was in Japan, and why floating words from the game appeared at the most inopportune moments. DarkFic. Semi-Gamer Fic.

***** I'm not hating the game, I really like Skyrim.

That doesn't mean it's not aimed at a very casual audience.

And yeah, I'm aware. There's just not a lot to be "hardcore" at with Skyrim. Maybe if you mod it, I guess.

I see how that came across as angry, though. My bad. I'm more confused.
