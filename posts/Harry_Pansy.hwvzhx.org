I've read linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3871411]]) a while back and I still can't find a fic on this calibre.

I'd like it even better if it was post-war but anything goes, but I don't like to read it as a secondary pairing (it's usually added next to dramione for the hell of it)

If you know any decent ones please let me know!

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

#+begin_quote
  set five years after the end of the war following a line where harry and ginny don't get married and instead harry and pansy build a relationship. told in alternating perspectives from pansy and hermione.

  Hermione can't... she can't work out their relationship. They seem comfortable with each other, their elbows are touching and Harry's hand is on Pansy's knee, and there's something when they look at each other. No, she doesn't get it at all. When Harry stands to get the next round Pansy touches his arm and asks him to "get her a Gillywater, darling" and Harry nods, his hand brushing across the top of her head, the term of supposed endearment going unnoticed, as though it's used regularly. Hermione wonders what he calls her in return.

*** The few that I have read usually have Pansy only going along with Draco in order to protect her family. Then some change in circumstances occurs where her family needs to change alliances but they don't want to align with Dumbledore who they think isn't truly looking out for Harry. So they decide to align with Harry. That's how White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais progresses.

The other way is that Pansy really doesn't like Draco but has to pretend or her deatheater father will force the issue and marry her off. She bonds with Harry when he stops her being bullied. That is the premise of We're in This Together by zugrian.

So her canon antics are explained by playing the role either Draco or her parents expect. When she gets an opportunity to safely go her own way she jumps on it.
