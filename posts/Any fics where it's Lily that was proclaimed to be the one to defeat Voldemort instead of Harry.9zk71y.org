I see it sparingly mentioned in fics where someone says it's ridiculous that people think a one year old could defeat Voldemort. Then it's never mentioned again. Any fics where the majority of people think of Harry as the son of the person who defeated Voldemort rather than as the BWL?


** Storm of Yesterday is a Hermione time travel fic (James lives) and Lily is lauded as the hero of the day. If you end up liking it, also look for Debt of Time by the same author. Their stuff is all great.

*** This was my first thought too! In this story it's very much a case of 'let Harry grow up like a normal kid, Lily can be the famous one' which makes so much sense. Also, this is an absolutely lovely fic in general, the finale was the so satisfying!

*** Nice one! I think I glanced at this once but ignored it because I thought it was set during the marauder years. Thanks so much. I'll give it a looksie.

** I've never seen it though this does present an excellent divergence. Harry's part in Voldemort's downfall comes out immediately. If this never happens and the official report is that James and Lily Potter defeated him but died in the attempt Harry would have a very different life. Even with Harry still being the Boy-Who-Lived but no one knowing that but Dumbledore Harry and Voldemort.

Most people wouldn't be aware of Harry's existence. His lack of fame means lack of isolation through childhood. Though he's still likely to live with his Aunt he'll probably have visits from Uncle Albie. We'd end up with a different sort of Harry. It's easy to prevent Voldemort's early resurrection if Harry has his usual luck but lacks the aversion to authority. We could get a realistic protagonist that could triumph by means other than goodness and righteousness.

  He'll be famous --- a legend --- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future --- there will be books written about Harry --- every child in our world will know his name!”

  “Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?”

****** Dumbledore knew because of the prophecy, others know because he survived the killing curse and his parents didn't, how they figured that out I'm not sure, perhaps they just took his parents wands and noticed they hadn't been used for fighting, but it leads to the simple conclusion that it's something special about Harry.

******* James's wand /was/ used for fighting. He was also clearly killed first, protecting his wife and child.

On the other hand, they would have to know that, with Lily and James both dead, there would be nothing that would have stopped him from killing Harry. Connecting the dots - two people effortlessly killed, one baby left alive with the scar from a murder spell on his head, presumably plenty of witnesses to Voldemort storming the house, minor Death Eaters trying to come clean offering information about where Voldemort said he was going, etc.

#+begin_quote
  James and Lily Potter, heroes martyred before Harry can remember, are matters of national pride. Harry, their son, is a mere footnote to the heroes' story, a half-blood orphan raised by muggles and generally forgotten. No fame, no expectations, only a sharp tongue and a tendency to get himself into danger unlike anything your average teenager would ever face. Now, together with his close friend Neville Longbottom, he faces his third year at Hogwarts, unaware that it will be full of fugitives, creatures, secrets, and revelations.
