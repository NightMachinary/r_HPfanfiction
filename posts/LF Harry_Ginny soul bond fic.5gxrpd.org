I'm looking for this fic I read a while ago. I'm positive that it was a Harry/Ginny soul bond. I remember that Ginny is an empath and studies under this woman in America- New York maybe? Does anyone know this fic?

** Goddamn, I know I've read this. Pretty sure it's a three fic series. [[/spoiler][I am fairly certain Harry, Ginny and Irius end up living in the US]].

Edit: Hmm, I might be thinking of one where /Harry/ is an empath. Shit.
