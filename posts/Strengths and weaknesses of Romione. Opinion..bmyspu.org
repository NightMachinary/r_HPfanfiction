I like both Hermione and Ron, I like that they have flaws and are imperfect characters. But I can't stand them together. I can accept this pairing as one of canon's, but I can't see it as long term relationship, and epilogue seems a bit unbelievable for me.

I would prefer they have ended up with people out of canon, their relationship was developing "off screen" and, judging by what we can see after 19 years it wasn't developed as much. And it was really big time gap comparing what we saw in last chapter and epilogue.

I think IRL they would tear apart during Hermione's 7th year if not earlier. I feel like their union was provided by extreme conditions and wouldn't last long in civil time. I like fan art of their, but don't read stories with this pairing.

So, I need you opinion. Do you ship Romione? Why do you personally like or dislike them together? Who would be better variant? It shouldn't depend on other pairings, though, not like 'I don't like them together because I ship yournameofpairing'.


** I read the first few books when I was 10-11 and I distinctly remember getting the impression that Ron and Harry were friends and Hermione and Harry were friends but Ron and Hermione's friendship was by proxy. By about book 4 or 5 I had thought they had grown on each other but I always thought of their relationship was that of squabbling siblings who love each other despite not really liking each other because all of their shared experiences forging them into pseudo-family. They have very little in common except for their friendship with Harry but eventually came to trust and tolerate one another.

I think the constantly arguing dynamic can work for a couple so long as there's a strong underlying affection and respect, and perhaps even enjoy arguing. Ron and Hermione seem to row so frequently that half the time they can't stand one another. They spent most of 3rd year avoiding one another and seemed to de facto do the same for parts of 4th, 6th and 7th years (Ron ditching them for months wasn't really a result of a dispute with Hermione, but still). The respect they build for one another is slow and situational, a good deal of the time they do not want to be in each other's presence.

During 4th year its implied that Hermione was spending most of her time with Harry while the boys were feuding -ergo she was not spending much time with Ron. This did not seem to bother either of them during or after the feud. You can argue Harry was more isolated and needed the companionship more but generally I think there's a pattern of Hermione preferring Harry's company to Ron's.

In third year she's visibly more distressed when Harry /seems/ to side with Ron on the Scabbers issue but was comparatively composed when Ron sided with Harry in the Firebolt dispute. In 5th year she's over the moon when she see's Harry holding a prefect's badge and dumbstruck when Ron reveals he's the prefect. She can hardly seem to believe it or even congratulate Ron on a fairly major accomplishment. Prefects also spend a good deal of time together patrolling- Hermione was much more enthusiastic at the prospect of being prefects with Harry than being prefects with Ron.

I cannot stress enough how strongly I feel that had they not had Harry as a bridge, Ron and Hermione would never have been friends. Ron is laid back to the point of being lazy and lackadaisical, Hermione is assiduous to the point of being neurotic and obsessive. Ron enjoys a day at the Quidditch pitch and a party in the common room while Hermione would prefer a quiet afternoon in the library. Hermione only humors the boys about Quidditch, which she doesn't much care for, and Ron doesn't even pretend to hide his disdain for her political tirades. I legitimately do not know what they would do together 80% of the time if they didn't have a plot pushing 3rd wheel keeping them busy.

Even by Book 4-5 when it's obvious Ron is sexually attracted to Hermione he doesn't seem to get emotionally or personally closer to her. At 5th year Christmas he buys her perfume that she has to diplomatically ( and poorly) pretend not to dislike while Harry gets her an Arithmancy book that she's ecstatic about.

I love these characters as individuals and think the way they play off each other adds a lot to the books and makes their eventual friendship even more striking. I also do believe that Ron and Hermione by the end of Book 7 do have a strong emotional connection which makes me respect the pairing more than I ever will canon Hinny ( which is a rant for a whole other day.) But I still can hardly stand to see a competent writer put them together and I do not care for Romione on its best day.

*** Well said. I disagree, but you managed to defend your point in a way that doesn't bash either Ron or Hermione.

*** I like your explanation but I disagree with some of the points :

- 4th year : Hermione spent more time with Harry, but I think it is a normal thing considering the situation. Harry is socialy isolated by the school, and has less than a month to prepare for a task that is designed to be dangerous for students 3 years older than him. From Hermione point of view, Harry need her help (or he may die), while Ron is just being an idiot "Deep down, he knows you didn't enter your name, but he is just jealous". The simple fact that she tried to spend some time with both of them shows she is at least affectionate with Ron considering how much Harry need her more.

- 3rd year : I may be biaised (and don't perfectly remember the 3rd book), but I think she /was/ more distressed by Harry than by Ron because of the situation. She knows that Ron is crazy about Quidditch, and flying in general, she knows there was no way he would ever have sided with her on a issue like "I thought the broom was dangerous so I made a professor confiscate it". Add at this that she was already fighting with Ron at that time (on the scabber issue), it's not surprising that Ron side with Harry. On the other side, Harry was "objective" about Scabbers, and his opinion was the deciding one in their group. If he had "seemed" to side with her, Ron would probably also have been hurt.

Considering their friendship, I do not know what to think. You thinks that she seems to be friend with Harry, who is also friend with Ron and so they are friend by proxy. But the thing is that Harry also didn't like Hermione at first. It is the troll that brought them together. I think that the main difference in how Hermione interract with Harry and Ron (attraction aside), is how both of them deal with her bossiness :

- Harry is the silent type. He never open about his feeling (he would say he is "fine" even with half the bones in his body broken), and rarely bother to disagree publicaly with Hermione (the only time he really "fight" with her is about the Firebolt in 3rd year and the Half Blood Prince book in 6th).
- On the other side, Ron is mostly open about how he feels. So when he disagree with Hermione, he will tell her, which will often result in a row. But once again they don't seem to mind much about it. The only "big" fight they have are either when something really big happen (Hermione's cat try several time to attack Scabbers, Scabbers disapear and there is blood on Ron's sheet. And her only reaction is to say it's not her cat and Scabbers must have fled somewhere? I know she was later proved right, but at that moment she was stubbornly refusing to admit that her cat hated Ron's rat, and showed a big lack of diplomacy. I think anyone would have fought with her on a issue like this, and Ron only refusing to talk to her is pretty tame as a punishment for this), or Ron's jaleousy when he starts to like her (the Yule Ball and 6th year).

On the other side, I don't think Harry either showed any attraction to Hermione. Even in 6th year when they began to show obvious sign, he seemed more worried about being left behind as the 3rd wheel that about Hermione herself.

​

PS: As for Hermione thinking Harry was prefect, let's be honest, he should have been. Harry's and Ron's student folder are pretty close to one another. They have pretty much the same grade except Harry is better at Defense. When one breaks a rule, the other is with him most of the case. The only big difference is that Harry is part of the Quidditch team while Ron is not before 5th year. In their situation, a teacher should have either chosen the best record and taken Harry, or decided that they broke too much rule to be prefect and disqualified both. Only Dumbledore's opinion that Harry "had already too much on his plate" made Ron prefect.

** I was surprised to first see Romione appear in canon, but I was a lot younger at the time, I suppose.

I've seen people make the case for this pairing working. It's hard for me to judge, because it's a relationship dynamic that I personally would never enjoy, but I'm not everyone.

** One of the biggest strengths of Romione is that they simply enjoy being in the other's company, even without Harry. In PoA, they're described as "looking as though they'd had the time of their lives" in Hogsmeade (Chapter 8), and in every book after CoS, Ron and Hermione have already met up before Harry arrives.

Also, while many anti-Romione people will point to their arguing, that's actually part of why I think they're a good pairing. Hermione /likes/ to argue - we see her do it with just about everyone in the series. Harry is not a fan of it, and generally reacts by ignoring it, lying to her to get her off his back, or exploding at her. Ron, on the other hand, is happy to engage with her:

#+begin_quote
  “Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,” said Ron sagely. “Anyway, I've always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape, where's the evidence he ever really stopped working for You- Know-Who?”

  “I think Dumbledore's probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn't share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.

  “Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can't you give it a rest?” he said. “You're always having a go at each other, it's driving me mad.” (OotP, Chapter 12)
#+end_quote

Note in particular that they both looked "angry and offended" at Harry's admonishment - as far as they were concerned, this was normal conversation and Harry is the one who was out of line.

**** It's admittedly an understandable oversight, given that the books are from Harry's POV - I didn't really notice it until I saw it pointed out in some [[https://owlpostagain.tumblr.com/post/129597015066/why-ronhermione-argue][meta]].
