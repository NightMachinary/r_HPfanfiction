Anyone got any fics where harry dates and/or marries one of both of the Patil sisters? Marriage contract soul bond anything goes so long as it's just harry and one or both sisters no harems or anything and they're all in love.


** Most (if not all) of these are shorts that often contain explicit scenes (gee Why would a writer put Harry with twins and have an explicit scene? /sarc)

These are collections of shorts/drabbles that have one or two Harry/Padma/Parvati "chapters/scenes".

The rest that I am aware of are all harem stories (I think the smallest grouping is 5 girls). Sorry I couldn't help more.

  Britain's new Veela overlords can make it difficult to get through the day; Harry needs a good reminder and a way to shake all that allure out of his head. Good thing he's linked to Padma and Parvati Patil. In more ways than one.

  Harry gets to play with the Patil twins at the Yule Ball.   I got lost with this before so I removed it - I think I've worked things out now, so here it is again.

  As suggested by Erbkaiser   Harry overhears a very important discussion after his disasterous Yule Ball date.

  Harry has finally had enough of Ron's thick-headed ways and takes Padma for a dance at the Yule Ball while his own date, Parvati, watches on. Harry's Gryffindor chivalry leads him clueless through the halls of Hogwarts to the Ravenclaw common room, where a rather pleasant ending to a great night awaits him. Rated 'M' for a reason. Harry/Padma/Parvati

** Year 4 of Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" has Harry and Draco dating a twin each, but they eventually break up in year 5.

Not a pairing I've seen otherwise outside of the ones where he's dating /everyone/.

** It's not exactly on point but it has both Patil sisters and Hermione nursing harry back to health after he is struck by a curse that the British government/medical establishment have given up on. It's called Alternative Medicine by canoncansodoff (be warned there are quite a few explicit scenes).

** The problem with your request (as you well know) is that the majority of fics that have Harry with both Padma and Parvati are full blown Harem fics. I'll have to do a search to see what I can find that's not a harem.
