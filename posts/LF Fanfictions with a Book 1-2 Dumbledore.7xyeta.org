Rather than a Machiavellian Dumbledore like the later books picture him, I am looking for a grandfatherly - greater good but good - Dumbledore.

Are there any stories (excluding Barefoot), you could recommend?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

***** You are welcome. :) Yes I'm tired of reading stories where Dumbledore is evil or stupid for the sake of it.
