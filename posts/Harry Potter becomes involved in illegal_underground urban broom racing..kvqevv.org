Whether it be because he's infiltrated it as part of an ongoing DMLE investigation, or he's grown bored with life and is seeking some excitement, or whatever other potential reason I leave up to you guys.


** Harry stared down at the sack of six thousand galleons that rested in his palm. His pulse slowed steadily as he came down from the high of the safest, most fun thing he'd done in ten years.

"That's it for the Ministry." He thought. Twice his monthly salary for five minutes of absolute joy? Yeah, he'd be quitting soon. If he was honest with himself, some nights he lay awake to wonder why he ever thought being an Auror was a good idea. He knew Hermione hated it. It was likely part of the distance between them of late.

A few years of racing, some wise investments, and he could afford to be a stay-at-home dad. He suppressed the grin that thought always put on his face, and headed home to have a talk with his wife.

**** The fourth one was the last in the vein of guys in cars doing stuff with questionable ethics. Well, five and six kind of did it too, but it was on a larger scale. Seven though, what the heck.

The Burrow is in Devon and they have an apple orchard. It's a little hobby farm(since they have chickens and stuff). 1000% they make cider.

************* I meant to say Dom, it was a gag in Furious 7 that Mr. Nobody kept trying to get Dom to drink this Belgian Ale. Basically the rule is it has to be a mainstream beer while a side character tries to get them to drink something nicer. You're right about the cider thing, it just doesn't fit the narrative with the Fast and the Furious references.
