I have thought about something like "the Courtesan", but without the prostitution stuff (i would accept it, anyway). whether she is with Harry or if its an AU without the Canon couples doesnt matter, but i would like to have AU.

If there are some Fics for Fleur, i would take it as well


** Well, it's not an AU, but she's pretty active in this one (and come to think of it, she's pretty sexually active in canon, since that's how she had three kids):

*** thanks for the Rec. I wouldnt call it Sexual active, when she did 3 Children in 19 Years. Wells, its actually less than that, but im to lazy to count the time span from past Hogwarts to her Marriage and then the Birthdates of her Children. And it doesnt really tell, how "active" she is, after all we dont see their private life.

****** Yeah. My beta reader knows how our capitalisation tends to slip under the radar.

** linkffn(4543379). She was active enough that this was deleted from consideration in a story competition on SIYE for violating site rules.

*** I mean it's pretty much the opposite of Harry/Ginny, isn't it? Regardless, the message this fic gives the readers is pretty reprehensable. Ginny's sex life tortures Harry. It demonizes it, and I found that pretty disgusting.
