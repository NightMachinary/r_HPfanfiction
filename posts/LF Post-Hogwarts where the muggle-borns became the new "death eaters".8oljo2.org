The muggle-borns radicalize in a terrorist movement because of discrimination to a point where they became a full blow terrorist movement. Bonus points if Dark Lady Hermione and Harry duel.

example:

Hemione start as one of the most pacifists Leaders of the movement but she ends up betraying then to Harry because they target the Hogwarts express.


** It's not exactly what you're asking for, but [[/u/Starfox5]] 's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][HG and the Marriage Law Revolution]] is sorta like this. I mean, they blow past terrorism and perform the titular political revolution. Someone already rec'd "Sum of Their Parts" so this is the only other thing vaguely like this that came to mind.

But attacking the Hogwarts Express? ...why??? Those are just kids

*** I find Marriage Law Revolution over the top and Starfox stories aren´t realy my cup of tea.

I read the fic a year ago but if remembered correctly was to attack directly the families that worked for the Ministry.

You should try "The Uprising" makes a good show on both the good and bad on both sides and the people in the middle.

**** (I'm not too sure about that story either, I've only read a bit)

I don't think I'm interested on Uprising. Based in the comments, a useless Harry and overblown threats (and Hermione fleeing to Australia at the end?) make it seem like the kind of story I would be more annoyed in reading. :(

***** And Draco is surprisingly pragmatic pushing for muggle-born reforms to end the revolt and gain political power and Harry is the only guy that could do "roman/normal magic" on the celts "anti-roman magic field".

But i cant see why you wouldn´t like it and the story could benefit from a epilogue.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Gosh, this reminds me of a very old abandon fic where Harry leaves for awhile and comes back to Hermione being a Dark Lady with muggleborns as her champions.

It was a Harry /Hermione pairing but it wasn't very romantic and Hermione was seriously on the path of going insane. At one point they have a duel...

It wasn't on fanfiction.net though.

** Yeah I got nothing on the muggleborn uprising front.

As for a Harry/Hermione duel, I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][The Song of The Trees]] had such a scene and it was pretty satisfying. That story still stands in my mind as it featured a legimately scary, even chilling, depiction of Hermione.

** That's the first time I've seen a spoiler work for me on mobile, could you drop the formatting for it?

Also, I'm about 90% sure I've read something like this involving the Hallows in some way, I'll go try and find it.
