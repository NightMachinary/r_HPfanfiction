I'm rewatching the movies and I can't believe how much they left out! From the first one alone, they don't mention Harry's other fits of accidental magic, getting to the roof of the school, shrinking his clothes, regrowing his hair, they don't show Harry meeting Draco at madam malkin's and they completely forgo the magic of the castle, the doors that are walls, walls that are doors, some that have to be tickled to be opened and some that only open at certain times of the day, to name a few. What do you guys think? Should they have done more to accurately portray the books?


** I get that time was a constraint. I really do, so I don't mind them leaving stuff out.

I do mind that the director bastardized whatever he included. The director butchered Ron. He changed duel scenes. You know how much I wanted to see the duel between Flitwick, Minerva, and Snape? Instead we got some stupid flames being hex-deflected.

** Honestly, I don't really care about the missed scenes (at least in the first years). Writing a book is different from making a movie, and it's unavoidable that some things will be left out in the translation.

What's pissing me off about the movies are more things like The 6th one. I can understand how a realisator has to make some choice about which scenes to include, but in this movie, they basically ignored the main plot lines to focus on . . . Ron and Hermione love story. There are at least 3 plot lines that were more important for the plot but /teeeeeenage/ movie.

I also made peace with it, but it's annoying how Emma Watson was obviously the favourite actress of the realisators, and how they gave her a lot of good scenes at the expense of other characters (mainly Ron).

*** IIRC the screenwriter outright told JKR he considered Hermione the main character of the series.

** I was kinda bummed that we didn't get to see the storyline of Percy's betrayal and him coming back

** Snape was miscast. Rickman was a good actor no doubt, but too old and attractive for the role. Going by the books, an Uruk-Hai from LOTR would have been as good a fit to depict Snape.

In the books Snape is an ugly, bitter loser who joined the magical Nazis and then defected when he didn't get Lily's ass. In the movies Snape might be dick in parts, but Rickman managed to give the character a certain mystique when a childish temper tantrum would have been more appropriate (revealing Lupin, his stance towards James, baiting Harry with the pensive, his desperate attempt at whitewashing himself via memories).

*** 100000% this. Rickman was far too likeable and charismatic for a true to book Snape.
