** Short Answer:

#+begin_quote
  As long as fanfic remains a non-commercial activity, it should remain legal.

**** Non-commercial basically means that you aren't making money off it or trying to pass it off as your own content. You'll probably see more "This world belongs to JKR" sort of disclaimers at the top of fics.

******** That's great for ideas or even more complex concepts. Hell, that's the base purpose of [[/r/explainlikeimfive]] and [[/r/NoStupidQuestions]] but for things like the definition of non-commercial, that's why humans invented the dictionary and why we later decided to make the dictionary accessible through google.

It also eliminates the possibility that the person you asked was using the word incorrectly. Not a problem in this case but certainly something to take into consideration.

** Very possibly. Youtube will definitely be gutted, as will Google, Facebook, Twitter, and virtually every video and social media platform that there is, as well as every single search engine that's not Google.

Copyright is a finicky thing, as is the idea of fair use, but from my understanding basically everything that's not 100% original is at risk if it operates in the EU. Meaning that geo restrictions will likely be put in place until the legislation becomes clearer, the legislation is repealed, or more nations leave the EU.

P.S.

Compete side note, I'm hoping for the third option just based on this stupidity, no matter the result of the final vote. From my understanding, the EU is ridiculously set up, run, and maintained, with little to no accountability to the public. I am just a hoser from the great white north, but that's my understanding at least.
