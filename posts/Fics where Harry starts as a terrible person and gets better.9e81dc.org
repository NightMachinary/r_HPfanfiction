[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter][On the TvTropes page for "Fandom-Specific Plots" in HP fanfiction,]] one of them says the following:

#+begin_quote
  Harry ends up as fat and nasty as Dudley and has to suffer major personality changes to be kind enough at the end to face Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I don't think I've actually read any fics like this. Are there any fics that play with this idea or something similar, starting off with a Harry who is "dark," "bad," or non-heroic in some capacity, and eventually transitions into being a good person/hero that embodies his better/canonical traits?


** linkffn(2913149)

Writing quality of this starts off a bit rough, but by the end of the story it's perfectly good and well. Not to mention the sequels and fluff parts afterwards.

Keep in mind Riddle is altered a bit from his canon counterpart, as the series wasn't finished by the release of this fic. Still a wizard Nazi, obviously, just /slightly/ more humane due to actually raising Harry.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

** I second Kurinoone's series (as well as the above poster's evaluation of it.) I think most everyone has read it, but I'd also suggest /Brutal Harry/ linkffn(7093738) if you haven't.\\
It's not exactly what you're asking for, but it features a Harry who was tremendously affected by his treatment at the Dursleys' and has walled himself off (or attempted to wall himself off) from all emotion. There's also a sequel.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** In linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) Harry doesn't really care about others and is angry at Dumbledore for his actions, but in the end realises what sacrifice means. iirc

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
