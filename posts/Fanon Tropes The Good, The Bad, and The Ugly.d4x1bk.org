What are some of your favorite, least favorite, and absolutely bizzaro fanon tropes you have stumbled across? Stuff like the names of Hermione's parents, or that /Crucio/ is red (it's actually clear, lol). Try and avoid bashing them if possible, but there are some +idiotic+ / +really stupid+ / */distinctly odd/* tropes out there, so I won't judge you.

I didn't see any active threads with this concept, and nothing for roughly a year that even seemed to touch on this topic, but feel free to redirect me if I'm mistaken and I'm repeating something.


** Good: fleshed out other houses and schools (even though it can really be all or nothing sometimes) and a good and /consistent/ magic system.

Bad: black/white morality. Also "we're the good guys so we don't fight, we just serve as target practice for our ennemies to kill and torture).

Ugly/Bizarre: these fic where they change a few letters in a name and they do it consistently, like Hagwarts instead of Hogwarts.

** *The Good*\\
- Non-canon pairings. I like a well-written non-canon pairing, though I tend to avoid Harmony, most Drarry, and Snape/anyone.\\
- Different genres! The Harry Potter universe is possibly only surpassed by the Star Wars universe for how well different genres can fit into it. Romance (of course), mystery/whodunnit, crime thriller, supernatural, coming of age, war, horror, dystopian, legend, historical fiction, legend, etc. I would love to see a Western HP story that contains the elements of a Western but is set in modern-day UK.\\
- Wizard politics. While most commonly done over-the-top and unrealistically, wizard politics can be fascinating and I enjoy quite a few fics that contain lots of wizarding political drama. Though I will say most fics with politically savvy children are a bit much, though there are some notable exceptions.\\
- Non-Harry POV. I like reading stories from most other perspectives.\\
- Crossovers. I've read a handful of good crossovers (and dozens of bad ones), and my favorites are Mass Effect and Star Wars, and I'm still looking for a really good HP/Pokemon crossover.\\
- Unique ideas, including fun oneshots.\\
- Quidditch. I love Quidditch in stories. I wish there were more Quidditch-oriented stories, especially ones featuring Oliver Wood and/or the Gryffindor Chasers.\\
- Competent professors. I like it when the professors actually do their jobs and inflict punishments and rewards in ways that make sense.\\
- PTSD Harry. Not angst-Harry, because PTSD and angst are /not/ the same thing. But I enjoy reading about a Harry that comes out of the war with scars that are a struggle for him to heal, and require help from his friends. It's why I find Auror Harry to be rather uninteresting.

*The Bad*\\
- A lack of editing. There are so many fics that would be greatly improved with basic spellchecking and grammar checking, and with a quick read-through or a beta reader. - Naming Hermione's parents "Dan" and "Emma"\\
- Moldyshorts/Umbitch/Dumbles/other shit nickname\\
- "pup" "cub" or anything of the like. I recently had to break a habit of flipping off whatever device I was reading the fic on every time I encountered pseudo-pack language.\\
- Extensive pop culture references.\\
- Seer Luna. Please, no. She's /odd/, not /genre savvy/. And her oddness is just plain fun. Please don't ruin it by making her quirks have a purpose. Same with Dumbledore. Let him be eccentric for the sake of being eccentric, dammit!\\
- Glaring Americanisms.

*The Ugly*\\
- Agenda fics, in which the author has a clear agenda (political, racial, character-bashing, etc) that they hammer home with all the subtlety of Hagrid appearing on peoples' eleventh birthdays. Sadly, a lot of shipping fics can fall under this because many contain copious amounts of bashing.\\
- Smut that contains nonsensical harems, A/B/O dynamics, extensive noncon, etc. I have not yet found a good harem story despite having no problems with the idea.\\
- WBWL. This is only placed in the "ugly" category because, like harem fics, I have not found a good WBWL fic. I have read some decent stories in which Harry has siblings and/or the Potters are still alive, but it seems the entirety of WBWL fics are mediocre at best, and that's if you're being generous.\\
- Fanon Hermione in general. I love canon Hermione so much but fanon Hermione is typically unbearable. And it's sad, because I've never had nearly as much difficulty writing a canon-compliant Hermione as I have Luna or Sirius. I am not sure why so many people struggle with her character.\\
- Magical cores. While not a bad idea in theory, it's most frequently implemented to explain why Harry and/or Hermione have Merlin-levels of power.

**** Most of all, everyone having read Lotr at 11. It's not exactly the most read book amongst pre-teen (moreso in the 80s/90s). Narnia or Enid Blyton books, those could be expected, maybe the Hobbit; having muggleborns to think the sun will petrify trolls, or re-naming Fluffy as Timmy, or even asking about pizza-eating magical turtles, is much more plausible than quot(h)ing The Raven and the ring inscription (in Black speech). We're talking about eleven years old who then live 3/4th of the time in a culture where those works are probably unknown, not about angsty and/or nerdy teenagers going with english litterature for their A level....

** ITT: Pet peeves

Anyway, I think fanon gets a bit of a bad rap. Sure, it's mostly shit, but it's still better than /Cursed Child/ right?

*The Good*

I really like fanon Slytherin. Yes, Daphne Greengrass, Theo Nott, Blaise Zabini and Gemma Farley are basically fanon inventions... but I'm /glad/ that they exist. Because otherwise you're stuck with morons and brats: Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Bulstrode and Pansy.

*The Bad*

Light magic / light wizards. I think it feels weird and video gamey, and clashes badly with the morality and magic systems in HP. Also, writers don't have a good grasp on what 'light magic' may constitute, apart from the Patronus Charm.

'Magical Cores' is a more common pet peeve around here. I think that's another example of 'video-game fanon' that clashes with and mundanises canon.

*The Ugly*

Marriage contracts and soul bonds. I'll admit to pre-judging here, since I've read very few of these fics. (If anyone has good fics that do these, I would be interested in recs.) But it seems like lazy and fluffy plotting to me. Also, while soul bonds could /plausibly/ be compatible with canon, life debts and marriage contracts ... do not.

So? Perhaps the house where all the bigots end up in is truly a shithole. Canonically, almost all Death Eaters we know of came from there and not one of them ever called Malfoy out on his behaviour, which means that no one was bothered by his calls for racial purges or behaviour towards Hagrid and Buckbeak.

I'd much rather read a developed Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff than a fic trying to come up with ways to have "good" Slytherins.

**** We know Crabbe and Goyle are dumb Slytherins. We know Bulstrode and Parkinson are ugly Slytherins. And we know Malfoy and Parkinson are bratty Slytherins. But we can still guess that most of Slytherin *isn't* dumb, ugly and bratty, because that's seriously unrealistic. 25% of children are not evil.

So I think it's neat that fanon has collectively decided that Daphne is good-looking, Theo is smart, Blaise is charismatic, Tracey is a half-blood. Those contrasts are needed, otherwise Slytherin becomes a lot more boring, and stories set in Slytherin become much harder to write.

***** Again, they had no issues with Malfoys behaviour. No one wanted to fight against the evil mass murderer who was carrying out a systematic campaign of racial purges. Not one ever asked to fight for Harry and/or Dumbledore. The two Slytherins on their side were Andromeda Tonks, kicked out of her family for her life choices, and Slughorn, who couldn't go back to Voldemort after spilling the beans about the Horcruxes. Not one student from Harry's age group. That tells me everything I need to know about Slytherin.

************ I was being facetious. What I meant is: it's a perfectly reasonable supposition that any Slytherins who stayed to fight would have kept quiet about it. Three canonically did exactly that (plus at least one underaged Gryffindor), and while I'm not gonna pretend that they weren't Death Eaters (well, I don't think Crabbe and Goyle technically /were/, but they were very much in Voldemort's camp and it's not a meaningful distinction), it makes perfect sense that more Slytherins would have done the same, with roughly even odds of fighting for either side.

Edit: which, to be clear, is /not/ evidence that there were Slytherins fighting for Hogwarts in the final battle. Given how Rowling wrote the canon members, and has written about the house as a whole during and after publication, I'm close to four-million percent certain that she didn't intend for there to be. I'm just saying that if you want to headcanon that the Slytherins we don't get to know are decent people, there's nothing stopping you. I mean, you specifically don't seem to want that, which is equally fine, of course, but, y'know, people in general.

** I feel like most tropes are ... neutral. They can be done in a good or bad way.

That being said, let's see... I would say that some that lend themselves to /generally/ being in bad fics include: Soul bonds, marriage contracts, light lords, hyper manipulative/dumb dumbledore, Lord Potter, and the super friendly goblins b/c harry asked them something nicely. All of these /can/ be done in a good way, I feel - but I've found that most of the fics I've seen with them tend to make me run away fast. Oh, and add hyper manipulative 10 years olds talking in stilted 'political' terms ;)

I like the fanon tropes with Daphne/the other slytherins, because they're fun to have in there (and them all being evil would be no fun). I actually kinda like the concept of 'magical cores', or something to that effect to show what we kind of intuitively get from the books - that there's some amount of magical power innate to different people, it's not just an on/off switch. That's a bit of a cop out though, because it'd technically fall in the above category - but I like more explained/explored magic systems, though I don't like those that put firm numbers on it or treat it as an excuse to just make Harry insanely powerful.

A more fleshed out world in general is also a lot of fun to explore - though I wouldn't call most of the fanon tropes there /amazing/ in my book :)

** Like:

- additional world building, the world is a big part of the appeal the books hold for me
- Lily having done something that actually defeated Voldemort on Halloween
- Snape or Malfoy getting an redemption arc (assuming it's done at least somewhat well)
- good do-over fics
- getting good evolves a lot of effort
- creature fics that are well written and don't involve mating or soulbonds (I'm assuming this exists)

Dislike:

- Snape is super-attractive
- Harry is the first person ever to remember a goblin's name
- Ron is only friends with Harry because he wants to use Harry's fame/money
- either everyone is gay or everyone is straight and everyone is paired up at the end
- teenagers swearing undying love as an important plot point
- Dumbledore is obsessed with Lemon Drops (Shebert Lemons are mentioned /twice/ in the entire series, once in the first chapter and once as a password for his office)
- Luna is obsessed with pudding (she expresses her hope for pudding, i.e. dessert, being served at a feast /once/)
- training for a summer results in teenagers being at magic than almost everyone else
- blatant americanisms

Hate:

- Voldemort is actually the good guy/right about blood purity
- heavily imbalanced relationships, especially student/teacher
- Harry is abused to the point of near-death by the Dursley
- do-over fics where the mentally 30+ main character grooms their eleven year old love interest
- being forced together by a soulbond or marriage law as the basis for a happy-ever-after relationship
- eleven year olds spinning political intrigues
- complete character transplants where at most a cartoonishly exaggerated trait remains of the canon character

**** I would love to see this done well. Like how the hell do you navigate this insane mish-mash of feelings?

Presuming the MC isn't a pedophile, there's not going to be any romantic oomph to those feelings, since your hindbrain is gonna clearly tell you that this child is, well, a /child/. But the love, the affection, the emotional intimacy are all going to be there and be so /so/ powerful.

And how do you navigate the fact that this other person will quite literally never catch up with you? Even if you could avoid nasty-ass grooming behavior, when that person is 13-ish, they're gonna wanna start making out with other 13 year olds, and the time traveler is, presumably, going to be a sought-after target.

So lets say you tamp down on that and can deal with the trauma of watching the partner you've exclusively loved for decades fumbling around with other people. Then you get a bit older, and now here you are at 16 or 17 or whatever and you finally think you can begin something like an adult relationship with your beloved, only to be struck with the horrible realization that over the past seven years, your love has only grown into a teenager (still basically a child) while you've grown from a, let's say, 35 year old into a 42 year old.

More than that, you're an adult who's gone through a strange, traumatic, surreal experience, thereby growing even more as an adult. You've matured into comfortable middle-age while the target of your love is still a (blegh) high school /kid/.

What do you do? Wait another five years? Now you've moved further into middle age and finally, finally, your beloved is an adult, although very much a /young/ adult. But at this point, if you've tried to do the ethical thing and stay hands-off, your love has almost certainly moved to someone else. Maybe even married, given the Rowling-verses ludicrously young marriage ages.

In the end, I think this story done well ends up becoming this heartbreaking Love in the Time of Cholera type plot, except without the "happy" ending of the main characters ever getting together.

***** Ugh I know. I'm writing a Draco time travel fic and was struggling with all of that. I generally prefer gen stories because I think there are more interesting themes out there to be explored than romance, but...

my cursed child Draco, who has lost the love of his life to a blood curse, is suddenly back at Hogwarts with his wife, 13, alive. I can't just not address it. But at that age, kuds aren't even interested. I'm a teacher and my students have their first “relationships” with 12/13 and that's one day relationships that usually don't even get to holding hands before they are over. At first I had Draco not worry much about it because he assumes they'll eventually get together just like they originally did.

But one year into the story they are best friends and the Yule ball's just around the corner and suddenly the whole thing is a problem again because he only has three options: be the only one not having a date, asking someone else who he doesn't have feelings for on a date, asking his super young wife out on a date. Option 1 and 2 also risk that his wife goes to the ball with someone else. He struggles with this a lot. But then he discusses it with a friend and his friend says

“are you sure though about the whole age thing? I mean you are 14 in everything but knowledge and experience. [...] I don't think a real grown up would have such an easy time being friends with so many kids. We should bore you to tears with our petty little problems, really, but we don't. I never feel like I'm talking to an adult when I'm talking to you. Grown ups also don't eat like they're a human trash can. They aren't as moody and prone to temper tantrums. They don't get into prank wars with other students [...] and they certainly don't use their time throwing paper planes at other students during lessons.”

And the conclusion that Draco (and I) came to was that it's not just the mind that decides your age. It's the body and hormones as well. Hormones are what make teenagers moody, hyperactive, eat a lot, grow,... so I don't think it's too much of a stretch to assume that if you are in the body of a kid and are effected by a kid's hormones which make you think thay Quidditch is more exciting than girls, then that makes you a kid. I mean, if taking hormones can turn a man into a woman, I assume they can also turn a man into a child...

For me that solved that problem. But I had to think a lot about what defines age and so on. Draco then asks her out on a date and they kiss and then their relationship isn't the focus of the story anymore. I assume it will be relevant again soon when she figures out he's a time traveler and has to come to terms about it in her own way.

Especially that training isn't an instantaneous thing- took me months just to be able to run any decent distance, and for Harry to go from one lap to fifty in the course of a week is absurd.

**** I don't mind imbalanced pairings in smutty oneshots, where they serve to scratch someone's itch.

But in more plot-focused things it's icky to have a relationship between people who clearly don't have the same amount of power.

There's a reason why student/teacher and employee/boss relationships between consenting adults are forbidden or at least strongly discouraged. Having a teenager involved just makes it so so much worse.

** To a certain extent I'd say that all fanon is bad, in that it shows laziness on the part of the author and tribalism on the part of the fandom. There's a certain amount of /wink wink nudge nudge/ about these tropes, like the author and the readers are loudly repeating private jokes to show off the fact that they have a common history together.

However, the more "general" a trope is, the more forgivable I find it. The best tropes aren't so much specific story elements as much as they are themes.

*The "Good"*

- Harry gains access to the wizarding elite/aristocracy and learns their ways. Frequently done very badly (see below) but can be executed well (see: Out of the Night).

- Harry becoming more proactive.

- Harry's latent magical talent (e.g. Patronus, ability to resist Imperius, overcoming Voldemort in priori incantatem) being properly developed.

- Development of the mind arts. Again, is frequently done very badly.

- Exploration of new locations within Hogwarts.

*The Bad*

- Lord Potter-Black.

- Helpful goblins.

- Magical cores/expendable magic.

- Magic being explained with physics/being likened to energy.

- Magical theory being mathematical in nature.

- Muggle weapons/military tactics used to solve magical conflict.

- Mindscapes.

- Fragile Harry i.e. a Harry who is in some sense emotionally damaged by the Dursleys/his experiences.

- /Everything else/ (Snape as Draco's godfather, Dan and Emma Granger, trust vault, etc.)

** Honestly, this sub applies the word "trope" so broadly that it's more or less completely lost its original meaning, so for the purposes of this thread, I'm gonna take it to mean "recurring elements in fanfics, no matter how minor or broad." Dunno if that's what you meant, but I made my best guess.

The Good:

I genuinely can't think of a single thing that always piques my interest in an HP fic; I'm truly drawing a blank here. I guess meaningful content, but even by the crazy broad definition I'm using here, I'm not sure if that counts. I seriously can't remember the last time I found a fic and enjoyed it on more than a surface level.

God, that's depressing.

The Bad:

I'll admit, this is tricky for me, since most story elements/premises that are the obvious picks for this section are things that, at least in theory, I quite like, but which are "developed" and presented with the subtlety, grace, and compositional skills of a wild turkey. Which, if you've never seen a wild turkey is . . . [looks at notes] none. That said, I've got a fair few things that I really wish would just die:

- Teacher/students pairings that are meant to be seen as romantic rather than creepy and abusive
- "Supremacist/anyone whom said supremacist believes to be subhuman due to their birth" pairings full stop
- The Death Eaters are really the good guys: no they aren't, they are racists. Stop trying to rationalise racism.
- Evil Dumbledore with no point (a story in which an authority figure is the main antagonist has a lot of potential if it actually bothers to do anything with that dynamic)
- "Movie characterisations are what the lord intended!"
- Dan and Emma Granger. Rupert bothers me slightly less, but only slightly.
- Bellatrix was brainwashed into becoming a death eater; forgive her, readers: she knows not what she does
- "Dark lord" being a "dark wizard who amasses a following" rather than a title Voldemort gave himself because he's obsessed with making himself seem impressive
- "Master of death" being taken literally, especially if owning all three Hallows somehow makes a person invincible or outright immortal
- "Realistic" takes on the HPverse, since they're usually just the author copiously handwaving away any perceived breaks from reality. For instance, saying that Harry's reaction to the Dursleys' abuse was unrealistic and making up a magical explanation for said reaction rather than changing it to something more extreme.
- Speaking of: cartoonishly abusive Dursleys
- Evil Weasleys
- "Malfoy was right all along!" Nope, he really wasn't.
- Malfoy hates Hermione because of who she is as a person; it's nothing to do with her birth status
- 11 year olds are somehow competent politicians. Most actual politicians aren't competent politicians. That said, a fic where all the Slytherin kids /think/ that they're brilliant politicians in the making while all of their parents are fully aware that it's basically just a game they're playing could be a lot of fun.
- Characters with no self-awareness whom the author clearly isn't portraying the way they think they are. For instance, a Harry that's meant to be badass, but is really just an inept whiner who constantly fails upwards.
- The MC is the author's stand in who exists to tell all the characters who are wrong™ about how they're wrong™, whereupon they immediately change their ways to be right™

The Ugly:

I'm choosing to break this down into two sections: one for theoretically interesting ones that are overused and always bad, and just plain /weird/ shit.

- Indy!Harry
- James and/Lily survived to raise Harry
- Harems or polyships: I feel like I need to justify this, so check out [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JhSyKaXczGI][this video]] for context on why I'm interested in the former (specifically the more general parts of the video, not so much the ones about QQ in particular), and as for the latter, so long as it's an actual exploration of how a polyamorous relationship can work and not just "Harry gets two girlfriends because he deserves them and women are trophies," I'm down
- Harry has a sibling
- Uncommon Harry ships
- Fred and George have very similar but ultimately distinct personalities
- Harry can tell the twins apart

And now, the weird shit. Hoo boy.

- werewolves can smell everything, including abstract concepts (this also belongs in the "please die" category)
- A/B/O. Nuff said. (This does, too, incidentally)
