  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]] Long and convoluted and I think the author may have gotten in over their head but it's not bad. Classic WBWL fic though the sibling isn't a massive dick for the most part. Still updating, just about.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12918161/1/You-Get-What-You-Give]] The same but harry and his twin are both Girls. Much better than the previous fic imo. HP/TR fanfic though if you don't like that kinda stuff. Finished kinda

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11827316/1/]] Cult Potter- Another Fem!harry story. Don't remember much except that's she's abit creepy/sociopathic and that's she's in Slytherin. Abandoned sadly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14188524]] Lord of Darkness. Massive smut fic. Harry's basically a god. Didn't really like in the end but you did ask.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9841367/chapters/22088246]] Danae Macabre. Again, basically a God however this handles it far better I think. Just updated after almost a year or two. Female Harry. I was iffy about adding this cause it has timetravel which you didn't mention but why not.

I could give you a few more timetravel slytherin fics if you like. Along with 1 or 2 focusing on Harry's slytherin twin sister.

******* I would rather like Harry to not time travel, be male and grow out in orphange, if you have only time travel then I have to search myself which will be hard, I don't know why so little fics are out there with Harry being more like Tom riddle given that their similiatries are one of the most important things in canon, Rise of the dark lord is the closest to my dream fic, just without HarryxVoldemort pairing.

******** Fine. You have a very specific type but I can work with this.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14188524]]

Lord of Darkness. I already recommended it but i'm gonna go into more detail. First off it is a massive smut fic but it's the only one I know of that covers all the bases.

Harry is raised in an Orphanage.

No timetravel.

Is male.

Is Slytherin.

Is powerful. (He's basically a unkillable in this)

Is a dark lord.

Similar to Voldemort? I would say he's a better version of Voldemort. More competent and less insane. Closer to young Tom Riddle as in, he murders people. But he doesn't do it willy nilly.

But again, it has heavy smut elements so i'm prewarning you.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

Harry can manipulate shadows because of the Horcrux he is a vessel for. He does not like Dumbledore or the Order, nor does he like Voldemort and the Death Eaters, instead creating his own faction as the Shadow Lord. Harry x Theo.

*** Another story is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855330/1/Dark-Prince][Dark Prince]]. Harry is neglected and thought to be a squib because he, unlike his twin, is not prone to fits of accidental magic. One day, Harry is sent away to the Dursleys instead of 'distracting' his brother from his studies with the Potters, but Voldemort rescues him and makes him the heir to his legacy.

The first story, which is linked, is finished, but the next one is not. The author updates once a month, I believe, so if you're impatient you might not want to start the series (I started the first one when it was already complete but I loved it too much to set it down).
