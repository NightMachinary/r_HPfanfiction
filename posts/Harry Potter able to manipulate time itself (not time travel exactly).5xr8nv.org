Ok so... very interesting and unusual request here:

Is there any Fanfiction that has Harry Potter manipulating time itself. No, im not talking about time travel exactly. I am talking about Harry being able to speed up, pause, or rewind time itself. Now obviously it would likely have to be semi-limited or it would just be so insanely powerful that it would ruin any fun. And it doesnt have to be a super power, but maybe some bit of magic he has discovered (perhaps in the time room of the Department of Mysteries?).

I feel like this could create all sorts of fun, from preventing death, to altering spell paths, to having fun with the ladies, to training up in shorter time periods, to dealing with problematic professors, to preventing or working within battles, and so much more.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** There's this bit in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838/][/Realignment/]] but it's sadly just one showcase spell.

  “James, they've got at least fifty wizards out there.”

  “Fifty?” He rolled his shoulders. “We might need to use some tricks then.”

  “I didn't think you had any left.” Clara was peering into some mirror, from the glimpses Tom got it seemed to show the street and the wizards. “They're getting into position.”

  “Well get ready,” Tom was watching his wand twist with horrified fascination, there was more power gathered then he'd ever even dared to imagine. Whatever magic Bond was doing was titanic, immense energies balanced on the end of the narrow length of elder, he had the Elder Wand! Bond didn't stop for his revelation. “Cause this may feel a little weird.”

  Clara was enveloped in a bubble that's edges were turning slowly grey, then she blurred. Spells lanced from her wand at an impossible rate, blasting the wall away and then the Germans. They were completely unprepared for the onslaught, hundreds of beams pouring out as the world around them turned hostile. Clara raised monsters from the cobblestones, twisted the German's bodies, and set half the road alight with blazing green fire.

  Tom's fascination with Bond's magic, some sort of accelerated time, wasn't enough to distract him from the toll it was taking. His hand was shaking, tremors racing up his arm as Clara cut a swathe through their enemies. The anti-apparition jinx fell and so did Tom, dropping heavily to his knees. She slowed into visibility for an instant, then he bore down on the magic, keeping it going through sheer force of will, and she sped again. Tom's vision went grey around the edges, but he kept going until Clara looked back then burst from her bubble.

  She pulled him up roughly, angrily. “Spinnst du oder was?”

  Tom swayed against her. “Maybe? You know I don't speak English- German whatever.”

  “Typical.” She gripped him by the shoulder and they were gone from Paris.

  His headache was back though. Tom lay in the darkness, trying to think about what he'd just done and seen. On all his previous excursions he'd been desperate to try the magic Bond showed. The construct, the rock shield, apparating, the bubble was nothing like them. He looked to his bedside table where his holly wand rested, he couldn't imagine using it to rip a sphere of the world free from the river of time. Not yet.

  When Harry arrives home after forth year he finds a shrunken book in his pocket on time magics. It contains a useful spell to stop time. I don't own Harry Potter the Great JKR does. We all thank her for allowing us to play in Harry's world!

** I vaguely recall one where he called himself a chronomage. He was definitely able to time travel and I think he could age or de age someone's body. He de aged himself so that he was "really" young again, no just an old man in a young body, and I think he de aged Sirius to pre Azkaban healthiness. Can't remember the title off the top of my head though.
