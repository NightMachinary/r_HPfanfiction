I remember reading a fic that starts out with the above premise, basically post OotP, Sirius visits harry in his dreams and instructs him on how to become an animagus and then it kind of went from there. I wasn't sure if it was finished or not, I never had time to read much of it

*** Wow yeah that's it, I do remember that it had like a half finished sequel when I first looked at it. I had hoped it might have been updated, but alas, wherever you are mr fake a smile I hope life takes you to a place where you can finish the story.

**** The sequel was taken up by another author on SIYE, and it is quite a good story in itself that starts immediately where fake a smile stopped.

It's called [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=129801&textsize=0&chapter=1][The Prevailing Counterpoint]], and it's a pretty good read with a nice resolution.
