** Not in the Hands of Boys is one of the best fics I've ever read in this fandom, maybe even one of the best period--- it addresses a lot of the issues I had with canon and the epilogue in particular, but it never veers into the territory of sheer bashing for bashing's sake, and it has an amazing Harry characterization.

  Once the final battle is won, life must go on, although it can be even harder to master than death. Back at Hogwarts for his final year of school, Harry tries to cope with everything he's been through. As the world around him struggles for a way back to normality, he is forced to realise that in the long run, living takes a lot more courage than dying.
