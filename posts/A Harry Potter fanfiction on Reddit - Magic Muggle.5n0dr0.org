In the summer of 2015, I was browsing [[/r/writingprompts]] when I saw a prompt that caught my eye - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3ituzr/wp_one_day_a_muggle_accidentally_boards_the_train/]["One day, a muggle accidentally boards the train at Platform 9 3/4, and must survive Hogwarts until the winter break."]] I just /had/ to respond to the prompt, and respond I did. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and it was a perfect opportunity to try my hand at Harry Potter fanfiction for the first time. The story follows Matt Mason, a muggle with a secret not even he knows, and his time at Hogwarts - however, it also prominently features canon characters, such as Ginny Weasley and Colin Creevey.

A year and a half later, the story (found at [[/r/magicmuggle]]) is now over 85,000 words long, and into the main character's third year at Hogwarts. However, at the beginning of the story, there wasn't much planning, or really much of a direction. I'm curious as to whether that shows in my writing, and whether I should rewrite some earlier sections for consistency with the newer, planned content.

I would be very grateful for any advice and critique.

EDIT: The first year is also available at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637373/1/Magic-Muggle]].


** Is it possible for you to post this on an actual fanfiction site or have an ebook available just to make it easier and more convenient to read, especially on phone where I do most of my reading, it looks interesting and I want to try it out

*** I agree with this! It's pretty quick and painless to add it to FanFiction.net and/or Ao3. You'll get a lot more readers that way too.

**** It's on FFN, but it gets a lot more traffic on Reddit than it does on there.

****** That's a good idea, thank you. I did upload it to FFN all in one go, next time I'm uploading I'll spread it out a bit.

****** It looks like you released all the chapters in a couple days. Maybe for your next book, update every week (even though you've finished them already) - that way it gets bumped up to the top of the updated fics list and more people are going to see it.

** So I just binge-read the first year

(1) I really like the main character and the mystery around him. As well as how the fact that he's not a wizard (but ppl think he is) is plot related [[/spoiler][with Lockheart and Riddle trying to use his want]].

(2) I'm not a huge fan of romances with little kids, but this was kinda cute so that's nice.

(3) The only real negative I have is that there is not real story. It's just Matt wandering through Hogwarts, meeting random Slytherins and Gryffindors. The climax of the story basically consisted of [[/spoiler][Matt finding Harry and Ron by chance and them randomly letting him come along]] and there's no connection with his day-to-day life.

I know you addressed this in your OP, but I'm hoping that the 2nd and 3rd years offer a more cohesive story.

(3.5) In line with that, Matt doesn't really have any flaws. Yeah, portraits and ghosts won't interact with him, but in terms of /the plot of the story/, there is nothing holding him back. This can be fixed however, by fixing (3) (which is why I only made this 3.5, not 4).

Great start though, even if it wasn't super perfect! I'd give year 1 a 7/10.

*** Bingeread up until Year 3, Chapter 6.

It's really good! Surprisingly the lack of a plot for year 2 got rid of some of the problems (even though the story seemed kinda aimless and [[/spoiler][the Sirius Black thread went nowhere... yet?]]. But I'm a fan of slice-of-life fics, so I liked just reading about a wizard living life.

Looking forward to Year 3. Super excited, and this is definitely on my reading list.

**** Good to hear you enjoyed it!

And yeah, that plot thread kinda went nowhere. Yet.

*** Thank you for reading, and thank you very much for such a detailed review!

1) I'm glad to hear that you like the main character, and the mystery. He's ever present, so it'd be a bit of a problem if he was unlikeable! And yeah, I've tried to make sure his status comes into play at key moments, because it is, after all, the key point from which the story has grown.

2) I've tried to make sure it's cute in that "aww little kids and their crushes" way. There won't be any proper relationships until they're older.

3) Yes, the lack of plot is a big issue, and is mostly a result of me not actually planning it until far too late. It gets more plot-driven later on, and I'm working in a rewrite of the early sections.
