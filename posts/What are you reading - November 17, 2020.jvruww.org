** I am currently picking up the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow]] series again. It's.... unique. Basically Harry is replaced by a version of himself that's been an Inquisitor in 40k and is uber powerful.

If you're into 40k at all, it is hilarious, and a good crossover of the two universes . 40k slowly starts to dominate everything, as it is want to do. If you're not, it's going to be really, really out there, but probably worth a read anyways just to see the way Carrow games the Wizarding world, and to see canon characters becoming daemon-killing badasses.

You just have to read it to know what I mean.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]] Am reading Dobby's Deceit by Morraine. I'd rate it 4/5. It's well written and wholesome. Yet I feel that Harry becomes friend of the goblins too easily and elves do 3/4 of the work and for the remaining part Harry is much overpowered. But it is a pleasant read nevertheless. Story flows nicely albeit slowly, no noticeable grammar issues or too big plot holes.

The thing is, I've never been that into Star Wars, so I clicked on this link with very low expectations. That has all changed now.

**** There are a few I have read. Potter of the ages I really good, set in the events of OOTP and Black is alive. When Harry met yoda, the problem I have with this is that some scenes are repeated in a different POV and It gets annoying. Into the black is during order 66 and is good once you get to the star wars part. The beginning for me was annoying because of unnecessary hate of the Weasley family. There are some other great ones like Crossed stars and stars Crossed. So these are some really good ones. If you want, you can dm on reddit and we can talk about these.

** Currently reading the lost generation by Jennbob on AO3. I love the Marauders Era with my entire being and this fic omygod this fic!! I'm not exaggerating when I say it really could be a stand alone Marauders novel because it's THAT beautifully written. The author captures their personalities and characterization flawlessly despite the crumbs we get in canon. And the way they wrote the first wizarding war and hoe the characters play into it, perfect! I love it so much and I would rate it above and beyond if I could.

** - Rereading “Breakfast In New York by Radaslab” linkffn(5141159) and I was frustrated again: it would be so good story, but it needs so much cutting. The plotline is good for some ten chapters, but the author drags it on for three times that long, and it shows. In the end the author themselves got lost, so for example he forgot that Harry already told Hermione he was a Roman Catholic, and so he discloses it to her as a big surprise just after asking to marry him (yes, the role of the faith is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][questionable]], but that's another point). It is such a pity, that author drowned a good story in so much repetition and stuff which doesn't carry the plot, because the story would be really lovely all-romantic all-fluff thing otherwise.

- “It's Not Just A Stick: A Wand Crafter's Story by Kgfinkel” linkao3(27454435) one of those Harry-has-different-interests-and-talents than in canon. Obviously going towards Harmony combined with good Dursleys, but not poorly written.

- “Many Thanks by Madm05” linkffn(4692717) ... a strange story with Hermione travelling back to the Marauders' times, saving the world from Voldermort by sacrificing herself, and yet probably doing the wrong thing. Well written.

** I've been rereading "Grow Young with Me" recently because it was updated. It's a very slow burn, not beginning with romance, but developing there. The slow tempo feels quite natural, no boring streaks. I also find the characters quite likable and well written. If you like the first few chapters you will also like the rest, so really worth a try if you are looking for a romance fanfic.\\

** Rereading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][‘The Very Secret Diary']] - very much an oldie but very much a goodie. The original has been taken down but thankfully someone put it back up so if you haven't read it then it's worth an hour or two of your time. It tells CoS literally just in Ginny's diary entries. Starts off mundane but slowly becomes more and more horrifying as it goes along. The final few chapters are so different in tone to the lighthearted opening that it's almost hard to picture it as all one story yet it works so well.

Worth a read and worth sticking with it as well as the opening is a bit slow and seemingly directionless but that just adds to the effect as the story slowly veers into darker and darker territory. Mostly canon-compliant other than a couple of very minor things which are more products of when it was written than anything else. Absolutely rate it a 10/10.

** I'm currently reading /Seasons of Change/, an AU in which Harry is more considerate, setting off a series of changes that include a stronger friendship between our Golden Trio, Harry having a better relationship with Dudley, Harry becoming acquainted with Sirius after a letter Harry sends to him in Azkaban leads him to fake his death and seek out Harry in Animagus form. I would say it's up there in my top 10 for fics where Sirius enters Harry's life under different circumstances.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

** I've been recently into OCs stories, but it's always a frustrating search, as most are not that well written. I've found a series that I simply love though. The pairing is OC (James Potter's sister) with Regulus Black, but it doesn't focus so much on that to the point that it becomes the only thing keeping the story going. In the first work even it's all about their friendship and how they become an inseparable duo like their older brothers. This fic also introduced something to me that I haven't considered before, namely chronic magical diseases. Beyond all, I deeply recommend this fic because of its protagonist's sense of humor. I haven't laughed so much while reading in ages!

*** I once read a wattpid fic with James's twin sister and one scene has stuck out to me for years. They're in transfiguration and James got in trouble and had his desk moved beside mcgonagall's at the beginning. Later, the sister gets in trouble and mcgonagall yells out “potter” and James is like “wtf I didn't even do anything!” It was hilarious.

*** I read this story and I really enjoyed it. I usually hate first-year fics but the OC really is hilarious. I was legit laughing out loud throughout the entire fic. The sequel is much darker and still in progress. There are moments of humor (the OC really doesn't give a single fuck about what the other students think of her) but it's mainly about defeating Voldemort. While I think I have the plot of the fic figured out, I'm definitely keep up with it to see it all unfold because it takes a stance on horcruxes I haven't seen in a fic yet: Voldemort receives a prophecy stating that his horcruxes will be destroyed.
