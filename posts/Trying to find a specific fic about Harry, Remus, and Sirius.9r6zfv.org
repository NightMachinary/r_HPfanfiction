I'm pretty sure the fic was from Harry's POV, and that the general premise was that he found out Remus and Sirius were a couple, and felt rather confused about it. I think it was set at Grimmauld Place, during OotP. I remember it had a scene with Harry and Remus talking while Sirius was asleep, and Remus showing Harry a picture of him as an infant with Sirius. I think it was a one-shot and hosted on AO3.

EDIT: 3 months later but I finally found it! It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2063883/1/The-Shape-of-His-Hands][The Shape of His Hands]] on ffn.
