Just to put it out there, I don't mean to come off as misogynistic or hateful towards women or anything. It's just that most of the good works I've read are written by females and I've lost faith in my species...

So...

What good male-written fics do you recommend?


** Unless an author mentions it in an author note, how/why would you even know?

​

... ...

I think the author of my favorite fic (like grains of sand in the hourglass) mentioned he was male. Or that he had a wife (which doesn't necessarily mean anything). Or something in one of his author notes. I think. Again, it doesn't really matter :P

*** Yeah, it's usually in comments that I notice gender, or if they say something on their author page. The fic you mention is the one by Temporal Knight, right? For some reason I had that author pegged as a woman. If it's a man, damn, does he do a good Tonks.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]])

Is probably one of the most famous fanfics out there, and it's by a man. People either love it or love to hate it.

Otherwise, how can you even tell an author's gender? Most pennames are androgynous.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth.

And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

Huh? Wouldn't that be misandrist if you believe there to be no good male authors?

Anyhow...

One of my favorite authors is male: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick]]

So is LeadVonE I believe: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6791440/LeadVonE]]

I'm pretty sure nonjon is male too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon]]

... and so is Bobmin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]

Another consistently decent to good male author: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1634726/LeQuin]]

I'd be surprised if Clell identifies as female: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/Clell65619]]

... same goes for sprinter1988: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2936579/sprinter1988]]

Conclusion: There's plenty of great male authors.

** I believe that Silently Watches is male, and his world-building is generally exquisite, and his characterization not far behind. The Black Queen series, while an unbelievably dark world, is a masterpiece. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4036441/Silently-Watches][Silently Watches]]

The other truly impressive male writer that comes to mind is Ebenbild, as yet another world-builder. His /magnum opus/ I think has to be Basilisk-born. linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) While the story has some grammar issues I believe can simply be written off as English not being his first language, the world he constructs within the story is even more complex than that of the Black Queen series, with a more complete history behind it. The way he links so many things together is incredibly impressive.

** Good is subject to opinion but here's a list of my personal favorites. I'm just going to start listing off the top of my head. I could be wrong on a couple of these but I read so much fanfic it's hard to keep track. Keep in mind that I know for a fact some of these authors are no longer active and in a few cases are actually sadly deceased.

Chilord, MSgtSilverDollar, temporalknight, bobmin, nonjon, jacobapples, whitesquirrel, oldcrow, lomonaaeren or however it's spelled, darthmarrs, neale, knifehand, roff, dunuelos, selector, dz2, tlyxor1, sinyk, senawario, zaxaramas, tiro, robst, vonpelt, racke, erbkaiser, nigelcat1, ruskbyte, slimah, brennus, kevin1984, lordcartwright, jbern, nothingpretentious, theblackhand724. There are undoubtedly more but I'm too tired to bother completely trawling through my archive of stuff for them.

** You can try these male authors:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]] always writes strong female lead characters. He likes Hermione so much that he often engages in arguments related to her with other sub members.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/116880/][Lord Silvere]] is very good with female characterizations, such as Bellatrix in “Delenda Est”, Ginny in “Para Bellum”, and Susan Bones in “Final Protocol”.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/][Marquis Black]] is the author of “Emperor”. I'm very impressed with his knowledge in history, politics, strategies, and wars.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]] is the author of “Strangers at Drakeshaugh”. His massive postwar Series is very worth reading, and often recommended here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/][BajaB]] wrote “Harry the Hufflepuff” and “Dark Marauder”. You should give them a try.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/][holdmybeer]] has only one fic, but an excellent and very often recommended one: “The Sum of Their Parts”. He put his writing on hold for the time being because his wife gave birth a few months ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2139446/][arturus]] is a very good crossover author. There is no misogyny whatsoever in his fics, and “Gods Among Us” is one of the rare gems that feature original plots in other universes.
