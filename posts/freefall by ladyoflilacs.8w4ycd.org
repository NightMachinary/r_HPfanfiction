I keep seeing this fic recommended but the author's [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] account has been cleared. Does anyone know of a way to read it or have a download that they can share?


** [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=ladyoflilacs][ff2ebook]] also has it, if you want a download.

**** No harm just taking a peek. They don't translate entire fics often.
