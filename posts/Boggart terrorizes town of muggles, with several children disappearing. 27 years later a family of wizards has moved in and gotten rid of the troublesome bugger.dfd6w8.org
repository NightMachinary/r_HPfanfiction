Probably not workable as a full story, but could probably be done as a one shot/crossover.

Be an interesting take on Pennywise/Boggart since they work similarly.

Really trivializing the struggle of the children to get rid of him xD

This has been word prompts with Me. Thanks for joining today's journey.


** Does a boggart kill their victims? Doesn't Pennywise kill them and/or lure them to his lair? I like the one shot idea, I'm just curious as to how dark this boggart is...could almost be a dementor/boggart hybrid bred by a dark wizard.

  A boggart is a shapeshifter that usually lurks in dark spaces. It has no definite form, taking the shape of that which is most feared by the person who encounters it. When not in the sight of a person, it is believed to look like a dark blob.

After a bit of searching this is the best desctiption I could find. And the answer is that it doesn't say. Maybe it's mentioned in the fantastic beasts book? But I doubt it since it's not mentioned here.

So the question is, why does the Boggart turn into what you fear the most, if not to terrify you so it can eat you?

**** I always figured they were kinda like low rent dementors, in that as psychovores they feed off of fear. Of course they're probably pretty efficient predators in an ambush situation, so maybe they eat people/animals.

***** That was my take as well. And that they are more dangerous for children and people who have less control over their emotions.

****** I always figured it was sort of a defense mechanism. There's no mention of them ever /hunting/ people, they only do anything when you stumble across them and scare them out of their cupboard or wardrobe or whatever.

******* Tht was my assumption as well. But that doesn't make sense if it doesn't have a form except when confronting someone.

******** I don't see why not. Magic can do all sorts of things. Besides afaik nothing says that they /don't/ have a physical form outside of that, only that nobody knows.

**** Makes sense. Probably why they teach the students how to fight them off fairly young.
