Hello :D

I read a story the other day where Snape had a very real werewolf scare, and I was on the edge of my seat wondering if he was going to join the ranks of the furry.

I read one a couple months earlier where he actually HAD gotten bitten and was struggling with that... and that one was neat! (I'll see if I can find it...)

I'd love some more stories along these lines!

Preferably with Snape as a friendly-to-neutral figure (I'm a big Severitus fan :) I understand that Snape is NOT a kind character and that's okay, but I don't really like 'Snape is actually really REALLY a Death Eater' unless it has a 'good' ending (as in, betraying the dark lord in the end) ... Obviously, I have preference to Snape being a major character, rather than a minor side details.

Anything else like this might actually be neat too. Snape is so often depicted as a flexible, yet rigid, strong, yet weak character... it seems like making him CHANGE would be a good way to write some interesting character development.. (as in.. .werewolf, vampire, ghoul, missing an arm, etc etc.)

(I might be interested in other stories along the same lines about other characters. Werewolf hermoine? Vampire Neville? :))

Have a lovely evening :D

Edit: Oh! I don't care if it's slash, het, femslash or gen. I care more about good stories :) I prefer to avoid aggressive character bashing where I can, don't like most crackfic, but don't mind silly stories.


** Clearly, Seventh Horcrux fits perfectly- Severus betrays the Dark Lord in the end, but spends years before that hiding his werewolf affliction from the Wizarding World (albeit in vain).

***** Oh, I don't mind some silly and goofiness

I just realized that I don't really get any joy out of most crackfics any more. I'd still be willing to read a good fic! (just not one where every sentence has a punch line, and where the Truth Of Things is that Voldemorte really just needs to get laid, the ginny weasley keeps a hammer in her pocket, for when her brothers start acting dumb and ISN'T GETTING HIT IN THE GROIN THE BEST THING?

As for your spoiler -- you spoiler like this:

#+begin_example
  [Some spoiler](/spoiler)  
#+end_example

FYI :D

and thank you for the fair warning ! seriously--I appreciate it! :D Still gonna read it :D

****** oh, haha, alright! Seventh Horcrux is a great fic, really -- just wanted to give you a heads-up about the werewolf bit. And thanks for the advice on the spoiler, though I ended up searching it up [[/spoiler][and deleting my original comment.]] :P

*** No pairing offends me as long as it's well written. Seriously, I've read harry/voldemort before happily.

I have a bit of an aversion to Snarry fics? but maybe I've just never read a good one.

But every Snape/Hermoine (Granape? Snanger? Herverus? Sevmoine? Snapmoine?) I've heard has been pretty good.

THANK YOU! :D /runs off to read now/

** Ah, I found, I think, the story I had read a few months ago where Snape HAD gotten bitten.

As a warning, that's technically a spoiler, but, well... :) that's kind of hard to avoid in this situation, isn't it?

also of note, this is part of a series. It's complete! There's a related but unrelated story I also recommend. I'll link that one too.

Additionally: This series is technically a cross over with Supernatural. I've never watched supernatural. You don't, I think, need to have watched it to follow the fanfic. but I feel like parts of the fanfic would spoil parts of the show. So beware.

Edit: PLEASE NOTE that the fanfic bot of awesomeness has linked the stories in the wrong order, so please make sure you read them in the right order :)

Here's the series: For the Price of a Soul, Peace is a State of Mind, Souls of the Dead, and Family Matters: linkffn(9265719; 10223438; 10380101; 11449172)

Here's the related but unrelated story... it's also complete. linkffn(11767424)

hope you enjoy!

  Lily Potter made a mistake nine months before Harry was born: Severus Snape, not her husband, was Harry's father. The ripple effect of this reaches far: Snape dies young, Harry calls vampires family, and Lucius Malfoy seeks to destroy Voldemort. But one thing remains the same -- the inevitability of death.

  Sequel to 'For the Price of a Soul'. Everyone wants peace. Unfortunately, no one's very good at finding it in healthy ways and when they do find it, something inevitably comes along to ruin it.
