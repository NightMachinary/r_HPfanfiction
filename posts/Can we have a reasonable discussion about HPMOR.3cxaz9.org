I just feel like every time this comes up it devolves into a storm of comments insulting people and with the recent posts about "why do people like X fic" I thought this would be an interesting one particularly since I don't see the appeal in it.


** I'm not a fan. I'm not a hater, but I read the beginning of it (the first fanfiction I ever read actually) and got bored of it when Harry decided storming Azkaban was a logical thing to do. I then went off to find something more reasonable and the rest is history. Since then I've read a bit further, on and off, but I never got to the end.

What is wrong with the story? The /story/ can only really be barely called a story. It weaves back and forth without any real direction and obviously never saw much in the way of pre-planning. Instead it uses the kitchen sink method of producing foreshadowing. Just throw every single detail into a story and then, later on, you can pick one of those pointless things at random and shout 'Hey look, foreshadowing, I'm so awesome!'

The characters aren't really characters in any meaningful sense. Everyone appears to orbit around Harry with no discernible goals or lives of their own. Quirrelmort is possibly the only exception to this.

But that's just the story, HPMOR is so much more than the story alone.

For one, it's fanfiction. Fanfiction never stands alone, it must always be considered beside the source work. In a very real way fanfiction is both commentary and critique of the original work by its very nature, to ask that we ignore that relationship when considering HPMOR is both disingenuous and simultaneously damaging to HPMOR's actual standing.

HPMOR doesn't stand on its own. If it had been released as a stand-alone book with no reference to Harry Potter it would have been largely ignored, if it had even been published (extremely unlikely given the form and length it takes). It isn't a novel in any real sense because of that. It is, at its very core, a work of Harry Potter fanfiction, no more and no less.

And so we cannot ignore what it says /about/ the Harry Potter books. It is uniformly disparaging of them, it is almost all critique and no comment. It is very much like the college student who decries the lack of awareness of his fellow man while simultaneously believing that the world's many problems have a /simple/ solution. It is overly critical and completely un-self-aware. It claims to be so much more than /mere/ fanfiction while simultaneously being itself undeniably fanfiction.

For me fanfiction isn't really about the quality of the writing or any of that stuff. It's nice and it's what I read for but it's not why fanfiction exists. Fanfiction is like an enthusiasm overflow. It happens when an author comes along and floods your brain with ideas and visions such that you cannot help but be utterly taken in it is a wonderful thing. But they overflow; ideas multiply and visions grow into dreams. And so the work that at first only encompassed the external books created by the original author must now grow to describe all of the new ideas and thoughts that flood from the minds of those who've been drawn in.

It starts with daydreams and idle imaginings and grows into jokes and arguments with the similarly afflicted. Finally the flow of ideas becomes so great that it sweeps the pen along with it and words find their way onto a page. Those words may not be beautiful or even especially coherent but they are still a pure and heartfelt expression of the dreams and wishes of the person who wrote them.

And that, I think, is why I truly dislike HPMOR. Because it sets itself in such abject opposition to that view. It is a cynical vehicle for self-promotion that, I think, tarnishes the core of what fanfiction has always been. It wasn't written by a fan, it didn't grow out of the ideas of Harry Potter and it wasn't nurtured by enthusiasm for the world. It is fanfiction in the practicalities, but it isn't where it really matters; in the soul.

Oh the author hasn't even read all the books. Which again I don't like as a criticism because it shouldn't be relevant but knowing that definitely affects me reading it and i've slogged through the whole thing.

I definitely agree that it comes off smug in the actual story though, author aside, and it's increased by it being a serious fic rather than a crack fic where I can let that slide.

**** Thank you for starting up this discussion. The drama has seeped into story. I find it hard to make literary criticisms without referencing the author. I feel that the protagonist is a self-insert/Mary Sue to the point that there is barely any divide between the author and the character. I think this could be evident to even a casual reader that is unaware of the controversy. I take issue with HPMOR's presentation as a 'serious fic'. To me it feels like the author didn't know what plot devices would be seen as "crack fic". Examples: [[/spoiler][My Little Pony unicorns, ghostbuster dance scenes, over the top school-wide student battles, immortal unicorn/troll sidekick Hermione, gluing people in the buff to the ceiling (Harry did it by proxy)]]

****** Yea, I agree it's annoying. Here are some criticisms without any reference to the author or controversy:

1. It is too slow. For such a long fic, the is to much crammed into 1 year. If Harry had been less ambitious the story would have been more interesting. What if his first 2 years were briefly touched upon, showing the highlights of his experimentation and then we get to see a more mature Harry in 3rd year acting after he has spent the time to actually get to know magical theory and magic culture/politics?

2. To much exposition. No matter the content of the conversation, that much exposition gets boring. I want to see things move along.

3. I enjoy fics that switch character viewpoint more often. It's too Harry-centric for my taste.

4. The kids are too adult like. If that's how you want them to be ok, but it's not enjoyable to me. The canon story is very interesting/compelling without the characters having intense political or philosphical tête-à-tête.

5. I find it unlikely that Harry's scientist dad shrugs off his first sight of magic. It seems like he just files it away and goes back to his daily grind. No chapter about him asking questions, doing his own research. Nope.

6. Intolerant muggles. I think that is a downfall of a lot of fics. We are fed this line that the Statute of Secrecy is needed otherwise a global witch hunt would ensue. People would revile magic users and toss muggleborn kids in the trash bin. Really? This idea does not seem likely to me. Provided the Statute doesn't come down due to magical terrorists I think the vast majority of muggles would be like *"SWEET! Can they do lightsabers!?"*. Think of all the non-religious who would say "see! Magic. Your religions is bunk". Or all the new agers, wicca, etc. Scientists wouldn't just ignore it, they'd employee the crap out of wizards. There would be no poor magicals anymore: they could all gets jobs helping researchers develop magic energy sources, become medical providers, go on Oprah, do glamours for celebrities, be MagicTaxi and charge $1000 per apparation, MagicFedEx, be employed in literally any industry at all and still live in Hogsmeade. I'd like to read a fic where wizards are dumbfounded by an overwhelmingly positive reception that plays to their egos.

7. It glosses over the political and cultural realities of the magical society. It falls into the category of fic that staggers around denigrating the magical world without really getting into why muggle society is better, why magical is dumb. The magical society probably is dumb, sure why not, but tell me WHY and don't make it farcical. Or better yet, make it appear simple first but then go deeper, making the reader have conflicted feelings about the culture: yea some stuff is wrong, big stuff, but some of it makes sense and I feel for them. Make it feel like real life is what I'm saying.

Whew! I'm surprised I was able to write that out without referencing the author, but there you have it. Any thoughts about these critiques, aWookieFromKashyyyk?

******* I'm not a Harry Potter Fan. I've read one book because a sibling asked me whether I thought it would help them with their English. I also have only read a bit of HPMOR. This as a disclaimer.

Do you know the book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World]["Sophie's world"]] by Jostein Gaarder? It's a coming-of-age story that is framed eventually as story within a story - I don't want to give away the plot - that is very much about the history of philosophy and a number of philosophical traditions. Like HPMOR, it is full of exposition, and it's a brilliant book I loved when I was younger. HPMOR for me is similar in that its purpose is to explore a specific philosophical "tradition", Bayesian rationalism, as a novel as opposed to a text book. This is usually called "philosophical novel" and is a genre unto itself, with well-known works being Voltaire's /Candide/ or Goethe's /Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship/. Other's are some or most of Dostoyevsky's books, certainly /The Brothers Karamazov/, everything by Kafka, Hesse, Stanislaw Lem, almost all works by existentialists (Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre), and so on.

If you generally like those sorts of books - and for me most of my favourite books are somewhere on a list on philosophical novels truly by incident - then HPMOR is not a bad fan fiction. It isn't as polished as books by professional writers. It's sometimes too slow, or too pathetic, or too heavy-handed, but the philosophical exposition /is/ what makes it interesting.

*** That's a very good point but the story does suffer, for me, from the community around it and the authors personality bleeding over/the whole trying to monetise it. Which is probably unfair but if I had Ayn Rand fans yelling at me for not liking every facet of Atlas Shrugged and had notes at the start of each chapter telling me to donate money to her after being given the book for free i'd probably not enjoy it as much.

Also I guess I disagree with the propaganda and the story doesn't stand as enjoyable on its own for me. Like if you remove the blatant self-promotion there isn't really a story there so if you're not enjoying learning about the authors theories there's not much to read about. Whereas 1984 can still be read as a cool dystopian novel without having to agree with the message. Actually for me Animal Farm is a far better example cause I read it when I was probably to young/naive to get the point behind it and just thought it was an enjoyable farm story.

A preachy, thinly veiled self-insert (admittedly Rand is less obvious about it) that serves as some kind of autoerotica for the author to marvel at his or her own magnificence. They are also similar in the sense that both of them boil down to "Waaah, everything would be perfect if people would just do everything /my/ way!".

Yes, I'm projecting, but this fic /really/ rubs me the wrong way. And yes, the drama and the fanbase are probably like... 65% the reason for it rather than the fic itself. But still.

But stuff like the human patronus are waaaaay too circlejerky for me.

*** Fair enough. I was interested in the whole rationalism thing but the fic isn't discerning about it for me. There's just so much crammed in and I think it's to the detriment of the story and causes it to read like a series of HP related essays at times.

Also I think I mentioned elsewhere ITT that the dementor/patronus thing is what turned me off for good. :P

** I thought the concept was nice, and I loved the first few chapters of it. I stopped reading around chapter 100 or so, when the wank became to much for me to handle, but then when I heard it had been finished I went back and read the rest. I loved the way at the end the author took one of the criticisms -Harry is unrealistic, both mentally and emotionally- and basically went <Spoilers>

I think a big part of why I enjoyed so much more of it than other people apparently did is that I read it in two block sessions, so I didn't get sucked into the discussions about it until after the fact. I also didn't really know anything about the author, nor do I have any memory of him asking for money or saying that his story was better than the original books.

Yeah there's a lot of dodgy quotes out there by him, often they're found on reddit or his website which is why I wanted to avoid bringing them into the discussion because they aren't easily findable and don't actually affect story quality, just enjoyment. (for example I vaguely remember seeing an archived page where he was trying to sell merch and asking for donations to his self-ran non-profit).

** HPMOR was my first experience with fanfiction. I had been reading [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/][Worm]]. Worm led me to the amazing stories on [[http://www.qntm.org/fiction][qntm.org]]. An author's note on qntm.org led me to HPMOR and I dove in before knowing anything about the world of fanfiction. I was on a streak of enjoying stories with innovative world building with a focus on SCI-FI, and I liked that HPMOR was trying to look at the HP verse through a scientific lens. I barely even knew what fanfiction was at this point. I didn't know what had already been done or what was considered good/bad. I was enthralled with it at for up until the end of the battle class arc when Hermione beat Draco. Before then I enjoyed the nonstandard uses of magic during the mock battles, skimmed the RationalRants and was just waiting for him to do more experiments. I did get the feeling that the protagonist had a stick up his butt but didn't care to much. The story seemed to lose focus at some point. Harry no longer did experiments, and the things he did discover felt like assumptions that turned out to be right /because awesome/. I stopped reading it for a while and came back after reading *a lot* of other fics. I didn't enjoy HPMOR anymore. I read up to the end and it seemed forced, like the author ran out of time or interest and it became a crack fic. Not only does Hermione become immortal but she's a shiny unicorn, troll hybrid ready to be Harry's life long (forever-long?) lab assistant/batgirl. I felt that Harry is supposed to be shown as super smart yet he gets himself and others into harmful situations without thinking the consequences through. The protagonist belittles others, assuming they are unintelligent because they act differently than him, or don't get into Rationalist arguments with him. Here is an excerpt from HPMOR ch. 81, after Harry scare the Dementor during the Wizengamot trial:

#+begin_quote
  /Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder how he did that.' This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are wealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other ways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of business and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed. Almost none have walked the path of a powerful wizard */(read:Rationalist)*...When they are not looking at a contract of debt, they abandon what shrewdness they possess and relax with some comfortable nonsense.*
#+end_quote

In my interpretation of that, Harry is calling all regular folk, stupid. Implying that we switch off our intelligence willy nilly, and that the intelligence we do use for everyday life and business is hardly intelligence at that, but simple shrewdness. Now I don't mind if a character calls someone stupid (egad!). However, I got sick of the protagonist, as a blatant mouthpiece for the author expresses that in real life most people (me and you likely included) are morons who go through life without curiosity about the way things work.

Some random critiques: (spoilers) I liked the pop culture references for the most part, but the My Little Pony tattoo on the dead unicorn? Really?

How did Quirellmort move his arm fast enough to block a bullet with a wave of his wand? With the distance apart they were and the speed of the projectile his arm would have had to move at supersonic speeds. Did I miss the part where the villain could was secretly the Flash. If you want your magic system to have a work around for mundane weapons that is fine, but don't bust out wrist flicks at Mach 2.

If you promise your readers a scientific look at magic, then do it. Short plots about experimenting with conjuring bats and looking into squib genetics is enough for a oneshot. I wanted more.

**** Agreed 100%. I should have said "I was assumed HPMOR would be looking at magic scientifically". You are correct, as a whole HPMOR did not do that, and camped out in Rationalism. But that became evident to me later on in the story as I kept reading. At the beginning there was the expectation and hope it would be scientific. I came to HPMOR through a recommendation on a sci-fi fiction site (qntm.org) so I thought that HPMOR would be similar.

There was so much more that HPMOR could have been, and so much it didn't need to be.

If you are going to make your protagonist 11 years old, he needs to act like an 11 year old in at least some capacity. I don't understand why the author decided to keep Harry 11 since the character bears basically no similarities to book-Harry anyway. Just make him older. I mean, HPMOR-Harry would still be an arrogant, pompous little twerp who annoyed the shit out of me, but at least he would have been a believable human being.

On top of my head I remember Quirrell getting all mad when some older year cast a spell on an another student that he didn't actually know what it does, only that it was for an "enemy". If you think about it, that is very very retarded thing to do, queue remembering cannon Harry doing just that. There are other moments like this, where cannon approach to things isn't just made fun of, but is exposed as almost insanity.

Ehhh, not really. HPMOR-Harry bears no resemblance to any actual 11 year old. At 11 years old, the human brain is not developed to process information the way HPMOR-Harry does. In fact, that ability doesn't start developing until 14/15/16 at the youngest. Realistically, HPMOR-Harry comes across as an obnoxious 18 year old.

Look, I get that writing kids is really difficult, but if it is something a writer feels they can't execute successfully, I don't see why they force it. It's particularly jarring when the author is writing a fan piece where the author of the original work was successfully able to convey age-appropriate children/teenagers most of the time.

I'd say that HPJEV's maturity (of a sort) does make sense, in light of the nature of his "mysterious dark side". But this is only explained too late in the story to be meaningful.

Not to mention that the other children can be just as unrealistic, and there's no in-universe justification for them.
