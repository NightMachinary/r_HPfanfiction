Things like the fidelius charm or the wards around places like Diagon Alley or Hogwarts that keep non-magicals from seeing the magical world... would that work against videos and satellite images or would the modern world eventually evolve to the point that keeping the magical world secret would be much more difficult if not impossible?


** Yes. In the 1990s there were already plenty of satellite photos of earth, and that's to say nothing of aerial photography which was probably much more prevalent. [[https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/]] is where you can see some of the satellite photos.

Besides this simple fact, magic is conceptual. You can hide the secret of a place in a soul. Taboo a word so it can never be used without being known. You can trace all underage magic use. Making something unplottable is to make it untraceable. Magic overrides the mundane to make it happen and is governed by its own limits. It's why a wizard can literally create matter but a wizard can't just blow up an entire city.

  /Just as wizards can make buildings unplottable, they can also make themselves untraceable. Voldemort would have been found long ago if it had been as simple as sending him an owl!/

So with the concept of magically hidden in mind, it's clear from the books that it definitely is possible to keep satellite imagery from being seen. I suspect the muggle repelling charm. Or confundment of all photography.

*** Could a wizard conjure plutonium to blow up a city?

**** We've had this discussion before I believe.

Allow me to amend my statement with "can't just blow up an entire magical city."

** It might also morph the picture or camera foootage to display something else entirely so that no one gets suspicious

** My personal headcannon is that Unplottable Charms prevent most long distance imaging. Pictures are just hyper-accurate maps, so any image that would contain something that has been spelled to not be mapped get rearranged so the charmed area isn't included.

** Depends on how they're designed. I think there's a variety of options for hiding things from muggle eyes, and they'd probably react differently to different types of cameras depending on when and on what budget they were made.

** Maybe it depends on the type of camera. If it's a camera designed to mimic the vision of the human eye, then they might not pick up hidden places. If the cameras use something outside the visible spectrum, such as infrared or ultraviolet cameras, then spells to mask their appearance would likely not work because that's not what they're designed to block.

Even the famous Deathly Hallow invisibility cloak doesn't block sound. Presumably it doesn't block smell or body heat either.
