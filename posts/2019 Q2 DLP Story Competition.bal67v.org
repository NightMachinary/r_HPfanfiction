The [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/posts/1090506/][DLP Story Competition]] is currently being run every quarter, and we'd like to try to gather a bit more entries this time around, if anybody is interested.

If you're interested, you've until the *14th of June*, or a bit more than two months to hash out your idea and put together a small story under 17,500 words, based off one, or both of the two prompts chosen for this round :

There's not really any limit to how far you can stretch the prompt, and there isn't any minimum word count, so there's quite a bit of extra room for you to work with. You don't /really/ need to work within the constraints of fanon!Daphne or what Azkaban is established as in Canon -- get creative!

All entries are anonymous, and you'll be sure to get fair and constructive reviews from the voters, even if you don't win, you can choose to claim your entry after the end of the competition if you're willing.

It's a nice opportunity to touch up on your writing with something short, and gain some valuable insight on improving in the process. There's no real benefit to winning, just as there's no consequence for writing something that might not be as well-written as some of the others. It's a way you can help yourself and in turn help others grow as writers through discussion and criticism, the possibility of winning is only an extra benefit. It's always worth giving it a try, and maybe you'll be able to become a better writer through entering, and maybe you'll even become the winner.

Hoping to see some more entries!
