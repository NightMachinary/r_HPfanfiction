Fics where an HP character develops magic from another world (like a more developed version of the Character Sheet of DeStInY), or where someone gets sent to/from the HP world with their original magic intact (like HP&tN20 and HP and the Planar Professor, and how the Dresden Fillies books did with MLP/The Dresden Files), that sort of thing. I've seen a few of these for Harry Potter/Harry Dresden crossovers, but they're few and far between compared to the "American magic is just different, even though it's headquarted in Edinburgh" fics.

(No "Harry is suddenly a video game character" fics unless they emphasize Harry's magic being different from everyone else's beyond the scope of things like "Harry learns spells more easily thanks to level grinding". I love those, but that's mostly past the border of what I'm asking for.)


** There are linkffn(wizard runemaster;retsu's folly;uchiha fukurou;to train a dragon rider).

The first work is by plums and is harem-y. Next is the exploration of the animes Bleach and Naruto's "magic". Finally the last one is an Inheritance cycle crossover wherein Potter uses some of the Inheritance cycle's magic while he's teaching his own magic to the MC.

Edit:

The fic by plums is a Warcraft cross by the way. Potter is slowly learning the magics of WC. Pretty destructive IMO.

** linkffn(10552390) - Magic Online\\
This story does have Harry in a video game, but the way his magic interacts with the game world is a key plot point. It gets a bit too angsty sometimes, but overall a recommendable story. Based on some anime story, but you don't need to know that to enjoy this, I didn't.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG
