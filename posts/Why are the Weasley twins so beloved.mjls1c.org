I am not even mad at their bullying attempts... when I first read the books as a kid I was happy that there were people standing up to those nasty Slytherins from the Inquisitorial Squad and I always loved their knack for theatrics. Especially their ride into the sunset while screwing Umbridge over.

However I never quite understood the people's love for them. They are minor characters, yet they are the only ones who always remain decent in a Weasley bashing fic. Then I go to the main Harry Potter sub and people are always crying over Fred. In my mind, he was such an insignificant character that I didn't even notice the first time that I read the story that he had died until Harry saw him in the Great Hall.

But I also never found them funny. Not in canon and fanon made them even worse.

Am I missing something?


** As others have said, they're the perfect comic relief characters. As the world around them gets darker, they still manage to find the humor in things. When I was younger, I loved their comedic antics and didn't think much else of it. Now that I am older, I realize that keeping a sense of humor when the world around you is falling apart is one of the best ways to cope. Harry understands this when he gives them his thousand Galleon prize for winning the Triwizard Tournament so they can eventually open a joke shop. He even says that he feels with Voldemort returning, people would need something to feel happy about.

** I feel like Fred's death is worst for me because as a twin, I couldn't imagine loosing my twin like that. And we aren't even as close as Fred and George are portrayed

** I think they are a bit like Luna, they are just fleshed out enough to be genuinely different to the other characters, but minor enough that if you don't care for them then you can completely ignore them when writing a fanfic. It is a sort of survivorship bias, the only people who bother using them as characters are those who like them and want to make them more important.

Also to be honest there are so few characters who we know anything at all about in canon. Only Harry, Ron and Hermione are 'major' so even being minor is an achievement. Think of how many common fanon characters are basically just name dropped and ignored in canon.\\
Added to that they invent all sorts of weird and wacky magic and then set up a thriving joke shop in the middle of a civil war. Arguably they are pretty much the only characters in the entire setting other than the protagonists who are actually competent.

** People always love a good comic relief character. And they're really not that minor of characters, relatively speaking. After Harry, Ron, and Hermione, they're some of the most commonly recurring characters, at least for the first five books.

And for what it's worth, their bullying is almost entirely a fanon invention.

**** You might as well ask why anyone likes any character besides Harry, Ron, Hermione, and...that's about it.

In fact, people love characters who we know far, far less about, like Tonks, Luna, Neville, Cedric, Daphne, and basically the Marauders' entire generation.

***** I don't mean in the way not to like them. I like it when fanfiction expands on these characters. I mean like whenever someone mentions Fred dying in canon, everyone acts so sad. Similarly to Hedwig of which not even Harry cared much that she died.

******* Maybe I was exaggerating but he only spends like a few paragraphs moping about her and those occur when Hagrid or Molly ask about her. After the first part of the fifth chapter he forgets about her. Albeit it could be argued that Harry was so used to death by now that he learned to move on quickly. He doesn't really seem that moved by the dead during the Battle of Hogwarts either.

*** Their bullying is canon. I mean, they burned a hole in Ron's tongue, nearly killed him by tricking him into making an unbreakable vow, gave him his spider phobia, used his pet puffskein for bludger practice...

*** Actually that's what I had in mind as well when I started the post (well that and the never-ending threads when someone mentions Fred's death and everyone keeps saying how sad they got). They did a nice thing for Harry and everyone loves them.

Ron also brought Harry into a loving family (and he didn't need to do so) which I think outweighs giving him a map no matter what sentimental value it has, yet he still gets a lot of hate (outside of this sub). Molly accepted him almost as her son and she's the second most bashed Weasley.
