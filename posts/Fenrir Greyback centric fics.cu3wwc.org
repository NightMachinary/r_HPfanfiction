Does anyone know good Fenrir Greyback centric fics? There doesn't have to be a pairing. I don't mind slash (prefer it actually) and I don't really care with whom he is paired if there is a relationship written in this. I don't mind gory fics and it would be cool if there would be some Death Eaters though I would probably read anything you recommend.


** These two fics are two of my favourites!! Harry/Fenrir slash, read the warnings first coz it may not be your cup of tea at all [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/393544]]

** Does anyone have fics that focus on Greyback but where he's the main villain that everyone else is trying to defeat
