Just wondering if there were some well written fics featuring vampires. Don't care what the plot is like someone bitten as long as there isn't a rivalry with werewolves (though Remus can be in the fic).


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]

Harmony, decent once it gets going. Plot winds up balanced between romance with actual adults (Harry is 22) and the end of Voldemort. Has the special distinction of being one of the few Harmony stories with very little character bashing and an awesome Ron.

** You can find a handful of fics if you search for stories involving Sanguini (the vampire from Slughorn's party) - and there are a surprising amount of them out there! Of these, there's two in particular that stood out to me: "sing me a lullaby of the blood rushing through your veins" by The Crownless Queen and "Blood and Honour" by salty-sarah. (This latter one is a crossover with /Let The Right One In/, if you're familiar with that novel/film, and I have to say it's fairly excellent.)

** There's always Sanguine. linkffn(11392098)

It's fem!Harry and hasn't been updated since 2016, but well worth the read.
