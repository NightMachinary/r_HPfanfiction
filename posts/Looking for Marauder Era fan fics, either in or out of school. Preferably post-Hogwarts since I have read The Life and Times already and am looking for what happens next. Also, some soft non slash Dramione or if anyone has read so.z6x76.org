#+TITLE: Looking for Marauder Era fan fics, either in or out of school. Preferably post-Hogwarts since I have read The Life and Times already and am looking for what happens next. Also, some soft non slash Dramione or if anyone has read something with a Luna ship that would nice too.

** I can recommend some Dramione for you, but I'm not sure if it will be "soft."

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3414902/1/Draco-Phoenix-Rising][Draco Phoenix Rising]]

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] is a must-read Dramione, imo.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The-Dragons-Bride][The Dragon's Bride]] is a favorite of mine.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2603288/1/The_Nietzsche_Classes][The Nietzsche Classes]]

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3667037/1/Gravity][Gravity]] is one I've read dozens of times.

** I would have submitted a LMGTFY link but I think it would require more than one.

Have you tried searching for any of this stuff on your own?

*** Yes, and I find it hard to shift through the garbage. I have been unable to sort by either highest relevance or rating. Maybe a push in the right direction for site that is easier to navigate than fanfiction.net?

** I can't help you right now, but .... this is what I'm writing for NaNoWriMo. I mean, First War will be in there, maybe about the second half of the whole thing. (And I've been laying the groundwork for this for years, so I really hope it won't be garbage, but obviously I'm not the one who gets to judge.) Because I agree, there isn't enough of it.

** "something with a Luna ship" is incredibly vague. If you really aren't any more particular than that, go to fanfiction.net and make Luna the primary character and set story genre to romance. Same for Hermione/Draco.

Fanfiction.net also lets you sort HP fics by era, so just pick "Marauders Era" or "First War Era" and get reading!

*** I couldn't find a search bar from my phone. Also, I like trying to get recommendations first. So far none of the 15 or so fics I have read featured a Luna ship. I don't require her as a main character just some more background and a romantic relationship.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=13][AkashaTheKitty]] is a great dramione writer.

You could also work your way down the [[http://dramione.org/toplists.php][Top Ten lists]] of dramione.org

The comments of [[http://akashathekitty.livejournal.com/196180.html][this LiveJournal post]] list a lot of good dramione fics worth checking out, as well.

*** Came here to recommend Dramione.org. Also, here's a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5414007/1/Absence-Makes-the-Heart-Grow-Fonder][lovely T-rated Luna fic featuring Snape]]. No, seriously.
