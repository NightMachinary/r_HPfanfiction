I just had this random idea all of sudden today and was wondering if there are any good fics out there about Harry transferring to a magical school in america, possibly after the events of 4th year or for some other reason. I dont care if Ron and Hermione go with him or not or if there is any bashing or not. I am looking for something with a pairing with an OC or something. Let me know if there is anything like this out there. Thanks.


** So, it's similar, but not exactly what you're after: linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356). Harry transfers to a school in the Pacific Islands after finding out he's been set up to enter the TriWizard. However, it's Harry/Hermione and manipulative Dumbledore. Although Dumbledore is a really minor character. Just his machinations set everything up.

*** I was disappointed that [[/spoiler][Dumbledore was killed off]] almost immediately.

Bobmin356 writes well, but I really hate the "funny" intros.

**** Agreed. I hate the intros, but like the stories. I actually downloaded the epubs and stripped the intros and closing notes using calibre. So much better.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

** Leave me alone, linkffn(3793722), has Harry running off to America after year 6, and finding new love there.

This story will piss off lots of people though.
