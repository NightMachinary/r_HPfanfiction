** As someone who reads on the phone I can tell that it makes absolutely no difference. If anything longfics with bigger chapters are better because you don't need a large supply of links

*** I know it makes no difference but if your in a car and it would be bouncy and shorter chapters make it easier to read while moving for some reason. I did word my post badly I guess I'm just asking for fics with short chapters.

** Reading on the phone is so much better than on the PC. Paragraphs get wrapped, and reading tall paragraphs is a lot easier than reading wide ones, at least for me.

** I pretty much exclusively read from my phone, unless I am sneaky reading in class on my laptop. Much easier. Also, a good idea is to make use of the recent tabs function on Chrome. You can open up Chrome on your phone, open recent tabs in your menu, and then directly open a tab that you have open on any other device with Chrome that you have logged into.

**** If you ever need to do that again, just open up all your phones tabs on your laptop, and then copy the links from your laptop into your GDoc. I've done that before, and I've found it much easier (this is coming from someone with a MacBook but a Pixel 2 phone)

*** The only time I ever read on my laptop is when I'm looking into recs on this sub, and then it's just long enough to see "do I actually want to read this?" If it passes that test, I give it a follow then go bring it up on the ff.net app on my phone.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** Whenever I want to read on my phone (which I do, every single day) and its a fic that I'm invested in, and longer than 30k words, I just download the fic as EPUB and transfer to my phone. I use a great and light app called FBReader, which has a bunch of configs from background colour and margin sizes to font sizes/type. And its free. I only ever read from any website when its the first chapter (to see if I like the story/grammar isn't horrible) or updates on stories which happens usually once every two days, with the amount of fics I follow and are ongoing.

** I use text to speech to listen to fanfics on the phone, while walking around or buying groceries. Getting used to the computer voice is a bit awkward at first, but I barely notice it anymore and can listen at pretty high speeds that way.

Maybe something like that is a viable option for you?
