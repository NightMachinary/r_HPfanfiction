Or headcanons for any characters?

Who gets together with who? What are certain characters jobs? What happened after the war, et cetra?

Some for me:

Susan Bones decides to become a Healer after Hogwarts.

Padma Patil becomes a Runes Master

Parvati Patil opens up a club for teenagers to hang out at.

Hermione doesn't become Minister of Magic, but she gets far with having creatures become equal, though she learns to accept that not all House-Elves want or desire to become free.

While Ron does work with George at the joke shop; he does help Harry out occasionally with any particular nasty case.

Charlie ends up meeting and marrying a Half-Blood Witch, and has a son.

Gabrielle often visits Fleur and the family; the Weasley's are often uncomfortable from the gifts that Gabrielle gives everyone, but still appreciates them.

Audrey is a Muggleborn who had moved to Britain after the war, she worked at the Ministry, but at a different time from Percy, it wasn't until her friends dragged her to a bar, and some co workers of Percy's dragged him to the same bar, that they had met.

After Colin died, Dennis ended up becoming obsessed with his camera, and started using it a lot

Teddy and Victoire had dated in secret for a year before James walked in on them. (Harry had betted that they'd get together, and won some money from Ron).

Just to name a few.

** Lavender and Pavarti were in a relationship which surprised everyone and yet no one. They had a hard time after the war because lavender, being obsessed with looks, was extremely insecure about being scratched and turned by fenrir greyback but after a long talk with bill weasley who could relate (not completely because he wasnt turned like she was but also had scars marring his face) grew up to realize that looks weren't everything and adopted triplet girls with parvati.

Percy Weasley bent the rules once in hogwarts and that was only for his late night snogging (almost shagging) sessions with Oliver wood. They later married and opened an orphanage for the children of the war. (Molly knits every single one of the children sweaters every year)

Hermione becomes an unspeakable which creates an even bigger rift between her and Ron. They ultamitly divorce on good terms after talking about it like civilized adults. None of their children hold it against them and Ron still meets her for brunch every Saturday.

Ron eventually marries padma and they officially open a small shop together that sells thing secondhand or at a lower price but still in pristine condition. Ron never wants anyone to feel like he did with too short robes and battered books.

When teddy is unconscious after falling down the stairs at Hogwarts his metamorphing stops and reveals his true looks with his father's sandy hair and his mother's original silver-grey eyes. Mcgonagall takes a picture and he crys when he sees it. (He kind of looks like a wolfstar baby but that's just the black genes ðŸ˜‰)

Neville becomes the head of hufflepuff house once sprout also retires from that position. In his opinion it was the proudest day of his life when he introduced the first year hufflepuffs for the first time.

Luna finally proves the existence of hundreds of 'made up' creatures. She often wonders if the ravenclaw bullies are still laughing.

Charlie Weasley is Pan and never settled down with anyone but he does meet up with hagrid and Newt scamander once a month to chat about creatures and they finally free up to 14 dragons from the underground of gringotts bank.

Susan bones becomes the minister for magic after following in her aunts footsteps and changes everything. After 30 years of re-elections she settles down happily having rid the government from as much corruption as possible. She marries Terry boot at 21 and they have 2 childeren.

After much hard work from the golden trio Regulus and Sirius Black both get the recognition they deserve and Regulus ever gets his own memorial in hogsmeade and an Order of Merlin 1st class.

The atrocious Narssisistic statue in the atrium of the ministry gets taken down and is replaced with a war memorial that is highly detailed and made of purple crystal. The names of every muggle, wizard, witch and creature casualty from both wars and the war with grindelwald are marked on it.

Fireworks are made illegal without the proper paperwork and precautions after too many accidents. PTSD is a real thing that effects almost everyone in the magical world. The colors and sounds look to much like spells.

George makes talismans and jewelry that blocks out triggers and candy that helps with trauma and nightmares. It saddens everyone that they sell out in the first day.

Neville pours his family fortune into the long term ward at st mungos and the medical research labs. After 12 years he is able to cure his parents.

** Rita Skeeter writes fake news articles for the Quibbler under a pen name. She was the one who came up with the Rotfang Conspiracy after some high-ranking auror pissed her off.

James Sirius Potter is very good at Potions, unlike his brother.

Hugo Weasley is a natural Legilimens, though Harry is the only one who even suspects it.

Charlie is gay, but Molly conveniently forgets about it and tries to set him up with a "nice witch" every time he visits.

After the war, Harry fought with the Ministry to clear Hagrid's name and return him his wand, and it was much harder that Harry anticipated. A couple of years after Hagrid got his wand back, he moved to France to Madame Maxime.

** Jimmy Peakes and Colin Creevey were together. Jimmy never really recovers from Colin's death, but he stays close to Dennis, who marries Gabrielle Delacour.

Later on in life, Harry and Ginny realize they fell in love with /images/ of each other. They only got married so quickly because the society was pressuring them. However, they choose to stay together for the sake of the children. Around that same time, Al "Don't call me Albus" changes his middle name to Rubeus, which also helps to heal the family. Harry finally realizes the difference between infatuation and love.

Hermione and Ron were also pressured to get married and have children after Harry and Ginny had James. It takes them a /long/ time to settle their differences, but by the time Rose and Hugo reach school, they're... /reasonably/ happy together. Hermione resents Molly, though, who was the person who did the most pressuring. Every so often, Ron and Hermione take a vacation, away from his family, to reaffirm their love for each other. She works as a legislator for a long time before becoming the Headmistress after the kids graduate from Hogwarts.

Ernie Macmillan is one of the youngest members of the Wizengamot. Justin Finch-Fletchley lives off his parents' wealth and joins the school's Board of Governors. Hannah and Neville help them both by feeding information they hear at the tavern and among the students.

** Given the postwar information, I can derive a much much darker interpretation of what they had become 20 years later (The DA could become the acronym for 'Dark Army').

I think their generation was completely fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

I don't think they would just become your average politicians, but ruthless revolutionaries who displayed almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who opposed them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some pain in the ass would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Skeeter'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his head first."

These people would eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

--------------

Since they made it to the top after 20 years, I guess the new story will be a mixture of "CSI", "Homeland", and "House of Cards". I thought about the "West Wing", but the politics in magical Britain were a lot dirtier and the struggles a lot deadlier. Probably JKR was probably right in not writing more, because there would be no way our heroes could avoid doing lots of nefarious things or 'necessary evil'. Politics and power struggles are inherently ugly, just following JKR on Twitter will give you an idea how much mud is being sling around, and she's not even fighting for control or engaged in personal life and death struggles.

** For the Next Generation

The Cursed Child does not exist.

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin:
#+end_quote

The son of Remus and Nymphadora, Teddy was raised by Andromeda, with Harry having an active role as godfather. He joins the Aurors, but he is more interested in what it means to fight for a cause than the actual battles.

#+begin_quote
  Rose Weasley:
#+end_quote

Sorted into Hufflepuff

I like to think that Rose has a special bond with Neville and Herbology is her favorite subject. She is somewhat distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry, while Rose despises government and bureaucracy in general. Rose has a habit of falling asleep in the library--though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. She goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries schoolbooks and storybooks around constantly. Her favorite stories are the Dr. Doolittle books by Hugo Lofting. She grows up to own a greenhouse and sells plants to potion makers.

#+begin_quote
  Hugo Weasley:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized--his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose scream, Hugo is also the one who reads to her when she's sick in the Hospital Wing.

#+begin_quote
  Fred II Weasley
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think he's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot.

#+begin_quote
  Roxanne Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

The smallest of the Weasleys, Roxanne makes observations. She sits still and watches and makes records--she got the idea from Hugo, who records everything that makes Rose scream--but decided to do it for everybody. She grows up to be a historian.

#+begin_quote
  Molly II Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

Molly, Percy's oldest daughter, is every bit a mother hen as her grandmother. She also favors some Muggle tools, taking after her mother. She wears glasses like her father.

#+begin_quote
  Lucky Weasley:
#+end_quote

I'm going to assume you meant Lucy. Percy's second daughter, I must confess I hadn't given any thought to until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][/The Noticing of Lucy Weasley/]]. So yeah, a girl who idolizes her daddy and acknowledges the importance of pencil pushers.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy:
#+end_quote

Scorpius Malfoy was sorted into Hufflepuff. He yearns to become a Healer. A quiet sort, he is utterly baffled by the antics of the Everyone Else. Being an only child and having no cousins close to his age, the way Albus and Rose and Lily can argue to the point of screaming one day and the next save one another favorite deserts is among the strangest thing he's ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  James Sirius Potter:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Given my inclination for Lucy, I find that James is not entirely unlike his grandfather, only with a far bigger ego. Delighted to be the son of heroes, James has a highly inflated sense of self. While popular among his classmates, he alienated himself from many of his cousins. To give him much needed discipline, Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. Without his wand. The months away are deeply transformative, after James sees one of his cousins take on a gang of bullies despite being outnumbered four to one.

** James Sirius Potter (2004) is in Slytherin. He's partially neglected by his parents, and as a result he's extremely close to Teddy and Andromeda. He tries to do everything that's expected of him but his parents never acknowledge it. His Hogwarts class is the biggest one in recent history because everyone started having children after hearing Ginny Potter was pregnant.

Albus Severus Potter (2005) is in Gryffindor. After learning the truth about Snape, and some about Dumbledore, too, he grows to resent Harry. He absolutely hates his name and wouldn't saddle it on anyone. He also wants nothing to do with Scorpius Malfoy, who's a stuck-up snob in Al's opinion (but actually he's jealous that Scorpius is close to Rose).

Lily Luna Potter (2007) is a romantic as a child, but then she realizes her parents' marriage is a sham. She has a lot of insecurities when she starts dating because she's not sure she can distinguish between infatuation and love. She's in Ravenclaw.

Susan Bones works in the bookshop. She's married to Ernie Macmillan.

Harry discovers that he has some distant cousins through Marius Black. One of these cousins married Penelope Clearwater and they have children around James' age/a little older.

Ron and Hermione have an amicable divorce once Hugo starts at Hogwarts.

Neville and Hannah have children closer in age to Lorcan and Lysander. They're all a few years younger than Lily.

Zacharias Smith has an "oops" baby with Romilda Vane. He walks out on them, but the baby forces Romilda to grow up in ways she never expected. She ends up marrying Dean Thomas later on.

All three of Bill and Fleur's children have blond hair, but Louis doesn't get actual Veela traits. He's best friends with Fred 2, who's the same age as him. They're a year younger than Al and Rose.
