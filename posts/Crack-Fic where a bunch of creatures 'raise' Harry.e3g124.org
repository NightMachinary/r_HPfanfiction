:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! So, I can't remember if this one is real, but...\\
Harry lives on Privet Drive with his Aunt and Uncle, but they lock him out one night (A full moon), and a Werewolf takes pity on him, wraps himself around Harry and they fall asleep together. Said Werewolf has a wife who gives Petunia a heart attack.

Later on, more werewolves come to Privet Drive, and then a hag opening a Bed & Breakfast, then a Vampire, then Lucifer (Kind of), and a Lich. There's plenty more, but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Does this ring any bells for anyone? Or was it just a weird fever dream?

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
