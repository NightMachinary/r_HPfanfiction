Hello!

I am hoping to publish later today (Friday 13th March) my first ever piece of online-platform fanfiction. It is something I have worked on for a while and I want to put it in the right forum for feedback. It is 15-20K range and the first part of a longer story that I anticipate will be 100K-120K on completion. The content is primarily OC and does not really tick many 'typical' boxes of fanficiton; pairings of characters aren't a major element and it is not being used as an AU exploration. It is, in a sense, quite experimental and I'm not sure what the responses to it will be like.

I would like to reach a diverse audience within the established fanfiction community whilst keeping the formatting presentable. Which sites or platforms would you recommend for this kind of fiction? There is FF.net and MuggleNet obviously but should I avoid these for any particular reason?

Thanks!


** Most people I know use ff.net most of the time. It's hard to get noticed in the sea of fanfic, but if you post a link here, you'll get some traction. I'm interested enough at least.

You might want to post your 15k words in a few separate chapters, especially if you're going to be posting the rest of your fic in smaller bits.

*** Yeah, consistency is important. Get people used to long chapters and small ones seem disappointing; get people used to small chapters and long ones seem intimidating.

** If your story has multiple chapters for the 15-20K, maybe try putting it out one chapter at a time on ffnet. Like have a schedule that you release a new chapter every Friday. That way it'll appear in the recent stories more often than if you upload it all at once. A story like that could easily get lost, especially since it's OC heavy and people won't be looking for it when they use search filters.

*** Thanks. There are a few filters I am apprehensive about using. For example, much of the story is 1970s and 1980s-set and the Marauders do appear - but not for a while, and they are not the main focus. I do not wish to alienate Marauders fans or anyone who might feel they have been suckered in by a deceptive tag.

**** Do not list any main canon characters then, just use *OC*.\\
If you list any /canon/ character people will expect them to be the lead and will punish you with reviews or PMs if they find this is not the case.\\
And please put in the summary that the story is driven by OCs as well so people looking for Jilly or Marauder slash won't be disappointed.
