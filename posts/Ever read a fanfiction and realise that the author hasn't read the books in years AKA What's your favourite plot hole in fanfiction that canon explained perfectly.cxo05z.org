  “I told you, Harry... I told you. If there's one thing I hate more than any other, it's a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt them, Harry...” Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. “Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all... you.”

  “You didn't... it---it can't be you...”

  “Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? I did.”

  Moody's magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.

Ron never said anything.

*** RON: I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

HARRY: Caught on, have you? Took you long enough.

RON: I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.

HARRY: Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.

RON: Least I warned you about the dragons.

HARRY: Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

RON: No, no, no, I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know, after you'd figured that out.

HARRY: Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental

*** It's one of those things that made me pause and go "yeah that is actually fucked up, it's weird Harry never mentioned it". Then I remembered the reason why is because that's not what happened.

** Not so much plot holes but things that only happened only in the movie, like the Mudblood scar on Hermione's arm being a big deal, especially when traveling back in time.

  Ron stayed and Harry never really forgave him after 4th year because he knew about the dragons and didn't tell him.
#+end_quote

I thought that was supposed to be taken as an AU element, not a plothole. Like how in some fics Hermione doesn't believe Harry didn't put his name in the Goblet and he stops talking to her and Ron.

*** It was in the middle of a list of all his flaws, I think it's rare that you'd change one small thing like that. In fact it only really words if the point of diversion is after the first task, not a year later.

Also normally AU's list the differences like that.

** A lot of “plot holes” aren't really plot holes if you know canon well enough
