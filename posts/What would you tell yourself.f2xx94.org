Readers and Writers both. If you could send yourself (when you first got involved with the fanfiction end of fandom things) a message, what would it be?

Other than "Run. For God's Sake, Run!", anyway. :D

** 1. Keep writing, no matter how hard it gets. You will always regret the fics you didn't finish. Besides, giving up writing doesn't make life any less shitty; quite the opposite, in fact. (Somewhat related: for god's sake, run screaming from that business partnership. It will destroy things you didn't even know could be destroyed.)

2. Don't drift away from that one fandom friend. She was amazing and brilliant and one of the best people you've ever met.

3. Keep leaving comments, even when people ridicule you for going overboard. It's one of the things you're good at, and comment culture will need all the help it can get once the kudos button appears on the scene.

4. Don't beta for anyone until you've learned to be a lot more diplomatic.

** I would tell me that people really didn't want to read what I was writing and that I was a worse writer than I thought and that I needed a beta reader and that I would have been better spending all that time on original fiction and that fanfiction would make me horribly miserable for a long time and leave me hating everything about it. But I probably wouldn't have listened.

** "Send [[/u/rpeh]] a message and tell him future you is making him edit your earlier shit. Sure, Letters and Princess aren't salvagable but just wait until the two of you work on VP. Maybe this time you'll actually trust him enough to leave out the scene where Titus fucks a schoolgirl. Also I know he talks about Soccer too much but you'll end up enjoying it. Wait a minute why would I go back in time and talk to me about fanfiction? That's worthless....So let's do something more worthwhile, Leicester city will win the 2016 premier league title, bet heavily. The Brewers will make it to game seven of a NLCS. Enjoy game six while you're there with your friend because the next summer will destroy you. Red Bull will dominate until Mercedes dominates.

**** A lot of people seem to have a problem with the Alternate Epilogue, which is odd because a) it's called the *Alternate* Epilogue, and b) there's a lengthy AN explaining that it's not part of the main story. Plus, Daphne had set that alternate ending up earlier in the story and Fleur had acknowledged that the plan had a good chance of working, so I don't see why it's a huge surprise. I remember when I first read the story that I went through both endings, decided I preferred the original and just moved on.

But the problems with Letters go much deeper. We can start with the title, which is relevant at the start but completely irrelevant by about chapter 8, although with a neat little twist in the Christmas Bonus.

Then there's the brave attempt to shoe-horn Muggle car manufacturers into the story as broom makers. I'll call that "strained" at best.

Then there's the fact that a 17yo girl shags a 14yo boy pretty much in response to a threat from another 14yo girl. Fleur's thinking at that point can be summarised as "I'd better fuck this kid now because if I don't, Daphne will be fucking him in a few months and I want to win". And that's rather disturbing stuff.

And that's just the stuff off the top of my head.

Personally I think Letters is a decent piece of writing and most other authors would be proud to have it on their profiles. But as TE7's later stories show, he's capable of much better work than this.

That is in absolutely no way going to stop me recommending it and linking to it from here whenever possible because I know it winds him up.

***** Imagine your watching a sport competition with your favourite team. They win the tournament and your happy with the whole experience. Then they announce an "alternative match" which ends with the rival winning. Once you've seen it, you can no longer unsee it.

That's what the alternative epilogue feels like. Or if you want a different explanation, imagine Rowling introduced an alternative epilogue where Harry married Hermione. Now imagine how the canon pairing crowd would feel about that.

****** Well a comparison with Real Life doesn't make sense. Even more so because Liverpool show no signs of losing to anyone no matter how many times they play. Just kidding. Not done yet.

The comparison to Rowling is better but also fails because she came out and said that she'd basically decided to have Harry and Hermione get together and only went with Ron because of a misplaced loyalty to her original draft. When I heard that I didn't feel like the whole story was invalidated.

The Alternative Epilogue describes itself as an omake; the author note says that the original plan was for it to be a whole separate story. For people to see all that and still claim it spoils things makes no sense to me.

******* The alternate epilogue is only an issue to people who are more interested in who's boning who and the pairing of the story than the actual story.

It's actually the best part of Letters, because it taught me that people don't give a flying fuck what I write, they have no interest in helping me grow as a writer. The only people who are annoyed by it are ones who aren't paying attention and whine about ships.

It's what jaded me toward writing fanfiction in general. While working on Letters I wanted to write something people liked. After Letters I wanted to write something that I could look back on and not want to vomit.

VP, in a way, turned into the Anti-Letters. By that point I had the benefit of knowing exactly what every comment would be, which made it less annoying.

It was the end of Letters that transformed 'maybe I was too subtle with this and people missed it' mentality into 'my god people read the damn text'.

If I had a dollar for the amount of times people have commented that Emily couldn't have been raped as a kid because she told Harry she lost her virginity at sixteen I'd....probably buy another bottle of booze. It's almost as if Emily isn't telling him the truth. She conveniently points out that when she was his age she had sex with someone who was her age. Gee I wonder what that'll make a teenage boy think about.....

I need a drink.

** ‚ÄúYou know all those stories that start out with an intriguing plot, which comes to a shrieking halt when the two unlikely love interests get together? Just give up on those as soon as you get a whiff of romance. The plot will never come back. The characters will just spend the next fifty chapters gazing lovingly into each other's gemstone-colored eyes.‚Äù

I'm working on a story that hopefully breaks this mold, but I've mostly given up on reading anything with romance because too many are like this.
