** Non-AU is a pretty wide category, especially since some people use AU to mean anything at all not canon divergent. Can you give some more guidelines on what you're looking for, w/r/t length, genre, ships, time period, etc?

*** Thank you for responding. I am actually not searching for anything in particular... no main character or pairing or era. I was just curious what is in people's opinion one of the better non-AU fics (even if they no longer comply with the actual canon but were complying at the time of the writing). The reason for which I was asking this is because I mostly see nowadays stories about evil/power/female/Slytherin/sassy Harry, what ifs, weird pairings that would have never worked in the original universe, etc. but all I would like to read is something that remains faithful to the main canon.

**** Since you're not looking for anything in particular, I'll just throw out a hodgepodge of fics I like. All are canon-compliant, to the best of my knowledge, and most are gen.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]] - Trio-centric, set 11 years after the war, short and sweet, 3878 words

Also, I'm totally with you on mostly wanting stuff that's faithful (or at least respectful) to canon, so if you've got any personal favorites, I'd love to hear them!

Are you still interested in canon compliant works? I also tend to only read canon compliant.

******* [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]]: Minor Dumbledore/Grindelwald. The story from Kendra's death to Ariana's death. Plays with canon a bit, but is still very much canon compliant-even works surprisingly well with Fantastic Beasts.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]: Slytherin (OCs) group of friends during the series. It's part of a series (Anguis), but this one is primarily to set up the characters-oneshot style, the later ones are full novels.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]]: Ginny's perspective on Half Blood Prince.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12330043/1/Tell-Brave-Deeds-of-War][Tell Brave Deeds of War]]: Terry Boot, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein during Deathly Hallows (at Hogwarts).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]]: Professor Binns' backstory. It's unexpectedly amazing.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Minds Eye, Souls Reflection]]: Luna's perspective of Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]: Neville in the summer before Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: Sequel series to Anguis, but not necessary to read Anguis. Next-gen story with Scorpius, Albus and Rose.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662%22][Muggle Studies]]: Comedy series. During Harry's kids time, about a Muggle Studies teacher and his (hilarious) experience trying to teach wizards/witches Muggle Studies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]]: Scorpius/Albus, it's a very sweet and funny story (post-cursed child) that has excellent interactions between Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny. The slash is minor and it has sequels.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]: Set long after the epilogue, a Harry, Ron and Hermione adventure when they're much older.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][Scarlet Pimpernal]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4007457/1/The-Sleeper-Awakes][The Sleeper Awakes]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]]: Ron/Hermione post-war. A bit angsty, but it's my favourite of this type.

Oneshots:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard]]: Absolutely hilarious. Harry at Ron and Hermione's wedding-hiding in a cupboard. The author has a lot of great oneshots/oneshot series but this one is my favourite.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4008738/1/Red-Ink-Remains][Red Ink Remains]]: Author also wrote Cauterize (and many other great oneshots), but this one is my favourite-conveys so much in so little words.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12998948/1/The-Curious-Case-of-the-Kitchen-Scissors][The Curious Case of the Kitchen Scissors]]: Harry's regrowing hair.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts You Won't Find in "Hogwarts, A History"]]: Five oneshots during the series-very funny and sweet

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5578897/1/Lest-We-Forget][Lest We Forget]]: George talking to his mother many years post-series.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This focuses on the other characters view of the war. It sticks to everything in cannon, but it features Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey perspectives during the Deathly Hallows. It is absolutely my favorite take on the concept.

** I remember enjoying "A Life in the Darkness" by PrincessO'Rourke on fanfiction.net. I can't remember how well it was written, but i think it sticks to canon then goes off in it's own direction. It follows the Weasleys.

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. The war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge to prepare themselves for a war of the ages. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry and Sirius family fic. HBP Semi-canon compliant.
