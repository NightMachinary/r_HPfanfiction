  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Who the devil is Charles Potter? I recall a helpful, powerful grandfather Charles Potter in linkffn(Harry Potter and a grandfather's gift), but that doesn't seem to quite fit your request. Was there /another/ pre-Fleamont fic with an OC grandfather called Charles Potter? /Really?/
