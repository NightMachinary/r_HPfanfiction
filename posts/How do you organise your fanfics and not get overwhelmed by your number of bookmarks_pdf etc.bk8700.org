I've been having a lot of tabs open on my computer, my phone, too many saved epub files on ibooks, lots of things bookmarked on both of my accounts on ao3 and fanfiction.net

I have no clue what to do. I just read and then check out that authors other fics and all their bookmarks and then I just hoard more and more.

How do you guys deal? Please send help.


** I keep a list of fanfiction on a google sheet, writing down name, author, date I'm writing it down and the date I finish reading/decide to abandon it, number of chapters, status (ongoing, complete, abandoned, dead...), fandom and crossovers, some tags, pairings, a link to it. A few months ago I also started putting a small 'review' to each one, just a couple sentences to remember what it was about or what I did or did not like about it.

​

I've got written down more than 1800 fanfics. I'm thinking of revamping the tag system with specialized ones for each fandom, though I'll have to set aside a couple days to do that.

*** I also use Calibre and FanFicFare, then sort them into categories that become folders when I import stories to my ereader. So I have folders for different fandoms/genres on my ereader. I keep an analog reading list in my bullet journal, just something basic with the title and few keywords (I actually have two, one for fanfiction and one for published books).

** If there's a story I'm interested in on FFN, I follow it on the site, since there's a section for that. You can add completed stories, so it's perfect for 'i haven't read this yet but want to.'

If it's one I've already read and liked, I add it as a fav, and every few months I'll download them using an ebook converter. I check the author's pages right quick first to see if they have a note against it (I know of a few that do but it's uncommon). If it's on AO3 I just download since it's a native part of the site. After that no real organisation.

** I down load the stories, and than create a word document that has several categories and list them along with their summary. So example, I have two Category pages for HP, one is sorted by character and the second is sorted by theme (azkaban, tri -wizard ect). I do this for several fanfics I like, Naruto, Gundam Wing, Crime Shows, Games. When I want to look for something, I can usually remember either the main character or the theme and can find the fic that way.

It's a long list, sorted by date of the last update. For example:

190401 HP c21 blablabal

190412 ncis c3 blablabla

190503 skyfall c14 blablabla

I'm pretty good at remembering the story by the title. And if the title doesn't trigger my memory, I just take a quick look at the first chapter.

** Whenever I come across a fanfic I like and/or might want to read later and/or want to check back in on if it ever updates and/or want to remember for some other reason, I add it to my Chrome bookmarks in the "Fanfiction" directory. Any threads in this subreddit that might have some good recommendations go in there as well.

It's a completely unorganized mess, and I can rarely ever find anything.

** I second google sheets. I keep it for everything that I have already read. One google sheet, divided into separate pages for each fandom. Each page has a series of headers that I fill out for each fic (I mark each story's title, author, word count, url, where I found the story, if it has a happy ending, pairings, summary, how much I liked it, if I downloaded it, if it is in a series, and how many times I've read it). I also have the sheet set up to calculate how many words I have read in each fandom, just to give me an idea how much time I spend with each. I never considered adding the dates I read a story to mine, and that is an awesome idea to help job memories. I might need to start doing that!

​

So google sheets for things I have already finished. For my huge backlog of stories I want to read, I just bookmark them in a single folder for "Reading to Pursue". That folder is divided into subfolders for each fandom, and I don't worry about marking them past that. I figure that if I bothered to bookmark a story, that means I wanted to read it, so it's okay if I don't remember exactly which is which. I worry about that for stuff I have already read (hence the google sheets), but for stuff I want to read, a lot of times I just start the next story on the list. Honestly, it never takes me more than a couple of minutes to pick my next story, so I don't worry about it. I do sometimes get in the mood for one fandom, hence the subfolders. I also will bookmark links to things I've downloaded, just so I know they are on the list in case I pick one. When I finish a story, I delete the link in the bookmarks folder and add it to the google sheets, that way I can keep track easily of what I've finished.

** For fics I downloaded I have a folder just for fanfiction.

In that folder I have folders for each fandom. If there's more then one ship I have folders for that. If you have a PC it allows you to group by type, which is what I do. If I have a fandom I'll read sporadically I have a miscellaneous folder. I also have one for fics that are finished/author deleted them.

** If I find a fic interesting but not enough to finish it immediately, I leave it in an open tab. Eventually, I'll get back to it, or close the tab if I lose interest.

But usually, I don't lose interest in the middle -- it usually only happens if the reason I started reading it is done with (for example: I lost interest in linkffn(Marauders of the Mind) after they eventually got physical bodies, because at that point the reason I got interested in the story was no longer relevant), and the unfinished stuff is something I wasn't interested in.

If a fic is unfinished, but I'm not "done" with it, and it's actively updated, I follow it by a "sort by last updated" filtered FFN/Ao3 list I refresh once a day or so. With the narrow interest I have, this is a simple task. In the rare case where I am actively following an unfinished fic outside my main interest, I leave it in a tab, similar to fics I've simply not finished reading.

** For fics that I find interesting and might want to read later I simply bookmark them in my browser and sort those bookmarks into folders by fandom.

For keeping track of what I've read already, I use the favorites button on ffn and the equivalent offered by other sites.

People who keeps dozen or tabs open in their browser at all times just confound me. You're probably not an AI capable of that level of multitasking, so if you're not likely to use a particular tab any time in the next hour its probably a better idea to just bookmark that particular webpage so you can close the tab and save your RAM the trouble of keeping it open for no reason.

** I have on my bookmark bar to start with a fanfic folder, in that i have 4 sub folders Unfinished Unupdated, Done, Fave author, and Ble,

the "Fanfic" folder also holds any fic I want to start reading, holds bookmarks to the latest chapter of any fic i read that i got to the end of and it was unfinished but was updater recency enough to be still alive, and any fic I stopped in the middle of but still want to read

Unfinished Unupdated holds any fic that are Unfinished and Unupdated bookmarked at the chapter it ended it at time of bookmark

Fave author is used mainly for people with a ton of oneshots to save on bookmarks and isnt really a fave author folder

Done are ones that i finished

Ble are ones i quit cause they are bad (which i need to keep cause what if i want to rec them cause they fit that perfect niche)(and im neurotic)

​

Unfinished Unupdated and Done both have a subsub folder that are simply "fave" (self explanatory)

Ble has a sub folder "Ble" which is for fics that I dont want people to see and its not really a indicator of quality

​

While that sounds like a lot in practice it just means i use "fanfic" as a queue, when i finish a fic it goes in "Done" or "Done,Fave" and if i get to the newest chapter and its dead it goes in Unfinished Unupdated which I skim sometimes to see if something alive again so it can go back in fanfic. and when I want to reread a fic its almost always in "Done,Fave"

works pretty well, thoughts? too much?

Any fic that I give the highest rating to I download an epub of it and put the file in the note.
