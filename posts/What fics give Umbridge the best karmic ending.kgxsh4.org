** There's a fic called Raised Differently. Umbridge gets eaten by the basilisk in the final battle. Another one is called Harry Potter and the Life Changing Head Injury. It's unfinished. In this fic, he turns Umbridge into a toad and then kills her by using a spell to make her explode, leaving nothing but toad guts. The Lightning Lord has Harry using mind magic on Umbridge to make her incriminate herself every time she tried, keyword TRIED, to implicate Harry for a crime that she committed. I think she either gets sent to Azkaban for life or she got sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss. Gryffindors Never Die has Harry use the Killing Curse on Umbridge, claiming that he always wanted to do that, and he does not get in trouble for it. There's another fic I read that I can't remember the name of where in the epilogue she escapes from Azkaban but ends up drowning to death in the water because she can't swim. The fanfic Supreme Champion has Umbridge die when a dragon throws up on her, which kills her and burns her to death because of it being super hot. Everyone in the Ministry that she had blackmailed threw a party after her death.

  Ha! That's funny. In canon Nagini-though she is not a basilisk-should have eaten Umbridge.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
