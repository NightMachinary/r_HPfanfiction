So I'm not sure how many of you have read the series by Derek Landy, however fellow fans know that Book 10: Skulduggery Pleasant: Resurrection is out tomorrow. /I am. So. Goddamn. Excited/

There are things that the first 9 books did that the Potter series couldn't do...for me personally...I was wondering for those who have read them, what do you feel about them in comparison to the Potter books.

The Magic in the S.P universe Vs the Magic within the Potter universe.

The characters.

The world.

The antagonists.

The humour.

*Also remember spoilers just in case anyone reads how amazing the books are from the comments and decides to start reading them*


** OH MY GOD THIS IS THE FIRST MENTION I'VE EVER SEEN OF THIS SERIES ON THE SUBREDDIT AND OH BOY OH BOY

I didn't even know a new Skulduggery was coming out! I think I've read all the others though and oh boy I'm gonna get all hyped /right the fuck now!/

Honestly though, I think the SP series is a far better read than HP, particularly through Landy's humour. Rowling had the difficulty - as it's often been discussed on the subreddit - of transitioning a series for preteens into young adulthood, and I think the struggle with adapting darker themes and more nuanced character arcs shows in her work, particularly once you start trying to dissect characters' actions retrospectively (the whole Philosopher's Stone fiasco, for example, and how the traps should've been way more difficult, etcetera).

Landy's work, on the other hand, has always felt familiar - from the first book until the most recent, even with the massive plot developments and increasing amount of weight behind the narrative book-to-book, like the series as a whole was far more sure of its identity from the get-go than HP.

The humour, as I've said, makes Landy's work entertaining in a way I've not experienced before or really since. It has such a good balance of quips, lightning-fast dialogue and more obscure abstract humour (like the dreaded canary car!) and he does a fantastic job of interspersing levity into moments of seriousness - like Skulduggery's banter with Serpine in the first book. Absolute gold!

The SP series did a fantastic job with the worldbuilding, from the different depictions of commonly-known creatures to more original concepts - Doctor Nye, anyone? - and his characters' identities have always felt more special and distinctive than Rowling's, but at the same time the supporting cast is considerably less relatable than Skulduggery and Stephanie. Look at Mr. Bliss, whose identity is built around his power and who stands so separate from the reader's perspective he's both immediately unique to the universe yet at the same time a total mystery.

In HP, the characters are almost entirely human (except having magic, of course), and even the nonhuman ones - Lupin, Fleur, etc. - are more human than creature anyway. It makes them perhaps (to me) more real than the characters in SP, and much more relatable in terms of understanding them, their motivations and their place in the world of HP, but Landy's characters /benefit/ from their distinctness.

Narratively I'd say the two series are definitely tied - HP will always hold a special place in my heart, after all - but I really enjoy the way Landy worked his smaller villains into the larger narrative that spans the series, whereas in HP it's very much centred around Voldemort, and when it's not (like Chamber of Secrets) it feels very disconnected from the wider story arc.

But down to the meat of it - the magic - I'd say they're too different to compare easily. This is a cop out, I know, but that said, both of them have great positives and negatives. In HP, magic is poorly-defined, and left open to the reader's imagination a lot of the time - hence the fanon ideas about 'Magical Cores' and some such nonsense, because Rowling left so much of the system vague. I think it works in HP's favour, as it's not really /about/ the magic, deep down. Instead, HP is about /humanity,/ life, love and death.

In SP, however, there's a lot more about the magic and the 'fantasy' aspects of its storyline, and the massive story arc of the nine released books. The whole stuff about Elementals, Necromancers and Adepts (and everyone in between!) was eye-opening to me as a teenager, and Landy built lots of clear rules and descriptions into his systems of magic so as to make it all cohesive and natural, and then illustrate what happens when the really powerful characters show up.

And you can't deny, /Skulduggery's got style./

I love both of these series, and it's so refreshing to see it mentioned here - Dresden Files and some others get asked about a lot for crossovers, but honestly I'd expected more mentions of the ol' Skulduggery in the seven-odd months I've been knocking around here. Have an updoot!

*** There's a single line from *Kingdome of the Wicked* that describes the humour of the whole series, it's a last line of a fight scene as well.

*He looked around, and that's when [[/spoiler][Darquesse]] hit him with a horse.*

** The original hardcovers. There are new alternatives out now which look more like character movie posters. Still pretty cool [[http://imgur.com/zzcZL3t]]

*** Stephanie Edgeley seems to be like a normal 12 year old girl, however, when her favourite uncle dies and then she is attacked, a world opens up to her, a (slightly) hidden world were magic, mythical creatures, and even gods exist.

Her tour guide and partner in this world, Skulduggery Pleasant, a detective war verteran with a bloody history.

Stephanie and Skulduggery fight to save the world in each of the books, from magic weilding psychopaths, to religious nuts who want the world to end, teens who suddenly get supercharged magical powers and enemies from a very old war.

You will like the antagonists just as much as the protagonists.

Very descriptive, 'violence-is-most-likely-the-answer' attitude towards the bad guys and it's really funny.

/New book has arrived, see you in about 4hrs/

*** I can try, but there's a lot of details I don't want to spoil, and I'm not particularly good at summarising stuff like this.

The series is centred around Stephanie Edgely and her adventures with a several-century-year-old Detective called Skulduggery Pleasant, who also happens to be a living skeleton, somehow held together by magic, to the point that no one actually understands how. Together, along with some friends/acquaintances/people-who-haven't-yet-betrayed-them-but-probably-will, the duo solve mysteries, initially centred around supporters of the defeated wizard warlord Mevolent four centuries before, who sought to return the /Faceless Ones,/ evil, godlike beings that are in extra-dimensional banishment, to the world. As the books progress, the plot becomes much more complicated and interconnected, and slowly builds towards a titanic struggle to prevent the rise of the /Death Bringer,/ a person prophesied to bring about Armageddon.

Along the way, Stephanie discovers her heritage as a magic-user, and Skulduggery - an Elemental wizard, someone who (you guessed it), manipulates the elements: Earth, Fire, Water and Air - helps her train her new powers, among other characters. In each book the magical world is given increasingly more depth, but always in accessible sizes, rather than any kind of infodumps or massive amounts of exposition.

There's plenty of betrayals, double, triple and quadruple-crosses, ravenous magical creatures, mysterious beings, evil plots, laughs and /lots and lots of punching./

I would heartily recommend the series to anyone, it's just fantastic.

** I liked the first couple but it got so far out there that I was a bit put off. I might have kept going if they didn't change the narrator of the audio books but eh. /shrug/ It gets super weird.
