I've been thinking a lot about this, especially with all of the 'prompts' posted on this sub. This community is certainly among the more hardcore of the Harry Potter fandom, given how we spend hours and hours of our lives writing/reading fanfiction about the series. But this whole idea of 'subverting tropes' is something I keep thinking about, and see popping up quite often among writers/readers of HP fanfics.

First, what I mean by the term - when I say subverting tropes, I mean that the underlying premise of a piece of work being the refutation of a standard or stereotypical idea frequently found in fanfiction. Something like stupid!Harry being a subversion of the indy!Harry trope, or hero!Ron as the subversion of all the Ron bashing (and its mirror image, the dumb!Hermione subverting the trope of making her a Mary Sue). IceCream!Daphne, etc etc. That's, what, a half-dozen of 30-40 tropes we could all list.

The reason behind the title of this post, though, is that 95% of the prompts I see aren't prompts at all; they're just individual scenes subverting tropes that the poster is irritated by. That's not to say that there are *never* real, actual story prompts; certainly some people take the time to write up an idea they'd like someone to grab and run with. But in this sub, overwhelmingly most prompts are in actuality more like 'inside jokes' mocking tropes that many stories frequently utilize. It's about judging the work that the poster doesn't approve of, or attempting to draw attention to conventions they feel are overused or stupid.

It's come to the point now where there are some - granted, very, very few, but some nonetheless - writers that are actively publishing stories that are nothing more than subverting tropes. They simply take cliches, reverse them, wrap it up in a bow, and then publish. It's meant to be satirical, and it is, just in an extremely lazy way.

The point to all of this isn't to say 'stop posting stupid non-prompts', or 'don't subvert tropes', because it doesn't really matter. Everyone's free to write what they want.

No, the only actual takeaway from all of this is that I'd really like a category for *actual*story prompts, the ones that people are seriously interested in seeing written, the ones that a person has thought about and is dying to see put into action, and then a separate category for all the 'yuk-yuk aren't I clever' type of posts. I think that doing so would really improve the community, and put an end to the quarterly "Can Mods Do Something About Prompts" debate that we seem to have here.


** What you're describing sounds to me like inversion rather than subversion. Subverting a trope, per [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope][TVTropes definitions]], means that the story /looks/ like it's setting up to play the trope out normally, but then it pulls the rug out and does things differently.

Eg the subversion of indy!Harry wouldn't be stupid!Harry, it would be something like, Harry gets named a "friend of the goblin nation" and then eventually discovers that that's a euphemism for /an easy mark/, who will meekly accept bogus fees and charges on the assumption that they're discounted from what other customers are paying.

But you seem to be describing inversion, where someone writes the opposite of a trope. Or possibly deconstruction, where an author shows how something that looks like the trope would actually have a lot of problems under the surface.

** I mean, I don't really mind them myself - some 'yuk-yuk' prompts are great, some 'actual' prompts are awful - but I don't think setting a 'shitpost' category would really help.

As a starting point, subverting tropes is just a literary tool, nothing more, nothing less. It isn't bad in and of itself, but it can be used well or used in ways that need more work. Published authors even use that for their works. So, for a start, the definition of 'actual story prompt' is going to vary between people and what people would want to see from a 'prompt collection post' or 'new prompt flair' would vary considerably as well.

Thus, you'd have to specifically set out what 'criteria' a 'proper-prompt' post and a 'shitpost-prompt' post would have to meet, and therein lies the rub. People already misuse the flairs and the definitions of what they each mean are literally written right above where you select them. Adding more flairs or more definitions won't fix that.

Secondly, this is a nearly twenty-five year old fandom. There really isn't all that much originality left to cover. Prompts are generally either going to be rare or referential due to that. That's how most of the works we have got written - someone saw an idea, liked it, got inspired, and wrote their own version.

** To be frank subverting an idea or trope in and out itself has no inherent good or bad value. execution is all that matters.
