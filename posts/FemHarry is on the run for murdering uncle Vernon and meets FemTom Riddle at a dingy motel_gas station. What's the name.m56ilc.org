I accidentally deleted my bookmark folder in a sleep deprived state and I can't find this specific fic.

Basically, Fem!Harry killed uncle Vernon in an altercation and runs away. She stops at a decrepit gas station/motel to buy some things and to change her appearance a bit. There, she meets Fem!Tom Riddle who just quitted her job at a well known company, searching for a new purpose in life. They are attracted to each other and decide to travel together.

It was a beautiful written oneshot and published on AO3. I searched under the Fem!Harry/Fem!Tom Riddle tag and running short plot summaries through Google got me nothing.
