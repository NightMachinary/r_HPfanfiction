Would Horcruxes have a maximum range? Say, could you send Voldemort into space, and he'd be mortal in space because he's out of range of his tether.

Would Voldemort have a concept of Death whilst he has Horcruxes? Would Shiki Ryougi see no Lines if she met Voldemort instead of Harry in book 4, or would she see 7 (1 for each Horcrux, cut one, the corresponding Horcrux stops being linked)

What if Voldemort was affected by Shiki Fujin? Orochimaru had Horcruxes (of a sort, he died several times and came back) but how would that affect him.

What if Voldemort was pushed through the veil. Would he die and his soul be trapped on the other side, would his wraith form floato back through and it was just destroying his body?

Would Horcruxes be destroyed by things like Water Pressure. Say Voldemort tossed one of his Horcruxes to the bottom of the Ocean when he knew Harry was searching (he got to 1 first) would the pressure of being that far below the sea cause the Horcrux to be destroyed, or would he become True Immortal because no one could get at it.

Any others you have.

Probably, since the whole concept of Horcruxes relates to death.

I think his body would go through but not his soul.

#+end_quote

As per /Secrets of the Darkest Art/, smart wizards put powerful protections on their Horcux to protect them from harm, so I highly doubt something merely physical like water pressure would have a chance.

Frankly, there are only two ways for a Horcrux to be destroyed. The first is to use a magical means that the Horcrux isn't protected against (see Fiendfyre and basilisk venom against Voldemort's Horcruxes) or remorse of the maker.

Shiki Ruougi sees lines of death or something like that. If she cuts them, the thing she cuts dies, end of story. Everything has those lines, even abstract things like fate. It's entirely possible that she can make you not do something by killing any future where you do do that thing. It's AK on sterroids.

So yes, that would definitely kill Voldemort.

As for the Shiki Fujin (from Naruto), it basically calls down Death itself (in the form of the Japanese Shinigami). Basically, Death reaches through your soul, grabs your victim's soul, traps it inside your soul, and then it eats your soul. Basically, if you want to make sure something is so dead that it could never be revived, and you're willing to suffer an eternity being digested in Death's stomach and to serve as the prison for your victim for that chance, you use the Shiki Fujin.

** I have this head canon or theory:

Horcruxes weaken one's soul, the more Horcruxes, the more vulnerable the main soul became.

There were extremely dark, soul destroying rituals out there that required horrifying sacrifices to work, for example murdering 7 innocent children.

However, Horcruxes weakened soul needed far less sacrifices to work. So the protagonists would be faced with the choice of using that ritual unaltered but guaranteed to work, or using it with far lower sacrifices (at least no murders), but not guaranteed to work.

** Sending Voldemort into space: probably not enough to remove his immortality. Can you put a limit on the range of a soul? Horcruxes work by having a bit of you remain in the living world to prevent your soul from moving on, so I'd assume they will work from anywhere in the universe.

Assuming Shiki Ryougi has the same abilities and limits as Shiki Tohno from Tsukihime (the only other person with those eyes I'm aware of), she could absolutely destroy Voldemort with ease, horcruxes or no - Shiki Tohno killed beings with far better claims to immortality than him. There's a possibility that the horcruxes can be destroyed, therefore Voldemort has a concept of death. A possibility, no matter how slim or unachievable, is all it takes for the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception to function.\\
And if she can see /points/ like Shiki Tohno, a single jab would end him and all his horcruxes in an instant. There's a reason those eyes are terrifying even to beings several orders of magnitude more powerful than anything in the Potterverse.

Shiki Fujin: that's an interesting one. I'd say Voldemort would be gone permanently, but his horcruxes would remain. They might be able to pull a Diary and steal someone's life force to create a body, but the "Voldemort" that returned would only be a shadow of the original with only his memories up to the moment the horcrux was created.

As for dropping the horcrux in the ocean, it would probably be fine. Pressure is deadly to living beings because of the compressible gasses in their bodies. Something made of metal or stone like most of his canon horcruxes would be unaffected, and seawater's corrosive effects would be useless against something that requires basilisk venom to destroy.

As for one story which bypasses what are effectively horcruxes, check out Harry Potter and the Enemy Within linkffn(3417954) and its sequel. Harry fights Voldemort in Voldemort's soul, and so makes it unstable.

A ritual could also be used to bypass horcruxes. Maybe not in canon, but I'm sure you could spin it so a ritual bypassing them seems reasonable.

The book would get soggy. The locket, cup, ring, and diadem would be fine.

Nagini would be turned into Corpse of Nagini. Harry would be turned into Corpse of Harry. Up to the author whether that gets rid of the horcrux.

As for the rest, you could write it any way you want.

With the Veil, maybe the stress of having the wraith on one side and the horcruxes on the other would destroy it. Maybe the stress would break the link and all the horcruxes would produce their own wraiths, or start possessing people. Maybe the horcruxes would physically fly from their positions through the Veil, or maybe the soul portion would become disconnected from their objects.

Same things with a Dementor sucking Voldemort's primary soul.

** I think that when you split your soul they become separate entities. So in reality they aren't your soul any more.

In TCoS we saw Riddle kind of evolve away from what we could imagine the OG Voldemort was like. Riddle began to talk about himself as if he was separate from the OGV but at the same time limited to the mentality and functions of the vessel and time from the split of the main soul. I.e the riddle soul couldn't learn from the main soul. Therefore that soul is independent.

From what I understood if the main soul was killed off then the only way that the person could come back to life was if the soul in the vessel overtook another person. Taking their life force for themselves. OoTP kind of demonstrated that with Harry showing Voldemort like characteristics.

In theory this could mean that worst case scenario there could have been 7 Voldemorts that were completely separate from each other having to start their life again from the point they were split. So I don't think you need a main soul to be present to survive.

The weakness of the imperious curse is if the target has /enough/ willpower, it's worthless. Worse, the caster can't even tell that it's been defeated in this way! Granted, there's very few people who have that much willpower, but it's still a pretty huge weakness for one of the most feared and hated spells around.

The Fidelious can protect a location from absolutely everyone and everything... as long as the secret keeper doesn't voluntarily spill the beans. That's an incredible defense with an incredibly simple weakness.

And so Horcruxes... we know they're incredibly powerful pieces of magic. We know Voldemort used significant deaths and significant artifacts to make them, and then hid them in significant places. What if it wasn't just Hubris? Sure those places were pretty heavily defended... but why hide them where anyone would ever think to look? Why make them from something recognizable? Surely enchanting a random piece of flagstone in some rural village to be your horcux would be a much better plan than hiding one in the hovel your mother grew up in after killing you father there?

So my baseless opinion is that making it into a rock and chucking it into the sea /wouldn't work./ Either the process of making the horcrux would fail because it wasn't a significant death or significant artifact, or the horcrux would fail over time because it wasn't placed in a significant location (under this model, the necklace would have been fine in Grimmauld because it wasn't Voldemort's choices that made it end up there).

--------------

As for completely circumventing the anchors... I would say no, you couldn't kill Voldemort without killing the Horcruxes first. There's a reason why Sealed Evil In A Can is a trope. You can seal him up, you can mindwipe him, you could paralyze him, you could turn him into stone, but as long as the anchors exist, he /will/ come back, sooner or later. But the better the seal... the more concentrated the weakness is that will release him - so if anyone can get to the weak point /at all/ then releasing him is trivial.

** Sending him to space wouldn't work as magic doesn't give a shit about distance, but the veil would without a doubt bypass the horcruxes as it sends people straight to whatever exists on the other side of kings cross. You'd still have to deal with the horcruxes themselves as they could be used to resurrect voldy chamber of secrets style but voldy prime would be dead.

*** I want to see a fic where the main Voldemort is dead (either Dementors kiss, veil, something like that) but one of the Horcruxes becomes Voldemort 2.0

**** One? Why not all of them?

Except each is just a fragment of the whole, so they conduct a ritual, and, by their powers combined, they get Captain Voldemort!
