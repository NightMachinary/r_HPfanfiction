So I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8892557/1/][Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort]] and now I'm curious if there are other fics along those lines, with Ginny dying at the end of COS but Tom Riddle taking over her body. There are so many fics in which Tom isn't defeated in the Chamber, but this is a spin on it that had never occurred to me before. Harry/Tom Riddle very much welcome but anything would be great.

  "A pair of familiar eyes stared widely back at him. And it was at that moment, Harry finally realised, that he had never been free." A dark spin on the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, 'Nineteen Years Later'. One Shot! Complete!

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU.

** This would be amazing if it was like a serious sort of story, with Ginny/Tom spying on Harry and relaying information back to his main incarnation, and then maybe going with him to the Ministry in OOTP and sabotaging it, and then LATER going on the Horcrux hunt and sabotaging THAT! Ginny/Tom could be this constant, subterfuge presence in the story, always watching and always countering Harry in ways he doesn't even understand! :)
