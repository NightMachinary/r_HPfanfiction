I'd like something 60k-200k words. Ships are fine if they're developed well. Thank you

** Closest I've ever come to reading a hp/pokemon crossover was a smutfic where half of it was harry reading a pokemon smutfic while locked in his cupboard. Basically the author trying to get people to read his pokemon smutfic so he copy pasted excerpts in the hp story. /cringe/

  Harry finally caught his lucky break. What would he do when he found a strange device that came from another dimension that let him transfrom witches into horny Anthropromorphized Pokemon? Of course he wouldn't use it. It conflict with his morals. But here comes Hermione. A Harry Potter x Pokegirl Crossover

** There's this fic with a God-Level OP Fem!harry who ends up in the pokemon world. It's got quite a few funny jokes. No Ships but I'm fairly sure it's abandoned. It's part of the "lily potter and the art of being a Sisyphus series by carnivorous muffin. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12753962/1/Wearing-the-Faces-of-Men]])
