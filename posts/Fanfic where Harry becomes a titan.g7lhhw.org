Like mythical Titans in Greek like his magic go wrong a starts to strengthen his body to god like strength he can't do all magic now only some He can be a god or not but has to be a titan

With or without the ability to control his size

Edit I might repost this somewhere else without the Greek and just the body strengthening still try to find the Titan body


** I'm assuming this is a Percy Jackson thing? As in Titans of Greek Mythology? Either way, you might wanna beef up your description a little, it's very vague and it might help you get what you want to be a bit more specific.
