Be it because of the tournament or Harry is in his year for whatever reason or etc.

Thanks


** I really liked LullabyKnell's fics: linkao3(8517286; 14176482; 18549484).

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

  POA AU: A tumblr prompt: Cedric Diggory + "rules" The thing about Cedric Diggory was that, if he was comfortable telling that sort of joke, he'd say that really, truly, and honestly... he was really just several anxious rabbits in a robe. Always had been.

  Goblet of Fire AU: "In fact, Harry decided that he was grateful for Cedric's closeness. If they stayed close together, it felt, if they grabbed each other tight and didn't let go, then maybe they could live through this." Cedric Diggory lives. Canon divergence at the graveyard.

** Linkffn(three black birds) has Cedric in a kinda Wesley twins/Neville/Luna position where he's definitely a friend, but not part of the core friend group or anything. Also just an amazing fic

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Draco asks Harry to help him beat the Imperius curse during 4th year. The lessons turn into more than either expected. A story of redemption and forgiveness. Pairings: HP/DM (Slash) Timeframe: 1994-2002 Goblet to 4 yrs post-DH EWE Rating T for language, high angst, content.
