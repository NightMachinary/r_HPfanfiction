*** OH my gosh! A sex story here between two fully grown consenting adults! I never thought I would see one. Thank you, and that story was actually very sexy. :) I've always wanted to write Rita's character but I haven't had the chance yet. I wonder how to incorporate her animagus form into sex?

**** This fix made them my OTP. There is nothing quite like it, though. And the pairing is quite rare.

I think Rita as a beetle would be great as a tickler. Crawl around. Fly a bit, land, crawl. Repeat. But sexily.

***** I don't like imagining Dolores in any type of sexual situation, so I personally think I'll stay away from this one. I have to say, though... her and Rita would quite suit each other based on their personalities.

Now I'm imagining a young Rita being very seductive toward her interviewees in order to get her big scoop. I'm not sure how her animagus form would work with that, though: you'd want to be careful turning into something that could easily get squished.

(*EDIT:* While I doubt Rita ever turns into a beetle during sex, we should remember that when she /is/ a beetle, she's used to having multiple limbs. Therefore, I suspect that she probably gets really... creative with using her fingers.)

** Linkffn(for love of magic) takes a while to get to it, as it follows Harry from first year, but once it hits its stride, there's smut almost every chapter.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
