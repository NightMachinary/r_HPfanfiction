(Sorry if I should have flared this post Meta. I wasn't sure so I went with discussion)

Ok so reading people arguing about these two raises my blood pressure and so i am writing this post too prevent one of my blood vessels bursting.

(I also want to read more fics with both of them in it that doesn't demonize one of them.)

Let's jump right in with the negatives, James was a horrible bully to Snape. He was a spoiled prick who picked on the wierd, ugly, poor, half-blood, dark looking abused kid because he was in the wrong house and dared be friends with a girl who he liked. This bullying escalated to physical violence and at one point sexual harassment. Snape succumbed to the pressures of the people surrounding him and was a bigoted jerk to many. This bigotry (whether he truly believed it or not) escalated to the point he became a death eater and likely did horrible things. We have no reason to believe James realized the depth of pain he caused but he mellowed as he aged and became a decent man who died to protect his wife and son. Snape never stopped being a dick and was mean to children, but after losing the one person who he ever had a positive relationship with he spent his entire adult life tortured by guilt, and gave everything to the cause of stopping what he used to support.

To be honest, I like both these characters. (Though I will admit to favor Snape). Both of them are complex individuals who are excellent examples of how societal conflict effects children, and both make an excellent case for why kids and teens need proper help and guidance while they mature. I think Snape fans and James fans should get along, both hate bullies (many people on both sides of the debate having been bullied themselves) and both believe people can change and become better people.

I think the primary disconnect comes from a profound misunderstanding of the way abuse and radicalization effect people.

The idea that “not everyone who goes through x does y, therefore the fact x happened shouldn't factor into how we judge the person who did y”. The problem with this is that it ignores what we know to be true about psychology: no two people will respond exactly the same way to trauma, and that ignoring the cause of problematic behaviors does far more harm than good.

Also, Snape was not the only victim. James was a victim of two things mainly a complete lack of proper discipline in his formative years that should have stopped and addressed his bullying, and the intense house rivalry that told students who they were and who their enemies were from the age of 11. Both of those boys needed proper adult intervention and neither of them got it.

I don't want to write an essay defending both these characters. I could go in for hours about why Snape being Nevilles bogart doesn't mean he is abusive, and why James didn't want Snape killed but I shouldn't have too. I fully believe that people on both sides have the reading comprehension and critical thinking skills to understand why neither Snape nor James is the anti-Christ, and why there are legitimate reasons for people to like and sympathize with both of them. I'm not asking you to like Snape/James I'm asking you too respect that others do.

(Forgive my typos I'm writing on mobile. Also, I know this is off topic but I hope all of you are well and stay well.)


** Most people forget that the First War started in 1970 the year before James and Snape started Hogwarts which would mean the first shots would have been fired and battle lines would have been drawn.

Personally I like James more. No matter what people say about him he was a great friend and loyal. He became fiends Sirius who came from one of the darkest families despite the war already going on and in his time of need took him in with a war going on. When he learned that Remus was a werewolf he decided stay friends with him and even became an animagus so that Remus' transformations would be a little easier. Friends like that are rare to come by.

Then there is the parts they played in the war. Snape was already mingling with the Death Eater crowd even when he was friends with Lily which Lily did not approve of and the one scene in which she tried to confront him about it he deflected it and eventually went on to join the death eaters. Even when he heard the prophecy he had no problem telling Voldemort about it to gain his favor despite knowing he was putting the target on an infant.

James however joined the Order and fought to protect the innocents. He did not falter even when he was faced with Voldemort while being unarmed and threw his life away to give his wife and son a chance to escape.

*** Oh I totally respect James for his acts in the first war, his lack of prejudice towards Remus, and his generosity to Sirius. Yet, I respect Snape more. Not for his acts in the first war but what came after. What Snape did, which is to say recognizing he was wrong, humbling himself in front of someone he no doubt did not respect, accepting the guilt of his actions, then committing himself to a life of abject misery and the scorn of others in order to protect Harry, and then being willing to give up even that in order to defeat Voldemort (indicating a complete turn to the light side), is far harder than what James did.

Sadly, he was told at age 22, that his new career was Hogwarts professor! Training in how to be a teacher? Who needs it when you have good old slughorn, the man who ignored the terrorist cell growing under his nose for more than a decade!

** Snape joined the Death Eaters. Despite claiming to love Lily, he joined an organisation with the stated and demonstrated goal of murdering all the muggleborns. Whether the bullying was one-sided or not doesn't change that James risked his life to fight Death Eaters and Snape did so to help murder innocents.

*** Not disagreeing with you. I think it is pretty clear that Snape is imperfect and highly flawed. He also was groomed from a very young age and was sorted into an extremist recruitment cell at the age of 11. He also didn't join because he wanted to murder innocents, we have no reason to believe he enjoyed killing, he joined for the social benefits of being in the organization. Once again not trying to excuse what he did but if you put any 11 year old into the kind of environment Slytherin was at the time you stand a pretty good chance of radicalizing them especially if the child is vulnerable and seeking protection like Snape was. In addition, James was in essentially the polar opposite environment. Him joining on the light side rather than the dark side is as surprising as an American fighting on the side of the allies rather the helping the Germans in WWII. (Not saying his bravery wasn't praise worthy only that for him, as a healthy gryffandor male of fighting age at the time of the first war, joining the light side in of itself is not saying much)

Also, this is not the point of my post. I'm only asking not to hate on people who like Snape and to acknowledge he is not /canonically/ evil incarnate.

When you say "like Snape", do you mean as a character or as a person? The former is fine but the latter is /not/.

Because there are people on this subreddit who actually /defend Snape's canonical actions/ and say he was /justified/ in joining a terrorist group and bullying children. That's where the majority of the "hate" is aimed at, because a lot of people find it distasteful when someone uses school enmity as an excuse for justifying terrorism and child abuse.

I've had one user point-blank saying that Neville deserved the treatment he got from Snape in the Shrinking Potion class (3rd year) and the threat/attempt to poison his pet toad was not a big deal.

***** I see far more people on this subreddit who retroactively justify James actions because his suspicion that Snape was Dark when they were 11 turned out to be true years of bullying later. I think part of the confusion is rooted in the sometimes muddied line between explaining and justifying. Years of child abuse and neglect, coupled with bullying, and being placed in an environment filled with people grooming young students into becoming DEs are what caused him to become a DE. If you think about responsibility as an all or nothing matter then it is simply a question of is Snape responsible yes or no, however, if you think about responsibility as a matter of degrees it becomes more complex. This is what I think the root of a lot of the argument regarding Snape's actions boils down too: some people look at responsibility as an all or nothing question, and others see it as a matter of degrees.

Also, I feel like perhaps you don't understand what /some/ (I won't pretend all Snape fans feel this way) people mean when they like Snape. Liking a character as a person is not the same thing as justifying all they do. I like and respect Snape, I think he was a good person, but I also know him to be a bad teacher for younger students. My ability to like him, is that, for me, his positive traits and actions out way his negative ones. That said you don't have to agree with me. I don't like Sirius because his negative traits and acts particularly annoy me, that said if you like Sirius because you think his positive traits and actions make up for his negative ones that is ok too.

No justification is necessary. You keep claiming that Snape is some innocent victim of bullying when we're told in canon that "he never lost an opportunity to curse James", knew more curses as a first year than most seventh years. They were both shithead teenagers but only one used dark magic and treated it as a joke. Only one joined a terrorist organisation. And it wasn't James.

  There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.

  Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, “What's he done to you?” And hadn't James replied, “It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.” Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius... but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen...

  Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it...

  “I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen---”

  “I'm fifteen!” said Harry heatedly [...]

  “Yeah,” said Harry, “but *he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because---well, just because you said you were bored*,” he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.

  “*I'm not proud of it*,” said Sirius quickly.

  Lupin looked sideways at Sirius [...]

  But Lupin shook his head. “Did I ever tell you to *lay off Snape*?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought *you were out of order*?”

  “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you *made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes*... that was something...” [...]

  “Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.

  “And stopped *hexing people just for the fun of it*,” said Lupin.

As for who used Dark Magic:

#+begin_quote
  “James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an *illegal hex* upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey's head twice normal size. Double detention.”

  [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070217225248/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24][Hexes]]:\\
  Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort. I see 'hex' as slightly worse. I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.

And here's Word of God:

#+begin_quote
  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their *relentless bullying of Severus Snape*, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

  Agreed. Not to mention, most of the negative perceptions of James has just one source: Snape. And Snape stans wonder why people don't take such an obviously biased source seriously. It's not as if James is around to give his POV or context.
#+end_quote

Sure sounds like you're trying to pretend James wasn't a bully and a sexual assaulter, on the basis that only his victims have a negative impression of him.

And no, it's fact that Snape was an innocent victim. It's on page - he's minding his own business, and he gets assaulted. Lily and James both acknowledge that Snape has done nothing, other than existing.

#+begin_quote
  Between Lupin and Snape, I know whose word I'll be believing.
#+end_quote

And Lupin admits they bullied Snape, with even Sirius saying that he was occasionally ashamed.

But it's interesting that, between [aggressor with a history of lying] and [video evidence that is backed up by everyone, including the aggressors themselves], you'll take the aggressor's side.

Besides, can you read [2]? Lupin is referring to their seventh year, and he's also trying to explain to Harry why James lied to Lily and hexed people behind her back, so he has every interest in lying. If Snape had been the aggressor, why would James even hide the truth from her.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Pointing out hypocritical and self-serving double standards is not whataboutism. If you don't care about Hagrid injuring students, and laughing about it, and threatening them with torture, or about McGonagall using corporal punishments and locking Neville outside of his own common room, while a murderer is targeting the area, you don't get to complain about Snape trying to scare Neville into paying attention (clearly, he wasn't going to harm Trevor, since he actually used the antidote on it).

Whatever your scale regarding teaching at Hogwarts, Snape is the teacher we see the most and yet the teacher who never endangers or harms a student.

#+begin_quote
  Compare that with /Sectumsempra/.
#+end_quote

Why? Is ganging up on people and using Dark Magic on them alright, as long as it isn't Sectumsempra? That we don't even see Snape use as a teenager?

You said James and Sirius didn't use Dark Magic. They did, which, in addition to bullies, makes them hypocrites.

#+begin_quote
  Death of author. I don't need her opinions on morality.

Those are not opinions on morality, those are facts. That she had to restate, despite them being clear in the books, for people who try to whitewash the school bullies.

And considering you think there are contexts that could justify bullying and sexual assault, you really should look into some morality lessons, instead of telling people what they should and shouldn't like.

He chooses to associate with eventual terrorists becoming one of Voldemort's inner circle of Death Eaters. Dumbledore calls him out on it when confronting him, saying that his defection only came because Lily was at risk and he couldn't care less about James or Harry.

As a result, we have a very morally gray character that's polarizing amongst the fandom. Snape certainly isn't the victim of circumstances given that he willing chose to join the Death Eaters and likely provided them with intelligence and more, but at the same time he was forced to spend the rest of his life fighting against Voldemort. He opted to blast the Death Eater that had his wand aimed at Lupin who was a part of the Marauders that bullied him and kept Dumbledore's Army somewhat safe from the Carrows at least.

It seems to me to be related more towards the impact on the caster, magical power of the spell, and the limited use of the spell than what the spells themselves actually do to the victim. For example, choking on soap (a way we know someone could be killed with light magic) is a far worse way to die than instant death from an Avada Kedavra.

** Snape is an undoubtedly brave and shit man (and very complex). After Snape turns, he has to suffer spying on Voldemort, staring the embodiment of evil in the eyes while defending himself from legilimency. He has to serve the man he absolutely hates for killing his love and has to kill the one man who has a half-decent relationship with him. He's absolutely fucking brave. If one man deserved to have a child named after him for bravery, it's Severus Snape.

Snape is also a piece of shit. The man didn't become a death eater for "social reasons". He joined because he was an angry man, seeking to strike back against perceived slights and an absolute racist. From a young age he excelled in the Dark Arts, creating sectumsempra. As a child, he stared "creepily" at Lily. He hung out with future death eaters and let's not even forget that Snape was the one who threw the first insult at James. Let's not forget that Snape was a blatant racist at Hogwarts who hated on every mudblood except Lily. This was not "seeking protection in Slytherin", the man joined a group with views that agreed with him. The man became a high ranking death eater, top-tier killing material. He was in a good-enough standing with Voldemort, god knows what he did to get it, that he could ask Voldemort /a favor/. The man gave up a prophecy knowing a baby was probably going to die without a second's thought. He arrived at Hogwarts knowing more curses than 7th years, the man was spiteful. Plenty of Slytherins did not become death eaters.

Even his redeeming quality, doing things for love, is not so redeeming. Even with his love for Lily, he wouldn't listen to her pleas to stop hanging out with future death eaters. He loves a woman who never loved him back, forming an obsession since his childhood. He hates on her son and Neville because they both contribute to why she's dead. He called her a Mudblood. I don't know about you, but as a non-racist person, when I'm in an argument with my friends (and I don't even think I'm in love with them), I don't call them racial slurs. He bullied children, but at least had the decency to grade fairly (Hermione did better than Malfoy). But I cannot deny that he did incredibly brave things to honor the closest he could ever get to love. It just wasn't a healthy love, it was an obsession. This was not a positive relationship.

Snape was a horrid man who did incredibly brave things for the wrong reasons. He absolutely deserved his traitor's death which allowed him to redeem himself. He's an incredibly complex character with incredible nuance.

James Potter is a good man. Yes, he retaliated with insults when Snape insulted Gryffindor. Yes, he bullied the racist who created a lethal curse as a teenager. This is like the well-meaning golden-hearted quarterback and top-student bullying the neo-nazi who shoots guns for fun in his backyard at targets with faces of minority group members. No he shouldn't have done this. Yes, Snape definitely contributed to this antagonism with retaliation . Yes, James was egotistical. He was also popular. He joined the Order of the Pheonix at great risk. He saved the life of Snape, who he abhorred, from Lupin. He matured enough for Lily to fall in love with him. He gave his life for his son and looked to be a pretty good father. Honestly, it shocks me that such a good man is remembered for his low moment of bullying the equivalent of a neo-nazi. I can't even find implications of James bullying other people, whereas it is heavily implied Snape contributed to the bullying of other muggleborn students.

I think this excerpt makes Lupin's opinion of James and Snape pretty clear, don't you? About who's instigating and who's retaliating?

Snape wasn't some innocent victim here, he can't play the victim card when he's the one inventing and using dark magic. James was a shithead teenager but he grew out of it and became a good man. Snape was a bigoted shithead teenager who became a terrorist and remained a cruel, petty and sadistic.

He didn't care and would have loyally followed Voldemort, until the prophecy included Lily and Dumbledore wouldn't help him while he was with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. He even outright asked Voldemort to spare Lily, and had she not sacrificed herself for her son, had she been in a different room at the time, Snape would have allowed her to lose her husband and her son, just because he didn't want to lose her. He had to stay on Dumbledore's side because it was the only way to keep him out of Azkaban, and the only reason he did for Harry what he did was that he's Lily's son and has her eyes. He also tormented Harry for the fact he looked like James. I also don't understand the fact people defend him bullying kids because it was "keeping his cover." No, it had been said publicly, in front of at least one other Death Eater, that Snape was a secret agent for Dumbledore.

But when you mention that Snape repented his role in his best friends death, that's completely true. Which is why I always think what if it was not Harry?

Say Harry was not the child born at the end of July. Then Voldemort wouldn't have gone after Lily. So, Snape wouldn't have repented then because his whole reason for joining Dumbledore was to protect her.

The problem with this is that it ignores what we know to be true about psychology: no two people will respond exactly the same way to trauma, and that ignoring the cause of problematic behaviors does far more harm than good.

This is very true. And oft-dismissed.

*** I too find myself becoming less moderate as I read the debate. Then I take a step back and realize what I'm doing, but still its amazing how easy it is to get heated about these characters. Even as I am replying to a bunch of these comments I find myself slipping into a defensive position! Reading your comment actually really helped me remember what I was trying to say with my post in the first place. Thank you for your reply.

**** I've gotta be honest here - I'm not gonna stop hating on the character I dislike (I'm not disclosing who it is because it amuses me, but really, it's super duper obvious). I understand what JKR was going for with his story and I think the intended interpretation was indeed what you had proposed in your post, but she did a very poor job of actually proving that this evolution indeed took place. My sincere belief is that she meant for every character who had one of Harry's children named after him to be redeemed and count as one of the good guys - but while I'm forced to accept what she wrote as canon even if I don't like it (the character I dislike was loved by Lily no matter what I think about it), I don't have to accept her (or Harry's, for that matter) moral judgment.

And... that's a problem with *me*. Baleful hate is not a good approach to take when trying to enjoy fiction, and it really sucks that it seems like some people's preference, so much so that they'll edit out whole swaths of dialogue and impugn the accuracy of entire chapters, and eventually even argue that JKR can't write (she definitely, definitely can), just to make their hateful point.

So I reserve the right to hate whomever I want and to love whomever I want, but I still thank you for reminding me that there's a more civil way to go about that shit and that it's not fun or instructive to hate fictional characters.

You're a brave soul!

** Thank you, for posting this! I recently read a thread where Snape fans were arguing with James fans and it was so ridiculous. They were getting really worked up, they were talking at each other so convinced they were right, not even trying to understand the other person's point of view. I totally agree with you.

** I also love both characters~ I was trying to wrap my head/daydream around how this conflict occurred recently when I finally got around to reading Against the Moon by SpotlightDelight. It's pretty old and popular so you might have already read it but I do like the way she(?) wrote about how the marauders vs Snape rivalry evolved. It's really realistic to the age and demographic of everyone involved.

*** I'll give that a read for sure. One I really enjoyed was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14661357][Break, Break, Break]]. Which is essentially Snape and James debating their different outlooks on war by exchanging war poetry (real war poems I might add I found one of my favorite poems through it) during the first war. Seriously, read it. (Also be sure to read about the meaning of last poem if you don't know it (after you read the fic of course), it adds so much to the story). It is so beautiful and as a poetry lover probably my favorite fic out there. I cannot recommend it enough.

** Thank you for taking the time to point out that no two people will react to trauma in the same way...it is one of my biggest bug bears in HP fandom to see trauma dismissed with the idiotic assertions including that because Harry overcame his trauma, Snape should have overcome his as well. It is such ignorant nonsense.

Snape's unresolved trauma is blatantly obvious in the way he acts. It played a big part in his choice to joint the DE (as well as having been groomed for it as a child from poverty). But it is noticable there are people incapable of attempting to accept the difference between understanding why someone acts the way they do and excusing it. Understanding is the key to helping others avoid the same dark path.

** I read almost entirely Snape-centric, and basically never read JP-centric. But I'm saddened over how often those fics bash James and portray Snape as the wronged one in the entire debacle who did nothing wrong himself. This is especially common in LESS, but also happens a lot in general, be it gen, SS&HP, or whatever ship the author is sailing. They both did stupid shit, and while Severus at his worst is worse than James at his worst, I'd also argue that his best is better as well. Some people seem to treat the entire thing as if Severus and James were sports teams -- one is perfect while the other is demonspawn.

I much prefer Snape-centric fics where James is portrayed as a flawed, but ultimately good person, just like I prefer fics portraying Snape in a similar way (even if I acknowledge that Snape was genuinely evil for a period, I have no interest in reading Snape fics set during 1978-1981 except for major AUs).

This is exactly how I feel too!

I love Snape centric fics but I hate James bashing too.

Also, I know you said you hate 1978-1981 fics but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14661357][Break, Break, Break]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/flibbertygigget/pseuds/flibbertygigget][flibbertygigget]] is definitely worth reading. It is about Snape, after he became a spy, and James debating their different outlooks on war by exchanging muggle war poetry. I highly recommend it (if you do read it also read the final poem mentioned "Gethsename" by Kipling AFTER you finish the fic it adds a lot of depth). Seriously, this story is one of my favorites.

** It's amusing how you made this very level-headed post, asking people to stop arguing... and some people went ballistic, downvoting you and insisting that /they're/ right (while displaying serious ignorance about canon). And I think it's telling that they're all supporters of the same character. Class.

**** (Lmao even this reply of yours was downvoted! Don't these people feel embarrassed when doing that?)

All of your replies have been more than diplomatic, fair and level-headed. Which is probably why you got downvoted, these people are the HP equivalent of Flat Earthers - they will outright pretend canon doesn't exist (like Lily, Lupin and Sirius acknowledging James was a bully) and make insightful, well-thought out comments the like of "James good, Snape bad", and "James didn't join the Death Eaters, Snape did".

Anyway, good OP and I completely agree with your take on grooming,

*** Well, it is the fan fiction sub. It is clear they prefer their head canon and misinterpretations over canon. There is distinct lack of understanding of grooming and trauma in fandom...and it becomes ever clearer that fan fiction "hating" without proper regard to circumstances only encourages it.

**** Please, grooming and trauma are issues much too complex.

These are people who think everyone knew Peter was the traitor, that Harry saw Peter's name on the Map, that Snape started associating with Death Eaters after Lily broke off with him, that the only evidence for James being a bully comes from Snape - these are people who have thoroughly supplanted canon with their illogical headcanons.

I also think it's telling that a lot of these people are dudes (predominantly straight), who downplay sexual abuse and bullying as a "boys will be boys" type of thing, while also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/euuld1/why_i_hate_pottermore/fftf7sq/][crying]] about the good ol' days when you could use the N and F words without "sensitive snowflakes" being upset about it
