In canon, the House Elves and Centaurs turn the battle with knives and bows. That's what a 13th-century peasant mob used. And that was already enough against the best Voldemort could offer. In comparison, modern weapons would just annihilate the Death Eaters if used by wizards (eg Harry and the others at the Battle of Hogwarts).

The Muggle weapons are not the issue here, not seeing the Death Eater is. The outcome of that fight would be the same no matter what the good guys used.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.
