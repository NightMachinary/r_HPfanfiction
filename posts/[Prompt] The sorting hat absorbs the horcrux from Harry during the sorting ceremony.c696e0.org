Title says it all. This could go good or bad in so many ways.


** Harry, and everyone sorted after him, will be in Slytherin.

*** Well, the Sorting Hat merged with /a/ Horcrux in my story (though not Scardemort), but that meant the Hat was only just 1/5th Voldemort, the other fifth being the four Founders. One of these, however, /is/ good old Professor Slytherin, so the Hat is /2/5/ Slytherin, and so the proportions at the next Sorting get screwed around a bit from the usual clean four quarters. (The Hat also gains a bit more of an ego.)

**** Your math is wrong. The hat is 1/4 slytherin. Harry is 1/7, 1/8, or 1.5625 percent voldemort, depending on how you do your math. I will be using 1.5625 percent for this example. So, the sorting hat gains 1/64 of voldemorts soul, making him 17/65 slytherin, rather then 2/5 slytherin. Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk

***** It's not a matter of "size of soul", but simply of how many different personality nodes are vying for control. How much "Voldemort-stuff" or "Gryffindor-stuff" there is in the Sorting Hat isn't the point, especially as the implanting of the Founder's personalities wasn't via soul manipulation but just memory duplication.

That being said, even the premise that you can quantify amount of soul is somewhat debatable.

****** There are 7 horcruxes, horcrux 1, 50%, horcrux 2, 50 percent of what's left

******* That's just one interpretation. No one ever said the ritual had to split the soul cleanly in /half/; it's equally possible that Voldemort, having planned all along to make six Horcruxes, only sliced off a seventh of his soul each time.

And it is also possible that "souls" aren't a quantifiable entity where you can speak about amounts and percentages --- where all you can note is whether it's "whole" or not, whole being understood in a much more abstract way than "how much soul-stuff there's left".

******** Your interpretation says there is no soul left in him. Remember, Harry was an accidental horcrux, so there were 7 cruxes, 8 pieces of soul

********* No one ever said the Harry-Horcrux was the same size as the other ones. Scardemort certainly didn't look as well-formed as Diarymort.

** "Creevey, Colin," announced the Deputy Headmistress primly, summoning the tiny, mousy haired muggleborn forward. He had a giant grin on his face and a bounce to his step. This was finally the day, he thought, the day he took his rightful place in Gryffindor, among the mighty lions and...

The Boy Who Lived...

He looked for him frantically as he took his seat and waited for Professor McGonagall to put the hat on his head. There he was in all of his Boy-Who-Lived glory, talking to some redheaded boy and totally not paying attention to him at all. If only he could be in the place of the redhead, he thought. If only he could be next to the great Harr--

"/Mudblood/," a voice in his head murmured with uncertainty.

"...What?" The boy said confused, only to realize that he had said it in his head.

"/M-mud/... I mean, uhh, yes very interesting," it was the hat! The hat was in his head and it was talking to him! "You're brave and err... /your blood. It is tainted/," said the hat ominously.

"What do you mean? Is this a riddle?" The boy didn't notice the sudden shudder that hat gave at that last word, "because I suck at those, so clearly no Ravenclaw for me, right?"

"Ravenclaw?" Said the voice, "Oh! Err, no, not that one. You're loyal and honest... /And hardheaded, stubborn, ignorant and witless, just like a disgusting/..."

"MUDBLO-- I-I mean... GRIFFYNDOR!"

That was fun! Thought the newly sorted boy as he headed to his table, his housemates all eager to welcome him and leaving a very disturbed McGonagall behind. Dumbledore was pensive, looking at the old hat with an analytical eye as he popped his ninth lemon drop of the night. Mmm, that hit the spot, thought the old wizard merrily as he ruminated one what he'd just witnessed.
