*** Hate to be that guy, but Broomstick Flyer, Paladeus and MSgt Silverdollar also belong on that list, as does becuzitswrong, although the latter wasn't as into the HP fandom as they were Worm.

***** Memories of Iron is brilliant. If you haven't read it, and you've read Worm, go read it. If you haven't read Worm, read that first. First fifteen chaps of Worm are rough, but power through as Wildbow finds his voice as a writer.

Believe worm is on parahumans.wordpress.com for those of you who are interested.

***** I take back my comment.

I somehow recall hearing that he'd passed away though Google is showing no evidence to support this. I must have gotten my synapses crossed with someone else.

He did post around three years ago, as per this reddit thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2x3yns/very_morbid_question/cownejy]]

** My condolences to his family and friends on this loss. He wasn't my favorite author, I couldn't really say that I read all or a lot of his stories, but from the little I witnessed in between he seemed like a fine human being. Chilord must have loved his arts a lot, because he kept being an author until well into his illness. He deserves to be mourned and remembered.

For years he was very active on the private Fanfiction Federation forum where he had his own [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/chilord-39-s-desk-f51/][*author's subsection*]]. There he posted his many incomplete stories in monthly updates and for some of you (that like other fandoms besides HP) it may be worth taking a look and reading them in a tribute to his life. Aside from a fond farewell message, that's the least we can do.

Since this forum has recently become part of the Tapatalk community, signing up is very easy if you already have an account with them.
