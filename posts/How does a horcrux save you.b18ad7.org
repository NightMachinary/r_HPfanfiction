Is it supposed to make you a disembodied spirit that makes you require outside help? Does it just refuse to let you die, even if you're cut into a dozen pieces? Does your body reform near the Horcrux, instantly or over the course of a while? Is there rapid regeneration involved?

If you don't know, feel free to speculate and point out how you did it, and have seen it done.


** The way I understood it is that when you die the horcrux acts as an anchor preventing your soul from moving onto the afterlife. It is still up to you to arrange a resurrection from there, but since your soul is hanging around, it is relatively easy when compared to a normal dead person.

*** I think a really important question/distinction is what happens when your body /isn't/ completely obliterated, as Voldemort's was.

So canon Voldemort was a disembodied spirit, who had to arrange for an entirely new body. That's a pretty difficult task, to say the least.

But what if it had been otherwise? If Voldemort's body had died, but was mostly undamaged? Could he have flown right back in? Maybe he'd have to have done some emergency magic to repair the death-causing damage, or to stop, er, decomposition, but it probably wouldn't have taken a decade and an obscure ritual.

the question is why did voldemort start his war when he did instead of waiting a few more decades while dumbledore grew older

***** A few reasons that occur to me:

- Lack of loyal followers. By the time GoF rolled around, the only followers Voldie had that he still trusted were Barty Crouch Jr and Wormtail. Wait 20-30 years for Dumbledore to die off and they might be caught, disillusioned (in spirit, not the spell kind), or decide they're better off turning him in in exchange for leniency.
- If he's concerned about Harry still being a threat, better to try and take him out while he's a child and not experienced.
- Voldemort pretended he wasn't afraid of Dumbledore. It was just bad luck that got him killed the first time, so he'll just be a bit more careful this time around and steamroll his enemies properly.

***** Eh, I can blame him just fine. It's an obvious step to make sure that you will be revived, but none of his followers had any clue that he even had such contingencies in place.

He definitely should have had a follower, known only to him, hidden away in some other country under an unbreakable vow to revive him. He had a horcrux for over 40 years before his first death. Plenty of time.

But for one - he was murdering a baby. He wasn't going into battle. He wasn't expecting to die.

He also wasn't expecting his followers to just FLOP. Only a handful remained loyal once it was clear he was gone.

Wormtail is a moron. He wouldnt have been able to research it for him. And he was a barely functional weird baby.

******* Wormtail was not a moron. He was a snivelling and shallow man who became an animagus at a young age, successfully faked his own death by using a curse powerful enough to blow up an entire street, managed to locate his master despite not even knowing which country he was occupying.

Voldemort had 14 long years to figure out ways to regain his mortal form, and was well acquainted with the dark arts. He probably didn't make these two ways from scratch. If his plan involved this exact ritual in these exact circumstances, then he'd have a cauldron, some random enemy blood, Bellatrix's toe, and his father's dust ready and waiting in the same spot together with a possessable monkey waiting nearby.

Also, the fact that he had to make them means that the other wizards who made horcruxes didn't have them, meaning that that's not what's supposed to happen with a regular horcrux and a regular death.

******** I didn't say he did it before he lost his body. I'm saying the Horcruxes we're insurance, he likely never expected anyone would manage to kill him. Especially before he even managed to conquer one country. He wasn't prepared to need them so soon, I assume. But that was the point in making them: just in case.

And becoming a wraith is what is supposed to happen to a Horcrux bearer whose body is brought to death. That was what Slughorn was saying when he reacted negatively to Riddle's questioning, saying (paraphrase) "Who would want to exist in that state? Dying would be preferable". Even that aside, he seemed to regard it as expected.

I interpreted that as the state of having part of your soul infused in an object.

If he had to invent a whole new spell/potion/ritual thing /after/ he was vanquished then surely it was not an expected result of being 'killed'.

Slughorn was talking about the person making the Horcrux. That death would be preferable to subsisting as a barely existing thing that would have a cursed afterlife.

That's my point. Given his overwhelmingly power and ability, he wasn't expecting to be killed. The Horcruxes were insurance in case he was. But it's clear he didn't have everything together at that point, as he hadn't even finished making Horcruxes yet. Not only was his attempted murder of Harry supposed to be used to make a new Horcrux, Nagini was made after he had a temporary body, right? To me, these indicate a plan still being set up, so in essence you're kind of right that he wasn't prepared, but he was building up to being so

*********** My whole point is this: the preexistence of horcruxes mean there has to be a way that everyone else who successfully used them to come back to life. Voldemort didn't have anything like that set up at all for his backfiring killing curse, which leads me to believe that something different happened after it backfired than would have happened if he died any other way.

He took extensive precautions if he were to suffer a mortal wound (making five horcruxes) and yet didn't bother even thinking of how he'd get back on his feet if he suffered a mortal blow?

************ Based on what Voldemort said, either no such method existed or the Resurrection Potion he used was that method. I don't think theres any suggestion that his state after being 'killed' was odd to him. He doesn't ever indicate it was not as expected, he thought it proved his work had been a success. And based on what Slughorn said, I think it's clear being a wraith is the undesirable existence referred to.

** It's a Phylactery. It Anchors your Soul. In Harry Potter you don't die unless your Soul passes on. Which is why Voldemort would live until all of his Anchors were gone. Voldemort is basically a very minor Lich, the difference being he still has a Soul.

If Voldemort put his whole soul into one Horcrux, he'd have gone Lichmode. As it was, he was "Less than the meanest ghost" so he needed to rely on possession and a follower in order to get his body back, but his Soul was anchored.

***** Liches' bodies grow back automatically near their phylactery, I believe.

I don't think it's as simple as a manufactured body, since it was a raw and bleeding baby, identical to the portion of his soul that was in Harry's scar that appear in Kings Cross station.

You'd think if he knew that as soon as he died this would happen, he'd have a ritual all set up and ready to go so he could get back on his feet.

Voldemort was stuck as a disembodied spirit for 13 years (give or take) until he got his first body back. Which he was desperate to do. Why on earth would he not use a lesser ritual for now to return him to his previous form? Especially since he didn't know about the blood protection until 11 years into the game?
