In time travel fics, harry always gets sent back to his younger self, and a lot of them are really tropey. And I've been craving a veteran harry sent back in time, but still in an adult body, or his old body.

Older Harry ends up in 1991, raises himself, gets together with Amelia Bones and bashes Dumbledore.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop.Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

** if you don't mind Snarry, there is this fic I like with Harry traveling to the time when Voldy still didn't kill his parents. I don't know if he went back right after the Hogwarts battle or if he was an auror, but he came back in time as adult. it's a lengthy fic focusing on the first wizarding war. it is marked as unfinished, but I think I remember them defeating Voldy, so it might just be a couple of loose ends missing.
