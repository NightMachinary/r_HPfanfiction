Is there any fic where there is a squib/muggle pretending to have magic so they could attend Hogwarts?

can be OC, canon character, SI, whichever is fine.

â€‹

just some chat (don't have to read):

I assume this would be really difficult to pull, but maybe they make their classmates perform charms for them in class, because they beg them. or they insist that they misplaced their wand, or that they are sick currently, maybe they don't go to certain classes, hide during class, distract teachers, or buy joke items that perform those tasks for them. maybe some muggle way, so technology or whatever. muggle magician performance if the character is skilled in it. for practical exams, paying someone to polyjuice themselves.

potions would be probably possible, and herbology. so the only classes really would be charms and transfiguration. DADA third year, maybe fourth. and definitely sixth. other than that, essays are doable etc. if it's a muggle they would have to get around the charm that hides the school. maybe they found a tunnel and that's why they came there.

I just think it would be hilarious. especially if it would be SI. just thinking about the movie She's the man. so hiding something from others and getting into all sorts of weird situations. maybe boggarts don't work for muggles/squibs, so the classmates are awed that they don't fear anything.

*** I'm OK with that!

too bad the sequel is discontinued since 2014. a complete series would be fun.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then'
