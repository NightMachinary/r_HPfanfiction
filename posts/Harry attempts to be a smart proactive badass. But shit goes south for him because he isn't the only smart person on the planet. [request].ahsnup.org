** Hmm, the closest I can get to this would be linkffn(Magic of the Kaleidoscope, Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) they're both Sharingan!Harry fics though and pretty dark, but it's all I have to rec.

One of them has pretty heavy Fate/ elements while the other has heavy Dresden Files elements though, so be warned.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
