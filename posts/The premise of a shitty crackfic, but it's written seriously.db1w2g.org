Or just any crackfic in general

For example : 'In which Harry is a demigod, Ron is a druglord, Hermione can talk to animals, Snape is a 20th level paladin, and Ginny is a Mary Sue'

Or just Snape being a 20th level d&d paladin. I would read that.


** We need Snape being a level 20 paladin

#+begin_quote
  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

Saphroneth: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/]]

It's not super serious, but it's written with thought and explores how it is to be differently shaped from the rest. It's not finished but seems to be updated frequently.
