Soooooo I have an idea for a HP fanfic and I need some feedback...

so the basic Idea is that this girl is the child of two muggle werewolves ( yes they exist) in their human state and long story short her destiny is to help the wolves/creatures get balance in the same way harry is supposed to beat Voldie. She is an orphan but raised by loving grandparents who did not know that her parents were wolves or that they served voldie beleiving his lies...

I can see her being a slytherin....

She would have a huge arc about discovering the lies, the truth about her parents and struggling whie being a muggleborn in Slytherin. She would make some great freinds but also enemies in other houses... i can see her standing up to Snape but at a cost ( He really is awful)

Now the part I am struggling on is this...

When to implement her?

I have three Ideas...

1. When Harry is done with First year he meets her near his home and she becomes his freind during the summer without the letters. She gets her letter late but is a witch so they bond quickly. She breaks hedgwig out for him, the start of her destiny... they bond until she is a slytherin and that causes some issues...
2. Or she still comes in in second year but never meeting Harry asa friend her story from there is someone else taking charge separately to overcome and protect their friends fromt he basilisk. The year sets their tone for their views of the horrible wizardin world
3. Or this happens after Harry Graduates....

Thoughts and help?


** I feel that having Harry as a main character could undermine the importance of the OC. I think first year would be really good to see up some later drama, after all a muggleborn witch in Slytherin is bound to create drama. Does she have Lycanthropy? If so how does that affect her getting into Hogwarts? If not, what kind of drama could their be if her heritage is uncovered?

Their is a lot you could do with this character and this story. How far do you intend to take it? If she is in the same year as Harry, will it span all seven years? I'm very intrigued by the idea and definetly look forward to reading it if/when it is published.

Exit: Auto correct is a bitch.

*** No lycanthropy herself, but Werewolves drawn into another pack and then striving to get rights. They weren't born into that world but they worried that tehir daughter would be a wolf and fought with his on the outskirts of the packs ( He didn't really know them just their wolf status).

And yes it would
