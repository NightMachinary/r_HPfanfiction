*** The main reason I decided to make this was because I enjoy it so much, it's just nostalgia really.

It's so funny, and was so fun to make.

**** The last I heard, she was going to release a book about her experiences as a Native American lesbian in foster care to find her long lost brother, when her brother came out with the information that she was neither Native American, a lesbian or in foster care. Don't know what happened after that.

*** When I was adapting this to audio, I had a thought of doing a “cleaned up” version. But the direction in which is ends up makes it difficult to think it could be ever good!

It's still incredibly fun though!

You can find it here, if you can stand to read more than a few paragraphs

***** It's worth looking at for a giggle and to see what people are talking about, but honestly don't try and read it all. That's a part of your life you'll never get back and you could spend it reading a real book.

** I just read My Immortal and I think it's overhated. There's a true love story there and it's very creative. Definitely deserves its popularity!
