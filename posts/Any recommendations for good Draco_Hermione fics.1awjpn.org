Am just getting back into fanfiction, I haven't read any in a few years now, and I'm looking for something new to read.


** I'll give you the same advice that's been given [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/196nmh/what_are_the_best_dracohermione_fics/][in this thread...]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/13fwe8/does_anyone_have_any_good_sugestions_for_dramione/][and in this one...]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/u9b28/anybody_know_any_good_dracohermionie_fanfics/][and in this one.]]

Go to [[http://dramione.org/][dramione.org]]. They have several variations of top ten lists. *The Fallout* by /everythursday/ will probably be in more than half.

I just finished reading this one, a bit heavy on the angst at times, but overall pretty good. I really like the characterization of Draco.

** Check out author [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3698412/clumsydolphin][clumsydolphin]]. She writes a lot of Dramione stories. She also has a few where Hermione is paired with other characters. Almost anyone except Ron.
