How different do you think the magical world would be ?

With Muggleborns born after 1692 NO longer being removed from the genepool of the muggle world and going off the assumption that magic is a evolutionary advantage that would help the children reach adulthood and therefore be more likely to reproduce. how many generation do you think it would take for the magical descended from the Muggleborns that the magical world abandoned to out number the muggle population ?


** Depends if muggleborns are descended from squibs or if magic randomly appears in newborn kids.

All things considered i'd have to say that most of the time untrained magic would get you thrown out of society or something. But maybe in third world countries where magic would definitely be an advantage then you might see increasing populations of them. Assuming magic is not a recessive trait.

*** ON the muggleborns there were no Squibs for the first muggleborns to descend from ergo Sometimes a Muggleborn is just a Muggleborn.

I disagree with you on most of the time untrained magic would get you thrown out of society I would say that Provided that the magical child made it to adult hood that Accidental magic would Taper off as they become more Emotional stable as Adults or they would be like Tom Riddle and Lily Evans and gain control of there magic but i think that that would be a rarity.

Accidental magic would have been a Great survival tool for any kids trying to survive the industrial revolution.

I would say that magic is a dominant trait after all from all the Relationships we hear about from Canon were A muggle and A magical have a child the child has magic. Even the Weasley Squib cousin has a magical child Mafalda.

**** Fair points. I was thinking more on the obscurus sort of thing. A good proportion of people would end up suppressing their magic. Ariana Dumbledore, Credence. Lily learned to accept her magic because Severus Snape was familiar with the wizarding world. Without that guiding influence i think things would get chaotic pretty quick.

****** hmmm, i mean Harry was never explicitly beaten. Mainly verbally and neglectfully abused, or chased by kids his own age, not exactly able to do serious damage. And Harry was younger than 11 when he found out about magic. And he never knew it was because he was magical, so he never actively suppressed his magic. Beyond the age of 11 and without a wand, accidental magic becomes far more dangerous, which is the reason i think they started kids at the age of 11. And Harry did in fact have trouble controlling his accidental magic at least until 3rd year.

There would be a fair number of magical children who would be abused far worse than Harry, even just statistically speaking.

And personally i think Credence was pretty stupidly op. Ariana though was believable as she had bursts and fits of rage where her magic reacted accordingly. In my mind an obscurial would be less weird demon cloud. And more unstable individual with dangerous tendencies.

****** Obscurials don't come from being abused, but from repressing your magic. Harry didn't know he was magical, so he never repressed his magic (all those instances of accidental magic when he was young), and so no Obscurial -- and no plot hole.

******** Not really. The Dursleys kept insisting that magic did not exist, and Harry had no reason to believe it did. For all he knew, he just kept getting into accidental situations and was punished for things that weren't his fault. If you live in a world without magic, you don't immediately jump to the conclusion "I'm doing magic" just because odd things occasionally happen around you. Harry just thought the Dursleys were being unfair and blaming him for things he had nothing to do with... which, let's be honest, was perfectly consistent with the Dursleys as he knew them.

Harry doesn't know he's in a fantasy book for children, there's no reason he should jump to the conclusion that magic exists. Lots of people experience things they can't explain without immediately going "oh, I'm obviously a wizard."

************ Voldemort was a child prodigy and a genius, and Harry was neither of these things. The prophecy didn't say that Harry would be equal to Voldemort, though, just that Voldemort would "mark him as his equal." Which he did by trying to kill him (and choose him above Neville as the most likely candidate for "the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord") and giving him that lightning-bolt scar. It was Voldemort's choice, not Harry's innate abilities.

  it would be travelable, then children could still be taken to the new world, maybe even earlier than 11 years old.
#+end_quote

I think that the magical's could travel between the two earths. but I also think they would want to wash there hands of the muggle world and go for complete separation.

IF you want to give a reason for them to still take in some of the muggleborns maybe have it that there are magics on Hogwarts added by the three founders after Slytherins exile to make sure that Muggleborns cant be excluded. maybe use that as a way to keep the Canon WIzarding world on track Somewhat.

But I think that the magical world would probably only take the best muggleborns who had managed to take conscious control of there magic like Lily Evans and Tom riddles.

** I wrote a short snippet that was something along those lines once, actually. Except rather than wizards retreating to a parallel Earth, they came from one in the first place, of the classical high fantasy variety.

Their being from an alternate dimension allowed some of their physics (their magic) to 'overwrite' local laws of physics, but that meant, vice versa, that any muggles who came to their dimension could use technology that would 'overwrite' their magic.

In any case, another similar thing I've seen was that one Voyage of the Starship Hedwig fanfic; Harry & co take lots of magical creatures and flee to another planet when they're targeted for genocide by muggles.

--------------

How different would the magical world be? Well...probably not all that much different. There might be no influx of muggleborns, but if we assume that all the other magical creatures are still there, you'd probably still have the same old societal divides...except that giants might be allowed to live in more fertile places, any misinformation/propaganda/obliviation office would be targeted at fellow magicals rather than muggles...and Voldemort & Grindelwald's respective campaigns were targeted at dominance over muggles, so if they didn't aim to control some other magical creature (goblins, perhaps?), they most likely wouldn't end up being dark lords...Grindelwald wouldn't, anyway. Voldemort might, what with his obsession with immortality.

On the subject of Voldemort, though, there wouldn't be any half-bloods, or (as mentioned earlier) muggleborns; what would the magical world do without that division? Something I've noticed about the HP world is that wizards and witches place themselves above all other magical creatures, even the most intelligent such as veela, goblins, centaurs, house-elves, and the like; they've appointed themselves governor over all these races, and feel entitled to control their rights (wand use limits, house-elf enslavement as standard, forests allocated to centaurs, etc).

If all these creatures had an all-magical world to share, with no risk of being discovered by muggles, I wonder; would this 'humans want to control everyone' trend vanish with all the different species establishing their own territories, or mixed communities, or would it grow with human-supremacists trying to enslave all other creatures in the absence of muggleborns to lash out at?

--------------

As for our 'normal' Earth that all the magicals have left, if muggleborns continued to be born, and successfully reproduced (remember, this was in the height of fears about witchcraft)...actually...

It occurs to me, that European regions, those going through witchcraft and devil-worship hysteria, would target muggleborns as they discovered their accidental magic, and probably, well, try to exterminate them. With large numbers of superstitious peasants and soldiers vs untrained teens, they'd most likely be fairly successful in preventing a magical population from forming there.

Other regions would...probably be the same, to be honest; when faced with disease and people need a scapegoat, or when there's wealth and property up for grabs, I'd expect people to go after the boy/girl with apparently supernatural powers. Even today in real life, accusations of witchcraft are a popular pretext to kill innocent people and steal their stuff.

On the other hand, if you had a region where muggleborns were respected (or even revered), possibly being believed to be blessed by a god or pagan spirit, they would have quite a lot of potential to survive, and reproduce; doubly-so if the people of said region realise that the gift of magic is passed down through blood. But then, they would have to be a fairly advanced region, lest they be invaded and conquered (and their muggleborns exterminated) by witchcraft-hating countries.

1692 to 1992 (when the first year of Harry Potter ends and the second one starts) isn't a huge amount of time for muggleborns to be born and propagate, though...even if they multiplied exponentially, there might only be a few thousand magicals descended from muggleborns in a country by that time, assuming that they weren't murdered as they appeared.

There is another factor to take into account, though; modernisation of civilization. In the 19th century there were a huge amount of innovations and innovations that made worldwide communication and transport a reality, the population boomed, the study of biology really became a thing...

With all that, you have both a potential super-sized jump in muggleborn births and survival rates, but also greater visibility and public scrutiny...and you have scientists trying to figure out how their strange powers work; given that magic at the very least is shown in the HP books to obey cause-and-effect, and that it's reproducible enough for a school to teach it to young teens...who knows what could happen then?

*** for Voldemort & Grindelwald I see Grindelwald maybe wanting it so that the original magicals would rule the new magical that have replaced the muggles after all in his mind they came first so they must be superior.

Voldemort maybe The Head the A group that wants to keep the Two worlds separate. and another group that wants to allow free travel between the two earths. with the Ministry in the middle wanting to keep to the status quo. and then the group that wants free travel does something to show the Muggle decedents that magic exists leading to conflict all round.

Another thing to consider would be that There would not be enough parts for the wands if there was suddenly 6 billion more magicals so That could be a point of conflict with the original Wizards not wanting animals like unicorns and Dragons to be treated terribly to mass produce wand parts and the Muggeborn descendants not liking that the Original magical are keeps wand all to themselves

** I have a kernel of an idea to sort of do AU Mars as magical refuge. Vanishing cabinets or whatever as magic transport; a veil masking magical communities from muggle observation; runes to conjure water/air. Magicals are tough, maybe they lack of magnetosphere won't bother them. Goblins can expand caverns underground. And then you've got all that actual historical supposed seeing of ley lines on Mars.
