Is there any good gen fics featuring Sirius as the protagonist? It can be time-travel, canon years, marauders years, a character study of him in Azkaban... I'd prefer it if there wasn't romance, but I'll take what I can get. Slash is fine.

I've already read A Black Comedy, Stages of Hope and that time travel one with Hermione. Also read all of Starfox5's fics, which I know have him on a prominent role.

Thanks for your help!


** If you want a motivated, determined, somewhat Machiavellian Sirius, try linkffn(back again? Siriusly? By manchester). Sadly abandoned, but some interesting ideas. Time travel. No pairing. Somewhat dark.

  The concept of the 'do-over' is used in, at the very least, hundreds of Harry Potter stories. Here's my own take, using a HP character that actually has a good reason for getting another chance to make things better.

  Sirius Black... we know that he was imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. We've all seen Harry's point of view---but what about Sirius's? From the moment Harry is born to falling through the veil---this jail bird is making a break for it.

** linkffn(In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life by SilverWolf7007) sounds like what you're looking for; as a bonus, is has a well-written snarky Harry.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

** The Shoebox Project has my favourite characterization of younger Sirius (and James). It also does a good job with Snape, which can be hit or miss in Marauder era fics.
