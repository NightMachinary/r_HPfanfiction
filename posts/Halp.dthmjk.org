Are there 1-2 people out there that would like to help write/co-author a fic (possibly several, but let's go with one first) that I've been working on for a while?

I have this giant clusterfuck of ideas that vaguely resemble a script floating around my computer and I'd really appreciate it if someone would be willing to help me organize that and form it into a story.

Add onto that, I really need someone to bounce ideas off/ keep mine in check.

I can't really offer you anything other than the aformentioned role of co-author, all of the cyber cookies and my gratitude.


** I'm just going to say this.

There has never been a fic with “co-writers” that was worth reading.

If you have a good idea, great! Start with an outline of the overall plot. Plan the overall main story start to finish. Then break that outline down into pieces, and each piece into a chapter. Flesh out the chapter outlines as needed, and bam, you're done.

If you need an editor or beta, those are available. However - write your own story!

Good luck.

*** Thanks for the advice!

My current problem is, I guess, that for like two and a half years I just collected ideas and now I'm kind of intimidated by that bulk^^

**** Spend some time working out why you want to write. Do you want to get better from a technical point? Do you want to explore a partiular part of the HP world, do you want to just have fun, do you want to bask in tons of favourites?

Whatever your answer is can help you trim that 'bulk.'

** I have so many of my own ideas to work on that I couldn't help co-authoring it. But I'd love to help you bounce through the ideas and look at drafts for you if you need.

** I'd be down for bouncing ideas off of, always love to hear what people are thinking up, especially when you sort of get each others ideas.
