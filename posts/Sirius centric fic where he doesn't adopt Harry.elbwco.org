He still can help him and be a mentor figure. Maybe get him adopted by another family. But hes more the fun uncle to Harry in the fic not a parent. And his story cant be about taking care of Harry. I love Sirius adopts Harry stories but in stories he lives and is a important charscter in more often than not I only see him being a father figure and not doing much else. So id like some more variety i guess.

Id like him to live ( preferably Remus lives too) Preferably Sirius is MC and story is Sirius centric but if not he is like secondary MC and still gets a arc which is very important to.story. Sirius's arc cant be Harry centric beyond like helping him kill Voldemort.

It cant be marauders time has to be adult Sirius but doesnt have to be set when Harry is in school. Can start earlier. But has to start after he leaves hogwarts.

No Sirius/OC, No Sirius/self insert, No Sirius/any minor chatacter who was only ever name dropped briefly and not expanded on at all and same applies to others. Replace Sirius's name with those of other major Canon characters too same restrictions .

No Sirius or anyone from his generation or older / Anyone from Harrys gen even with time travel

No genderbending. There can be trans characters but i dont consider that the same thing as genderbending.

Apart from that any ship is fine slash femslash het it all good. No ships are also fine though I prefer plot based to ship based for story.

**** Yeah, James/Sirius is one of my favourite pairs & it makes me sad it's not that common. If you finish these, there are some other really good ones under the "'James Potter/Sirius Black" tag on AO3.
