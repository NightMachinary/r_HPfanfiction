Fics where Harry studies somewhere else, could have OC's or none, as long as it is not Hogwarts. Like Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy or Niflheim Academy


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

So, this fic is pretty old, and one of the only ones I personally know if that take place in another school. Being so old, there are probably a multitude of problems I could list. The series is of course abandoned. I do think that this series is fun though, just be aware that it has not aged the most gracefully.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2816397/1/Bloody-Skies]])

This is another one that I read a long time ago and quit because I some how got blindsided by the slash (even though it was in the summary...). I really cannot tell you much about it.

That is all I have for now. I know there are some about Ilvermorny, but I have not read any of those.

Hopefully those can give you some amount of joy if you have exhausted all other options.

Edit:

linffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

How could I have forgotten this fic haha. Super awesome, abandoned though. Give it a whirl when you have the time.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), is also super!Harry fic. Because he was blind from Voldemort's attack, Petunia really took pity of him and the Dursleys treated him rather well. Hermione later joined him at his high school after being injured by the troll.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is my preferred 'Harry not at Hogwarts' fic, and here are some of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ptand/request_political_fics_pls_like_dodging_prison/dktrba6/][my takes]] on that story.

Both "Blindness" and "Emperor" are still WIP, but in their final story arcs, so I expect them eventually to be finished.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), has Harry trained by someone else. He showed up at Hogwarts only during Year 7. Needless to say, he was not welcome by anyone, even Ginevra was hostile to him at first.

The last third of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), happens at Beauxbaton. This used to be one of my top favorites, until I grew tired of all the Ron bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), features an extreme AU in which Harry, Weasleys, and Neville all went to Beauxbaton. Hermione and Ron are however the main characters in this fic.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
