When you use the "What's that fic"? flare, you're already telling us that you're looking for a fic. If your title is "Can't find this fic" or something similar, you've told us nothing. I've seen people say they won't even look at those. *Give us a hint!*

- List a pairing, if there is one, so that those who don't read those stories know they won't be able to help.
- If it's a time travel, next generation, Marauders or Founders era, say so.
- Special quirk in the plot? Put it in the title.

Help us, help you!


** A noble attempt, but unfortunately the type of person who asks for help in the rudest manner possible is also the type of person to ignore advice on good posting etiquette.

And conversely, the type of person to heed such advice is also the type of person who already takes the basic consideration of writing an appropriate title to their post.

*** I know, I know. But every now and then I feel compelled to try. Maybe one or two people who are new will learn better. I know I've learned from the occasional rant (which is why I read the Meta tagged posts).

*** Yeah... I once commented on a post with a useless title and the OP basically told me that it was intentionally click bait-y to get more people to look and that that's a good way to post.

** Rules for titles should be something like;

“What's that fic?” :: “WTF - (information about the fic)”

WTF - Harry is a cat animagus

“Looking for:” :: “LF - (information about the fic)”

LF - Starwars xovers

**** Haha, oh yeah. I see it now. I don't know, it adds a certain charm to it.

Maybe “F? - ( )” would be better.

***** I don't like that idea, because new people would be like "why is there a letter, what does that mean ?"

Then they'll rightly assume it's for a name, like W is Weasley, LF is some obscure character they don't know, or a strange pairing they can't figure out.

** Also, when "looking for a fic like X", please describe what you liked about it. Characterizations, cool action scenes, intricate magic? Otherwise even people who have read it can't be sure what exactly you liked about it.

*** Or, you know, a link to the fic you're referencing, because I don't remember every title of every story I've read.
