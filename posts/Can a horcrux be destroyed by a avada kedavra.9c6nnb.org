** Horcruxes are very fragile. Its a soul fragmet in a vessel. Its the vessel itself that is normally protected. If you break the vessel the fragment is destroyed. If the killing curse will destroy the vessel then it will destroy the horcrux. In the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort we see that the killing curse can have destructive qualities to it even when it is intercepted. That's enough evidence for me to say it wouldn't be silly to use it in a story.

** First, spoilers dude.

Second, technically we know it can a la Harry's little trip through the woods to camp Death Eater. Now, I think another way to ask this is can the curse work on non living objects?

My thought is probably not. The reasoning would be that the method itself makes little difference. What matters is that you have left the container incapable of holding the soul fragment anymore. Now that's a bit weird, since you would figure Harry would need to be ripped Harry apart or decapitate him him like Nagini, but there is little chance Voldemort placed any protections on his unknown Horcrux. Dumbledore seems pretty adamant about how dumb an idea a living Horcrux actually is, which might imply the necessities for destruction are lower.

Bottom line, with a non living Horcrux, probably not. With a living one, definitely.

*** I agree with your opinion my good sir.

Sorry for the spoilers.

Still not sure if it would have worked on nagini (As dumbledore would have said,“we have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested.”)

**** I think you mean ‘you three have...' from Dumbledore. And he was also referring to the connection by blood and the brother wands, only strengthening the weirdness.

When you word it like that, it makes it sound like Dumbledore was a Horcrux, or even weirder that he was actually Nagini. And while there is a theory about Dumbledore turning Fawkes into his own Horcrux using Ariana's death and then dying OotP, I doubt Dumbledore is that weird.

***** lol i didn't think anyone would actually recognise the phrase and where it was from. I know he was taking about the wand connection. i was just concluding my own point (we-the people in the discussion)

**** What he means is the horcrux in Harry's head was destroyed by a killing curse by the snake man himself. So in anwser to your question yes the AK is perfectly capable of destroying horcruxes

******* I mean, you can be smart if you want, but JK Rowling herself has said that he wasn't. He held his soul and therefore acted as one, but he didn't have the same protections and whatnot that the other Horcruxes did.

** Another intersting fact is that no one person destroys more than one horcrux in canon. Is that a coinicidence?

** According to JK Rowling she saw Harry as different to an ordinary horcrux-so potentially not. But there's nothing against it in canon. I have heard it said that only living horcruxes can be destroyed by it, which makes sense as they are the container that is destroyed.
