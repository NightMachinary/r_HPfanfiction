Hey there, I'm looking for some Epilogue complaint H/Hr. Hopefully in the Vein of Unlike a Sister.


** Vain or vein?...

Anyway, you might consider checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]], who has several post-Hogwarts H/Hr tales. Most aren't really my thing (I'm not a fan of infidelity fics) but they're popular among the H/Hr crowd and generally well written.

*** I tried reading /Senses/ but it starts off so damned sad with everyone angry at each other. It's well written, but I don't know if it's fun.

** I frequently recommend [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]]. Hope it fits your bill.

** Oh, absolutely [[https://fanfiction.net/s/4418163/1/Fulfilling-Obligations][Fulfilling Obligations]]. It's the closest in quality to Unlike a Sister and is still epilogue compliant even though in takes a while to get there.
