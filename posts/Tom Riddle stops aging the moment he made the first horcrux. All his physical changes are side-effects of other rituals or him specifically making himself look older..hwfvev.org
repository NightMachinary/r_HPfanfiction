It's more or less a consensus that Horcruxes don't stop the aging process, so I'd like to see a fic that goes against that.

I'd prefer if the fic is around 100k, I don't really mind tropes that much. Thanks, everyone!


** I'm not really quite sure where you get the idea that there's a consensus... could you explain?

It's true that the issue of Voldemort aging isn't really addressed very frequently, partially because JK never really writes any discernible age-related descriptions for her characters in general, but also because he doesn't look human and usually dies before the issue becomes super relevant.

In any case, in the fics I've read where Voldemort /does/ live for a long time, I generally see people reverting his appearance to normal, following which the aging issue isn't mentioned. The only one I can think of off the top of my head where Horcruxes don't stop the aging process is Blood Crest, which is still somewhat of a conditional /maybe/.

Maybe I'm just reading your question wrong. If not, though, check out linkao3(Mi Aedijekit) for an immortal Voldemort dealing with the issues that come from /not/ aging.
