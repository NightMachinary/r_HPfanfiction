So, yeah. I haven't read all that many fics that do interesting things with supernatural spiritual entities or the incorporeal undead, so I'm hoping the sub can provide! It can be a big or small portion of the fic.

For clarity, I'm including the old 'Demonic Apparitions' and 'Will of the Wisp' type entities that always were spirits too, as well as the actual once-living-and-now-returned style undead type ghosts. Just anything that isn't generic zombies and vampires, y'know?

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

*** That's definitely not a rec I've seen before, and it's a novel-ish idea, so thank you! I've always enjoyed the weirder Master of Death fics. :)
