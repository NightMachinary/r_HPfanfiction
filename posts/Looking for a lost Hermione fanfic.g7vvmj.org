:END:
Basically, Voldemort won the war and since so many people died he starts brainwashing muggleborns and giving them new identities. Hermione is one of them, but she doesn't forget who she really is. She ends up turning into Voldemort's right hand, then there's a scene where she has to torture Ron but she saves him? Anyways, Draco is a spy and he drugs Hermione and takes her to the order. I don't remember anything else!


** I don't recognize it but I kinda want to read it now...

I know a similar one where Lucius Malfoy rules the country, Hermione is brainwashed and part of Lucius's private military. Draco's a bad guy though and Ron is the one who gets her to the Order. Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

*** I'm still reading it but it's really good and even though I usually don't read Ron and Hermione because it's mostly really forced, in this fanfic it just flows! Thanks for recommendation!
