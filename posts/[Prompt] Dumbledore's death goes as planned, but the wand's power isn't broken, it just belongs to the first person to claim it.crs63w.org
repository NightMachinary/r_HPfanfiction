Not canon, please don't attack the prompt.


** Someone has to clean the Astronomy Tower regularly, which is where the wand dropped, so...

*** That brings up a good question, If the elder wand is so much more powerful than other wands could it be used on whatever magic a muggle or squib has?

** So the wand would function exactly as it was supposed to before Rowling did her author bullshit and ruined it with garbage?

The wand always worked for whoever took it, regardless if the ex-owner was dead or not, or was killed or not.

The entire Malfoy-Harry-Snape-Voldemort crap was pure unfiltered garbage.

** 'goes as planned' as in Dumbledore dies without malicious cause, takes it to his grave, and is literally buried with it some time in the 2100s?

Or 'goes as planned' as in SKDâ„¢, and resolves like canon?

**** Then Snape picks up the wand, 'claiming' it, then Voldy takes it, and Voldy wins. Unless you want something stupidly convoluted, like a firstie calling dibs on his wand before Dumbledore ever dies.
