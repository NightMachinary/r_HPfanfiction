There's a magical accident in OotP while at St Mungo's. By accident Harry gets trapped inside Lockhart's body and is believed crazy when starts telling people that he is the real Harry Potter. Meanwhile, a Lockhart with all of his charm and wit back is sent to Hogwarts in Harry's body.

** I always liked a darker take on this trope:

Harry falls in love with X.

X isn't X, though: She's been possessed by something or someone else, and the girl Harry met, got to know, fell for, married, and had kids with? Meat-puppet.

As for the original inhabitant of the body? Either they're trapped inside their own head, helplessly screaming (think Goa'uld) to themselves; in symbiosis with the possessing entity/spirit to the point where they're enslaved without realizing it; had their consciousness suppressed/rendered comatose; had their consciousness obliterated or removed; or their personality permanently altered or destroyed.

An example?\\
In a world where Harry and Ron didn't become friends with Hermione, she, in her hubris in thinking she could handle anything as she grew older, eventually ran afoul of a book containing a spirit, much like Voldemort's horcrux diary, that promptly body-jacked her.

She was either possessed, trapped in her own mind, swapped places and is now trapped in the book the spirit was once in, or was hollowed out and her memories/life taken by the entity.

The 'Hermione' that became more socially palatable and eventually got involved with Harry or Ron? The spirit now living a second life as "Hermione Granger". Their children? Biologically Hermione's and Ron's/Harry's, but from Ron's/Harry's and 'her' spirit.

Or, alternatively and more sinisterly, the artifact didn't contain any consciousness or memories but an imprint of the owner's personality: Hermione promptly suffers a personality death and replacement, while her memories/consciousness remain intact.

Another example? Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass has one of these fates befall her, and her/"her" personality changes as a result. In narrative and out of story, it'd be a creepy subversion of the "Ice Queen" trope.

Another? "Madam Rosmerta" is actually an ancient entity that survives by body-jacking a targeted girl every time the body's natural life-span is at an end. She remains close to Hogwarts to basically pick out her next meat-suit/victim, after they've passed a strict criteria of requirements, and each owner of the Three Broomsticks is actually her old identity bequeathing/"selling" it to her new one.

She's even had children/taken husbands in her new bodies, and she fondly watches over her various children/their lineage (and making sure not to take any of them as her new body).

Rosmerta, the /original/ Rosmerta, for example, was chosen as she was finishing her sixth or seventh year of Hogwarts, and she was possessed soon after graduating: Her taking over the Three Broomsticks surprised all her friends, as they thought she had been hell-bent on a more esoteric career path.

*** I once read a story where Bellatrix disguises herself as a teenage muggle(?) girl. He fell in love with her... etc.

Don't remember the name though
