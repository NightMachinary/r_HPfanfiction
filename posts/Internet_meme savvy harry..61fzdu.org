I'm looking for any stories where harry is basically a computer nerd. Whether he applies what he learned from the internet or not Doesn't bother me as long as i get a internet toughned/savvy harry. For example snapes rants are nothing compared to the peoples of the internet and therefore he doesn't get irrationaly angry. I also don't want an overly complicated or crossover heavy story like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/40/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar]]. As enjoyable as it was i'm looking for something more on the fun side without trying to wade through half a dozen different things.


** Harry Potter, The Geek may fit what you're looking for.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved to the modern day.
