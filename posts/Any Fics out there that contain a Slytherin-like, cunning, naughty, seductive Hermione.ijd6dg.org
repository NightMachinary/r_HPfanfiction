I thought that she should be straight in her goals and know, what she wants. To gain this, she would be cunning....like a Slytherin. But she also wouldnt hold back in seducing or even sleeping with a Man.

Well, i had the idea, that atleast Draco and Cormac might be the target of her attention. The latter was atleast attracted for her in the Canon. But both might get on her with progressing Years and she becoming more attractive...maybe. It doesnt matter if Draco (or other Partner/s) is married and she becomes a "scarlet woman"
