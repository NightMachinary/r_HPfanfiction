** "So," I began nervously, shuffling my feet and staring intently at my scuffed white tennis shoes.

"So," Ron replied. From the corner of my eye I could see his arms were crossed. Hermione and Harry didn't say a word, but they too were shifting uncomfortablely.

I said nothing else for a few moments. The question burned on my lips but my fear kept it at bay. When I finally gained the courage to look up, I had to REALLY look up because Ron is TALL. His eyes were narrowed and his wand twirled in his hand.

Hermione stood on his right, Crookshanks cradled in her arms. Her hair was as wild as I imagined it, but it fell artfully to her shoulders. She bit her lip as she eyed me warily, but I couldn't blame her a bit.

Harry was frightening.

His scar was in the shape of an actual lightning bolt instead of the rune sowilo like I thought it would be. His hair was a mess, but in a way that was similar to my cousin. His face was carefully neutral, but I could tell he was tense, his knuckles white as he gripped his own wand.

"So," I began again, mouth uncomfortablely dry. "How far off the mark was I?"

Ron's eyes widened before he scoffed. Crookshanks started to squirm in Hermione's arms and Harry turned his attention from myself to Ron, his brows raised.

"How far off the mark," he mocked. "I'd say bLOODY WELL OFF THE DAMN MARK."

He ranted for a solid hour, Harry and Hermione watching with interest and amusement. Previous tenseness fading away as Ron defended their and his own honor from the horror the my world's fanfics.

I let him, because after all, I deserve it.

** Well...assuming I didn't have an existential crisis over being transported in a world I believe to be fictional (and the likelyhood of myself therefore being someone else's fictional character with all that implies), and everybody else doesn't go into hysterics over having knowledge dumped into their heads about me by some unseen force...\\
How /would/ that play out? A person appears out of thin air nearby you, whom you are suddenly certain believes you to be fictional and has written all sorts of bizarre fanfic about you. Is this 'author' really not from your world? How do you know so much about them? Are you truly just a fictional character subject to the whims of whomever's writing you?\\
 \\
I guess things wouldn't go /that/ badly, questioning of the nature of reality aside. I don't bash too much, most of what I write is mini-fics and prompts and 'what-ifs'...and, bonus, I'd finally get to find out the actual in-universe reasons for house-elves being slaves.\\
 \\
Although my most recent snippets are of a dementor blowing a raspberry in Harry's ear, Peter Pettigrew making a pact with Bahamut, Snape complaining that the study of potions remains in the stone age, and a parody of 'Harry's inheritance' fics where Harry literally inherits everyone and everything in magical Britain, so I'm not sure how everyone would feel about those.\\

** I haven't written anything really in general not specifically the hp fandom but I have read a lot of fucked up stuff not always on purpose but honestly what would any of the main cast do? If we are talking about the cannon characters I wouldn't think they would do anything about someone reading about characters that resemble them. Also when are we transported to? Year 1? 2? Post war? Marauders era? When? And HOW do they know what I've read? Does the knowledge get placed into all their heads the second I arrive in universe? If so and if its its anything before year 3 then sorry Harry has been super traumatized by all the smut I've read about him fucking milfs at 15, or monster girls, or plants, or any of the other weird stuff I've stumbled across reading fanfiction. And that's just me imagine this happening to one of those disgusting freaks who read Snarry, Drarry, Tomarry, fics where he gets nonconsensual gangbanged by deatheaters or spread open by dragons or giants or squid. All of that knowledge just appearing in the mind of cannon Harry. You know not the weird fannon Harry that wants to fuck and get fucked by every dude in the series but one that would be disgusted by the mere hint of a thought that he would ever fuck a guy let alone draco malfoy. Yeah he end up worse than the longbottoms.

*** Then I would suggest 'In the Forest of Dean' by T3Tohru on Ao3, to help round out that last bit then. Its got a wonderful splash of about everything you listed there. Morally grey Harry and Hermione, after Ron leaves them during the hunt, become who they need to be to survive on their own after a couple mishaps. Dumbledore is a bit too reliant on friendly ideals, but not overly bad per say. Realistic friends-to-lovers timeline and get together. Small spurts of tasteful smut. Pain, passion, love, angst, new dark stranger to teach them new things, it's beautiful.

As you can tell I like this story, it is Hermione-centric. But not really an in your face type of way, it has some chapters focused on Ginny, Arthur, or Snape to capture their POV during the war.

Sorry for the recommend lol, just thought you may want to clean up your record and fill it in with a decent fic.

I'm probably going to end up in hell there if this were to actually happen. No one knows what I read. But now everyone would know. Kiss/kill on site would be accurate. Depends on my mood.

**** ok, so in that se I can mostly excuse myself with the review thing for all the shit that I read, might get a vew interesting comments about all the crossovers about it. Maybe someone commenting how suspicious that I have reviewed so many of some of those genres (just saying, there's a suspicious amount of character bashing that I read and I did start reading a lot of yaoi when I was done reading all the hetero pairs that I could stomach and needed more reading suplies to feed this hungry fanfic devouring brain of mine) and if I didn't like some of them, then why did I read them all the way through while other's I stopped halfway and so on.

Explaining the Snarry I'm currently writing might be a bit complicated, but it was a challenge prompt from a friend and, while Snape would immediatly go on the offense, I'm pretty sure Harry would give me a chance to explain (I'm not gonna comment on the other characters, though XC).

If the stories I have planned but haven't started writing also counted then I could rest assured because most of them I try to stay close to the characters and it could further give me the benefit of the doubt, but since so far the only written works I have with Harry Potter characters are Silver Generation, the Niwatoko Timeline and Braving the Weather and Crossing Paths, plus the unpublished Snarry, it would give them a percentage of 25% chance of writing another such egregious story again so I can feel the judgement coming XP

** If this includes crossovers then i would die on the spot. There was too much kinky stuff.
