This basically.

If I can recall correctly the Aurors' training is 4 years, and we see that some of them are exceptionally young, like Tonks, so it would seem like you can have access to it right out of Hogwarts.

Obviously we don't know much about them in canon, but in fanon usually both Sirius and James are depicted as very eager to start fighting for the Order and give their contribution to the war, just like Harry in OotP. Remus too, but a bit less, and my personal headcanon is that he does it because it's the right thing to do but he really always wanted to become either a teacher or a healer (as far as the other Marauders gifting him a suitcase with the "Professor R.J. Lupin" on it as a bit of a joke, as the suitcase is described to be old and worn out in PoA even if Remus never worked as a teacher before) and Peter only did it cause the others did, and cause he believed that the Order would protect him.

I would say, tho, that it would just seem right to me if James and Sirius went along with it and became Aurors.

What is your opinion on this? Is there some diffused fanon theory about why they didn't?


** Maybe part of the reason was because the Ministry itself was corrupt and well infiltrated by then (at the time of the Marauders leaving Hogwarts)? Voldemort was at the peak of his influence back then anyway.

Also, it just fits Sirius and James better to become rebels and enlist with the vigilante Order rather than become official agents of the Ministry.

*** Definitely agree with this, I never thought about it. Although I would think they considered the Aurors as something a bit separated from the rest of the ministry, seeing how many Order members (Moody, Kingsley, Frank and Alice Longbottom, etc) were Aurors

**** Also, if James and Sirius were Aurors (or even training to be one), then I'm pretty sure it would have popped up in some conversation, including:

- Hagrid mentioning Harry's parents to Harry (though, to be fair, JKR didn't use the term 'Auror' until book four. My suspicion is that Auror was a retcon of 'Hit Wizard', which only popped up once across the entire series, in book three).

- Harry talking to Neville at some point (especially after the St Mungo's visit).

- Augusta Longbottom, upon meeting the trio at the ward.

- Fudge discussing Sirius.

- Anyone discussing Sirius, including the newspapers.

- McGonagall or Umbridge at Harry's careers-advice session.

- Dumbledore at some point.

- Snape mocking James (especially if James never made it out of the training phase, for whatever reason).

- Scrimgeour trying to lure Harry over to the Ministry side.

Etc.

** The Potters were 21 when they died, and Sirius got tossed in a hole.

They'd been in hiding over a year ( likely more than two given Harry was 15 months), and fighting before that.

James didn't live long enough to get through even wartime training.

**** I think people have a much different impression of their ages due to the casting of the films. Sirius and Snape are both in their early 30's, and played by excellent actors... who were both in their 50's. Adrian Rawlins, who played James in the first movie, was in his early 40's and looked it. Geraldine Somerville, their Lily, was 34.

That said, I rather like the fanon concept that gets kicked around of them unofficially training with Mad-Eye, with an eye to dropping them into the Auror fast-track after the war.

** Rowling has said they worked full time for the Order, and given they were both wealthy this seems sensible.

But although they might have wanted to dedicate themselves to fighting against Voldemort, that doesn't necessarily mean it was their career ambitions. They might have had different wishes for after the war - there are hints that James was especially gifted at Transfiguration so perhaps he wanted to do something with that, or Quidditch.

** Maybe they thought they would be able to help more if they're full time Order members? As far as we know James, Lily and Remus lived off the Potter inheritance and Sirius got enough from his uncle. They could afford not to work.

**** I think it's plausible, but it must mostly be a case of not wanting/having to get a job. If they were so dedicated to helping the order, why would they not reveal their animagus forms which would've been really useful to the order?

** When you're really rich, it's a different kind of world.

Jobs stop being a fact of life. They start being optional. They start being a “if you want to”.

People who are aurors (policemen) have to follow rules. They have to follow a chain of command. They have to get up at a certain time and be at the office at a certain time for their shifts. They have to ‘yessir' to Barty Crouch. James and Sirius were wealthy enough that they got to /choose/ not to bother with any of that.

James and Sirius wanted to ride motorcycles and shoot bad guys. And they didn't have to join the aurors to do that. They could just throw galleons at the problem of food, housing, clothing, bills, and then... ride motorcycles and shoot (spells at) bad guys.

Also, I don't think they really liked following rules, so idk if them being Aurors would've worked. Entrepreneurs maybe, like Fred and george

*** I mean Harry didn't need to work either seeing how he had bot the Potter family's and Sirius's inheritance but he still did. I don't think being rich enough to affort to not work is necessarily an excuse to actually not work, i think i still would do something if I was rich or I would go crazy not doing anything all day lol

**** I think Harry has a very different mentality compared to them because he didn't grow up rich. Jobs pay a lot less than any kind of business. It is possible that they'd go for salaried jobs, especially Sirius, whose inheritance comes from his uncle and not the main black family.

*** Bro now that you make me think about it I don't know lmfao. It think it's never really mentioned that they were but it's not stated that they weren't either? So I guess they could have. At that point James probably quit to go into hiding with Lily, and Sirius was probably arrested just before officially becoming one. I'd say the auror training would start around autumn to allow the Hogwarts graduates to think about it and study for/pass the selection exams, so that doesn't seem a that much of a stretch as Sirius was arrested and sent to Azkaban in early November exactly 4 years after leaving Hogwarts. Brilliant solution!

**** Except there is a long disputed question [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Potters_in_hiding.htm][when did Potters went into hiding]] and related “how old where they when they died?". Apparently JKR used [[https://www.patheos.com/blogs/leithart/2015/10/double-time-othello/][Shakespearian dual-time]], so it is not very clear.

(That site has quite pro-Snape bias, but it is absolute treasure trove of [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm][canon-v-fanon issues]] and [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Britrefs.htm][Briticisms]])

** If auror training is 4 years, it would be impossible for James or Sirius to take it. We know for a fact that the Potters are in hiding for a year atleast because Harry is born, and I believe Sirius is in hiding too, to sell his part as faux secret keeper. Even without harry, Lily and James die at 21, less than 4 years post-graduation. Plus, the Ministry is very suspect in these times, and Law Enforcement is led by Barty Crouch, a notorious anti-Dark wizard. He probably wouldn't allow a Black to join. Mature James would definitely not stupidly risk his life after having a kid, nd being an auror definitely falls under stupid risk. I don't see it realistically happening unless serious alterations are made to timelines and characters
