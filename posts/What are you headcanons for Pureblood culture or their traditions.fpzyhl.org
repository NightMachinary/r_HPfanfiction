** - Strong emphasis on charmed clothing and outer appearance
- Heirlooms or enchanted items that protect against Obliviation and other forms of memory charms, with the exception of the Imperius Curse
- Witches have comparatively far greater influence than Muggle women. In fact, one major gripe of Purebloods against Muggles is their discrimination based on sex and skin colors
- "The past was better" as a predominant attitude, thus, emphasis on tradition and dislike changes
- Rejection of Aramaic monotheism because of its hostility toward magic

*** I share all your headcanons. I'll add, in general I tend to imagine Pureblood culture more in the lines of /might is right/, where the individual is placed in the center and glorified rather than /here's 55 thousand types of forks, better know exactly in which order to eat with them or you become a mockery in society./

​

Edit: Strangely though, when I mentioned in the past that it's unrealistic for Wizards to be so open to Abrahamic beliefs, people went up in arms all the time.

*** The third point! It's actually a pet peeve of mine when fic authors make the wizarding society utterly misogynistic (like 19th century or something), when in the books I always got the vibe that witches and wizards have an equal standing and it have been so for a long time. Sadly, even a lot of otherwise great authors often use this “housewife witches” trope.

*** I share those though id like to add that in my headcanon some pureblood families are a magical version of Christianity that beleives Magic is a gift from God and proof that the holy spirit is a thing.

Mainly because at least to me it doesn't make sense that some Magical didnt get in on the protestant reformation

*** I think magical culture has had gender equality a lot longer than muggle communities - muggle power imbalance stems from "might is right" physically. Magical skill and power is a great equaliser.

I also think they'd reject most widespread religion, again because of historical prejudice against practitioners of witchcraft.

I recall when I first got into reading fanfiction that I enjoyed all the takes on "pureblood supremacy stems from fearing cultural erosion because of an influx of muggles from judeo-Christian cultures". I might even write a fanfic of my own based on that premise.

** (I just want to warn you that these headcanons mostly apply to Europe since, want it or not, Harry Potter is very European-Centric and traditions and culture could be night and day from one continent to another)

- Hardcore traditionalists pure-blood families from upper-class practice magical rituals on the holidays of the Wheel of the Year to magically enhance and help their estates. They've become mostly out of trend over the twentieth century because some of them need an animal sacrifice (i.e. Samhain among others), but their significance is still known and factored in for events in the greater pure-blood/half-blood population like Imbolc, for instance, which takes place in February and symbolises new beginnings among other things.
- This is weirdly specific and I'm not even Scandinavian, but I like to think wizards of high birth in the Nordic Union (mostly called Scandina via for shorter) still give a Norwegian forest kitten to their significant other as a gift after being officially engaged like the Norse used to do.
- This as been said before, but highly charmed clothing even if the fabric isn't enchantable. You want Warming Charms on your dragon-hide winter boots? Let us put a lining with the enchantments on it for an extra fee.
- Squibs and/or witches and wizards will be used by the richest of pure-bloods on the continent as servants alongside house-elves. They will be the one to dress and clean the masters' clothes and will serve at the table among other things.
- Greco-latin names are very popular all over Europe and sometimes native names will be latinised. It's for this reason the name Hestia was a very popular name for witches during from the mid 1970s to early 1980s.
- Witches and wizards are very Napoleonic in the way they see society. Meaning they are meritocratic and value the hierarchy already in place at the same time. This as caused them to greatly shun revolutionary movements like the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution and Communism in general. It was so great in Russia, in fact, that the wizarding Duma passed a Muggle Act that made it a criminal offence for any magical being inside their borders to be in any way of contact with Muggles and live inside or near densely Muggle-populated areas and caused the Duma and the wizaridng Imperial Court to abandon Petrograd and Moscow for Siberia, the Central Steppes and some very intensely charmed and protected region in Southern Russia and Muggle-born children are immediately taken from their families when they are detected by the book of admittance in Koldovstoretz and put with wizarding families instead. This indirectly caused Russia to be the most accepting magical nation towards Muggle-borns because there is virtually no cultural difference between pure-bloods and Muggle-borns by the time they attend school. Some Muggle-borns in Russia are even raised as nobles.
- Having three children is very common in pure-blood families during the 19th and 20th centuries. Although it cannot be controlled, this is seen as the perfect number so you can have an heir, a spare, and a daughter to marry to someone else. It also represents the wholeness of completeness of the number three seen in Arithmancy.
- Witches can fully inherit the titles of their parents even if they have a younger brother because it is a matter of who is born first instead of who - to put it crudely - has a penis. In this case, it will be the husband who will take the name of their spouse instead of the wife, and the witch will be able to pass her name to her children.
- Older witches in Western Europe will remember the early 1890s very fondly as the Muggle fashion was so eccentric that they barely had to change to go in the Muggle world. It was such that the ICW recorded the short period to be the one with the most contact between wizardkind and Muggles since the early days of the Statute of Secrecy in Europe outside of the Great War and Grindelwald's War. It was then that modern ice cream was really introduced to the wizarding world instead of sorbets. Sodas also became popular for a while but didn't last as much as ice cream except for some rare old souls who still reminisce their younger and carefree years.
- Pure-blood families don't marry their offspring inside their country only, they marry them all over the continent so as to keep the family line truly pure unlike what the British who are quite isolationist. This cause Muggle-borns to be more accepted in most of Europe minus exceptions because the pure-bloods are far from getting extinct.

**** I'm glad that you like my headcanon about Russia. I imagine them still having a Tsar, but since their true independence from the Muggles in 1896 they went down the path of constitutionalisation. What you need to know is that Tsar Nicolas II was very reluctant to be emperor and simply wanted to live a calm life in the countryside and raising his children with his wife. I imagine that when he was crowned, Nicolas would have seen the opportunity of escaping one of is roles without losing face to the public. That role was the title of Emperor of wizarding Russia. So, he contacted his distant cousin who was his informant about the magical world and offered him the throne of magical Russia.

Yadi Yada, Peter IV is crowned Tsar of wizarding Russia, but with something akin to the Council of Wizards and the Wizengamot having been put in place after the instalment of the Statute of Secrecy, Peter had to let go of a great part of his power but could still practice some of it without causing a constitutional crisis like what would happen in Britain. In short, Peter got to do what is cousin Nicolas would have done regarding the wizarding side of the empire: not much, but what he did mattered and what he said happened.

Peter IV also pushed for voting and inheritance reforms . The former expended the poll of those eligible to vote for the Prime Minister and his Cabinet while the latter let his eldest daughter, who would pass in history as Tsarina Catherine III, access to the throne and let her eldest child inherit it.

I haven't really structured the Imperial Court, but it would be very similar to the one of Peter the Great but different for modernity purpose, I imagine. I just used the word as a general term for the Imperial Family and their entourage.

** Since the wizarding world separated from the Muggle one in the late 17th century, their history before that was closely intertwined. Because magic gives an individual a tremendous advantage, most important historical figures before the Statute of Secrecy were actually wizards. The great Greek philosophers, Alexander the Great, Caesar, Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus etc.

To me it seems unlikely that pure-bloods are either pagans or atheists. As it is explicitly stated in the books, wizards do celebrate Christmas, Easter, and Hallowe'en. And since it is easy to fake miracles with magic, wizards were usually among the most important priests and highly Christian. Pure-bloods believed that magic was a divine power and that they were descended from angels or Christ, and this belief explains their arrogance. Only after the Statute of Secrecy this part of wizarding culture died out.

However, even after the Statute of Secrecy, some rogue wizards meddled with the Muggle world in order to gain power. Napoléon Bonaparte was a wizard and considered a Dark Lord during his time. The Bolshevik revolution was orchestrated by Grindelwald, and Lenin (who was a wizard) was his puppet. Also the Nazis were Grindelwald's puppets, but Hitler was not a wizard. Operation Barbarossa started because British and French wizards usurped the People's Commissariat for Magic, making the Soviet Union break free from Grindelwald's control. The Soviet Union was in secret ruled by wizards even after the war, but when it collapsed, wizarding Russia remained communist because communism can work when magic is involved.

** That there are rules/pacts regarding hospitality (or there would be few social gatherings within a home).

Having a "My home is my castle" attitude wrt privacy. Secrecy is a matter of information control, so there are spells and enchantments to aid in maintaining family secrets.

Smaller families are common in the modern era due to concerns about inheritance splitting up wealth, not just because of the wars that occurred. This also makes purebloods more defensive about muggleborn ideas taking hold.

There are hedge witch magicks that are not taught in school, some of which might be done by squibs or those who have weaker powers.

Some pureblood families send their squibs to the muggle world with help, so they can be successful and therefore potentially help their families. They don't talk about it with non-family members, of course, both as strategy as well as embarrassment. But the larger, wealthier families are smart enough to realize that squibs might have magical children again. Family blood is important.

Blood adoption is a real thing in some families, but is still difficult/dangerous enough to be rare. There are cultural concerns as well as familial pride/beliefs.

Use of the family grimoire is earned in some families, and in others it goes only to the heir to the current head. They can be lost or stolen, so some families protect them with blood magic.

Rituals are dangerous but powerful, and only some families know them in modern times.

Alliances are important and enforced with magic.

Women have traditional magic that they learn from their mothers and aunts. They absolutely do not talk about it with men. There are some matriarchal families, and marrying into those families is tricky, but second sons are willing.

There is religious activity centered around the old calendar. The old families look down upon nonpracticing "newer" purebloods, and hate that a long, rich culture is losing strength. Faith and history are linked and can't be untangled without losing something valuable.

** - Wizards can't agree on what constitutes pure-blood.

- Before the Statute of Secrecy, some wizards held titles of Muggle nobility. Following the Statute and the accompanying rise in anti-Muggle sentiment, those titles became a source of shame rather than pride and wizarding noble families abandoned their titles.

- The majority of the population are pure-blooded: even if a Muggleborn marries into your family, within a few generations the family will once again be pure by most definitions.

- Accordingly, the wizarding elite are not the "pure-blood elite"; most pure-bloods are average joes.

- If you're a member of the elite but have some Muggle blood, you will generally be treated as if you were a pure-blood - so long as you do not rock the boat.

** Until 1692, the muggle and magical world were the same. Afterwards, the magical world wasn't affected by changes in the muggle world any more - Magical Poland was never divided, Magical Germany wasn't united, there is no MACUSA, but a variety of European-founded magical enclaves on the East Coast, a coalition of Native Shaman Tribes between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalaches, and Magical California, mostly.

Wizarding Britain is ruled by "Old Families" - a few dozen pureblood families that have inherited seats in the Wizengamot. They have cadet branches and client families that rely on them, and also control most of the countries economy through monopolies and aforementioned cadet and client families. Most of the purebloods, as well as the half-bloods and muggleborns, have no say in their government unless one of the Old Families speaks for them or they have contacts or a position in the Ministry, which is open to them, but riddled with nepotism and corruption. The Wizangamot is both parliament and high court, and so even justice is mostly a matter of politics.

After splitting from the muggle world, the purebloods in England tried to "go back to our roots", meaning, return to the pagan religion of their ancestors. Unfortunately, after more than 1000 years of Christianity, no one really knew much about that culture and religion any more, so what they ended up with was far from authentic - and mostly founded on a "authentic tome" that the Malfoys "discovered" in their manor. Not that most wizards and witches are actually religious, anyway - they go through the motions on important holidays, just like Muggles in England do.

2. Purebloods are pagan and hate muggleborns and halfbloods because they celebrate things like Christmas instead of Yule
3. Beltane, Samhain and other magical days are celebrated by purebloods, by performing rituals
4. The witches are seen as sneaky, terrifying and generally more powerful than the men. The witches in old families have secret covens.

** For me I could see the term pureblood he simply anyone with magical grandparents on both sides of the family. So basically if Harry married a pureblood witch his children are considered purebloods. Even if it's another trope I think multiple houses could be a thing(Multi marriage) it's designed to limit political power of families. Say if Harry is Lord Potter-Black he may be encouraged to marry multiple women.(especially if he married a heiress) The plan is within 2-3 generations they won't be close.

** There isn't a pure-blood culture, there aren't enough of them to generate a culture.

All they have is snobbery and the bits and pieces they've picked up from Muggle aristocracy over the years. Most of them don't know that's where they got it from, but that's the truth.

The snobbery is based on length of purely magical ancestry, the last few wars have thinned their ranks out so much they're reduced to incest.
