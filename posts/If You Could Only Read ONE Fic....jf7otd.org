If you could only read and recommend ONE fic for the next six months, which one would it be and why? Please use spoiler tags where necessary, obvs.

For me, I think it would either be linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89) for the length and emotional content of it,

OR!

Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by flamethrower) for the length and uniqueness of the story.

Boys of Crowhill was a very close third for me. Sorry, I'm a bit predictable I suppose. Hence why I want to see how other people think on the subject!

Not gonna start it tonight but it looks good. More seriously, going without reading fanfic for 6 months is no big deal. There's plenty of other stuff to read. I was into fanfic some years ago, then didn't read any at all for years, and more recently have gotten back into it. But I should probably stop soon since it's such a time sink.

** If I could recommend only one fic: "Fate is a Four Letter word" by Philo.

But for reading I would be hard-pressed to choose between "Fate" and one of the other longer fics mentioned here, especially the "Like None Other" series by Aspeninthesunlight.

I have already read "Fate" several times over the last few months. So while I love it and wouldn't mind having it the only fic I could read, I know most of it by heart by now, making it a bit boring.

"Like None Other" is something that I have been wanting to read again and catch up with the last posted chapters. Last time I read the whole thing, the second part was half-finished. But it is so long that I tend to get bored with it halfway through the first part. If I had nothing else to read I would probably be able to stick with it this time.

It's a straight-up crackfic with enough laughs to make it incredibly re-readable, some funny bashing that's so over the top you can't get made at it or take it seriously enough to get mad... and it has a running fart joke that makes the one in 'Blazing Saddles' look like it was done by a second-grader.

But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** For me, it would have to be "My Immortal" by Tara Gilesbie. It's the only 'work' that made me cringe enough to put down every paragraph or so. Since I usually go through stories at a really monstrous pace (when I first got to read OotP, I finished the thing in 20 min, then aced a quiz), so it's the only way for a fic to last me more than a few hours. Ouch.

** How is it possible to only read one fanfic?

But, if, theoretically speaking, I was to only read one (that you've not already listed here), it would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - Hermione in this story is totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Most of you remember the day that Severus Snape went to Voldemort, begging for the lives of the Potters. What if Voldemort had actually considered this and decided that Harry could be useful to him? How would the Wizarding World react to Harry Potter after he was raised by a Dark Lord? Dark!Harry. Annoying!Dumbledore. Rated T just in case. Now complete!
