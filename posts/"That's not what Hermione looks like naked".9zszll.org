After Ron's return, but before he and Harry return to the tent, Harry pulls his friend to the side and points out that the naked spectre of Hermione did not at all look like the brunette, using a couple of noteworthy differences as examples (like overall body proportions, cup size, tan, pubic hair and so on).

Please no Ron/Hermione endgame.


** I can't tell if this is looking for a fic you have read in the past or an oddly specific 'find me a fic that does this'

*** It's tagged as prompt and I'm pretty sure that none of the easily found DH fics have something like the described scene.

So while technically a request, the fitting story must still be written.

*** If "your two best friends have sex" is your worst fear in a civil war against a fascist group who is carrying out a genocide, your friends are no. 1 and 2 on the most wanted list and your whole family is endangered, you really need to sort out your priorities.

Especially after walking out on them.

#+begin_quote
  I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible... Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend... Second best, always, eternally overshadowed...
#+end_quote

That's a quote from that scene in the books. So a bit more complex than you make it out to be, and presumably deep fears that had been lying under the surface for quite a while. That's what he's had thrust in his face, and Harry telling him he's been sleeping with Hermione for a while that callously would be cruel. I don't know about you, but I prefer my protagonists to be sympathetic.

***** Should he lie to his friend instead and also put their friendship over his romantic relationship?

Bros before hoes only applies is the girl isn't a bro as well.

I prefer my protagonist honest. And if the truth is that Harry took a shot because Ron ran then it's better to tell him bluntly than pussyfoot around the issue.

** As interested as I am in anything referencing a naked Hermione, that sounds like something of a taunt from Harry, and I doubt Hermione would appreciate her body being discussed like that!

*** Well, it would definitely not be a serious story. And with the implication of Harry and Hermione being intimate with each other, you would need some kind of icebreaker to break the news to Ron.

**** It would be best to talk about it with Hermione first, and I don't think she would consider your chosen method to be among the top 1000 ways in which the news should be broken to Ron.

That said, it would make for a funny, if slightly sadistic crack fic.

***** I'd say that you would have to break the news before the trio is reunited.

And honestly, there's no good way to tell someone something like this. I mean, you might as well go with "We need to talk".

** It would seem more natural to me if Harry blurted out "That's not what Hermione looks like naked" when the spectre appeared from the Horcrux. If he says it afterward it seems like taunting like others have said.
