** "All those rituals and dark magic. He really did that to himself? What about drawbacks? Don't they give him some kind of weakness?"

"Indeed they do, Harry. In fact, I know of one ritual that Tom has definitely performed, which was Arithmantically incomplete. After you showed Fawkes the Chamber of Secrets, I was able to go there and complete the ritual with my own additions."

"So he'll be weaker now?"

"Of a sort. He had performed a ritual that would provide him eternally with sustenance of his body. He planned, at least, to be free from the Horseman of Famine. I could not undue the intent of the ritual... but I was able to modify it in such a way that he will be forever inconvenienced, and who knows, perhaps slowly driven to madness."

*** ... I tried.

Bam! He was slammed against the wall.

Crabbe yowled, jerked out of his half-doze, to find Yaxley standing at his desk. The other man looked at him, eyes deceptively mild. “He wants you to check his post.”

“Huh?”

“He wants,” said Yaxley softly, “You. To. Check. His. Bloody. Post.” He leant into Crabbe's face, breath sweet with some liqueur. “Don't make me repeat it.”

Crabbe considered hexing his colleague, but he couldn't keep the Dark Lord waiting. He lurched to his feet, back throbbing. Bloody Yaxley. He was feeling sick himself, from the whiskey they'd had earlier to celebrate the recent raids. He didn't know how Yaxley could handle more alcohol.

The Dark Lord's office was spattered with feathers and blood. At first Crabbe assumed it was target practice for Nagini, then he realised that there were no rats or mice to be seen anywhere. Letters were scattered around his desk, some half-open and torn, others presumably shredded. And tins of... of Spam with their contents blasted open and smeared around the room. Crabbe allowed himself to wonder if the Dark Lord was going even barmier, then quashed the thought.

“My- my lord,” he began, hesitantly, and stood respectfully at attention.

The Dark Lord's eyes were burning with rage. “Imperio,” he hissed, and Crabbe felt the familiar clouding, floating feeling. /Sit/, said the voice, sweet and mellifluous, and Crabbe sat. /Intercept every bird that comes near this window and kill it,/ said the voice. Crabbe, lost in visions of butterflies and waterfalls, obeyed.
