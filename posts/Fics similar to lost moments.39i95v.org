I just finished a really good fic on FF, called Lost Moments. It's an R/Hr fic that shows the hidden moments in their relationship development from OOTP to DH. Anything else like it?


** linkffn(Biscuits, a Love Story) and linkffn(Six Foot of Ginger Idiot) by Pinky Brown are both wonderful storeis which focus on the development of Ron and Hermione's relationship, the first throughout the series, and the second just for HBP.

If you haven't read them yet give 'em a shot, because it sounds like it's what you want :)
