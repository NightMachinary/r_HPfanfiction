** The potion transforms the drinker into the metamorphmagus' base form.

The potion transforms the drinker into whatever form was being held at the time. This would be easily exploitable to create unlimited amounts of polyjuice of a person without them ever knowing.

The potion totally fucks the drinker up in some unpredictable fashion. It wasn't designed for use on such a rare and unique magical being, it stands to reason that the potion simply wouldn't work correctly.

Who knows? There's no canon answer. I tend to think it would be the third option.

*** Option 3 makes the most sense: it couldn't handle an average cat without messing up.

**** Actually, do we know whether or not it was an actual cat and not, say, a kneazle or a hybrid?

This brings to mind another question---how does hair (or fur or feathers) from an animagus affect polyjuice?

***** Animagi are human beings who can transform into a particular animal at will. So, if their hair is used in polyjuice in human form, you will transform into that human. If their animal form hair is used, complications will arise.

****** Ah, but you must think magically. If an animagus is transformed, are they truly an animal, or merely impersonating one and still have the magical essence of a human (or other being)? Since animagi can (presumably? I'm not sure if this is canonical) be differentiated from true animals, then use of keratinous materials (such as hair, feathers, nails, or claws) from an animagus in Polyjuice potion may produce different results than those from a true animal---perhaps even transforming the user into the animagus's true form.

***** 1. We don't know a thing.

2. We know even less. In fact, [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Impersonated_individuals][looking at the list of impersonated people]] , there's not even a known Animagus, let alone a transformed one

*** Do they even have a base? We see Tonks stuck in one form, but is that her base or would a different event lock her in a different form?

**** I imagine they did when they were born. But as we see that they begin changing very early, it's likely they lose their base appearance while they're too young to even comprehend such a thing.

**** There's no reason to believe she doesn't have one, so we should assume that she does.

Fanfiction is fanfiction though, I certainly would have no problems with reading a story where metamorphmagi's forms are far less stable.

** Rookwood added the hair sliced away from the metamorph into the potion and swirled it. Seeing the alchemical reaction in process, he smiled. "Baldrick! You will now test the sample." He handed the silver cup with the self-swirling cobalt-coloured goo to his assistant. The young, dim, but well-paid apprentice drank from the sample.

Convulsions wracked the poor fool's body. Within moments Rookwoods apprentice had transmogrified into one long strand of blue hair.

Rookwood cackled as he poked at the pile of hair with his favourite poking stick. "Heh, heh. Interesting..."

**** Rookwood works for the Department of Mysteries -- he isn't always testing a hypothesis so much as poking at the edges of expectation. He has the good sense to hand off the actual experience to those younger and more replaceable than himself.
