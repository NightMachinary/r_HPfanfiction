I'm a log time lurker and first poster.

Please tell me what your favourite "grown up" Harry Potter fic is. I don't care it it's cannon and/or slash or not.

The second type of stories I'm looking for is how a muggle discoveres the existence of Magic - maybe because he/she is with a wizard or witch or by accident.\\
(I liked the Professor Muggle fics or even crossovers like "Like a Phoenix" or "Knights Magic")

Thank you!

Um...FTFY? I think the capitalisations threw the bot off. Either that or it's on holiday too. For that matter, does the Fanfiction Bot detect links in quotes or otherwise formatted?...I guess we'll find out.

Bugger, looks like the bot's on holiday after all. That or it can't see quotes, I'm not sure.

In any case, the fics you linked were:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me:]] The one that starts with Harry getting a coffee spilled on him in a muggle cafe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh:]] Harry Potter is the new neighbour.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors:]] Apparently this one won an award?
