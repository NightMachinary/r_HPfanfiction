I love stories where Dudleys are good to Harry. And if there is a one where Dursley is also a wizard that would be great (even if his parents don't like magic).

** You know what would be great? A Dudley that is to Harry as Crabbe and Goyle are to Malfoy, but he leans into the whole hired goon thing even more.

*** Beats the shit out of Malfoy and his goons and locks them in a compartment. Returns with their wands and keep it with him for the rest of the year. Sells them back to Ollivander.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
