I've finished reading it yesterday and just finished playing Season 1 of The Walking Dead so I'm in a bit of an emotional crisis. Anyone knows anything like it? (25 y old Harry and Sirius fall through the veil into another dimension where Voldemort is still alive and Lily and James had a son and a daughter after losing Harry) It should be both good on plot /and/ comedy. Not to mention that it shouldn't be badly written. Thanks in advance!

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Yeah, try not to set your expectations too high. I don't think anyone can match nonjon in action/humor fusion.

But some have made a good effort. Check out most stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach-s-Blot]]

This is also one of my favorites linkffn(11120132), it's crack (but the good kind) about Harry turning into an elfling in Middle Earth.

Harry raised by Lockhart, linkffn(6635363).

Harry runs away from home believing he's a forest elf, linkffn(8197451)

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

** A lot of people found my original version of harry potter and the darkness within/ascendant very funny [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/6/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]] The rewrite as a standalone is a lot dryer but still has a few moments.

** I've read all of those which aren't crossovers (I hate crossovers) and I'm very pleasantly surprised! I've just finished reading Magical Relations by evansentranced and would appreciate it if someone could tell me of any similiar fanfics to this one, which should be long and hopefully finished.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
