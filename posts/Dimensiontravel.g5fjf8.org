Personally I like to read stories about Harry spending the summer or a year in another dimension and actually coming back. These stories are kind of hard to find with google. If you know some good stories where harry comes back could you comment the links here pls, I would appreciate it

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds himself in a world completely different than his own. One where Albus Dumbledore has snapped, and Voldemort is headmaster. Lily and James are alive, and Harry is thrown for a loop. HPDM, SLASH.
