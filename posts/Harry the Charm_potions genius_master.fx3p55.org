I was reading Rune stone path and realized that I have read lot stories where Harry is rune/ward genius, so is there fics that go more deeply into workings and theory of charms or potions.

Instead of pulling perfect pepper-up from his ass Author shows each step in brewing process and explains main components/why they are added.


** Can you link the stories you have read where he is a genius in any subject? I'd love to read some books on that concept. And I really liked Rune Stone Path.

** One of my favorite fics is a Severus/Harry fic (romance develops lateeeeer) but Harry becomes a potion master. It even explains potion making and stuff. Idk if you would become discouraged cuz of the pairing though. Its a twin-fic... [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3780602/1/][invisible]]

Highly recommend it though.

  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP! SLASH

** I know right! There are some authors which write the most amazing fics with detailed descriptions of potion theory etc. Those stories are always a treat to find! Unfortunately I've got a really really poor following system and I've read so so much that I can't really find anything anymore so... yeah this is all i've got.

linkffn(2750775)

Genius!Draco where he's very good at ancient ruins. The characterisation and the plot is fantastic! It's also a four part series which was amazing to read. I really recommend this one!

linkffn(7724057)

Genius!Harry with wbwl trope. It's interesting to read as Harry does a bit of alchemy and potions is quite important with Snape being a pseudo father figure. I recall him designing a broom as well and the author writing about the ruins that went into that. (Can also be found on ao3) /\/This was really really good**

linkffn(8586147)

Don't get put off by the summary! It was actually a very well written idea. The OC does ruins and designs quite a few things using it.

linkffn(4924413)

This one is a Dark!Harry fic and Genius!Harry. It doesn't really fit what you're looking for but it does have the genius tag :P

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  AU,6th yr. Draco has a secret, he's a genius. Bill Weasley is teaching Ancient Runes. 6th year brings debate class, mystery, horcruxes, etc. The story is complete, but I am currently editing and commenting on the chapters. NEW FORMAT as of 1/14 - All newly revised chapters will be at the END of the story, for ease of reading. It makes way more sense this way...

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) as well as linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) delve heavily into potions theory - in Problem of Potions, Harry is passionate about Potions but not necessarily an innate genius (a Genius of Hard Work, so to speak), while she (fem!Harry) is definitely a prodigy in the Pureblood Pretense.
