Any good rose weasley and scorpius romance fanfictions ? The more angst the better.


** The Stygian trilogy by JustSlide is really good! It's kinda dark and has drama and action. It used to be on Hpff (tbh hpff got new owners and isn't what it used to be). Read it on AO3 --->

Linkao3(ignite)

Linkffn(paddling through rapids) - incomplete but I remember really enjoying it.

** Sabotage by Geoblock is excellent and was just completed! Rose and Scorpius hate each other and are normal angsty teenagers, but they are still likeable. Their growing feelings for one another are actually realistic. There's also an unexpected twist which I did not see coming.
