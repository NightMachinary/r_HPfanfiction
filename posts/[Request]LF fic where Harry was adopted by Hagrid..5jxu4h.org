If possible, preferably one that doesn't have Hagrid's lines written with thick accent I can barely decypher.


** Huh, now I want to see a fic like this too.

It's not like it could be hard; just have the 'extra-abusive Dursleys' cliche in place, then when Hagrid comes to the hut on the rocks and takes Harry away for shopping, when it's time for them to part and Harry to go back to the Dursleys, young Harry begs to stay with Hagrid instead.

Or, earlier than that, have Dumbledore approach the Dursleys about taking in Harry; when they prove reluctant, he lets Hagrid manage Harry instead.

If it had to be justified, I'd say that baby Harry would have a lot of destructive accidental magic from the ongoing conflict between the horcrux scar and his own magic, and Hagrid as a half-giant would be well equipped to withstand it.

That, and without his mother's protection from living with the Dursleys, Hogwarts itself is one of the safer places for Harry to be.
