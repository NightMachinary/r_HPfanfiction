Harry Potter has a special place in all of our hearts. That's why even after all this time the community is still strong. Many of us grew up with it. Many still experienced it after all the books were released. It gave us characters we love and care for; amazing locations and a sense of wonder; awe inspiring magical beings and so on

What were the things you loved the most about canon?


** Little comedic one-liners JK Rowling included in the books.

For example, the following excerpt was taken from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 8: The Wedding when Harry was disguised as Cousin Barney to hide his true identity:

#+begin_quote
  "Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron's who seemed unsure of whether or not Harry was his son..."
#+end_quote

Another example (which I found particular funny) was also from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 21: The Tale of the Three Brothers:

#+begin_quote
  Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock.\\
  "Mr. Lovegood - what's that?"\\
  She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.\\
  "It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius.\\
  "No it isn't!" said Hermione.\\
  "Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now's not the moment-,"\\
  "But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and it's an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!"
#+end_quote

Or this one too:

#+begin_quote
  "All right," said Hermione, disconcerted. "Say the Cloak existed...what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?"\\
  "What of it?"\\
  "Well, how can that be real?"\\
  "Prove that it is not," said Xenophilius.\\
  Hermione looked outraged.
#+end_quote

I'd be willing to read a whole book in which Hermione converses with Xenophilius. I think it'd be hilarious.

Makes me wonder where all the cousins are. Unless Arthur was much younger than his siblings there should have been at least a few fellow Weasleys at Hogwarts. Especially considering there are supposed to be enough of them that a random red head can go to a Weasley wedding and nobody questions if he really is part of the family.

**** Arthur is actually the richest Weasley. The rest does not even have enough to buy wands, and can barely attend the wedding.

**** There was a cousin character that was dropped from canon, though she was the daughter of the squib cousin rather than other magicals.

** That sense of wonder. Rowling, whatever else you can say about her, is a phenomenal tour guide. The veneer she shows us is pretty as heck and she shows it us in a way that makes us excited and enthralled to see it.

Plus, the fandom fights over literally everything else - I've never seen a comment here criticising or disagreeing with that sense of wonder. Uniting a fandom like this on even one note is a singular achievement. :D

*** I once had to write an essay about a novel. I wrote about Harry Potter and this one of the highlights of the essay. I said that it all feels so real that I would not be surprised if you could actually cross into platform 9 3/4 and it was all real. I was young like 9 or 10.

** How much more of a morally grey figure Hermione is. Cursing Cho's friend scarring her for life for betraying the DA, leading Umbridge into the path of the centaurs knowing she'd get severely treated by them, Keeping Rita in a jar for who knows how long...she has a real mean streak and seems to relish people getting what they deserve...kinda hot honestly lol. fic writers often gloss over this stuff they make her really meek and soft or overly studious like a young McGonagall or something...only interested books, rules study so on...but if anything sometimes she what id imagine of a young Bellatrix in some regards haha

*** The morally grey characters in general. There's Snape obviously, who's spawned a perpetual motion machine of online arguments about whether he was good or evil, but there's but also Dumbledore, Fred and George, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid... No one's perfect and very few characters are purely evil.

** Harry's narration/POV. I think his personality is a large part of what draws you in to the story.

** The details, the whimsy and the wealth of characters. To pick one thing in particular, maybe how thought-out most names are. Everything from very specific names like Remus Lupin or Dolores Umbridge or Nagini which etymologically tells us exactly what the characters hidden nature is, or more creative and subtle things like the alchemy references in Harry's father figures (Sirius) Black, Albus and Rubeus. Also things like Diagon Alley and Knockturn and the Knight Bus feel both funny and clever. And naming the single prestigeous school in the country after an animal like a hog with a skin condition is hilarious.

** I just want to mention [[https://www.firstthings.com/article/2000/01/harry-potters-magic][Harry Potter's Magic by Alan Jacobs]], which is very supportive and thoughtful about HP universe, even though it is from very Christian conservative website.

** Gred and Forge were pretty great. Unfortunately the movies mostly cut them out. Along with a lot of the day-to-day classroom interactions that really gave the story depth.
