Am I missing something or are there not many fanfics that use this aspect of harry? A lot of the darker ones have some sort of parselmagic, but I think it would be cool if he either had a real connection with a snake or came up with some more creative ways to use the skill.

Any suggestions?


** To Shape and Change (I think by Blueowl) is a time travel Snape-mentors-Harry fic where Harry uses parselmagic to heal.

** It's certainly not the focus of the story but Harry uses Parseltongue a lot from second year onward, even teaching others, and his conversations with snakes are some of the funniest and best in the story. linkffn(magical relations)

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** In Barb's trilogy Harry finds a garden snake and keeps it as a familiar, she plays a minor role in the story as an author mouthpiece (all snakes have the sight in her world).
