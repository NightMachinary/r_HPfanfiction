I love fics where Sirius is sent back to fix things, but my favorites are unfinished, so I'm looking for more. I generally prefer him to go back within Harry's lifetime, but I'd consider back to the Maurauder era if it was really good.

Gen, het, slash, I'm fine with all of them.


** linkffn(Oh God Not Again!)

Well, he is timetravelling there...

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Sirius Black didn't die when he fell through the Veil, instead he is given a second chance, waking up as his twenty-one year old self, a week before Halloween 1981. Armed with knowledge of the future, Sirius fights to ensure the burden of prophecy doesn't fall on Harry's shoulders... But can he survive the war and keep his friends alive? Completed!

*** My two faves were posted on a writing challenge, not finished by the deadline, and not reposted elsewhere yet. Sadly. One was by Jilly James, and one by Toasterpop. Jilly has a pretty good track record for eventually finishing stuff, though. So I still have hopes.

There's also linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9052687]]), which has its moments. I like the depiction of Sirius' lack of self-control. Especially in the first round. And linkffn(Back Again? Siriusly?) which is unfinished but also has its moments. That one has Sirius digging deep into his Black side and getting pretty ruthless.

  The concept of the 'do-over' is used in, at the very least, hundreds of Harry Potter stories. Here's my own take, using a HP character that actually has a good reason for getting another chance to make things better.
