So, I was thinking:

Does anyone do a fic where Harry dies, and Ron and Hermione and...whomever else...end up having to finish the job somehow? (Yeah yeah yeah, prophecy,blah blah blah....)

Edit: I know I fucked up the title...

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)Year 1: Ron Weasley is not as alone as you might expect.
