No crazy vaults, no grand manors. Just what his parents left him in his vault plus the broken remains of the Godrics Hollow house.

He has enough to get by but that's it. There's no Lords in the wizarding world and Malfoy is an aberration in terms of wealth but death eaters range from poor and impoverished purebloods to the wealthy Malfoys.


** One of the nice characteristics of the stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is that it very well keeps the middle-class character of the HP universe. Harry is probably a bit richer than average (after all, inherited large house in the middle of London brings some gold to your vault), and the Head Auror has probably nice salary, but he is not obscenely rich and there is no culture of Lords, Ladies, Scions and Heiresses.
