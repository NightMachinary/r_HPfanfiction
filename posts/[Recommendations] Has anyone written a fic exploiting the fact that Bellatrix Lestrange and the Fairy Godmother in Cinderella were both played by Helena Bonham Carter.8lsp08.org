Inspired by the post asking about Barty Crouch Jr. and the 10th Doctor, both played by David Tennant.


** Or a scenario based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3mw3b4/hermione_and_bellatrix_as_a_teenager/][this premise]]:

The Order raided Bellatrix‘s home a few weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, whom she treasured above everything else. She and her husband weren't at home that night however, and the Order didn't have the heart to kill an innocent child. So they burnt down the house, took away the child, and eventually found a muggle woman looking somewhat similar to the young Bellatrix. With some magic, the Grangers were happy to become a family of three.

Bellatrix, on the other hand, completely lost it, and began her descent into bloodlust, madness, and sadism. Whereas she was a tough and lethal, but a disciplined warrior who abstained from torture before, she now completely gave herself into the dark arts and Voldemort's cause. Later, she learnt that the leader of the Order during that raid was one Frank Longbottom.

Most of the story went as canon, until the Trio was captured and brought to the Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix stripped Hermione naked as part of humiliation. Just when she was about to torture Hermione, she saw the very mark she had put on her child all those years ago...

*** I would alter that premise a little:

#+begin_quote
  In 1979, Bellatrix Lestrange gave birth to a daughter whom she treasured above everything else. Rodolphus didn't care about the child since she was a girl but he had wanted a son to follow in his steps, which caused Bella to break with him. One night, she wasn't at home and the Order took that opportunity to raid her safehouse. However, the Order didn't have the heart to kill an innocent child. So they burnt down the house, took away the child, and eventually found a muggle woman looking somewhat similar to young Bellatrix and hoping to adopt a child. After a memory charm making them believe that Hermione is biologically theirs, the Grangers were happy to become a family of three.

  Bellatrix, on the other hand, completely lost it, and began her descent into bloodlust, madness, and sadism. Whereas she had been tough and lethal, a disciplined warrior who abstained from torture before, she now completely gave herself into the dark arts and Voldemort's cause. During the Raid on Longbottom manor, Frank Longbottom, in the heat of Battle, taunts Bella with the fact that he engineered the operation which ended up taking her daughter away. Two Aurors turned vegetables later, Bella is arrested laughing like a maniac (not unlike her cousin Sirius).

  During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Harry, Hermione and Bellatrix get separated from the others. Bella ends up subduing Harry, breaking his arm and leg or something like that. Despite already being battered and bruised, Hermione stands in front of her friend, aware that they are done for and about to die. But, due to the light, ambient magic or whatever, Bellatrix pauses because the girl in front of her reminds her of herself when she was younger, fierce, utterly loyal (to her sisters in Bella's case), with untamable hair in a colour that looks like a blend of Bellatrix's and Rodolphus. In fact, the girl looks just like her daughter would look like and so Bellatrix casts a spell which would reveal any familial connections. Hermione throws up a shield but since the older witch didn't cast a curse, it goes straight through and Bellatrix breaks down sobbing.

  Confused by this and yet unable to get away, Hermione tries to pry information out of the sobbing Death Eater and eventually gets the picture. However, because she doesn't believe the woman she fought with no five minutes ago, Hermione casts the spell and then even teaches Harry to cast it, and yet it always shows the same result. Therefore Hermione now has an existential crisis because her entire life has been a lie. Harry tries comforting his friend, but really, what can he do in such a situation?

  Seeing the two teenagers and how they fought together (although she is not sure if it is a romantic attraction or if they have simply grown into de-facto siblings), Bellatrix realises that her daughter would never follow her on the Dark Side and that if she wants to have her back in her life, she would have to desert Voldemort. And as tempting as Voldemort is, there is no doubt when she chooses her daughter. The only issue here is that Hermione doesn't trust her much and so Bella begins to tell them a few of Voldemort's secrets and plans to convince her daughter and her daughter's friend that she has chosen her side.

  This leads to Hermione and Harry questioning Dumbledore for not telling Harry anything about the prophecy, a possible trap or his role in it (Bella only knows the first part through Voldemort) and his overall failings. There is also a mother-daughter bonding moment over the fact that Hermione led Umbridge into a Centaur gang rape (that's what Centaurs are famous for after all). In the end, they reach a tentative truce with Harry, Hermione and Bella becoming their own side whose only goal is it to survive the war and have a “happily til the end” without “ten dark years” Dumbledore or Voldemort in their lives.

Don't expect this anytime soon however. I am writing two stories and have at least one oneshot queued.

*** It was never written, but I played with a similar idea before Cursed Child was written that Bellatrix as pregnant when she was sent to Azkaban which led to her child being adopted by the Granger's... I forget how.

The key difference is that my Bellatrix was completely unrepentant and only made worse by her imprisonment leading to a rather cruel re-education for Hermione.

There are a lot of details I've forgotten but I do remember Harry and Hermione developing a fri-enemies relationship and a confrontation where Harry used magi-tech while Hermione used fey like enchantments.

***** It's your story so write what you can enjoy writing, but if you'll consider my suggestion I don't think it's necessary for Bellatrix to be redeemed. Atleaast not completely. Finding her daughter again won't be enough to regain her sanity (however she was before) will it? Bellatrix wanting to protect/take back Hermione and wanting to stick with Voldemort could produce some good conflict, any good plot needs conflict.

Whatever you do I hope to read it once it's ready, I'm really excited about that premise. Will you post a link here?
