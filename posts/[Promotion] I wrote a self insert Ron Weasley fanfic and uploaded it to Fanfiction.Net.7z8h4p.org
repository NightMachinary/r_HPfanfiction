I was tired of looking for posts with Ron as the main character over here in the subreddit and decided to write one, I have other fanfiction on my profile but I have kinda fallen out of them because of real life. Let me know how you liked it and what I can do better.

*** u/Aoloach:
#+begin_quote
  he looked toward her
#+end_quote

Isn't actually the same meaning as

#+begin_quote
  he looked at her
#+end_quote

"Toward" is "in the direction of" while "at" implies a target of the look. Both describe the direction of his look, but the latter is explicit regarding /why/ he looked that direction, while the former is more ambiguous.

*** Thank you so much, I will keep the punctuation in mind, I had trouble over the color coloured thing because it leaves a red line underneath when I type it the British way and it annoys me so much (I actually grew up spelling it as Coloured) but I forgot to change it, I will make the requisite changes soon and post it again.

Thank you so much for your help on this, much appreciated.

**** Where do you type it in? I don't think GDocs makes a fuss over what spelling variant it is, and if Microsoft Word does, you can just change the default language to English (UK).

**** You have a bunch of instances where you end a sentence with dialogue and there is no punctuation at the end. There needs to be some sort of punctuation. Whether it's inside or outside the quotation marks depends on the circumstances. And if the dialogue is at the beginning of a sentence there usually needs to be a comma between it and the non dialogue portion. A quick google search turned up this explanation page that seems good.

Also I would recommend using less all caps. If you say he is shouting something that is sufficient. Exclamation points also work well. I find all caps annoying, but using it occasionally is probably fine for stuff that's ridiculously loud. Not a bunch of times in the same chapter though, that's way too much imo. Yes I'm aware Rowling did it a bunch in Order of the Phoenix, I still think it's a bad practice.

*** Wow, grammar-nazi on tour? Sorry, but I've seen worse! This is still very much legible, thus nitpicking at a high level IMHO...I hate mistakes such as "could of" instead of "could have" much much more, especially since those mistakes ruin the entire sentence ("could of" makes no sense, "could have" does!)

  My worst fears were confirmed when I met Harry the next morning. "Hello, Ron!" he said with a bright, cheery expression, before suddenly hugging me. Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux recursive fanfiction, Self Insert.

  Engineering is hard to do. Sometimes, you don't know what you're doing wrong, and sometimes you fix something even though you didn't mean to. Watch Ron Weasley struggle to engineer a better life for himself, his friends, and the Wizarding world as he breaks some other things along the way. Self Insert Ron Weasley. Rated T for bad language, might change later.

** This seems pretty good for a start. Just looking at the title I hope your Ron doesn't turn into a Mary Sue. I will follow and review when you add new chapters.

Good luck!

** I've started reading it, and I do like it, but I wouldn't really consider this a fic with Ron as the main character since he is replaced by a self insert and the whole point is that he's no longer Ron Weasley. Unless it will be one of those merging SI?
