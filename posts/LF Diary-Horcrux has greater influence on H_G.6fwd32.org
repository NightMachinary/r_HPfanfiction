I am looking for fics with point of divergence when Harry rescues Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. In canon, Tom basically falls over once the basilisk is defeated. For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][Bonds of Blood]], which I like a lot, the soul fragment latches onto Ginny and the reaction from Harry leads to a Soul-Bond, which the story is build around. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936039/1/Remember][Remember]] is similar. Stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2788096/1/If-You-Can-Help-Her][If you can help her]], where Harry cares for Ginny after the events are alright, but I'm more looking for fics where Tom isn't that easy to get rid of or getting rid of him has severe aftereffects. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging-the-Sword]] and similar stories where Ginny dies don't really qualify. There was also a story where Ginny secretly is a loyal LV follower, infiltrates the order and disrupts the trio - that's interesting, but not quite the right direction.

Can someone recommend fics that go in this direction?

In my head I have (strange?) ideas like, e.g.: - The soul fragment gets absorbed by Harry's scar, overwhelming Harry, Ginny rescuing /him/. - Tom taking over Ginny and Harry having to fight(?) and injure(?) her. - Ginny is deeply traumatized and develops a greater obsession/addiction to Harry (no soul bond), both going to a mind healer together - The dairy soul fragment tries to take over Ginny and the fragment in Harry's scar reacts and tries to do the same. Harry "calls" Hogwart's magic for help, but magic always needs to be shaped by intention. Harry's deepest wish (derived from the Mirror) is having a loving family and living his life, so the magic he draws upon compels them to have intercourse, which dispels both(?) fragments and gets Ginny pregnant. - Something 'bigger'(TM) happening in general (when in doubt, explosions).
