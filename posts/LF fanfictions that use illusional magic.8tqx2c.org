Where the main character or anyone really incorporates it into duels and fights and uses it to their advantage and is so sneaky with them. Sort of like Loki from the MCU but fits more in the Harry Potter universe


** Delenda Est, the ghost of Harry Ashworth.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): creates illusions in fight by the end of 3rd year, even teaches Krum how to.

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw): harry makes ample use of illusions when dueling.

Linkffn(return of the marauders): some interesting magic, at one point ginny and Daphne create a fake basilisk to scare off the acromantulas.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
