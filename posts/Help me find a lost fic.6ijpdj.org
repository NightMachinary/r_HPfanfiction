So, I read a fic about 2 years back. I don't remember the exact story but I think it went like this:

1. Ron and Hermione were getting married and Harry was where, I don't know.
2. Hermione goes to Harry with the weeding invitation at a house where Harry is living alone, or so she thought.
3. When Hermione reaches there, she finds her replica in the kitchen which asks her if she wanted tea.

It was something like this. I think it was Harmony fic and it was incomplete at that time.
