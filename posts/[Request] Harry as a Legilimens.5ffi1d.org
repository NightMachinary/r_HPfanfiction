I'm looking for fics where Harry learns Legilimency and isn't afraid to use it.

By: Alaunatar AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE Rated: Fiction M - English - Angst/Drama - Severus S., Harry P. - Chapters: 50 - Words: 164,882 - Reviews: 1,491 - Favs: 1,689 - Follows: 515 - Updated: Apr 3, 2007 - Published: Feb 11, 2007 - Status: Complete - id: 3389525

Probably the closest thing you're looking for in terms of Harry using Legilimency effectively. The principal magic explored throughout the entire book is mind magic, with Occlumency featuring initially and then Legilimency quickly becoming the next focus after. As the genre suggests, this is a pretty angst-heavy story and often times more than I'd like, but I think it's a decent read all around and again, the closest thing I can imagine for what you're looking for.

There are other stories like LightningOnTheWave's /Sacrifices Arc/, or GwendolynnFiction's /The Weapon Revised/, or storytellerSpW's /The Legacy/ or many, many other stories where Harry becomes competent in Legilimency or actively uses it, but I don't think there are many other novel-length treatments besides /Stronger than Hope/ which focuses almost exclusively on it, and Occlumency.

*** Ugh, I really wanted to like /Stonger Than Hope/ because I love mentor fics and the concept of offensive Occlumency was very interesting, but Harry and Snape both came off kind of sociopathic, and something like 70% of the whole fic seemed to be made up of their smug internal monologuing about how clever they are in their ability to manipulate others. It was boring and ooc.

**** I feel the portrayal of Snape was perfect, but yeah, Harry does come across a little ooc, but at least they take the time to explain it. As for boring, well that is always something to be interpreted individually so I can't really refute that.

** To build off of this, I would love to see a natural Legilimens Harry who cannot turn off his power. It would be neat to see a story that usually turns one of the check-marks in the 'Super Harry' genre into a plot device. Also, it would be fun to see a story where Harry is ostracized for something that actually makes sense.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

******* Hmmm I hadn't considered that.

Yeah, that's one of the big things on my (growing smaller) list of complaints. Another big one was that Jim + Ron were kinda dumb but that's been changing for a while now.

The third is that, beyond Pettigrew and Voldemort, all the evil people are just kind of, /evil/. Or "secretly good". Imo there are very few people who are evil for the sake of being evil, and PoS hasn't really shed too much light on the emotions of most evil characters besides Pettigrew.

******** Your third point really interests me, usually people like when Villains have goals, and are a little sympathetic. Often you here that the sign of a good villain is they do not consider themselves evil. So it really intrigues me that you find the lack of evil for evils sake to be a deficit in the story.

SPOILERS:

I don't like how Narcissa, TIberius, Goyle, and Dolhov are basically just /evil/. Like they have no goals or plans, they're just straight up monsters. I don't think (personally) that's very realistic and wished their characters were more fleshed out.
