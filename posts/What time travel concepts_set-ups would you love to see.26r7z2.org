A lot of people enjoy HP time travel stories, and there are so many different variations. There's also a lot of AU fics that involve a character from canon entering another dimention with a different storyline, which is in some ways similar to time travel fics because it gives the character an opportunity to interact with characters that he didn't in canon, puts them in a position where they know more about the future than everyone around them, etc.

There's: *Character(s) from one generation finds themselves in another generation. *Character(s) go back in time to change things *Character(s) do a Peggy Sue.

These seem to be the three basic fic types, and yet there's a huge amount of variation between stories. The characters that change time periods, their ages, their backgrounds, the circumstances of the time period they've found themselves in, drama created by people knowing who they are (or not knowing who they are), drama created by changing things (or not changing things), and so much more.

I've seen one-shot fics where the next gen meets Baby Harry and accidently informs L/J that their child is going to fit Voldemort a dozen times before his birthday, and I've seen fics that involve Ginny (and Sirius) going back in time to her first year in order to save Harry from dying in the final battle. There's a ton of creativity.

Any premises that you guys would love to see or would love to see more of? I'm not writing anything, just curious what people think up.

Personally I would love to see more fics that involve a Ginny and Harry interacting as a couple, but it would be cool to see some variation. Like "Ginny and Harry and their three kids under 5 accidentally end up in 1979."


** Severus Snape, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley are all transported centuries into the past. They don't know anyone, don't have money, and notice that there is no school, no society, nothing. So they decide to start wizarding society better than ever before. They start teaching, building a castle to defend those who cannot defend themselves, and go on and have debates as how to integrate muggleborns into society and so on.

Stories about them grow less and less accurate, their names become forgotten, their (now twisted beyond recognition) ideas become semi-religious doctrine. Their names become forgotten with passing generations, but the stories give them aliases that sound good.

You get the twist: they become known as Salazar Slytherin, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff respectively, and nothing is changed.

*** I think Draco would be a better fit, just age wise. Temperament as well.

Man I feel gross saying that as I hate DM.

**** He might fit age-wise, but Salazar Slytherin was a known master (inventor?) of occlumency/legilimency, extremely powerful, and quite possibly paranoid. Severus Snape makes a better fit for all of those. I had a bit of a problem thinking about whether Hermione as Rowena and Ginny as Helga would be a better fit than Luna as Rowena and Hermione as Helga, but Luna would never become estranged with her daughter.

** I can't remember the particular fic I read this in but basic premise of the do-over was that Harry didn't remember first life.

Basically he had one clear memory of being older and dying, and he was constantly getting feelings of deja-vu. The only knowledge he had to guide him was that 1) This is the "second do-over" and the first one did not turn out well and (2) His only guidance "this feels too familiar - I am repeating the version of the past that turned out shitty".

Now if that particular fic had just left it at that, it could have been amazing. But it also stated returning some memories to him, so ended up as merely "pretty good" for me.

If there was only the sense of deja-vu for guidance, it gives the main character a plausible and important reason to try spontaneous actions and make risky choices to break out of the sense of deja-vu - but it doesn't give him any advantages of powers. A great way to keep up tension and introduce spontaneous plot twists that are still believable to the reader.

** I'd like to see something way further into the past than normal. As in, they go through the time warp and run into a mason putting up a wall. Hadrian's Wall.

** I liked both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]], where both have Harry learning in the past to help him confront the Dark Lord. Both of them do so differently, however. In Rebirth especially, it uses Soul Magic.

I also like the fics where Harry some way absorbs the Horcrux in his head, or he gains the memories of the Dark Lord from childhood til 1981** where it splinters off into him, usually in '98 when he gets hit by a second AK. I would love to see a fic like that, but in Kings Cross where he meets Dumbledore, he not only gets the Horcrux's memories, but Dumbledore's as well.

The easiest explainable way I could think for that is at Kings Cross, it's a realm for "Souls" in passing, and perhaps he kicks the Babymort and hugs Dumbledore, thus their souls sort of touching maybe? And when he wakes up, he knows things that Harry didn't know, and then depending on how the author wants to write it, finds a bunch of memories that don't belong to him. Maybe to avoid SuperDuper!Harry, he could either learn along with the younger Albus/Tom in the memories to not have the talents automatically, or he could spend more time absoring them to get the instincs from either person. IDK I can't write good fanfic.

Tom Gaunt (Voldemort) is Hogwarts Headmaster while Dumbledore Leads the underground resistance. Harry grows not knowing he is a wizard because James hid him so he would be safe. and then there is the prophecy.

*** My first impression was that this is the biggest, dumbest, most convoluted premise I've ever seen. Then I realised that the three paragraphs are supposed to be a separate story each and it made more sense...

** A very long time ago I read one in which Harry was his own father. I'm not sure I'd want to read more like that, but I do think authors should be a little less rigid with time travel rules kind of like that. There's nothing wrong with weird and disturbing, I say!

** Harry dies in his sleep mysteriously (something to do with the Horcrux) one day after the final canon battle. Ginny, Ron and Hermione go back in time to change it. Ginny's personal mission is to have a life with Harry that she lost. They end up in their younger bodies, with their memories, minds and magic. Only when they arrive, they find it is an alternate reality, where Harry's parents are alive, he has a sister, and Sirius is a free man and has a family. Voldemort's still around, also.

Harry's parents survived that Halloween night because of something known as 'bloodlust'. Voldemort was basically blinded by his urge to kill Harry, that he didn't even think of harming James and Lily. Lily did try to protect Harry, but Voldemort pushed her aside. James, Lily and Harry are known around magical Great Britain as The Family Who Lived. Also Harry grew up with friends, including Neville and Sirius' family. He didn't meet the Weasleys however, though James might have met Mr. Weasley at work.
