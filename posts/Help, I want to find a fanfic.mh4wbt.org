:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfic but I don't remember its name. I need help.

Harry is Slythering (no Slythering politics), he's friends with Hermione but not Ron, and the best part is that he does LITERALLY everything people tells him, if they tell him to sit down, he sits on the floor right where he was, If a teacher tells him to help Malfoy, Harry follows him and tries to help with everything until Malfoy and can not stand and he have to ask him to stop. Harry takes everything to the extreme. It's really funny.
