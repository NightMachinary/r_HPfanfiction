The circumstances can be variable. Whether Ginny is an Auror or her Canon Promotion, whether said Criminal is magical (possibly a Spy) or a Muggle. Ginny might actually be straight (so married to Harry) but find this Person fascinating and attractive, maybe she finds her lesbian side, maybe this Criminal uses Pheromones to make her work better. Whether she is a common or high Dangerous and Ginny is supposed to message Harry, but she cant. The Female however might use Ginnys Crush on her by seducing her or play with her.


** Dude, your requests are too specific. You're not going to find a fic like this. Femslash Ginny fics are rare on their own.

**** Not your title, but the description. Of all your requests lately, really. Actually, your title too. Like I said, femslash Ginny fics are rare on their own. One with a female criminal is probably not going to exist.

** Check out the darkwitches challenge on livejournal, I think there's some Ginny fics there. It's a femslash anthology.
