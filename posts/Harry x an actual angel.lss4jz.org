I thought that this would be an interesting pairing, so if anyone can link something then it would be appreciated. Also the angel has to be female

EDIT: If the angel could be an OC that would be good


** I don't think there's many "purely" hp fics that include stuff like this, because these usually trend towards repeating canon instead of doing something new. Try your luck with crossovers, especially with canons that include a pseudo-biblical fantasy theme (like Supernatural, Hellraiser, Constantine, etc)

*** The reason why a female Angel is because I believe it would fit better

**** Nope. In dresden files, fallen angels are still angels. They are not demons nor do they follow lucipher. All the fallen angels were trapped inside 30 silver coins called denarians by lucipher because he feared the fallen would try to take over hell for their own purposes. In a way, the fallen angels of dresden verse are a literal 3rd and seperate faction from and between heaven and hell.
