  Severus was raised Roman Catholic by his mother. As he laid dying in the Shrieking Shack, he portkeys to Father Patrick McKinney's for his Last Rites. Can Patrick keep his friend alive? Can Severus claim Sanctuary if he does survive? Will the British Ministry of Magic accept the claim?

You /could/ write in some additional plot if you were creating an AU where he lives, but that makes it fan fiction not fan theory.

****** So, he's passed out and bleeding so heavily from a neck wound that he was described by Harry as looking like he "had no blood left in him." The trio then hang around long enough to hear Voldemort's speech about gathering their dead and speaking directly to Harry before they decide to leave.

So he would have had to not bleed out during that speech, then somehow wake up from being passed out, treat his neck wound while being incredibly weak and then also take anti-venon.

Let's be real. He's dead. In 0 circumstances does he survive.

** I think he died. In my mind he's a man that really has nothing to live for. I think he personally played both sides to save himself. He hoped to save Lilly's life to have either the hope she forgives him or to be with him. Harry is in his mind a combination of his failure to save Lilly and his torment by James Potter.(also the man he lost Lilly to) I don't see him planning a huge scheme especially with Dumbledore and Voldemorts planed death.

Snape could have taken a gamble that he could be seen as doing the right thing should Harry win. In the short term people would listen to harry again. Would anyone on his side question him or at least publicly state that the memories are fake?

Assuming he did fake his death why hide then? Kankoraf (spelling is wrong) didn't hide and lasted a long time with Death eaters free.

******** Ok, listen up. He's horribly poisonned, a poison which took Mr. Weasley weeks to cure. He got bit in the neck, two huge holes from which blood came out like a fucking faucet. Harry spent more than 5 minutes between the moment he closed his eyes and the moment he left the shack, because of Voldemort's speech.

Discarding the speech, let's say at minimum it took 2 minutes, okay? Snape would need to somehow do in less than 3 minutes what took more than 300 hours of work from professional healers. Even if he had an antivenom, even if he had magical bandages, he'd be dead because he lost to much blood already. Even then, IF and that's a big if, IF he survived the blood loss he'd have to dodge, in his weakened state, both armies, until he somehow got away.

I'm gonna be real with you fam, he's dead as fuck.

** I'm kind of baffled by this idea that canon is absolute. In my experience as a long-time reader, creative fannish minds can always find an alternate view of even the most seemingly unarguable canon events, especially in HP! There are canon-consistent ways Snape could have lived, especially with magic.

For example... I read a story, can't remember it now but I might be able to find it, in which Snape actually had taken a variation of Draught of Living Death. In the story, Draco eventually figured it out, and dug him up from his grave and revived him during eighth year, months after he had been buried (as I recall, he was angry about this as he hadn't wanted to survive - and I think he might have ended up dying later in the story anyway).

**** He didn't die, he just appeared to be dead. Draught of Living Death sends the taker into a death-like state of suspended animation, like being cryogenically frozen maybe. So all systems stop. No bleeding, the venom doesn't circulate, etc. He'd have to be healed after he was revived (with Wiggenweld potion, the antidote to DLD), but meanwhile he was alive but appeared dead in all ways.

ETA: just so it's clear, this was what happened (if I remember right) in the story I described in my original comment, a story I did not write. But it is true that for me one of the greatest pleasures of fanfictuon is reading all the different ways creative fans can interpret canon or make it come out the way they want it to - there are a million different Harrys and Snapes, alive or not, all existing at once, and I can choose the one I want at any moment.

** Quite plausible. After all, up on the Astronomy Tower Dumbledore offered to fake Draco's death (implied in British version, stated outright in the American version), so faking death is a canonical possibility.

And really, you think Snape wasn't prepared to be bitten by Voldemort's honking huge snake, when he'd often seen it used as a weapon.

As for "in canon he's definitely dead," pshaw. Three stressed teenagers saw him PASS OUT from blood loss and assumed he was dead.

...and then they ran off to do their thing and left him there. Nobody even checked his pulse or to see if he was still breathing. But then, none of them have even a smidge of first-aid training.

Now, to be fair, passed out from blood loss means he needs external help at this stage. Hello, house elves? He's still headmaster, after all, so the castle's elves should still be tied to him.
