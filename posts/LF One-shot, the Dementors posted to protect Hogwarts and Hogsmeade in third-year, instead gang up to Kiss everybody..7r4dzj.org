You know, like during the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, what if they all homed in on Dumbledore and the teachers before gorging themselves on the students and players, then went to the castle, then to Hogsmeade, and basically just killed everybody they could via de-souling Kiss?

I've [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362319/13/Bolts-from-the-Blue][seen a fic where the Hungarian Horntail from the Triwizard Tournament gets loose and decimates Hogwarts & Hogsmeade]], but nothing with Dementors.


** Attempted in the climax of year three of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) It backfired horribly for the dementors.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** Mm, I'm actually finishing up re-reading that one right now. I just finished that particular chapter. It and the previous dementors+quidditch incident were sort of what made me wonder this request.

...Considering that someone shot Harry off his broom during the Quidditch one, it's a good thing that a good chunk of the Slytherins were in detention during the dementor attack; what would have happened if someone had cursed Harry in the back during the next dementor incident?

*** Ah, yes, this one's familiar. Although I'm hoping for the aftermath of a successful-mass-Kissing, this technically has the aftermath of an averted-mass-Kissing.

*** Mm-hmm. And apparently one patronus is enough to sweep away something like a hundred dementors at a time, if the end of Prisoner of Azkaban is any indication.

Honestly, if not for that Harry, as our viewpoint character, has severe reactions to dementors, and that they're apparently invulnerable to everything except the Patronus charm (you'd think that bludgeoning them with something would work since they apparently can't go through solid objects, but whatever), dementors would be punier than Boggarts.

**** I think /Fiendfyre/ would destroy a Dementor. It's mentioned at one point that Harry and Snape disagreed on the "best way" to defeat a Dementor, indicating there /is/ technically more than one way but the Patronus is the only one Harry is willing to consider --- making it likely the solution Snape is advocating is Dark Magic of some kind --- so /Fiendfyre/ seems like a right pick.

As for bludgeoning them, my take on this is that Dementors are indestructible, but finitely strong. If you try to run them through with a sword, the sword will collide with them and possibly push them backwards, but it won't be able to poke even the tiniest hole in them.

***** Mm...but then, if Dementors aren't necessarily strong enough to destroy solid objects, couldn't you just conjure up an iron safe or something around them? Or if they somehow break conjurations, telekinesis a real one around them?

...Iron safes...I wonder if Gringotts has dementors as security in some of the vaults.
