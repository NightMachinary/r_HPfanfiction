Prompt: Dumbledore interferes in Tom Riddles life immediately in a positive way, and gets Tom into contact with the Flamel's who take him on as an apprentice. The Philosopher's stone satiates his need for Immortality, and he somewhat becomes a functioning human with at least three adult mentors.

No Voldemort au.

50 years later, it's just Forever 21 Sadistic Alchemist and Defence Teacher Tom Riddle.


** You probably meant "forever young," but now I'm imagining Tom Riddle as a Forever 21-wearing prep a la "My Immortal"

** I am assuming that at some point in his life Voldemort experienced what he would perceive as the three greatest human weaknesses: lack of control over a situation, pain and death (not himself but others, say, his mom). That's why he is so set on using them against other people, while he tries to protect himself from them. In my headcanon, it's not Harry that is able to resist the Imperius, but actually Voldemort's piece of soul in him. He doesn't make any friends because he knows that the pain of being betrayed by someone you care for is worse than any physical pain. And, obviously, he makes Horcruxes to prevent death.

*** There was a story I read recently where Voldemort gets his wish of immortality because Harry doesn't kill him. Instead he puts him in a magical stasis that unlocks after millions of years when the earth has become barren and the entire human race is extinct. So Voldemort is now the uncontested ruler of earth and is immortal because of his horcruxes. But now his immortality is a prison and he is doomed to this barren planet in search for food and sustenance (he's immortal but still feels hunger/thirst).

I think if Voldemort ever got immortality, he would realize what a foolish target he had been chasing for his entire life.

**** First I thought you were talking about Wand For Skitter, but they're slightly different.
