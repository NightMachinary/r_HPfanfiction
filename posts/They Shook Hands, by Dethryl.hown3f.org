** I did enjoy it for the most part, but at times its such a Harry-wank-fic. Not to mention I think it might be the most "bro" fanfic I've ever read.

*** Anything particularly annoying after year 4 that you remember?

**** Hmm, its been a while since I read it, but I remember there being alot of Tracey Davis bashing for pretty much no reason from Year 4 - 6. Theodore Nott spent all of Year 4 being an arsehole for no reason, and then despite basically despising Harry for the entire year, he then refuses to join Voldemort, kills his father, and spends an entire year moping about. Slytherins where the good guys, whilst the other houses where full of one-dimensional characters.

***** Still better than linkffn(Harry Potter & The Slytherin Selection) , which, while being a pretty well written (and abandoned) rewrite up until the beginning of Book 6 with some very interesting elements, had an extremely infuriating Harry that during OOTP. Can't remember how to do spoiler text so I won't say why though.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
