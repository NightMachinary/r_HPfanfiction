I read one that I think was a one shot, and I think it was Harry's third year and there was a volcano not too far from the school, and it hit Hogwarts which had almost not Defense from the lava because they never expected any muggle things to hit it

But I was wondering if there was any other good natural disaster fics anyone's read?

** linkffn(Ambient by Caliburn). Unfinished, and maybe not an easy read. The final battle with Voldemort caused a magical "black hole" that is sucking the magic out of Britain.

linkao3(Son of Magic by PurplePebbles). Muggles go to war against wizards, and produce something that will destroy everything. Master of Death Harry must go back to 1941 to prevent it from happening.

linkffn(Countdown by Silens Cursor). Not a natural disaster, per se, but the world is about to end.

linkffn(The End Of The World by AWMPerry). Asteroids.

linkffn(Phantasy by Tsume Yuki). Master of Death Harry is reliving life multiple times trying to find a way to prevent the end of the world caused by the Yellowstone Supervolcano erupting.

I've got a couple of others, but the disasters aren't quite natural, and they're just the McGuffin for starting the real plot.

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible]]) wasn't too bad.

The basic premise is that shortly after the defeat of voldmort (the 2nd time), strange things start happening, magical settlements dropping dead, extremely large magical creatures burning up from the inside.

In the run up to the events of the 2012 movie (where solar activity does things solar activity can't do), it's discovered that the sun is also flaring magic and the only real way for magical beings to survive is to leave. Entirely.

Crossover with Battlestar Galactica.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** Oh! Another one, though it's not natural disaster.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6719282/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Guardian-Wand]])

Long story short: War. War never changes. Harry and friends are riding the hogwarts express back to london after the events of order of the phoenix - dumbledore just died. And weird, why are none of the cars moving? Why are there so many fires burning out of control in the cities?

Oh. Nukes went off 2 weeks ago, EMPs fried most electrical gizmos and infrastructure. Most of humanity back to the pre-industrial era, only without any of the infrastructure necessary to support us

It's a disaster, but not a natural one.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.
