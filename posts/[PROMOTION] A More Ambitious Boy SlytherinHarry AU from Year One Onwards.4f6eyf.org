Hey, this is just a Slytherin!Harry AU I'm working on at the moment. It's currently a WIP at 37k words for the first year, but I'm planning on writing this through to year six, so it's going to be a series in progress for a while.

Let me know if you like it, what you think, et cetera, to be honest - I'm having loads of fun with it, and I'm really glad I went to back to it this year.

*** What do demiromantic and pansexual mean? Half as romantic as others and attracted to anything (as that is what the base words translate out to)?

**** Demiromantic means that you don't fall in love on the first sight and pansexual is bisexual, but with less mainstream word. You shouldn't try to make sense out of tumblrspeak.

***** Guilty as charged: I'm a tumblrino.

Pansexual is often a synonym for bi, and then demiromantic means you have to have an emotional link with someone already before you fall "in love" with them, so Satanniel has it covered, pretty much.

** I expected this to be glorious trainwreck, but it turned out to be medicore canon rehash.

It look like you are already aware about basic problems with the first few chapters so I will skip this. But there is more pressing problem.

Why do this fic exists?

The title says promises that Harry will be "a more ambitious boy", but he hardly shows any ambition. So why the fic is named like that?

The premise is about Harry ending up in Slytherin, but he interacts more with Gryffindors. So why he is in Slytherin?

Basically all plot events stay relatively unchanged from canon despite changed circumstances. Why bother writing the same thing again?

Hermione's racebending changes nothing. Why do this?

Letters are interesting idea, that allow Harry to interact with completely different group of characters. But then we don't see him interact with those characters, and there was only one person shown trying to influence The-Boy-Who-Lived. So what's the point?

Speaking of letters, how did even Harry got idea for writing the first letter? What made him believe that parent would rein their child in? Being bullied by Dudley who according to his parents could do no wrong? Living with Draco "Wait till my father hears about this" Malfoy?

I could go on, but I think I've made my point.

So it's time for some technicalities. Cut down on the tags. Some like "Slytherins being Slytherins" are stupid and needlessly clutter taglist. Other, like many character tags are simply misleading. Why tag Nott, who is non-entity here?

I haven't seen many technical errors, but my Englis sucks, so it proves nothing. Still there were some and there were annoying tendency to put speech of one charater with action tag of other in the same line. It lessens readability. The prime exchange is the first talk with Wood.

To summarize: your style is decent enough, but your writing lacks any form of substance. Instead of rehashing what we all have seen so many times, you should think about derailing plot to make it different, to make interesting.

  When Harry Potter arrived at Hogwarts, he didn't know what he wanted. He was to be educated at a school of magic, just like his parents were - what more could he want? He never specified his house of choice to the Sorting Hat, and the Hat sorted him as it pleased. Slytherin!Harry, emotional manipulations, Hermione&Harry dream team, no shipping (yet), no bashing.

** I got to about chapter three. It's a bit late so I need to stop at the moment. Your writing is solid, you've got interesting little details, and you've introduced a racially diverse cast -- a French non-Beauxbaton student, Pakistani girl, and black Hermione. Neat.

I like Slytherin!Harry fics. Guilty pleasure. But after I got to the end of chapter two, I'm having trouble getting to understand the premise of this fic. It's an ambitious Harry, but I'm not sure where the ambition has come in yet, or where or how Harry got this different personality. And in combination with a frightfully fast friendship with Hermione where all we see is that he just wants to be her friend just because and that she seems nice and smart? It kinda comes out of no where. Then with his letter to Mrs. Weasley, I see that he's slowly understand how to manipulate people, but where did the idea come from?

I think if you worked out those kinks, this fic could be really interesting - but you've already posted almost 40k words, so it might be a bit late to change any of that.

Last note: I'd love to see these manips but AO3 is showing me some broken links.

*** Dang about the broken links - once I get on my PC today I'll change the link host to imgur or something and see if that helps. They're working right now for me and I know they've worked for others, but it's probably due to the hyperlink I've used.

Thanks so much for the feedback! My plan is to finish the first "book", which is only about 8-10k more words from completion, and then I'm going to go back to the beginning and rework the first five or so chapters. The rush with Hermione and Draco - and the lack thereof with Ron - is because the chapter was written as an RP accompaniment and I didn't want to tread on partners' toes, so I'm going to add a lot to Harry's thinking in each personal link.

Again, thanks so much for the detail there though - it's really going to help me edit through!
