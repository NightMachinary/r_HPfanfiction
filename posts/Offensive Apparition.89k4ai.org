Grabbing someone and deliberately splinching them or something along those lines.


** linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) Harry uses forced splinching to circumvent the Dresden-verse wizard's Death Curse. More specifically, he apparates with his victim, but deliberately leaves the brain behind.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** Judging by people essentially "hijacking" apparations(e.g grabbing someone about to apparate and getting dragged along, like the DE in Deathly Hallows which gets brought back to Grimmauld) I don't think apparation works like that. I think the spell either works or it doesn't, and if it fails then you get splinching, the degree of splinching I would imagine would depend on just how badly the spell failed.

Taken this way I also doubt that there is any control over which person within the apparation would be the victim of the splinching, most likely a failed side-along apparation would just be complete chaos in terms of end result. That's just my take on it though.

I would be curious to see a fic where Apparation is expanded a bit and used more in a combat role, compared to a lot of the fics I read even the movies use Apparation much more offensively.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

** Not necessarily that way, but I have been seeing more fics using apparation in battle. As in, assuming there are no wards preventing it, apparating around the battlefield, out of the way of spells, etc
