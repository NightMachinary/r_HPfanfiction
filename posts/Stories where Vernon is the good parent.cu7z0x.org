I've seen plenty of "Petunia kicks Vernon out and raises Harry and Dudley right" fics, but what about fics where, say, Vernon is deeply disturbed by his wife's rabid hatred of magic and takes Harry and Dudley under his own care.


** The only ones I'm aware of are /Compound Interest/ and /A Better Man/. Neither of which involves him leaving Petunia, but they both feature a good Vernon.

  Vernon Dursley is an ambitious man. And when he finds a freak at his front door, he opts to see it not as a burden, but as an opportunity. An opportunity that shall provide him with rich rewards in due time.

** Magical Relations linkffn(3446796)

Kinda/sorta. Maybe not good, but at least more tolerant. And it takes awhile.

Dudley gets a Hogwarts letter the same day as Harry. Petunia cannot handle it and eventually leaves, forcing Vernon to step up and accept his wizard son and tolerate Harry.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

** This one has a *relatively* empathetic Vernon: still distant and hard, but doing his job as a parent and certainly not abusive. EDIT: oh Petunia isn't abusive either tho. They're just both distant and not hateful.

** I have no idea what fic it was, but I remember a fic where the cycle of abuse at the dursleys went like this: Everyone got up, Vernon assigned chores to +Petunia+, Dudley and Harry, he left, +Petunia and+ Dudley made Harry do all his chores. Once Dudley's chores are done, Petunia just kept giving him more and more chores until his day is full, +Harry only got a small amount of his done,+ Vernon gets home, Sees that only Harry's chores aren't done, Calls Harry a layabout, Punishes him and makes him finish his chores.

*** Interesting. But why would Vernon assign chores to his wife? I would imagine that Petunia, who is a stay at home mum, knows far better what has to be done in the house than Vernon, who has a full time job.

**** You just kicked my memory into gear. Your right, what happened was Vernon assigned some chores to Dudley and Harry, as soon as he left the driveway Dudley forced his chores onto Harry. Once Dudley's chores were done, Petunia just kept giving him more and more chores until his day was full with the chores she gave him.
