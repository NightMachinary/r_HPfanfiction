This is a fic where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

My thoughts on the new chapter (spoilers!):

This chapter starts off with Harry waking up the day after his Sorting and going on a run with Mischief. I wasn't particularly sure whether or not I was going to have Harry run, especially since in the previous chapters I had said that he wouldn't be running with her, but I actually decided to have him go running with her anyway since it gave me a chance to go over Occlumency a little bit and it allowed me to flesh out some of Harry's feelings on returning to the castle and him dealing with PTSD.

This chapter was also particularly fun for me to write since I got to begin lying down some groundwork for future chapters. Describing the common room and how the light filtered through the large windows was particularly fun and I'm going to enjoy writing the common room and a lot of its aspects in the future.

Writing Snape had been particularly difficult for me. I'm not particularly good at writing his character---I never have been---but I feel that I got some of his emotions and reaction to Harry across rather decently. Writing him in the latter half of the chapter was kind of interesting, because I decided to have Harry realize that he'd never really looked into Snape in depth. He only really saw what he wanted to see, and he never really realized that while Snape's form of teaching is difficult and different, he is teaching in a way that is productive and when you're working with dangerous potions and ingredients and whatnot.

The worldbuilding was a fun aspect, too. I ended up googling a lot of different things about Potions in Harry Potter and potions modern witches use, but I'm not particularly sure if I got it across well enough or not. I always thought there was more to it than cutting up some ingredients, plopping them in a cauldron, and stirring, so it was fun to discuss some of that and how Harry actually isn't horrible at Potions. I was actually planning to have Harry discuss how his magic sensing ability helped him with brewing, but I decided to scrap that idea. I may go into it more in the future, especially once I go over the Sabbats.

Having Harry interact with Neville was definitely me laying out some groundwork and I'm going to enjoy figuring out how their relationship flourishes in the future as well as how their peers react to them being friends.

This fic includes all of that tropey and cliche stuff in (hopefully) inventive ways. Those tropes and cliches (amongst other stuff) include:

- /Fix it!/ As few people die as possible!
- /Slytherin!Harry/. Harry's not suited for Gryffindor anymore, though he could've been in Ravenclaw. He'll be using the politics of Slytherin (favours and allies) to his advantage this time around.
- /Powerful!Intelligent!Independent!Harry./ Harry's got some new tricks up his sleeves, including and not limited to: spellcrafting, warding, and curse-breaking!
- /Lordships!/ Yes, Harry is the heir to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses (Potter and Black), but gone is "extremely powerful, bow down bitches" cliche. Harry, like many other children in Slytherin, is simply only the heir of those two Houses and he doesn't have ridiculous power due to that. The Lordships are only titles for those who have seats on the Wizengamot (though many of the older families were appointed by King Arthur and Merlin themselves) and they only have the political power due to their family. Meaning Harry has to deal with the stigma of the Blacks and the fact that the Potters hadn't been in the game for decades. It's a good thing that being the Vanquisher of Voldemort, aka the Boy-Who-Lived, gives him some political power to work with! Though, a lot of people will seek Harry as an ally because he'll have more votes than others in the Wizengamot, meaning that if someone wants a bill passed, they should get on his side to get him to back them up.
- /Grey/Dark!Harry./ Harry's not evil, Merlin no, but he certainly isn't the "Light Golden Boy" anymore! He's killed and tortured and he's practising darker, sometimes illegal magic! And let's not forget the fact that even though he was an Auror, he lived in a house full of Dark history and secrets; including a secret library! And some other stuff I mentioned earlier in the fic but I'll leave that to you to read.
- /PTSD and Abuse./ So, I might have dialled the abuse up just a bit? It's still pretty canon. The abuse is only mentioned in the fic (meaning no scenes where Vernon violently belts Harry), but Harry does experience some anxiety and panic due to his cupboard. The starvation thing is something I'll be touching on a bit as well as Harry dissociating (see if you can spot the mention of that one). I've also apparently given Harry a service/therapy dog on accident, so that's cute.
- /Canon Compliant/ */and/* /Divergent./ As this fic takes place after the books, it's safe to say that anything you read in the books is canon in my fic. It'll stay that way for most of the major plot points (Basilisk on the loose, Sirius breaking out, Goblet of Fire, Dementor attack, etc.) until after fourth year where the changes kick-off. The magic system I use is pretty fanon, such as magical "cores" existing and the Trace acting differently.
- /Epilogue, What Epilogue?/ I might have taken a few tidbits out of the epilogue (mainly about Harry being an Auror), but Harry never got married to Ginny nor did he have children.
- /Cursed Child nods./ I am mainly ignoring anything that was written in the Cursed Child (mostly because I've never read it), though I did add a few tidbits from the character wikis into the fic. This includes Harry still being a Parselmouth after he got the Horcrux removed and Theo messing around with time turners.
- /Bashing./ My bashing is completely/almost based on canon events/personalities/characteristics. Hermione is a bit insufferable and rude at the beginning ("Are you sure that's a /real/ spell?") and she's a bit closed-minded towards wizarding customs and traditions, Ron's */not/* a prejudiced prat who spits vitriol furiously at the sight of a Slytherin but he will get jealous of Harry during the Goblet of Fire, Molly Weasley will be bashed slightly on the fact that she took over Sirius's house and cleaned it out and threw shit away (like, you could have /sold/ all that stuff, and not to mention the books!) but that's all (and the fact that she's an overbearing, presumptuous person), Sirius and Remus will be touched a bit on their flaws, and some of Dumbledore's manipulations will be mentioned but Harry's not going to be super pissed at him. Oh, and the Dursleys, but that's a given.
- /Harry Potter/Theodore Nott/. I absolutely love this relationship. The fanon version of Theo has so much in common with Harry and I feel like they would just click. There's also the bonus that Theo's a pretty undiscovered character so I can describe him/characterize him however I like. It's also a nice difference to Harry/Draco fics, where Theo is still Dark but he's less well-known than Draco and he can sympathize more than Draco.

Feel free to ask me any questions about the fic or if you want more of an explanation on something I've mentioned above!

This is such a weird thing to be offended by. Sirius didn't give a shit iirc and even then, wasn't all the stuff she threw out moldy crap and dubiously legal items?

*** You're not wrong, but Harry does kind of own the stuff (since he's Sirius's heir) and there's also the fact that the Blacks, despite being "evil" and Dark, own quite a bit of useful items (I'm thinking of books), especially for my version of Harry.

** This definitely sounds interesting, and I'm a sucker for time travel fix it fics. I can tell this one has a unique flavor, and I'll definitely check it out.

I do agree with the other commenter that the Molly bashing seems nitpicky, and I'm wondering why you feel the need to include it in your story. Canonically, I'm pretty sure she had Sirius' blessing to clean out the house, and, at the time, the stuff in no way belonged to Harry, so he really has no right to be angry at her. Could be she got rid of some potentially useful objects, but that's not a reason to bash her, especially as she had the permission of the homeowner at the time to do what she did. I would hope there's a way of addressing this situation without making Molly out to be the bad guy. Jeez, she was just doing her best under an enormous amount of stress.

About Snape. I don't know how this is addressed in your fic, but I have to say that I dislike when Harry is the one who has to change his perception of Snape when /he/ was the innocent child in this. He didn't see what he "wanted to see"; he started his first year with zero expectations and Snape was inarguably abusive to him, as well as to many other students. Sure, as a teacher, Snape absolutely needed to keep control of a classroom that could easily turn deadly with one misstep, but that has nothing to do with the sick pleasure he took in verbally abusing defenseless children and blatantly favoring some students over others. I'm all for humanizing Snape; I do it in my own fics, but I'm of the opinion that he needs to be called out for his misdeeds instead of explaining them away as justified.

Just my thoughts, and I'm genuinely interested in your response.

*** I don't necessarily plan for Harry to outright say that Molly's a horrid person for throwing out Sirius's stuff or whatever, especially since Sirius himself didn't care, but in this fic, Harry /does/ care. He's just going to end up convincing Sirius to allow him to keep some stuff or whatever, since Harry's his heir and he'll end up getting the house if he doesn't have a kid, and stuff like that. There's also the fact that in my fic, he'd been living in Grimmauld Place for over three years and he basically considers the house and its contents /his/ even if it's not his yet, you get me? She'll probably kick up a fuss/dislike that Sirius is going to allow Harry to have all of these "dark and dangerous items" or whatever, but it's not like Harry's planning on using the dark objects (he'll remove any curses) and he's not going to do any of the really Dark magic in any of the books.

I'm kind of terrible at writing Snape, if I'm being honest. He's such a complex and horrible character in the books and I feel like I won't do him justice. Of course, Harry won't /completely/ like Snape or defend him or whatever. Snape's still a pretty nasty character even if I'm going to try and keep him mild. I'll have to take care of how I handle Snape in the future, for sure.

***** I wasn't saying it was unreasonable, it's perfectly understandable since Harry's technically a minor, but the fact that I'm focusing on is that Molly often sees fit to mother all children, even those that are not her own. Well, at least I think so. She doesn't want the children involved in the war, and that's perfectly understandable considering all of the deaths in the previous war that were children or young adults, but the fact is that they kind of are involved in the war. Especially Harry.

** I thought this was another well-written chapter! There were some things that weren't to my personal taste - mainly the Snape apologism piece because I really don't think there's any excuse for his nasty behavior. He may be throwing in instructions amidst the insults, but it's hard to process the instruction when it's being given in between the insults he spews. I personally don't think that's a productive way of teaching or excusable, but I know plenty of fans think differently and it's your writing, so take that with a grain of salt!

I appreciate that you spell out all your tropes in your summaries here, but don't feel like you have to go into things that aren't happening for a while yet. The Molly Weasley thing is minor enough that it probably isn't worth a warning, though I'm curious to see how the storyline is going to progress in order for that event to even happen. I always got the impression that the Weasleys were staying at Grimmauld Place because Ron was Harry's best friend and they were known as being very close to him. They weren't even members of the Order the first time around. With the story so different here, with Harry in Slytherin and close to Theo, I'm interested to see how that will play out.

*** Thank you for the comment/review! It's greatly appreciated so I can see what I lack in my writing and what people prefer to see.

I definitely realize that I'm kind of going soft on Snape. He's an extremely difficult character to write so I may end up keeping a sort of antagonistic relationship between him and his students --- Harry especially. I didn't really mean to have him come across as a decent person and eleven-year-old Harry just didn't realize, but it kinda ended up that way. I'll find some way to fix that mistake in the future.

I'm totally looking forward to the next few years, especially fifth, sixth, and seventh year.
