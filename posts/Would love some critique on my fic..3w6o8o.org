** You need to do something about the info-dump up front. I'd try interspersing it in scenes where something's going on. In fact, there's a lot that you could cut out all together -- or at least, put somewhere else. For example, instead of saying he's ageless, have him look at his hands while he's brewing a potion or something and internally comment on how they should be incredibly wrinkled instead of smooth. Another thing is Ginny, instead of the whole spiel about how she died, have him continue to mourn her and think of her occasionally.

The info-dump is actually a huge turn-off and a chore to read. I personally would have exited out after skimming the first paragraph. Then again, I am a fairly lazy reader... but most people are these days.

If you want more of my specific brand of tips, I'll be happy to provide.

** I skimmed it and the writing is okay and the premise seems good. I'd be happy to give it a more thorough critique if you'd like, thought are you looking for anything specific?

I'm wondering where you plan on going with the story. Harry seems pretty OP and these types of stories run out of steam rather quickly.

*** First of all, thanks for taking your time to read it.

You are correct in saying that stories centered on OP characters are quite difficult to write. But I rather like OP characters (blame falls on Noblesse, btw) and writing this story is a sort of challenge that I've taken. Basically, I want to write a story with an OP character and make it as engaging as is possible.

**** I followed the story so I'll keep up with it. It'll be important to focus on characters instead of events since Harry is so powerful.

** I'd say definitely look for a beta. The writing isn't /bad/, but it's a little below my standards for what I would continue reading beyond the first chapter. I noticed several missing words or grammar errors, and some awkward phrasing.

Don't take that the wrong way, that's what everyone's first few drafts look like and as an author you don't want to focus on endlessly revising your story, you want to write more new story. That's why a beta is so great, you can send them your first or second draft and have them point out any mistakes or things they don't understand and then make corrections quickly.

Sorry to not focus on the story more, I'll just say that if something is truly well-written I'll read it regardless of content unless it's completely boring or totally grosses me out. Good writing can elevate even the most mundane plot.

*** Thanks for your suggestions. To be honest, I found quite a lot of errors on my re-read too. As for a Beta, I have no idea how to get one nor do I know whether someone would want to volunteer given how recent this fic is. I would definitely be re-editing the chapters to correct the small mistakes. Once again, thanks for your feedback.

** Found the summary confusing. I assume the love of Snake's life is Lily, so why wouldn't he remember her. Presumably it has to do with the terrible cost, ... then why is the question how Snape can fare in this world when Harrying is the one who dimension hoped?

*** Thanks for your insight and having read what you said, the summary does indeed looks a bit confusing. I will be updating it soon enough.
