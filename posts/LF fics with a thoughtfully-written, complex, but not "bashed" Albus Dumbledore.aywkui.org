Like many people (or so I assume), I have real problems with canon Dumbledore (insert complaints about his treatment of Harry etc., here). At the same time, I'm not able to stomach superficial, one-dimensional, "bashed" Dumbledores that oversimplify him as evil puppet-master or the like (as we see in so many 'righteously indignant,' insufferable Indy!Harry fics).

I'm looking for well-written fics that contain thoughtful representations of Dumbledore that offer fleshed-out, compelling characterizations that better reflect his responses to what I, when I'm feeling charitable, admit are circumstances that required him to make hard choices. I'm okay with him still being treated as an antagonist if it is well done.\\
I'd prefer Harry-centric fics, but it you know of something else, please do recommend it for other readers.\\
I have no preferences as to pairings, het, slash, etc.

Thanks in advance. I'm sure this has been asked before, but the search feature kept returning bashed after bashed Dumbledore thread.

**** It's hard to find complex characters in Harry Potter fanfiction. An issue is that the way canon is written, the adults are all incompetent. Linkffn(3787073) is also a good story.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I generally like Dumbledore as described by WhiteSquirrel (heck, I like his writing generally ;)), so linkao3(14078862) and its sequels.

I am in the middle of reading linkffn(13197260), which seems to be rather surprisingly pleasant fem!Harry, excitement about dresses and fluff are kept to the reasonable level and there is still pretty good story around it. It has pretty good description of well-meaning but blundering Dumbledore.

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

*** Thanks for these. I've seen /Accidental Animagus/ rec'd a fair bit, but I tend to avoid early-years fics. I'll check it out. Same with the other one (which I've never heard of). I usually can't stomach fem!Harry, but am buoyed by the relative absence of dress-inspired excitement :)
