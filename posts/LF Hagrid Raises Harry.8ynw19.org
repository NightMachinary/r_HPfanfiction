Getting into ridiculous adventures, like the Fanon Harry Potter rides a Dragon and tames a Nundo by age 8 sort of Books all being real, and he has Hagrid's extreme love of "Oh he's not dangerous" as Harry stroked his pet Nundu sort of craziness


** yeah the post about badass hagrid made me think about this too. i have read fics where Harry is raised by Sirius, Trelawney, Umbridge, Goblins, Snape, Voldemort and Himself, but not a single one with Hagrid !

**** When little Harry grew up with Hagrid's accent, well, everybody thought that was just adorable.

When they realized he was /incapable/ of proper pronunciation... it suddenly wasn't.
