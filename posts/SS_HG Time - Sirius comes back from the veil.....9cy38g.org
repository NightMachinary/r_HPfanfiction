I am looking for this story and I can't remember for the life of me where it is! It involves Dumbledore charging Hermione to 'keep an eye' on her fellow classmates. Her and Snape are drawn together out of their mutual spying. The big element of this fic is that Sirius has returned from beyond the veil and he has a mysterious watch that is keeping him alive and he is sortof stalking Hermione. It seems like he is some kind of inferi. There is also a Pansy/Remus pairing in this fic! Anyway, ALOT going on and I would love to read it again. Can anyone help?
