I've read “A Marauders Plan” and enjoyed it, but I would like some more fics that get into Lordships without the overdone bashing and OP Harry stuff. Forgoing that: I would not mind reading all of that in a great crack tic or subversion. Also I made this. “Lord Hadrian Black-Potter-Slytherin-GRIFFINDOR-Peverell and the recently exonerated Lord Sirius Black of the Ancient an Most Noble House of Black go shopping in Diagon Alley for Dragonhide boots” [[https://imgur.com/a/9ZqHrkU]]


** I have just today created [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nnacju/just_to_say_how_delightful_the_beginning_of_the/][this other thread]] and I am referring to it second time today already. That author has uncanny ability to use the worst tropes possible in the manner which is rather inoffensive and cute. “Oh I am so glad you are alive after your very heroic act! And also, you are grounded for the rest of the summer.”
