I read a fic a while ago that had Harry (and James) with dark skin.

I don't remember much about it except that it was Harry/Hermione and an authors' note early on mentioned that JK never says anything about Harry or James' skin and one of the reasons Petunia didn't like James was because of it.


** While I fully understand the idea here, and I find it delightful, it just doesn't make much sense to me.

It's all down to some basic logic. Harry's mother Lilly is a redhead with vibrant green eyes, these are fairly ressesive traits in the grand scheme of things and therefore make it unlikely that Harry would get dark skin from his mother's side. Harry's father James is a british pureblood with several distinct physical characteristics. As far as the British pureblood bit goes, most of the British pureblood population is mostly Caucasian. Not only that, but Harry's other distinctive feature of his father's hair is described as black and messy, but never particularly curly. While having straight, albeit very messy hair, does not really mean much in the way of indicating genetic or ethnic heritage. The pureblood part does. The potters were an established fixture in Britain. They were related to the majority of the pureblood families in some way or another, thus making the common genetic trends among the other purebloods a good indicator for Harry and James appearance. And while it is certainly possible for James to not be fully Caucasian like most pureblodd, the likely heritage of Lilly combined with the fact that Harry does inherit down of Lilly's traits means they have not been genetically drowned out.

As I said, I quite like the idea of a darker skinned Harry, I just can't see it making sense for this to be the case.

*** First of all, it's fan fiction; the entire point is to change things. Lily's hair and eyes are distinctive but hardly essential to the plot, and it would be trivial to change her appearance.

Second of all, even if you want to avoid that sort of change for whatever reason, your argument about the Potters is flimsy. Of the pureblood families we only see the Weasleys and the Blacks in any significant quantity. Dorea Black married into the Potter family but has no established blood relation to James, and the Weasleys have no known relation to the Potters aside from their own link to the Blacks. That covers two of the /twenty-eight/ families known for being /fully/ pure-blooded, which the Potters aren't. It's entirely possible that there is significantly more racial variation in Wizarding society than Muggle society.

As others have mentioned, there are even some specific highly plausible possibilities leading to a non-white Potter family. Britain has had close ties to India since before the stated establishment of the Statute of Secrecy, and if we accept the heavily hinted Roman influence in magical society (through naming, the use of Latin, and prevalence of Arthurian mythology---one of the most frequently mentioned candidates for influencing the Merlin legend was a Roman general) along with the increased ease of long-distance travel using magic it seems quite likely that prominent families could come from any part of the Roman Empire. Egypt, in particular, is a popular choice for having a large amount of influence in magical history, is specifically mentioned in canon, is implied to have a relatively close relationship with Britain given Bill Weasley's occupation, and has a large non-white population.

Being confident in the impossibility of a non-white Harry is a sign of internal biases more than anything. JKR gives very little concrete information about the magical world.

** Desi!Harry is a very common trope, especially on AO3. You're going to have to give a lot more detail than that to be able to narrow it down

There's a list [[https://desiharrypotterblog.tumblr.com/tagged/fanfiction][here]], if you want to look through that, although that Tumblr doesn't appear to be the most active

** I'm gonna bet it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer]], well loved fic where James was Indian. It is based on this prompt:

/do you ever wonder what would have happened if the dursleys had actually managed to hide harry's identity from him until he turned 17/

/like dumbledore somehow lost track of them when vernon changed jobs or when they moved houses, and for some reason they just couldn't find them again/

/and harry potter the boy who lived grew up attending typical schools and his friends knew that sometimes weird shit would happen around him, but they just thought it was a coincidence or that they were imagining it but slowly they all left him and he grew up even more isolated and angry and so he runs away at 16/

/and meanwhile voldemort knows harry ran away and that he is out there somewhere, vulnerable, but he's not in the wizarding world, so his death eaters are wreaking havoc trying to find him/

/and harry obviously has magical talent but he doesn't know that, but every child in hogwarts does and they've learned about him and now know that he's just out there somewhere, completely unaware of what's going to happen to him/

/and some kids it doesn't bother, but for others like neville and hermione and luna and ron, it's horrifying to think that this innocent person who should be in their year is going to be hunted down like this/

/so they decide to go find him before voldemort or the death eaters can/

/and harry is in a train station on his way to work and is converged upon by about six people who are trying their hardest to not freak out and tell him that he's a wizard in grave danger, but they know they have such little time/

/so instead of the wizarding world finding harry at 11, it finds him at 16 and a half when it's in a much darker, desperate place/

/i don't know i just really like the idea of harry potter joining the wizarding world through a bunch of rebellious hogwarts dropouts hiding throughout england and running from enemies he didn't know he had and learning magic along the way in dark alleys and through street fights/
