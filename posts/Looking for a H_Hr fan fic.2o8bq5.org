I started reading a fan fic story but closed the browser before I saved the bookmark. I was quite a ways in to the story too.

Summary of what I've read thus far: Harry and Hermione are in a relationship but have to keep it a secret from the rest of the school for two reasons, one is that they don't want gunny to find out, the other is that they are head boy and girl. They return to hogwash for their seventh year. Minerva gives them leave whenever they want. They have Portkeys that can transport them even into hogwarts. Hermiones parents are attacked as well as the French school. At one point they end up in Egypt tracking down a horcrux. The two of them can communicate telepathically. Tonka and Remus are teachers at the school. The author color codes the different characters quotes. Gunny runs off with draco. Percy is a death eater. Umbridge comes back. Hermione duels ginny and harry duels a slitherin at the beginning. If any of you know of the story im trying to remember I'd really appreciate jt.
