** *DISLIKES:*

-Manipulative Dumbledore who does a crapton of evil shit in his first scene then mumbles to himself about "the greater good". Honestly, those three words are so overused in the fuckton of manipulative Dumbledore fics.

-Harry just goes up to the goblins and they give him a bunch of free things and then do a ritual that makes him stronger than Merlin and have a million lordships. Make your heroes work for their advantages, don't just hand them over on a silver platter.

-Half of the fic is just training scenes with no purpose besides establishing what the characters can do. If you add a training scene, use it to help the characters evolve or to add in some humour.

-Everyone gets perfectly paired up in a relationship, and each relationship proceeds with no or minimal drama. I get that magic could feasibly make finding stable relationships easier, but there are stories where everyone gets paired up with their life partner around the age of 15, which tends to push the limits of my suspension of disbelief.

-Reiterating canon with no or minimal changes. Or writing a scene that is almost exactly canon with only one character responding differently. Assume your writer is familiar enough with canon that they don't need to see an entire scene from canon reiterated with no changes.

*LIKES:*

-Give your characters different strengths and weaknesses. Having one or two characters excel at everything makes additional cast members feel cumbersome. Having every cast member excel at everything makes them fail to stand out.

-Unique plots/subplots. Even if you follow canon closely, adding in some twists of your own in the form of original subplots is a great way to spice up your work.

-Spice up the villains. Voldemort and Umbridge are very one dimensional. Add a some backstory or new motivations to give them some complexity.

If you go with a evil!Dumbledore, keep in mind the guy has more than a century of experiance and is one of the most powerful wizards of his time. He's just not gonna be outsmarted by bunch of kids.

Any evil!Dumbledore should at least be competent. Also, if it were easy to see though his act, it would have happened long ago. It shouldn't be so easy to see through him or to out him.

It really depends on which kind of villains you want. If you go for a cartoonish, pure evil villain and give him a tortured past and complex motivations, it won't work. If you go for a more subtle villain who has complex or ambiguous motivations and don't give him a sloid backstory, it won't work either.

The Joker doesn't need added complexity, it weakens the character. Magneto, on the other hand, does.

** Overused/disliked: Helpful/friendly goblins who give inheritance tests (shouldn't something like that be done at a medical facility?), Lordship of more than one house (even being Lord Potter can be a little tiring to read after a while), sudden manifestation of magical ability (sure, Harry is going through a 'magical time' in his life, but becoming the next Odin over night seems a bit contrived), MARRIAGE CONTRACTS AND FRACKIN' MAGICAL CORES!!!

Like/Rarely Seen: Awkward boarding school moments (Harry walks in on someone polishing their knob), believable house unity (I'd list examples but...), Luna Lovegood done right (she's more a Cloudcuckoolander than a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, don't get them confused, unless that's the point), and realistic flaws (not some contrived 'flaw' that turns out to work to the characters favor later, but a real, debilitating flaw that has to be worked at to be mitigated).

There's a thousand other tropes that have been 'overused' (Time Travel, Death giving Harry a do-over, ect...), but if you're able to use a trope right, then people are going to like the story even if there's a billion that use that trope as well. It really depends on your passion for your own writing and how good an editor you/the person editing are/is.

**** I'll do my best to answer from my phone.

Basically, every attempt I've seen at house unity seems forced, either due to a 'helpful Slytherin' making the first reach across the gap (highly unlikely to begin with), or Harry realizing there is some nefarious plot that's been hatched by an adult who wants Hogwarts divided (in walks evil Dumbledore).

It would really be dependent on when the story began, but I think there are plenty of ways to get Harry introduced to people in other houses and have those friendships break away at the animosity there seems to be between the houses at Hogwarts.

Maybe there are a lot of stories out there that do this well and I've just not seen them, but I think there should be a drive to make more stories with this 'trope'.

** As people said, write what you want, if you want to read your story, then there are other people who also would. But if you want to know taste of people :

- Tries to escape the biggest cliche (lord potter, magical inheritance, slytherin full of seasoned 11 years old politicians, manipulative Dumbledore, Weasleys only friends for money . . .)
- If you don't write a full AU, some events from canon are inavoidable (Voldemort probably try to steal the stone, Lockart will be there for year 2 or the Triwizard Tournament will happen), but if your character is different, some scene should not exist. (For example, I remember seeing a Slytherin Harry where Draco still wants a midnight duel, Harry lives in the same room as him and yet still go to Trophee room, and still tries to escape to 3rd flood corridor even if as a Slytherin it's like the exact opposite direction from his dorm).
- I guess it's a matter of taste, but some expression are so overused it may be best to not use them (I cannot imagine Sirius ever calling Harry Pup or Prongslet, except in the sole objective of messing with him when he reacts to this, same for Remus and Cub).
- Characterization is important, Seer Luna is not really canon compliant and a bit overused, Hermione is not Perfect (not matter what movie want you to think) and Ron is not a complete idiot that just barely passes class by copying Hermione (academicly speaking, the only notable difference between his grades and Harry's is that Harry is better in Defense, for the rest they have close grades).

Maybe it's not the most popular trope, but if it's something you personally like, your writing will most likely be better, and for a lot of people, that's worth more than the "perfect trope".

** Bashing.

I know you hate some Harry Potter characters (mostly Weasleys as they stole best girls from Harry), but do not bash them for wrong reasons. For example, Ron is not an abuser. He never physically attacks his friends. (Infact there are more chances that Hermione would be abusive in their relationship).

Don't bash them for stupid reasons. Avoid bashing as much as possible. If you want to do bashing then make the reasons compelling and characters OOC. Because the only bashable canon characters are perhaps Snape, Fudge, Umbridge, Malfoys or Algie Longbottom etc.

*** May I point out that the "Ron never physically attacks his friends" actually gives him the moral high ground over /both/ Harry and Hermoine. Everyone knows the bird scene in HBP, but everyone seems to overlook the scene in GoF where Ron accidentally interrupts Harry's fire call with Sirius because he woke up and noticed him missing- and even when they're upset with each other, Ron still cares enough to go looking for him in the middle of the night. Harry responds by chucking a "Potter Stinks" badge at his face.

Ron is the /only/ member of the Golden Trio who has never physically attacked his friends in some way- Harry and Hermoine both do when they're angry.

** Over used: cassanova Harry who for inexplicable reasons everyone falls in love with, a well adjusted lover without reason. Like a veela will automatically love him, or bones or mine or even in a harem without development nor following what happened before. A kid raised in a fucked up environment is not an adjusted individual nor is a post war Harry so neatly pairing people up ESPECIALLY before they even reach puberty. Super smart Hermione that figures out everything like deus ex machina.

Another I don't like is Lord Potter or overly competent Harry who can do everything perfectly because reasons. Without flaws or drive.

Overly mature Harry that learns everything since he reads books, like no body every did that before. Use of unknown obscure magic without compensation and some how curb stomping everyone.

Learning something that's not plot relevant.. being an animagus just so he can have a cute marauder nickname but has no actual bearing to he plot... Like not even for accompanying Remus since they don't bother warablish any rapport with him.

What I like: that awkward teenage love and not knowing what to do.

A socially awkward Harry or at least a consistent characterization where established personality doesn't get squashed by plot and do thing simply plot says so.

A good friend Harry, because people can be friends with girl without them being your girlfriend or be friends with them because they are your friends girlfriends.

Luna as a resident conspiracy theorist, the "alien overlord" "Illuminati confirmed" or "lizard people" kind of magical crazy not a seer or manic pixie girl.

** Avoid:

-Unreasonable bashing. If you want to "bash" a character then make it realistic. Write key events that hint at the fact that something is different from cannon. A sudden change in behavior is almost never unprecedented and, like it or not, cannon does not present the most bashed characters how those authors present them. Even if you make it AU, generally readers will be caught of guard if an character does something that does not correlate with cannon (even if it DOES make sense in the Alternate Universe you describe). Take it slow, maybe use narration to describe what is different from cannon.

​

-Errors in continuity. That's one my pet peeves; as someone that loves searching for details that hint what the future plot will be it really breaks my immersion when I notice a continuity error. That can be anything from a forgotten plot device to contradictions between 2 successive paragraphs. If, for example, a character receives an injury then you can't have that character jumping around and fighting like the injury didn't exist. Yes, someone can ignore their injuries mid-battle but they will have a negative impact, sooner or later it is going to flare up, causing you immense pain. Also, if (in a class/traning or reading montage) you have a character learning something out of the ordinary then don't just forget it and never use it or even worse, have them learning about it again later whilst they comment how useful it is! I believe every author should have a table somewhere listing all the little details they've added in order to not forget about them.

​

-Errors in writing. The plot should be one of the priorities but it should not come in the expense of quality. Quantity over quality does NOT work in fanfiction. No matter how amazing or good your plot it, if it's littered with typos and error in the grammar and syntax then it's going to be unbearable to read. Do NOT, for the love of god, mix up their/there, your/you're and other similar sounding words; it's one of the worst mistakes one can make (in my opinion).

​

Advice:

Disclaimer, I am not an author (yet) however, I have given a lot of though regarding what I would do if I ever try to write a fic of my own, this is what I came up with.

Create a diagram of the plot. Have the start, the plot devices and the end written down. You can always change something later (as long as you shift around everything else in order to avoid having the change stand out.

​

I have more to write but i'm running out of time right now. I will come back later and add more.

**** Rereading my comment, I think I made a small mistake using the description "low level petty." What I meant was simply /normal/ crimes. Breaking & entering. Theft. Kidnapping. Murder. A new asshole who tries to become the next dark lord. Or something even more exotic.

The key idea I had in mind was that of criminals or other antagonists who think they're hot shit, and maybe they really /are/ hot shit, but Harry and Ron are even /hotter/ shit and never actually feel like they're in danger.

** Instead of likes and dislikes. I figured it would be easier to link some fics that I thought were good, despite having tropes/cliches.

Linkffn(12141684) The Red Knight is full of eleven year old political masterminds. It does however have some of the best character dialog in Fan Fiction, an excellent AU plot. That while maintaining similarities to the cannon will surprise you. And my favourite Ron characterisation in HP Fan Fiction. I honestly laughed at some of the Ron/Daphne moments.

​

Linkffn(11191235) Who hasn't heard of the Prince of Slytherin. It is popular for a reason, I think a big part of that is the World Building. When I was reading, I was always looking to see how cannon would diverge is the best ways possible. It also has one of my favourite quotes. It really shows how to do a sorting correctly.

>!Which is more important? That everyone around you know how brave you are? Or that you actually be brave?

The question surprised her and brought her up short. She thought for a few seconds. Be brave, always.!<

​

Linkffn(11160991) 0800-Rent-A-Hero is just a great example of Harry dragging himself out of a ditch, flicking the middle finger at everybody and making something of himself. The only issue is the WIP status.

** Dislike:

Not sure if it's a trope but I hate it when I'm reading fics like snape adopts harry and the writer writes harry like a young child even if hes in his Hogwarts years. I mean if you're writing him as abused and want it to be realistic then yeah it's normal that he would regress but I've read stories where harry is totally normal then suddenly hes this kid who's like 5

Marriage law. It feels like a cheap (that sounds rude sorry I just couldn't think of another word) way to get two characters together (like dramione)

Mpreg. Nuff said

Random balls: Christmas, halloween, Valentine's day etc

Like:

I might be in the minority but I love bashing fics. Eh on Dumbledore but that's because hes not my favorite anyway so I tend to go to ron/molly/ginny/Hermione bashing and maybe sirius/remus/tonks bashing if I feel like it.

Annnd I cant think of anything else right now but dont just take our word for what to avoid. I firmly believe that anyone can take an overused trope and make it good

** The thing with tropes is that they aren't bad in a vacuum. They're bad when poorly implemented.

i.e., manipulative Dumbledore, Mr greater good. Obnoxious trope, right? But not if you make him conflicted, tortured by the hard decisions he has to make. The choice between what is right and what is easy.

Even an overused trope can be fun and entertaining and compelling if done in an interesting way, with depth.
