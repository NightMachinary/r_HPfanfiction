Specially after witnessing two world wars. Instead of standing up and devoting time and resources to advance forward they settled for hiding away.

And it's all thanks to their own arrogance because they can bend nature to their will. Sure there are portions and stuff. But when you can apparate (freaking teleportation), have a mirror that can travel between worlds, can control people minds and so on and forth, it's ridiculous that muggles can trump them if they're discovered.

Instead of hiding away, they should've dedicated heaps of resources into develop their power to the highest level. Look what muggles can accomplish with science, and yet there are limits we can't break. But wizards can break nature's laws. The possibility is endless.

To make matter worse, they label anyone with such mindset a Dark Lord, and put a bunch of laws in place to bar people from going beyond the safe and convenient.

** They've got a way smaller population. No surprise that that slows down the pace of innovation.

** We regularly hear about advances being made in the WW. You're mistaking a lack of interest in imitating muggles for a lack of progress.

** That they are like this is stupid, yes, but understandable. People are afraid of change, that's just natural. There are also the laws of magic, and the small population. The wars would have also lowered the population, which leaves a lot less options for people to experiment when they're still recovering from war. There is also the matter that, at the core, they're just different people. They are very separated from the non-magical world, and since it's something very different, they are afraid to take those steps into something new. It's like how older people in this day and age will refuse to use some technology because they think it's pointless or something like that. People are just stubborn, and at the core, they want to stick to what they know.

At the end of the day, Rowling wrote the wizarding world the way it is, and we can just play around in her sandbox and knock over the castle she made to make a better one.
