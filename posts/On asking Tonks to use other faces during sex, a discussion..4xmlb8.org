Recently, I was debating the potential pairings in my Darkness!Harry story. One of those is, of course, Tonks/Harry and Tonks/Harry/anotherfemalecharacter.

One of the things I find annoying in some stories is Harry asking Tonks to look like someone else but I always chuckle at Tonks shifting mid-coitus to tease Harry. One moment he's with his girlfriend, a minute later, another witch is looking down on him.

But what do you think of Harry asking, out of the blue, for her to use a specific face? I personally find it to be kind of creepy and very rude. Kind of along the lines of putting a bag on someone's face to have sex with them.

The idea came from Harry potentially having a thing for Sinistra in my story and asking Tonks to take on her guise for a night of passion. And then I saw Harry asking her to do it more and more and got kinda squicked out.

So, anyway, thoughts on metamorphmagus sexual shenanigans?


** Hypothetically, if I were Tonks I would probably oblige if it were some unattainable person (like Angelina Jolie, a young Sophia Loren, or maybe some random from a 16th century painting). I'd be uncomfortable/offended if he asked for a girl he actually /liked/ or knew on a personal level. Hits too close to home, like you undeniably /know/ he's thinking of her while having sex with you.

** Well, hypothetically speaking, if I were Tonks and someone asked me to do that, I'd oblige them if we happened to be in a relationship and all was well and it was a rare request. Because, you know, a bit of roleplay once in a while never hurt anyone (who isn't stupid already).

That said, if such a request came from someone with whom I wasn't in a relationship, they'd get something disturbing instead, like Snape's face, or their own mother's.

So yeah, it's kind of potentially creepy, but if kept to a minimum and in a well-established relationship, it could count as just roleplay.

**** Yes, but with the polyjuice potion it is a tad different, as it takes pretty much ages to brew and goes bad fairly quickly in comparison so it'd have to be a premeditated thing, not to mention having to get the hair of a given person which is not necessarily the most difficult of tasks but certainly a creepy one with some targets.

So the polyjuice thing is probably going to be creepy all-around unless the lovers used the potion to change into each other, the potion happened to be given to them as a gift from a friend and had the hair already in (because, you know, if you don't use it up it will go bad), or the person making the potion takes it themselves as a gift for their lover with their approval before taking it.

** Here's an idea. Have this conflict you're having in the character. It's be an interesting point of minor drama for Harry not to know how to ask it, for Tonks to decide whether or not her confidence is hurt etc. Instead of her having a pre prepared opinion, let her decide in character.

Also, please oh please dont let Harry be like "I wanna see your real face" with Tonks like "nobody has ever asked me for that before ugu~" because that shits cliche as fuck

Because it would be very strange if it were true, too. It just doesn't make sense to me.

When you're in love, at the very least you want to know the person with whom you're in love. And particularly what that person looks like. Anything else seems a bit creepy to me.

** At some point, I'd like to write a story that makes full use of Tonks's metamorph ability, since it's so rare in fanfic and was equally underutilized in canon. Here's my perspective on her character:

- Tonks /does/ have a "natural form". It might not be exact, but she reverts to something close to it when she's depressed, as in HBP.

- She can either change gender or at least change her body proportions enough to pass for a man.

- She naturally changes her proportions to suit her needs, switching from a slim and athletic form on the job to a curvier form for her off hours, and maybe other go-to forms as needed.

- Contrary to the cliche, most of the men Tonks is with do ask to see her real face, and it annoys her because she thinks it's boring.

- She gets offended if someone asks her to become a specific person they know, but she appreciates men (and maybe women) who can get creative with (for lack of a better term) body modification, as long as they're respectful about it, and she's not shy about doing it herself.

- I can see her doing role play in a committed relationship as well as shifting forms to tease Harry, but if he asked for it all the time, she'd knock some sense into him.

***** That reminds me of fics where Harry asks to see the real Tonks and she falls in love with him for asking--shite stories all. I've used the "I switched so much I don't remember my real form" in stories when people ask her that. And it's usually the true answer in my stories. Sometimes I'll use the 'reverts to real form in her sleep' for stories where she's an infiltrator.

How to explain...

"The Dark lord was surronded by his deaths eaters, he had call a meeting after it became clear that there was a leak in their organization.

-One of you, he said, has betray us. Avada Kedavera!

The lifeless body of Lucius Malfoy then hit the ground. Before the astonished eyes of those present, the corpse began to change, quickly assuing the shape of a woman.

-Tonks! Bellatrix cried in surprise. But, my Lord how did you know that it wasn't really Lucius?

-My dear Bella, Lucius never had breasts...

Bellatrix was shocked by the observation skills of her Lord. He really was the best wizard in the world."

Does it answer the question?

#+begin_quote
  I can tell you right now, Tonks, an active police office, would not want her bust size bigger then a D cup. Because breasts that big hurt your back and neck. They get in the way. They are expensive, because bras and clothes need to be tailor made or bought in specialized stores. That is why girls with breasts that big get breast reduction surgery.
#+end_quote

It's hardly relevent, I wasn't advocating for Tonks to get the bigger breasts she can, only for her to adjust it to her needs.

#+begin_quote
  And if you think, well, she could do it only in the bedroom. Sure, she could. But that is like telling a girl you want to have sex with her only when she has plastic surgery to increase she bust size, or wears a fat suit, or dyed her hair. Which is an issue.
#+end_quote

It can be like that, and that would be an issue. But it also can be somthing like when people ask their partners to wear some particular clothes, it could be a simple turn on. You can ask a woman to dress like a maid, it doesn't mean you don't respect her.

<Also, breasts that big mean laying on your back is difficult. It's suffocating, especially if you aren't use to it. Laying on your front is worse in some ways. It's awkward and can be painful.

Again, I wasn't talking about getting huge breasts, just about adjusting their size.

Absolutely, it doesn't really make sense if she can't. It's not offensive either.

No. So?

#+begin_quote
  Said, wow, lets make these C cups into As! That would be super sexy (I don't think that only big breast are sexy, but the authors of Harry/Tonks certainly seem to). The simple fact is that every time it comes up, Tonks is inflating her chest like fleshy balloons.
#+end_quote

Doesn't change the fact that there's nothing wrong per se at having Tonks changing the size of her chest, even if it can be ridiculous. I don't know what your problem is but I refuse to consider that respecting the girls is not asking them anything related to sex, If that's what you imply.

  Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snape's, shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses.\\

  Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.

While Tonks never appeared as a man, I've always given her leeway to take any vaguely humanoid shape that she could envision- just that it would take some time to make substantial changes. With practice she can adopt a regular second form, but simulating a specific person would take some effort and a good reference for comparison.

** If I was roleplaying a female metamorphmagus SI, she would have no problem with requests like this because she would see bodies as items belonging to their persons (so no problem with objectification bullshit) and because she would also be ok with polyamorous relations (so no problem with jealousy bullshit).

You're not asking the metamorphmagus to put a bag on their head, you're asking them to undergo the equivalent of a perfect, instantaneous, and fully reversable full-body plastic surgery that costs them nothing more than a thought (at which point it becomes more like changing an avatar in a MMORPG than a surgery --- or changing a costume).

This, however, doesn't also answer the question of “should it be used in the story”. You should consider:

- what personalities your story's characters have (regardless of how much they differ from canon);

  - what kind of social culture they grew up in and are living in;

- what are the default focus, narrative, and pacing of your story and whether this can be made to fit with them or will always look unnaturally shoehorned in. In stories like /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][HE & the Spiral Path]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ it would look fine, but not as much (IMO) in ones like /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra,]]/ /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HP & MOR,]]/ or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute;]]/

Teddy was changing hair colours the moment after his birth, and its quite possible that he might have already been doing that for a while even inside his mother's womb. How would he ever know what his true hair colour was? Same applies to his other body features.

Idk. I suppose the thought has always felt interesting and unique to me, which is why I believe in it and use it in my own stories.
