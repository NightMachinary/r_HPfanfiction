Or Harry meets his great-grandchildren. And boy, they have some stories to tell about their grandparent! Since wizards live for longer than muggles, I'd imagine that Harry might have already died, by the time they were little kids.


** Whatever he expected, this wasn't it. However, there was no doubt about the fact that they were Potters. The mess on the top about as clear of a indication as any. It was of course Halloween, when it happened but he at least got a six month reprieve from Riddle before it did.

As he got closer he could make out the rushed whispering between them. "I can't believe we get the meet 'The Harry Potter' when he was alive. I mean there is a reason he is considered the most powerful mage since Merlin himself. History of magic covers his life more extensively than anything else. Not to mention the N.E.W.T level D.A.D.A. are still the original version from what he wrote in 2004. "

It was at this point Harry knew he was probably going to end up marrying Hermione.

** If I met my yet-to-be-born descendant, in a world where time travel works like it does in PoA, I'd use my knowledge of the future to compel fate to do things I want. Like I'd arrange to get surgically sterilized, with the only way out being some unlikely event I want to see happen. Time stays self-consistent, and the easiest way for this to happen is for an unlikely good event to happen.
