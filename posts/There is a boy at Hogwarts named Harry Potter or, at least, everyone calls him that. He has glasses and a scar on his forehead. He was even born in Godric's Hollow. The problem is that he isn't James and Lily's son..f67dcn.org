#+TITLE: There is a boy at Hogwarts named Harry Potter or, at least, everyone calls him that. He has glasses and a scar on his forehead. He was even born in Godric's Hollow. The problem is that he isn't James and Lily's son.

Harry Potter died on the same night as his parents. The boy that grew up in Number 4 Privet Drive was born from a corpse and the fragment of a soul. No one finds out any of this until it is much, much too late.

*** Kind of? It's the seventh horcrux, given control of the body of a baby. But the seventh horcrux was only a very small piece of Voldemort's soul, and it never really had an effect on Canon!Harry. Maybe he would just grow up to be Voldemort again, but maybe he would grow into something else. I suppose it's up to any author that takes the prompt.

After Voldemort's attempt to possess Harry in the Ministry, the two of them learn that Harry /didn't/ survive bring hit with that killing curse after all. Voldemort's amnesiac horcrux has been possessing her body the whole time.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
