That last thread just jogged my memory. I read it, maybe 3-4 years ago on ff.net and it was super creepy. Draco has disappeared for a few years, and the twist at the end is Ginny finding Harry harboring Draco's dead corpse and, ah, using it as his toy.


** I'm trying to search for it...I remember Ron playing a detective role and eventually finding Draco/Harry, but I think Draco's hair was a motif in the story and might somehow relate to the title? I think Ginny also used magic to vaguely see who Harry was cheating with her on, but it was hazy and looked to her like Draco's body was actually someone who was physically handicapped (maybe something about that was also the title)?

*** I was linked the fic, so I didn't look at the title sadly :( I remember stuff about Draco's hair--silvery and fanned on the pillow, perhaps--and him being in a wheelchair? Maybe he wasn't dead but under a spell? Something very morbid, in any case. I also remember some description about Ginny with a butcher knife? I have a very fuzzy memory, so I don't want to accidentally provide false info.

**** I definitely remember him being dead. I tried looking for the fic on painless j's rec-list and another one (partial eclipse which is down), but couldn't find it.

I remember this story as really bizarre and was hopping it could jog some memory :(
