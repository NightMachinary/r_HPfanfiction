As the war becomes worse and worse, Fred and George use more and more of their creativity to create more and more lethal products. Everything from shield hats to deadly potion fume grenades, Marauders Map based home surveillance systems to flying invisible armored tanks, wireless extendable ear bugs to lethal traps for home defense. You name it, they got it. Civilians buy tons of traps to secure their homes against Death Eater (or Auror) raids, both the Order and the DMLE love their weapons, despite a "no selling to known Death Eater" policy some of them still manage to get their hands on Weasley Wizarding Weapons, and Fred and George profit.

Eventually the war ends and sales drop. So, what do you do as a weapons producer without customers? Export abroad! There's a dark witch gaining power in Peru? Let's see if their government might need some helpful equipment...

** Fred and George find themselves then assaulted and boycotted by peaceful protesters accusing them that they had turned into greedy pigs from the lovable twins. They too realize they no longer can walk only on the hind feet and they oink when they laugh.

** Totally believable. Post War, having Ron working at the shop provides an insider view to what an auror would want/need. Plus Harry would totally volunteer to product test in the field.
