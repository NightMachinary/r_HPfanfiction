I've recently become obsessed with Snape-y fics, and I can't seem to find new stories. I've already read Come Once Again and Love Me, Chasing the Sun, a Dream Carved in Stone, Lay Me Low, A New Beginning (didn't like it) and the ML one where Hermione is actually royalty (also didn't like :P). I don't plan on reading the Snape Chronicles, because I'm a sucker for happy endings. Anways, I've turned to y'all for help because I wanna see what else is out there!

*Must be long and hopefully adulty-rated for teh drama/teh love/teh angst/teh Voldey! (preferably 100,000+ words)

*Preferably Snape/Lilly or Snape/Hermione, but if you've got something awesome...

*Semi-realistic pairing if it's shippy

*Completed!

Thanks so much in advance! It's impossible to find the hidden gems without asking around! :)


** Y'know, Snape Chronicles has an AU sequel with a happy ending that was satisfying. Even includes him reconciling with Harry- of course, one or both of them was about to die, but whatever gets them talking...

This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

I really enjoyed this one. It gets a little strange at parts, but its a great premise. Its Snape/Lily.

Plus side? Its complete. :)

*** Aurette, while too ship-focused for my liking, has hands down the sharpest dialogue in HP fandom when on point. I will, as always, recommend [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377&chapter=1][Practical Solutions]], since it is one of Aurette's stories not on ff.net, and also the best one.

**** Aurette's early work is excellent. My fave was "Needs Must."

Since you liked Lay Me Low, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2506612/Teddy-Radiator][Teddy Radiator]] writes memorable adult-rated Snapefic.

If you're looking for a non-ship, Snape-centric story, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7056390/1/The-New-Skin][The New Skin]].

** A Never Ending Road. Snape isn't the main character, but he's the most major supporting character. It's SnapexFem!Harry starting year 1 and is currently in year 4. The romance progresses very realistically so there isn't really much of it yet, just little hints here and there. It's absolutely fantastic and is definitely worth the read.
