** Been a while but I think Vox Corporis was the most unique way I read. It's been years since I've read it though and most of the details has slipped my mind. I think there was something about tokening off something. I could be wrong though. linkffn(Vox Corporis) I think I'll go and reread it now since it's kind of a slow day at work right now.

*** Is this good enough to read even though it isn't complete? I hate fics that end on a cliff hanger and never get completed

** Widely known but Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]) Had an interesting take on the process of becoming an animagus.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** My personal favorite was probably done in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4494886/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Warrior-s-Path]]). Though the most amusing form has to go with A Black Comedy.

  This is a what if story. Canon will be followed when it fits my story. Harry is powerful but not a superhero, Harry and Hermione the main pairing, rating may change down the road.
