I'd like to see his story explored. I know that JK had big plans for him that were eventually scrapped but honestly I'd love to see a fanfic that explores this forgotten character. He's fairly talented after all. Took a couple of newts, became a chaser, fought off some death eaters. But the father is an interesting plot point.

  Once a week, every week, Dean Thomas allowed himself to pretend nothing had ever happened.

  In the war, Dean holed up in hollows and friendly attics and Muggle pubs. He drew Umbridge the Toad, noseless Voldy confused by the last dozen plus years of wizardly pop culture, the Ministry of Magic with its fingers stuffed in its stuffy ears. He drew Snape as Headmaster, his sneer easy after seven years of notebook margin practice. Dean drew the Dark Mark over London's skyline and he left his work nailed up around Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow. He signed his name. He had things he wanted to say. There were long days when he didn't talk to anyone-- walking old fields and long roads, sleeping in haystacks. There were long weeks when he only talked to strangers-- passersby, shop owners, sympathizers, snatchers who he traded curses with. He drew the Gryffindor Common Room, hearths all ablaze. He listened to Lee Jordan's radio show on the crackling airwaves. He drew his little sisters, who had gone to France with his mother and father. He drew faces from the darkened boys' dormitory-- Harry's long bangs hiding his scar, Neville practicing his dance moves for the Yule Ball, Ron asleep with his head on his thick Weasley sweater, Seamus grinning at him over a three a.m. game of cards.

- in linkffn(9566537) and [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]] there is his cousin who is interested in one of the main characters
- there was an unfinished story, basically just a setup, where Hermione gets to some of there lectures on the immorality of house-elves slavery and Dean (or is it Angelina?) puts her down with something like “You know who was the second most hated character for my great-grandfather, who actually was a slave? Northern good-doers who decided to save them without actually caring for them or listening to them.” Cannot find it right now. Not sure whether Hermione starts dating Dean, and it was really just few chapters, but I would love somebody to explore this idea.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
