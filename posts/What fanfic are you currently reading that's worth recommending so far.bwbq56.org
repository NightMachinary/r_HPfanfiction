--------------

last week was another update week; this fic releases 1 chapter per day about every second week has a lot of content already which includes a *finished HP-section*.

It also has a unique (at least I think so) writing style, which I find is very entertaining/cool. The crossover also does not really come into play before the HP-section is done.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  When the world is coming to an end and all hope seems lost, Dumbledore has a rather unusual request for Hermione. "1943? And you'd like me to...kill Tom Riddle?" Dumbledore shook his head, that annoying twinkle glowing thrice as bright as before. "No, my dear. I'd like you to join him." Full Summary inside. An interesting take on time travel.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

**** You know, I actually just came back to this series after giving up on it, and this time I finished.

You're not wrong about the Hermy Sue angle? But I decided in the end that that isn't really the point of these particular stories. They're world building, and they do that pretty well. Hermione does have character flaws, especially her tendency to get too focused and risk burnout. But ultimately, she is a plot device, rather than being the story. It's really about exploring how magic could be used in different ways, how you could extract minerals from soil, and fabricate carbon nanotubes, and pinch off your enemy's carotid artery.

In the end, I had fun with it. I actually may have enjoyed Annals of Arithmancy best, the extended epilogue.
