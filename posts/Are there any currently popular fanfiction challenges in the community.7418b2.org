Something like the Severitius challenge for example, where there are outlined rules for what should be in a story but you can deviate from them.

Are there any challenges that are currently popular or have been recently? Is there anyplace in the community where challenges are common or being regularly posted?

I'm interested in looking into this mostly because challenges tend to dictate certain trends in the fics that come out for the next little while if they catch on, so being aware of them means I'll have a better ability to guess which stories will catch my eye for the next while and what to look out for. they also tend to spawn tropes, and being aware of those so you do or don't fall into them in your own writing is always a plus.

So any challenges currently running the board?


** There aren't any challenges that I know of here on HPFanfiction, but I can recommend a few banks of challenges.

- [[https://hpkinkmeme.dreamwidth.org][*The Harry Potter Kink Meme*]] - prompts posted anonymously by individuals that you can fill, anonymously or with a link. The HP Kink Meme is relatively new, but it's been publicized across different communities, so there are a lot of different challenges up; the vast majority of them will definitely be of a smutty and/or kinky nature, though.
- [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forums/challenges.44/][*DLP Challenges Board*]] - People will post challenges back and forth here on the board, sharing their writing. If you're going to write on DLP, though, make sure you have a thick skin: they say exactly what they think, and they won't sugarcoat a thing. They have a particular dislike of certain pairings, particular H/G, and they won't go in for M/M fanfiction. A lot of them will express a vigorous dislike of "slash".
- [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=challenges][*Potions & Snitches Challenge Board*]] - Again, individuals on Potions & Snitches will post challenges to their heart's content here; in contrast to DLP, Potions & Snitches is very gentle and generous with praise. One could say too much, but some people do prefer that! Potions & Snitches is specifically a Gen Harry Potter & Severus Snape site, meaning that all fics should have Harry and Snape as protagonists, and they don't accept HP/SS pairing fics.
- [[http://hpfanfictalk.com/forum/20-story-challenges/][*HPFanficTalk Challenge Board*]] - HPFanficTalk is a Harry Potter-focused forum that sort of rose from some people leaving HarryPotterFanfiction: they have a pretty wide variety of challenges, and people definitely laugh back and forth with them, so they're pretty comfortable with changing challenges and the like.

Barring the Kink Meme, which is a very new development, these challenges all have their own cultures associated with them - in a fandom as huge as Harry Potter, with hundreds of thousands of readers spread over all kinds of different sites, "trends" aren't likely to go quickly through the fandom in the way they might a smaller, more compact one, but it can still be fun to play around with challenges and the like.

If you haven't already, I would also recommend looking on Fanfiction.net for any groups that would be to your interest, but if I'm honest, a lot of the fanfiction groups over there are heavily dominated by very young people and some of them are very repetitive in the ideas offered and explored.

*** DLP monthly challenges have been on hiatus for a few years, though there have been some preliminary talks about restarting them. The challenge board itself is currently inactive, but technically you can post a challenge and it might get answered. In fact, I'd say that if it was a really good challenge, it might even cause a brief resurgence. There's still plenty of excellent writers on the site.

I noticed it when I joined DLP a year or two back, but I didn't realize it was pretty inactive, oops.

Need thick skin? Yes.

Reflexive hatred of H/G? Not so much, provided it's decently written.

Dislike of M/M slash? Pretty much. unless it's by one of the greats, like Sam Storyteller/Copperbadge. They've a couple of his fics in the Library.

*** Just a note... This fandom is even more obsessed with Snape than I had realized. On all of those challenge boards, every second or third challenge or so is something with Severus Snape in it. What the hell?!

***** I left that one out of the equation. Obviously, P&S would be only Harry and Snape.

** There are a few that just don't really go away. The Don't Fear the Reaper challenge has been around since I started reading fanfiction and I saw a new response to that the other day. Blood Brandy's Woke up in Vegas is also a popular challenge, but to my knowledge only Megamatt ever finished it.

*** Do you happen to have links to the original postings for these challenges? Just so I know i'm looking at the original sources and not some third-hand retelling google drags up from some obscure corner of a debunked forum haha.

** try siye.co.uk (Sink Into Your Eyes) I just discovered it the day before yesterday so I haven't explored it properly yet but it seems like they do challenges often. It might just be NextGen though I'm not sure if you're into that.
