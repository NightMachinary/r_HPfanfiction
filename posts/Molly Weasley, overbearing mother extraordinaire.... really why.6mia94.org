This is one of my pet peeves about fics that involve Harry and Ginny or soulbonds etc. Molly always seems to be portrayed as the archetypal matriarch with rather backwards views on decorum. I don't really understand why? We are not given any inclination that she holds these views at all. I don't see why she is always written as a prominent secondary antagonist to H&G.


** I think it's because in canon she's shown as having a lot of bitchy over-protective/intrusive mother features, and fanfic is a reactive medium in which authors often exaggerate existing features of canon characters for specific effects.

Personally, I find canon Molly annoying as hell due to

- her proprietary behavior towards Harry and Hermione (howlers anyone? how is this not abuse?)

- her extreme rudeness to Sirius Black (whose home she and her family are being sheltered in at the time)

- her over-protective management of her adult children

- her xenophobic rudeness to her oldest son's fiance.

So the fanfic rudeness you describe really doesn't seem jarring to me at all.

*** were there anything in the books/canon that implied that her rudeness to fleur was due to xenophobia?

**** Not [[/u/PeteNewell]], but I was looking on the wiki for Molly, and I got the vibe that her issues with Fleur were in regards to her "taking" Bill away from her, rather than anything xenophobic.

#+begin_quote
  She sometimes found it difficult to cope with her children heading out in their own, separate directions. Not surprisingly, she initially considered Fleur Delacour completely wrong for Bill when they become engaged in 1996.

and

#+begin_quote
  She was irked by Fleur's criticism of her household and even her favourite singer, Celestina Warbeck.

**** The anti-French part may well be headcanon, or may be cross-faded from canon Ginny. I'd go and look but I'm lazy. Strike that word, then.

The rest of it stands.

** I think the problem is that a lot of writers just don't really understand her character. They see her as an overbearing control-freak. But really, she strikes me more as a woman who just loves children a whole lot and has trouble dealing with the fact that they've grown up. I think she'd do well to start up a daycare business now that her children are older. It would keep her mothering instincts satisfied and make her some much needed money as well.

I can tell you right now this is a giant negative in my book...maybe because of my upbringing but different people see these characters in a different light depending on how they were raised

**** Yeah, there's definitely different ways to view that. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that a good writer should try to show more than just a single flat perspective on the character and actually give them some realistic depth. But considering we're talking about fanfiction that may be a lot to ask for.

** It depends on what stands out to you about the character. To Harry, whose eyes we see the canon world through, she is the mother he never had...but also doesn't have to live with. She is overbearing - it is because she loves them and cares, but it's smothering and less appropriate when they are adults. Bill and Charlie seem to have fucked off ASAP after graduating. I personally don't view her as a bad person, but she is very rude on multiple occasions, she is rather bossy and domineering, and she plays favourites with her kids. If a conflict is set up around her behaviour and views, I can believe "overbearing cow" Molly. As long as it doesn't get out of hand; she is still a decent and loving person, I think.

I almost never find it believable when Harry is the target of ire though, unless something happens to set that up. She adores him.

*** Not only them:

The Twins and Percy left as soon as humanly possible, too! That's a pattern IMHO - if you are driving your children away, then you are doing something wrong IMHO!

Yeah she plays favourites: Ginny is always the favourite (ok, her and Perfect Prefect Percy!), but on the other hand she also seems to smother Ginny (more than the others! She's her "little princess", hell it seems like she'd rather Ginny not play Quidditch because it's no sport for a lady!)

As for being rude: Yeah, staying with Sirius (so she's a guest!) but taking over his house (and using everybody available as her own fucking cleaning team? Sorry, leave the kids alone you control freak, it's their holiday! They didn't sign up to be house-cleaners!) and then she has the guts to insult him and imply his a bad guardian etc. etc. (I'd have tossed her out and told to never talk to me again - unless it's to appologize!)

*** JKR deliverately wrote the Weasleys so over-the-top to contrast with Harry's miserable childhood. In real life that family would definitely be a bit too much.

**** I can believe that a family is big and loving and the parents care about their kids and the kids' friends, especially one who has no one else, but some of the internal dynamics don't quite jive for me. Percy not liking the twins is completely understandable - they torment him and seem to have done so for years. Ron liking them is less so - they aren't very nice to him either, using him as a guinea pigfor dangerous and scary experiments since he was little. If I had older brothers who beat my pet (pygmy puff was it?) to death, I sure wouldn't like them.

***** Yeah, me neither (I have a love/hate kind of relationship with the twins: On the one hand I was bullied in school myself and that's why I loath bullies and think every bully should be punished to the full extent of laws/rules (in school that would mean expulsion IMHO and a letter for their file explaining why, so that finding another school becomes fucking difficult!), but on the other hand: I love their antics and pranking Draco etc. is justified (going after bullies IMHO always is - if the teachers don't do shit? Then it's ok to do something yourself!))

** Some writers are lazy and misogynistic. They need a conflict for H/G that doesn't revolve around Voldemort so they resort to having their relationship hinge on Ginny and her virginity.

Harry not only gets threatened by all the Weasley males, all of a sudden Mrs. Weasley, who has been shown to deeply care and love Harry, often becomes distrustful of him.

It's lazy writing.

*** ehh people are misogynistic I'll agree to that, but at the same time you do have to remember that fanfiction is alot of peoples form of escaping reality, alot of people do have moms like Molly and they do honestly dislike them. don't quote me but aren't most fanfiction authors teenagers that makes writing an overbearing authority figure to bash pretty easy for them, especially teenaged boys who are rebelling against their mothers.

** You need some form of conflict and some people don't like Molly.

At least when I write canon matters a lot less than what my story needs, and I imagine the authors you're talking about do something similar.

** I find most good bashing has to have at least some basis in canon. They're exaggerated, of course, but it's not like they're creating things from out of nowhere. For an example of Molly having backwards view of decorum, most seem to extrapolate that from the fact that she's a housewife with a lot of children, who did not seem to work once her kids were all away at Hogwarts, and assume it means she thinks women shouldn't work and should stay in the home. But like I said, it's an exaggeration of something that is in canon. It's not like they suddenly turn her into a Death Eater.

And there are other incidents that authors can use to back up their interpretations. In addition to the examples from [[/u/PeteNewell]], there is also sending smaller Easter eggs to Hermione after a Rita Skeeter article.

** Yeah seriously if she´s not written like that, she freaks out that Harry isn´t with Ginny, or she is a manipulating bitch who is only friendly to Harry, because Dumbledore orders her to, or for financial gain. She has it almost as bad as Ron when it comes to stuff like this.

*** Ron "has it bad"? - Nah, I think canon treated him with kid gloves (Harry should have told him to bugger off after he left in DH at the latest (I myself would have told him to "get lost" in GoF!)), sure he's no Draco Malfoy but Draco is at least honest about being an asshole while Ron is a bad friend, jealous, unreliable and frankly he's narrow minded ("All Slytherins are bad, hm kay?"), too (not to mention overprotective (of Ginny)...I hate that trait as it's condescending to protect people from stuff they don't need or want protection from!)
