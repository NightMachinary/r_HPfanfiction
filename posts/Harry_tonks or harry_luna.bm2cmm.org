As a dedicated harmony reader I thought it's about time to read about harry with others.

Looking for harry with either tonks or Luna with him still being friends with Hermione and ron but doesnt have those two paired together.

Sorry but I cant stomach 'romione.' Please no Dumbledore bashing or lord potter nonsense. Any and all help is appreciated.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

Ofc, both aren't teens, and have went through the war, so they matured a bit, but still retain that loving Luna personality, without that boring trope of her being a plot device "seer" or some bullshit like that.

I was reading it, having a good time when a thought popped into my head: 'What about Hermione? How's her life going without harry in it?' Now she might show up later in the fic happy and healthy, but the only thing i could think of at the time was (without Harry being there in her first year) she safe? Happy? Or was she alone in life without Harry's intervention.
