Following the creation of [[/r/HPHarmony]], I decided to create a sub for Harry/Ginny a few weeks ago. I am now making it public, in a rough form, since I have already gotten support for the idea from various users.

This sub is - you guessed it - simply about celebrating and discussing the H/G relationship, as well as listing the best fanworks.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them here, or otherwise in a PM. I'm not knowledgeable when it comes to coding, so please PM me if you know CSS. Otherwise, head on over and just have a look.

** I would love an /HPslash sub. I read all pairings pretty much but have a special fondness for Drarry and Wolfstar fics. This sub is decidedly anti-slash for the most past. If anyone else thinks that sub would be sustainable maybe I'd start it.

** I'd kill for a good Draco/Ginny sub. Fire and Ice for life, yo.

*** I respect your right to have an opinion but just letting you know your opinion is wrong.

**** I mean, Harry/Ginny is good stuff, but every now and again I need a good, torrid, Romeo and Juliet-style smut fic.

***** Bleh. I just can't stand Draco with anyone. I was never a fan of his redemption arc and his whole supposed bad boy persona. He's a whiny, spoiled little rich boy who just parrots what his father says with no independent thought of his own. He's the Paris Hilton of the wizarding world, a blonde, vapid, shallow, trust fund baby with a bit of Trump racism thrown in.

The idea of Ginny of all people falling for an idiot like that requires such a huge re-working of both their characters that in the end you don't have Draco/Ginny you have OC/OC whose names happen to be Draco and Ginny.

** Is there really much of a demand for specific pairing subreddits? [[/r/HPfanfiction]] isn't incredibly active itself, so I don't foresee a ton of activity on [[/r/HPharmony]] and [[/r/HarryandGinny]]
