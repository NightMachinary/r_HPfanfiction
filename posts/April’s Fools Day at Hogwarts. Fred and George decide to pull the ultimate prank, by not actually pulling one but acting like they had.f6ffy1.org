I got the idea from accio-shitpost all credit for the idea goes to them.


** That was a fun read, but it was pretty spoiled for me by this post's title.

Like, "If you want to see a boy learning about magic and accidentally killing his evil, possessed teacher, read Harry Potter!"

**** I really liked it as well! Maybe just change the title to end at pulling the ultimate prank. If the title is too specific, only people who like the exact concept will read it... then by extension most of your readers will like it automatically
