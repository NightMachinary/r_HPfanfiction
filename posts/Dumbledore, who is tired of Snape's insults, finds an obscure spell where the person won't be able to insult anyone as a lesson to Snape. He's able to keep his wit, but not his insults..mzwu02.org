** He is cursed now that every time he wants to insult someone, he's only able to say nice things. Now everyone believes he is trying this new thing where he's sarcastic all the time.

"Class, take example from Mr. Potter's dexterity at stirring his potion."

*Harry becomes flustered and starts questioning whether he's doing the right thing.

"And Mr. Weasley has chopped the salamander eyes with such precision."

*Ron double checks that his salamander eyes are chopped according to instructions.

"Now can any of you, brilliant minds, tell me what are the magical properties of salamander eyes?"

*Hermione's hand shoots up.

"Ah, yes, Miss Granger. Always knowing the right answer. She puts in so much work coming prepared for each class."

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

**** Cause the description makes it seem silly in some way I can't quite describe. The Malfoy scene and everything leading up to it proved the nature and substance of the story.

****** Yeah, it's a very interesting take on Dumbledore. I regret not reading it sooner.

It's that it's more serious in tone rather than crackish, which the description implies, that I think makes for fun reading.

Another fun story that's vaguely similar is linkao3(23702959), it's leans a bit more crack, but there is enough seriousness that it creates the contrast I think funny stories need.

Though in this case Dumbledore is semi-bashed, but it's not a major part of the plot. It's a more lighthearted almost slice of life story.

  Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.

******* I concur. I'm in a minority in that I've never been a particularly big fan of Dumbledore - whether in canon or most fanon incarnations - so I find it refreshing (and a little therapeutic) to read a DD I /don't/ want to strangle with his own beard. Quite apart from that, I enjoyed such a sharp and immediate a butterfly divergence that starts a significant part into the events of canon. Both are things I'd dearly like to see done more often.

The former because I wouldn't mind developing a more nuanced view of DD as a character and the latter because it's a great way for an author to skip pointlessly rehashing the stations of canon with only minor changes.

Also, thank you for your two recommendations, especially as I'm not familiar with either of them (yet).
