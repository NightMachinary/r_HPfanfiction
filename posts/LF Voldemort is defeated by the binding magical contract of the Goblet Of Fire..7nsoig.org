If Harry doesn't have to put his own name in, yet is still believed to be held to count by the Goblet, why doesn't Dumbledore just confund the Goblet into accepting Tom Riddles name? Hell through the whole Diary in for good measure!


** The usual explanation for why they couldn't do this is that it has to be written by the person's own hand, and that Crouch!Moody used a scrap from Harry's homework. It's not a great explanation, but fills in well enough.

On the other hand, the "binding magical contract" is never actually explained. We have no idea what it does, how it works, what the penalties are, or anything else, save that it exists.

*** Tom riddle was an exceptional student. Someone would have his name written by his own hand somewhere. At the least the ministry would have his OWL's or NEWT's

**** Right, so the only possible reasons why the goblet still exists and it's powers haven't been terribly abused yet are:

1. Wizards are even more moronic than most of canon suggests and can't even think a little bit about possible uses of this technology and Barty Crouch Jr. is Wizarding Einstein.

2. The Goblet doesn't work that way and can't force you to enter a contract without agreeing.

***** Well, maybe the Goblet was not an ancient relic at all but a new creation, created especially for the 1994 Triwizard Tournament --- and no one had thought too hard about its functions yet.

Or maybe it was in the custody of the Department of Mysteries in-between Tournaments.

**** It is by no means a perfect explanation, and is flawed in many ways. Just like most other fanon concepts.

** There's this: linkffn(3941656)

But I agree that this is a major issue. I don't necessarily remember the story names, but I've read fics where this was dealt with in the following ways:

1) The Goblet of Fire can only affect the person who put the name in, so if Harry refused to compete, Crouch would've lost his magic/died.

2) The goblet of fire is not magically binding (or (1)) but it is legally binding -- it would be illegal for Harry to refuse to participate and he would be punished with Azkaban.

  In Goblet of Fire, JKR established that it was absurdly easy to bind other witches and wizards unwillingly into binding magical contracts with a simple, school-taught 'confundus' charm. What if Harry took note of that and decided to do something about it?

** To what purpose? We don't even know what HAPPENS if someone refuses to participate in the Tournament. The entire "you lose your magic" thing is pure fanon; we just know there'll be consequences of SOME sort. It's perfectly possible that the consequences were of the sort that wouldn't affect Voldemort at all.
