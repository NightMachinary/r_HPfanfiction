I was just reading Weeb by Andrius, and suddenly this came to me. A fem Harry who is convinced that Severus Snape and James Potter were a thing, and nothing will convince her otherwise. She thinks Snape hates her because she reminds him of her mother who got in the way. Bonus points if she confronts Snape with this idea.

There's plenty of crack with a male Harry, but I really want to see a genderbent Harry act absurdly. There's only 'Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus' that comes close.


** I'd read it...hell I'd write it if I was a good writer.

**** Yes, that. Besides, what's the worst they could do?

And no, that's not an invitation to write something worse than “My Immortal” or that trash story where Harry is changed into a girl, but if someone wants to do that they shouldn't let me stop them.

*** I saw that one, and apart from Randy Marsh's ignorant bluster, the rest of the episode was incredibly unfunny.

***** *Tweek x Craig*

"Tweek x Craig" is the sixth episode of the nineteenth season and the 263rd overall episode of the animated television series South Park, written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central on October 28, 2015. The episode parodies the slash fiction genre of yaoi art and the acceptance of the LGBT community, while continuing its season-long lampoon of political correctness.
