I'm looking for fanfictions where the OC/SI is reborn as Harry Potter before he goes to HW. And please no stories with Hermione or Ginny as the love interest. And no Slash. Harem or multi-pairing is ok.

Thank you in advance.


** I found a very well-written fem!Harry Si fic on discord. The SI character is from a universe where the HP books don't exist, and the fic actually spends time on her time at the Dursleys, developing all of them as people. She actually has a good relationship with Dudley and tries to teach him morals as he grows up.

  The world had always been such a terrible, beautiful place, full of colors. Then why do we always split it in half, in Black and White? In Good and Evil? Nobody has one without the other. I thought I knew what the world was about. But then I died. Then I found Magic. Or, rather, it found me. fem!harry SI.

** Shameless self promotion... Linkffn(Harry Potter, Self-Insert by 15Redstones)

Will update soon, exam season is taking a lot of time away from writing. No love interest as the main character's age difference is way too large, plus I'm terrible at writing romance. It's mostly a "how to save the country with canon knowledge" combined with "nerd at Hogwarts". There'll be some very unique magic once I get around to write beyond first year.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.
