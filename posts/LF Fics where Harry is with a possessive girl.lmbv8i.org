  Hermione Granger is special. She's always known it, really, even before she received her letter that informed her she was a witch, and even before she could do the little tricks that kept away the bullies and left her time for her books. It was too bad, of course, that she had never met anyone quite as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to a right and proper school for witches and wizards.And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed.

  Hermione loves her books. Hermione loves her Harry. Get between Hermione and either at your own peril. Series of connected one-shots.
