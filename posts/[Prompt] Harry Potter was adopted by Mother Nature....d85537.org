While left alone on the Dursley's front porch, toddler Harry Potter wanders off, and ends up in the wilderness, where he is adopted by the natural world as a whole. As such, by the time he arrives at Hogwarts, he can communicate with all animals, wilderness and nature just loves him (to a point where thick brush will part for him as he walks through it, for example), and his magic focuses on augmenting and asking nature to do him favors, so a lot of buffing of animals, making plants grow, changing the weather, etc.

Also, animals flock to him like a Disney princess.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
