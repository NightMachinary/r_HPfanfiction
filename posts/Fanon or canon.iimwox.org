Is Nevilles Mother actually Harrys Godmother is this just Fanon?


** Fanon. In canon it's never stated whether Harry has a godmother.

*** JKR stated in interview in 2004 that he doesn't:

#+begin_quote
  Harry does not have a Godmother. Harry's christening was very hurried and quiet, just the family and James' best friend Sirius.

** It's my understanding that having both godparents if they aren't a couple is iladviced. It can cause custody issues.

*** That's not the case. Godparents have no connection to custody most of the time - they are there to provide spiritual guidance. It is a religious and cultural thing rather than a legal thing. The Potters must have/would have stated that they wished for Sirius to be a guardian in addition to naming him godfather.

**** To be fair we don't know that for sure in canon. Not saying the other person is right, but it's likely not a religious thing since religion is never mentioned in canon, and while it could be a cultural thing in the wizarding world it could also be a legal thing. If I recall correctly Sirius isn't stated to have been assigned as his legal guardian outside of being named his Godfather.

**** Huh, I guess I'm misinformed. Did anyone other than Sirius or Harry talk about them living together in cannon? Sirius makes the offer when he thinks they have Pettigrew but did Sirius actually have any claim to him? I never thought about it before but I doubt Lily or James really thought they were going to die. If they did, they probably thought Harry would be right behind them.

***** Only Sirius, though Dumbledore clearly regarded him as enough of a guardian to let him sign his Hogsmeade permission form. I think it's perfectly possible that the Potters believed they would die, though I agree with you I expect they thought that if they did Harry would quickly follow. But perhaps they made arrangements just in case.

****** I'd forgotten about the permission slip. Though that could just be Dumbledore bending the rules again.
