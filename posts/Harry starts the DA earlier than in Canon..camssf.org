Anyone know any fics where Harry starts the DA earlier, maybe in third year or fourth year. I'd be fine with fics that focus more on the DA in general as well.


** It doesn't exist yet, but I'm trying to write one about continuing the DA into 6th year. I've not actually written before, but if you're interested, I can let you know when I'm happy enough with it that I start posting it.

**** Cool, I'll try to remember. It may not be the best story but I'll at least try to make it grammatically correct. I'll try my best at it though.

** linkffn(Anicus Protectio Fortis) has this, though it hasn't been updated in almost 2 years.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** Doesn't explicitly start as the DA, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has Harry start a spell-casting practice with a few people in his first year and it eventually grows (in the sequel I believe) into the DA, more or less, though with different goals and lessons.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
