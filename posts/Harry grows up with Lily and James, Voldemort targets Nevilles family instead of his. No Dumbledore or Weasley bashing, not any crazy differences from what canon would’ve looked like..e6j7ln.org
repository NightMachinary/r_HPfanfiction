#+TITLE: Harry grows up with Lily and James, Voldemort targets Nevilles family instead of his. No Dumbledore or Weasley bashing, not any crazy differences from what canon would’ve looked like.

** harry would be different by nature of not being raised by the dursleys so thats a difference there, unless his parents get tortured like the longbottoms were in canon, and if they weren't sirius wouldn't go to azkaban, pettigrew would probably be caught, thus 3rd and 4th year wouldn't happen unless you made something new for the tri-wiz on, cause no pettigrew = no free barty/captured moody = no resurrection

*** Exactly, a repeat of canon stations would be utterly ridiculous.

On the other hand, if Lestranges and Barty Jr didn't get caught for torturing people, they might have found Voldemort much earlier! Furthermore, if Barty Jr was not outed, his dad would most likely become the Minister of Magic. Now the situation becomes very interesting:

- Voldemort returned earlier with three Lestranges at his side
- Barty Crouch would be a more effective Minister, but Barty Jr remained a dangerous deep spy at his side
- Potters and Sirius Black could seriously impede Malfoy's corruption of the Ministry
- Voldemort returning early would mean the entire PS plot was redundant
- Voldemort taking back his Diary from Malfoy for his lack of faith would mean no CoS plot, at least not in 2nd year

See, someone could write a very interesting story without any mindless canon rehashes.

** I read one on AO3 called like Everyone Lives or something! :) It was super canon compliant but was also your premise. :) Harry and Lily and James had such good relationship I loved it!!!!

** I know it doesn't help you find it, but how can Harry have both his parents, but nothing 'crazy' changes from the actual books?

By design, you're asking for an exact retelling of the books, but want Harry's parents around? That would mean they were acting like the Dursleys? You also forget that Sirius wouldn't be in prison, which would mean Sirius/Remus would be in Harry's life alongside his parents.

Just stopping at that, the whole idea falls apart.

*** I'm saying that characters like Dumbledore and the Weasleys aren't portrayed as the bad guys out to manipulate or use Harry. And that Harry isn't some OP character that destroys everyone.

** The Boy With the Scar.

Same author as "The Family Evans," so it's as good as it gets for canon-parallel fics.

AO3(3454106)

Edit: Okay, the bot's busted.

** I would think that Harry not being an orphan and (presumably) not living with the Dursleys would be a rather significant difference from canon

** The story would change completely. No heroics or lack of social life or a bunch of other things to do with Harry. Even Longbottom would be different.
