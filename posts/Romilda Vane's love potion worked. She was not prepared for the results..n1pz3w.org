When Romilda was a young girl, she'd always had this fantasy - a hero would sweep her off her feet, on some grand adventure. They'd have a grand time.

Sure, it had required the use of some... Less-than-scrupulous methods, but now her fantasy was /this close/ to becoming reality. Harry was refusing to go anywhere without her, he was so obsessed with his perfect princess. She loved when he doted on her, just like in her fantasy...

What she didn't love, however, was what she /really/ should have seen coming. Harry was a hero - and the hero's love-interest is /always/ in danger. Always. So here she was, in a boat, in a dank cave. She could see corpses floating in the water, and it got her close to both vomiting and crying.

Harry was, of course, unfazed by it all - too focused on the way Romilda's eyes shone with fear in what little light filtered into the cavern. His dopey smile was, at this point, downright creepy - so out-of-place was it in this nightmarish cavern, so unfitting for what was about to happen.

To claim what they were looking for, Albus Fricking Dumbledore had told them, there is a basin with a no-doubt horrid potion - one that, from all he could discern from an /earlier trip/ - how could anyone stand to make this trip even once? - someone would have to drink, and then not be tempted to drink the water from the lake after.

She already knew how this was going to go - Harry, her "beloved", would refuse to let any kind of harm come to his precious princess. He would take the agony of the potion upon himself, begging for mercy all the while and forcing Romilda to witness it all, comforting him through it.

Privately, she resolved to one thing. After all this was over, she would go to Professor Slughorn, give Harry the antidote to the love-potion - how was she supposed to know that chocolate would amplify its effects that much, for that long? - and apologize profusely. She'd take whatever punishment was needed, and then... Then she'd give up on the Boy-Who-Lived. Some fantasies just don't live up to reality.

A stray thought made her wonder why love potions were legal in the first place. Of course, she'd done some research on them - for some reason that no book ever mentioned, the Ministry never made it illegal to sneak someone a potion without their knowledge. This included love potions - but all that knowledge did was bring her right. /Freaking/. Here.

She was firmly over her fantasy by now, anyway - she just wanted a normal boyfriend, with a normal, danger-free life. Maybe that Ravenclaw boy? He might be impressed by her newfound knowledge of Horror-cruxes or whatever, and they'd bond over some quiet library time...

--------------

It struck me that, even if Harry did eat Romilda's love-potion laced chocolates, she would /never/ have gotten what she wanted out of it because Harry's life is such a mess. Here's one possible scenario around that premise.


** Dumbledore: "Harry, the power you know not is love. That is how you will defeat Voldemort."

Harry: "Okay!"

** Sadly Romilda was not able to get the love potions cure.

and resolved that she would support harry and try to reduce his suffering until they got a cure its worth noting she would confess her deed to ron and hermione, and talk about how she didnt expect this would happen.

once she got a cure she then disappeared after the war for several years.

Returning with a vengeance to launch a one women crusade to ban love potions.

** Referring to the comment on love potions legallity, I think if we were to "fix" this part of the plot we would have to go with pseudolegal potions. I mean they are wizards, and can do plenty of other things that can be used the wrong way. They can mess up, but they don't want the Ministry to tell them what they can or cannot do. Even if they know this means some wrong people are going to get their hands in one of these. Taking love potions away from them might be something akin to trying to take guns from texans. So, IMO, we could make love potions sort of restricted and controlled. Have the twins needing to comply with antidote and length of effect regulations for such potion selling. Also have Hogwarts NOT teaching how to brew one, just going over the theory of them. And they should be definitely be banned at Hogwarts since way before the twins started their business. And there should be a quick way to identify if someone is under love potion, important to signing contracts.

So I think that way, love potions can be more realistic and still keep their importance to canon plot.

*** My going thoughts, for a "sensible" version of the Potterverse, are as follows:

Less-effective love potions are treated much like alcohol or other legal drugs. In and of themselves, they are not illegal - but a lot of things you can /do/ with them are (Merope Gaunt's potioning of Tom Riddle would be considered rape, kidnapping, and a truckload of other crimes), and there's some strict regulations on their effectiveness/sell-by-date/availability of antidotes.\\
Consenting adults might just use them to spice up their love life. Hence why Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes can sell them - canonically, their version is pretty weak, and Romilda's is only as strong as it is because it's gone off.

Some more effective potions are treated like harder drugs. Personal use is condoned-at-best, but they are illegal to make and sell, and /hello Azkaban/ if you decide to spike someone's food or drink with them.

**** It's canon that veritaserum is restricted to ministry authorized use only so that makes sense. But it's also kind of jacked up that they would restrict veritaserum and not love potions.

***** One way to explain that:

Certain kinds of laws, including drug-relates ones, only really gained traction after Something Big Happened to make it necessary. That might mean that, while some big mishap with Veritaserum made restrictions happen, no such Big Public Thing happened with love potions yet.

In theory, if Voldemort's parentage came to light, there would then be public call for restriction on love potions - even if the potion wasn't directly responsible for the Dark Lord's mentality, it led to the circumstances of his birth and youth.

****** They'd pass that law in under ten words: "Voldemort wouldn't be born without a love potion." Quite simple. The only vote against it was Umbridge's.

******* Yep. Like I said, if they found out that Voldemort only was who he was because Merope Gaunt thought love-potions equal consent, and the fact that it /isn't/ landed her child in an abusive orphanage...

But of course, they'd have to /find out/ first.

******** If I were in the trio or were someone who knew about Voldemort's past, I'd die from spilling the tea. I wouldn't help it and Voldemort would go after me for telling everyone he's a Half-blood lol but at least I'd get this law to be approved as my legacy.

*** Personally I'd go with keeping them legal but having them invalidate consent in any form unless the potion itself was consented to. So if you give someone a love potion and have sex, it's rape. If you give someone a love potion and you run away together, it's kidnapping. cross the border, human trafficking.

There's also definitely different strengths - potions that just "make you notice" someone wouldn't do this, while potions in the middling range, that can actually sway ideology and make people do things they normally wouldn't, would be subject to these laws. And potions like fermented amortentia, which will make you willing to die or kill for who it is keyed to are wholly illegal.

** Nice... another take on "unexpected consequences" for Romilda I saw once (but can't remember the name, I know it involved Hermione interrupted something Ginny was making to enslave Harry and accidentally wound up as Harry's mistress was Hermione found Romilda after they intercepted the love potion, dragged her into the room of requirement, yoinked a hair and polyjuiced into her, shoving her down under Harry's cloak all just in time for Harry to burst into the door looking for Romilda acting like he was hopped up on potion... and proceeds to faux-rape Hermione, who IIRC sent him a silent signal that it was actually her and not Romilda.

After he leaves, she then talks Romilda down from going to McGonagall by pointing out that given their master/slave circumstances if she tries to make a big deal out of it Hermione will just claim it was an intense roleplay and also points out that what Romilda did was illegal and she'd get in trouble for it if this came out. Wish I could remember the name...
