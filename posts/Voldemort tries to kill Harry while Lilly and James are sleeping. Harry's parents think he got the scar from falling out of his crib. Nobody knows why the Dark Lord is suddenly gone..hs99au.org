** I didn't follow exactly to the whole no one knowing what happened to Voldemort, but this is what I came up with for now: [1/?] EDIT: some grammatical errors, added Part 3 below

It had been about a week and half since Lily had woken to a thud and a cry. Harry must have fallen out of his crib and that had resulted in a nasty, oddly-shaped scar above his right eye. She ran to his room and saw him in the fetal position, crying and bloody. As she dashed across to him, she cursed James' insistence that he was ready to sleep in his own room; Harry wasn't even eighteen months old yet, he wasn't ready to be alone and she most certainly wasn't ready for him to be. It was all happening so fast. At least now she had the evidence she needed to prove to James that Harry wasn't ready for his own room, nor was he apparently ready for this crib.

The blood was easy to clean up, just a simple /Episkey/ spell and it had disappeared, but the scar had formed instantly, something Lily hadn't realized at the time. Now that it had been twelve days, she was beginning to think she had cast the wrong spell, or maybe due to her immediate concern, and having just been woken up from a very deep sleep, she wasn't as concentrated as she should have been. Healing spells, while simple in theory, can be difficult in practice for the inexperienced. She would have James look at it to get his opinion. It seemed odd to her, but they had all been sleeping better since the first of November; it was almost as if there was more lightness in their world, or maybe less darkness? She could only hope that it was a sign of good things to come.

Living under a /Fidelius/ charm had been a struggle from the start, but it was for her family's own good. It meant very little interaction with their closest friends, but she knew that those friends and indeed others were out there, trying to destroy the Dark Lord so they could rejoin the magical world and be of service to those around them. The /Fidelius/ did allow for a select few to visit, but it had been over two weeks since their last encounter with anyone. James had been worried that something dire had happened to one of his school friends, and when he got onto that train of thought, there was nothing she could do but wait it out. They had both seen so much death and destruction, there really were no words of comfort either of them could offer, even after two years of marriage. The only thing they could do was be there when the other was ready.

Lily and James were sitting at their table, having just finished up breakfast, when there was a loud rapping at their front door. It had been so long, Lily let out a small yelp and James jumped to his feet, wand ready, and made his way to the door.

"Password?" He let out, barely above a whisper.

"Gillyweed Pasties," an excited voice chimed from the other side of the heavily protected door. It was Moony, one of James' oldest school friends. James threw open the door and in a flash, Moony had embraced him in the tightest hug he had felt since his wedding day.

"Moony, what in Merlin is going on? And, please ease up, I think a rib just cracked," James let out as loud as he was able.

"Where are Lily and Harry? You're not going to believe what has happened. It's the most bizarre yet incredible thing to happen since...well since longer than any of us can remember," Remus exalted.

Lily had heard the excited interaction between her husband and Remus and had dislodged Harry from his high chair to go and meet them in the living room. She walked out of the kitchen to see Remus exuding happiness and aglow with excitement.

"Remus! It's so good to see you; it's been months since we've last heard anything from you. How was your visit with the werewolves in Scotland? Will they join us or has He gotten to them already?"

Remus looked at her and held back a laugh, although not very well. "It went...well it doesn't matter how it went, there's no need for them. There's no need for any of it anymore. We have no idea how or why, all we know is that on the night of the 31st, He vanished. Gone! Not a soul knows where He was. Dumbledore, being Dumbledore, has been out searching for any kind of answer for the last ten days after he received word from an old schoolmate that something big had happened. Dumbledore just returned a few hours ago and called an emergency meeting with a select few of the Order to inform us that it appears He is in fact, dead!" Remus cried as he waited for Lily and James' minds to catch up to the news. He beamed with pride and made his way to Harry to say hello to his only, and his favorite, adopted "nephew". "Harry, oh Harry, you and your parents are going to be fine, and you'll finally know a world without this dark stain."

Lily and James, having took quite some time to process this information, finally screamed out in joy and ran to each other. They embraced and James yelled, "This is the best news we've gotten since we found out you were expecting!"

Remus flicked his wand, firewhisky and three glasses floated from their hidden compartment in the bookcase, the bottle pouring as the glasses met the hands of the three. "To the defeat of Voldemort!" he barked out. The three of them downed their first of what was sure to be many drinks and the bottle floated and filled their glasses for them.

"How? What happened? How is Dumbledore so sure that it's over? Who is this old schoolmate of his and how would they know of this happening?" Lily rapidly questioned Remus while Harry started to curl his hand into the werewolves' growing beard.

Remus took a long sip of his firewhisky and glanced at his friend's expectant faces, a large smile appearing as he sorted through all of her questions. "Well as for the how? Not a soul knows. What happened was Voldemort tried to make good on a prophecy, a prophecy you both know well, but it didn't work. As for the who? I didn't say it was Dumbledore's old schoolmate. It was someone we all know, Lily you know him better than any of us as you grew up with him."

Lily gasped, "No, there's no way it could be him! No one has heard a word from him since...since we left Hogwarts."

James, having taken a moment to catch up to what Remus was implying, nearly spat out his drink, "Snivelus!! What does he have to do with Volde...oh. Oh, that makes a world of sense. Of course he would have become one of those wretched things. What a sneaky little snake boy he was!"

Lily, having known Severus Snape most of her life, would have disagreed with her husband just a few years ago, but seeing as to everything that had happened since their fifth year, she could hardly disagree now. "What exactly did Severus say happened and how would he be privy to any events?" Lily slowly asked Remus.

Remus, having finished his second drink while James and Lily sorted it all out, calmly said, "It appears that Snape had in fact become a Death Eater before we even left Hogwarts. He immediately joined Voldemort's side upon graduation and became his potions expert. Snape had been one of Voldemort's closest followers as he blamed all his misfortunes on Dumbledore and the Order in general." Remus took a large sip and an even larger sigh and continued, "On the night of the 31st, it appears that Voldemort tried to fulfill the prophecy. He chose a boy who was born in July last year who he deemed would be his vanquisher. He found a way through all the protective enchantments that were in place to protect this child and broke into the home while the parents and the child slept. According to Snape, he was in this house to do one thing only, kill the child. He cast the Killing Curse, but nothing happened to the child. Well," he glanced at Harry's forehead while Harry was still playing with his graying beard, "nearly nothing. Snape informed Dumbledore that from all angles, it appears Voldemort is dead. I'm not sure as to the specifics as to how Snape would know this, but Dumbledore took ten days to look into it and at the meeting earlier, he stated without hesitation that Voldemort is in fact gone from this world." Remus finished and polished off his second drink of the evening.

Lily and James were in shock. They knew of the prophecy, how could they not? It was their home Remus was talking about. It was their Harry! Lily knew of the scar that very night after she cleaned up the blood. She thought it odd in the morning, but figured it was her fault. She could never have imagined it was the mark from a spell cast from one of the darkest wizards the world had ever known. Her jaw dropped more as she began to realize the implications of what that scar meant. James, having also finished his second drink, was flummoxed as to how someone like Voldemort could have made it into HIS house in the middle of the night and attempted to kill HIS son, yet he didn't even hear a sound. Of course there were quietening spells and ways of concealment, but their house was under a /Fidelius/! It was to be protected and repel any and all types of concealment unless he or Lily had cast them. HOW could that vile creature had been in the house?

*** 2 (EDIT: Some grammatical errors)

Remus waited patiently for the Potter's to process the events while he watched Harry, holding his "nephew" close to him. James finally spoke, "Moony, how in Hogwarts did He get into our house completely undetected? There's every imaginable protection in place for my family and yet he just walks in whenever he wants and nearly kills my son?"

Lily piped up, "I knew that scar was abnormal, scars don't form instantly from a cut. I thought...I thought I had done something wrong when I cleaned him up after he fell out of his...James! He didn't fall out of his crib! I was half-awake when I went into his room and had assumed that he must have gotten cut by falling out of his crib. But thinking back now, he was still in his crib! How could I have missed that? I heard a thud, but there was nothing on the floor that wasn't there when I took him to bed, I'm sure of it. We'll have to use Dumbledore's Pensive to check, there might be other things that could be useful that I missed, but I can't explain that thud now that I really think about it," Lily spat out, shaking and looking rapidly back and forth from James to Harry.

Remus calmly answered James' question while pondering Lily's story from that night, "It appears that someone we entrusted with the /Fidelius/ has let us down. And that could only be one person Prongs."

James' face drained of color. He could never have imagined that anyone, let alone one of the three men he trusted with his life would do that to him and his family. He swore to himself we would find Wormtail and he would pay. It didn't matter to him that his family was safe, that was a level of disrespect and mistrust that could never be forgiven. He finished his firewhisky and rose to his feet to take Harry from his old friend. "Moony, I could never have imagined I would have made a mistake like that, but it appears that I did in fact choose the wrong man to be Secret Keeper," James shamefully admitted to Remus.

Remus shook his head slowly and cast his eyes on Lily who was visibly going through the events of the night of the 31st. He could not even imagine being in their position right now of being betrayed like that. He knew why James hadn't chosen him, and he would always understand that a man in his condition would not be the ideal candidate for being a Secret Keeper. But he had not even questioned James when he had suggested Peter be it. He knew it was crossing a line to ask James why he hadn't chosen Sirius, but he now knew he should have overstepped and forced an answer from James.

The positive charge in the room that was present mere minutes before had been dulled. The three adults sat in their own minds contemplating everything that had happened since they left Hogwarts, all absentmindedly swirling their drinks and each finding that exact moment where everything went wrong since the birth of Harry. They knew prophecies were out of their control, but they all felt they had done everything right since they had learned of it through Dumbledore.

Lily finally broke the silence, "Remus, thank you for informing us that our family is finally safe. You have and always will mean the world to us. James, I think I need to have a lie down with our son. You and Remus are free to sit here and speak and drink as long as you like, invite Sirius is you think it safe, but please, no one else. As far as that rat is concerned, if I ever see him near my son, I will kill him before anyone has the chance to react. So for Harry's sake, I hope the Order has dealt with him before I decide to do it my way. James, I love you and I will see you in bed when you're ready." She gently picked up Harry from James' lap and gave him a small kiss on his forehead. James stood and embraced the pair of them, not having to say a word. Lily walked over Remus as James grabbed the bottle of firewhisky, too stunned to even use magic at this moment, and poured heavily.

Remus stood, and softly spoke to Lily, "Lily, I'm so beyond the moon that the three of you are safe. But I promise that I will not rest until the Order knows where Peter is and he is brought to justice for what he has done to you three. I'll watch over James for the night. Dumbledore will be by tonight to cast new protective charms, I will make sure of it; those will hold until the Goblins can come over tomorrow to reinstate the /Fidelius/ as we now know that has been broken by that sorry excuse for a man. I'm so very sorry for all this happening, but we will protect you and your family." Remus looked down in shame as he felt he had let his closest friends down.

Lily hugged him, and quickly said, "Thank you, Remus. Do not blame yourself, for it is not your fault. You are family here; nothing that has happened could ever change that. Good night, and you know where the spare bedroom is. See you in the morning, although Harry and I may sleep in a bit." Lily left to go up the stairs to get ready for bed. She would never let Harry out of her sight again. She flicked her wand a few times to conjure a new crib at the end of the bed; satisfied with the placement, she went to the spare bedroom, what used to be Harry's room as of this very morning, and transfigured the crib to a larger bed for Remus, and turned the rocking chair into another bed for Sirius. She left them each a hangover cure potion and a large glass of ever cold water on the night stand that was Harry's rocking horse a moment ago; she knew her husband and didn't doubt for a moment that Sirius would be here any moment. She had wondered why he wasn't there yet, but knew that the Order all had rotating duty, so assumed he hadn't been present at the small meeting.

She brought Harry back into her bedroom and placed him in his crib; she lay in bed for what she was sure was to be a long night of thinking and worrying.

Downstairs, Remus and James had been sitting in silence, each contemplating what this all meant. They could never let Peter live, but neither could the kill him as it was against their very nature. Even in his internally outraged state, James could not bring himself to do it. He did think of one way to exact his revenge, the Dementors of Azkaban. But, could he really bring himself to request a Kiss? He sipped from his third, or was it his fourth?, firewhisky as he thought of the implications.

Remus was also contemplating how it had come to be where he nearly had lost three of the five, well now four, most important people in his life in one moment. He had to contact Dumbledore to re-fortify the property they were in now. He stood and looked at James and spoke, "I'm going out into the garden if you'd like to join me. I'm going to send a Patronus to Dumbledore to have him come here immediately and start on some protective enchantments. You bring that bottle and another outside and contact Sirius to have him stay the night as well. Come on, Prongs, I need the fresh air."

James nodded as Remus headed out the door. He knew that sitting around wasn't going to fix anything, but he was struggling to understand how Voldemort had been so close. That was an answer that would only come in time. He agreed with Remus that Sirius should be here, so he conjured his Patronus and relayed a brief message to Sirius that he needed to see him at his home right away. Having finished that, he grabbed the two bottles of firewhisky and headed outside where he conjured up three comfortable chairs and a roaring fire for warmth in the garden. He could spot Moony on the far side having just sent his Patronus to Dumbledore and starting on the enchantments.

**** Spoiler alert; Remus and James discover that Peter didn't betray them at all; Voldemort managed to find a loophole in the Fidelius Charm ('Lily and James Potter are living in Godric's Hollow' doesn't say anything about their /son/'), and Peter sacrificed his own life (like Lily did in canon) to protect Harry's.

**** 3/?

James sat in the closest chair to the house and sighed. He felt less than useless as Remus set about the enchantments to protect his family; he kept reviewing in his mind the path that led to selecting Wormtail as Secret Keeper. To explain away Remus as his selection seemed almost too easy, but at the same time dismissive of a whole group of people. Werewolves could not always be trusted because when they transformed, they retained so little of their humanness that it was easy for them to mistakenly reveal too much information to other werewolves; it was almost as if when they transformed they could telepathically communicate with those closest. James felt awful he hadn't picked Remus for the most important information in his family's existence, but he felt the risk too great.

Sirius was of course an option, his preferred option if he was honest with himself, but even though Sirius had been removed from his family, the Black's were so ingrained with the Dark Arts and the Death Eaters, they both felt the possibility of his family coming after Sirius for James and Lily's whereabouts was too great. James and Sirius agreed that even though Sirius had had almost no contact with his family, the threat of Voldemort and the existence of Narcissa Malfoy, who had married a known Death Eater in Lucius, and Bellatrix Lestrange WAS a Death Eater; those three factors weighed heavily in the decision to bypass Sirius as Secret Keeper.

That left the final of the Marauder's: Peter Pettigrew. Wormtail had always been more of a side member of the group, but he of course had his uses and his magical knowledge that lead him to be a trusted person in James' eyes. For seven years of school and up until a few hours ago, James, Sirius, and Remus had considered Peter to be one of them; he came to the Order meetings, he appeared to be doing his duty to defeat Voldemort, and he was almost always the first one to show up when James called for his friends. James realized, however, that Peter was almost always the first to leave an Order meeting, always stating that he had to look after his mother, or his aunt, or some other family member, before showing up at the Potter's house to discuss the night's meeting or to just enjoy the evening with close friends. Where did James go so wrong in his evaluation of his friend and how did he not see that Wormtail was the wrong person to lay his trust and his family's safety in?

James was suddenly alerted by a pop near the edge of his property; it appeared Dumbledore had finally made it to assist Remus. As the headmaster approached, James grew angry at himself and at Dumbledore for what had almost transpired nearly a fortnight ago. He had to have better answers and had to understand why he hadn't been invited by Dumbledore to the Order meeting earlier in the day.

“James,” Dumbledore whispered as he approached the young man, “how are Lily and young Harry? I see Remus has told you and Lily what has happened.”

James, in a bout of frustration, spat at Dumbledore, “How DARE you not say anything to us?” he stood so quickly his chair nearly flew into Lily's garden bed, “it's the twelfth of November Professor, we've been without proper protection around our house since Halloween!! My wife and my son are at risk, and you come to my home and offer a ‘how are you?'” James' face was scarlet in anger with the older wizard. Remus had ceased his enchantments momentarily and gone to his friend for support. He could hardly believe that James had lashed out at the headmaster in such a way, but he wasn't the one with a family.

Dumbledore raised his arms to his waist and address James, “James, I implore you to settle down. Please sit and I will discuss with you everything I know once I have re-cast the required spells. Remus,” he turned to the young werewolf, “if you and I could continue these wards, I believe that would be in the best interest of all. And, it appears, that we have a visitor; Sirius I presume?” he turned to face away from the house and to begin the enchantments.

Sirius saw James as he came through the Potter's gate and broke into a sprint. “James, what is going on? You sounded almost catatonic in you Patronus,” Sirius rapidly questioned as he engulfed James. For the second time tonight, it felt as if one of James' ribs had cracked.

James was able to cough out, “Hi Sirius, please let me go before you choke me,” as he felt his anger dissipating slowly. “It turns out, Voldemort tried to kill Harry, but wound up killing himself,” James motioned towards Dumbledore, “at least that's what he said.”

Sirius' shock was evident on his heavily bearded face. “What? What do you mean ‘tried to kill Harry?' How could he have gotten to Harry at all, let alone without anyone noticing? And how do we know he's dead?”

James flicked his wand and his chair met his legs as he motioned to Sirius to take a seat around the fire. The bottle of firewhisky, more than half drunk at this point, floated into the air and filled the three glasses. As James finished wiping his glasses on his shirt, more of a nervous tick than a necessity as he had placed an ever-clean charm on them as soon as Harry had been born, the glasses met their hands, Remus' floated in front of the chair meant for him. James took a long sip and started, “Twelve days ago, on Halloween evening, Lily heard Harry fall out of the crib in the middle of the night. I was completely asleep, but she told me, the next morning, that he had cut his forehead open and so he slept with us for the night. She woke up the next morning and everything seemed fine, at least she didn't say anything to me, so Harry went back into his crib that night. That is until tonight, when Remus showed up and told us this astonishing news that Voldemort had been vanquished. Lily and I were ecstatic, as you can understand; we would finally be able to rejoin the wizarding world properly.” James took an elongated breath and a swig of his drink while Sirius sat in silence. “Remus told us what Dumbledore had told him and only a select few others earlier this afternoon. According to the headmaster, Voldemort had come into our house on the night of the 31st and attempted to the Killing Curse on Harry while he slept in his crib. For some reason, it didn't work on Harry, but it did manage to kill Voldemort. That must have been the sound that awoke Lily. She only told me after Remus arrived that the scar was still there and hadn't changed in any manner since she first realized the next morning. It's very faint, and his hair is so long, as you know, I never even saw it; and I guess if I did, I just assumed it had been from him falling out of his crib and it would go away.” James took a long enough break for Sirius to chime in.

“How in Hogwarts could Voldemort have gotten into your house? It's under /Fidelius/ and has been since just after Harry was born!” Sirius' hand was white with rage around his glass.

“That's exactly what I said! Sirius, there's only one person who knows where this house is that could possibly have told Voldemort where we live. He's the one person I decided to trust with our most important secret. I couldn't have imagined he would do something like this, but there can't possibly be any other explanation. Voldemort was able to get into our house without a sound and attempted to kill our son. We didn't even know he was in here until just a few hours ago when Remus showed up. Hell, we didn't even know there was an issue with the /Fidelius/ until he showed up!” James croaked, exasperated, his head in his hand. He had finished another glass of the firewhisky and the bottle had begun its journey from the ground to his glass as he sat back in his chair.

Sirius was flabbergasted. How could this have happened? How could one of their closest friends, the Secret Keeper for the Potter's betray all of them by turning over their location to Voldemort? “James, I don't even know what to say. Peter would never...could...how could he have done that to you and Lily, to Harry? We've known him for ten years. Well, I thought we knew him,” Sirius said dejectedly, finishing his first firewhisky of the evening and allowing the bottle to pour him another.

***** 4/?

James sat in silence, slowly contemplating the events of Halloween. It was difficult to do considering he was asleep the entire time, but he was starting to realize as he evaluated the last twelve days how he had been feeling; lighter, happier, more appreciative of what he had with his little family, and for the first time in almost six years, looking forward to a future, rather than just running from the present. It irked him how the headmaster hadn't felt it necessary to inform Lily and him about what had transpired; if he knew the wards were down, why not send over goblins to reinstate them? Was there some other part Dumbledore didn't tell the small group of the Order?

Remus and Dumbledore finished putting up the enchantments and made their way over to the fire. Remus' glass floated into his hand as he fell into his chair. Dumbledore, sensing the hostility, did not question why a fourth chair hadn't been supplied. He looked around the trio finally resting on James, saying, “James, I understand your frustration with me, but I ask you to listen to what I have to say before passing judgement on my actions.” He implored James, and by extension Remus and Sirius to hear him out; he knew the pressure he had put the Potter's under by not informing them sooner, but he had reason to believe the threat was no longer present from Tom Riddle from the moment Severus showed his face at Hogwarts.

Dumbledore continued, “In the early hours of the third, your classmate Severus appeared outside Hogwarts' gate and relayed a message that he must speak to me immediately. While it was, of course, unexpected, I could not turn away a former student for as you all know ‘help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.' Severus went on to explain that he believed ‘/...Voldemort had left this world without a trace.'/ Severus had been one of his closest supporters after leaving Hogwarts. He relayed a story to me that seemed too intricate to not contain anything but the truth. He told me of how Peter was attempting to rise through the ranks of Death Eaters, and by doing so ran to his master to inform him of your location. This presumably broke the /Fidelius/ and allowed Tom to enter your home and attempt to kill your son.” Dumbledore let this sink in once again as James took a large sip from his glass.

He continued, “As you well know, he was not successful as Harry is still alive; he only succeeded in killing himself. I have spent the last ten days searching through every known location Tom has used in the past, interviewing every known associate who is not a Death Eater, and those I trust most have been assisting me; we have not found one single trace of him. I had to be sure before I told anyone in the Order, including you and your family James, you must understand this. There was no reason for immediate alarm as I had Minerva place a /Caterwauling Charm/ over this area and an anti-apparition charm over your home and grounds. The Order always had eyes on your family, of course, but they were instructed to not interact so as to give your position away to any Death Eaters that may be around. It was not clear at the time of speaking with Severus whether other Death Eaters knew of the location or not, but in the preceding days, there has not been a single breach of the charm.” Dumbledore took a long pause to allow the three to sort through all of this information. His eyes followed the smoke of the fire until it dissipated into the atmosphere.

James, Sirius, and Remus were white as sheets. They still couldn't grasp that Peter could do that to their friend; he was truly living up to his Animagus form. They had suspected Snivelus of becoming a Death Eater seeing as to how he had become obsessed with Dark Magic as they grew older, there was no surprise there; the fact that he had so quickly risen to such a high position within their ranks startled them. Remus finished his drink and the last of the bottle poured into his glass. He let out a slow breath and asked of the headmaster, “Professor, does anyone know where Peter could be now? We haven't heard from him since the Order meeting over two weeks ago, when we discussed where we believed Voldemort and his Death Eaters to be stowed away, plotting their attacks.”

“Remus, there has been no sign on him either,” the headmaster admitted dispiritedly. “The Order will continue to search for him and we shall deal with him as the law allows. Until such time, I'm afraid that James, Lily, and Harry will have to remain here. I will send Goblins in the morning to cast stronger enchantments,” Dumbledore nodded towards James and caught him by surprise, "it will not be another /Fidelius/ until such time as we have discovered where Peter has scurried away to. The risk is too great James, there is no telling what powers he may have gained from Tom,” Dumbledore finished, following the smoke, this time it appeared to nearly form a shape, but quickly dissolved into the air.

James was shocked. He was just about to say that he would have them put up another /Fidelius/ in the morning when he felt the headmaster invade his mind, “Given the circumstances, I ask you stay out of my mind for at least tonight, you may not like what you find in there, Professor.” Remus and Sirius took this to mean they too should put up their Occulumency shields as they realized the implications of what James had just said.They both had been by themselves working for the Order for so long, there simply hadn't been a need to guard against Legilimency. They gave the headmaster a distained look as they each finished their drinks and the new bottle floated over to fill their glasses.

Dumbledore nodded slowly and said, “Forgive me James, there are times where I myself do not realize I am actively engaging in such a manner. I shall take my leave for the night, there is much to be accounted for, and it appears I have over stayed a welcome that was granted only out of necessity.” Dumbledore finished a slow sweep of the three recent graduates of Hogwarts, and with one final look at the fire's smoke, he turned on his heel and left to apparate back to his school beyond the enchantments.

“What a right git!” Sirius spat once the faint pop of Dumbledore leaving was heard. Remus looked taken aback that someone would have the nerve to call Professor Dumbledore such a name, but quickly remembered they were no longer in school and could therefore call anyone they wanted by any name they choose to. James had let out a faint chuckle at Sirius' outburst and finished his drink as well. He couldn't tell if it was the firewhisky or the constant cycle of anger that was making his head spin, but he decided the best course of action was to continue his drinking for the night.

As the bottle floated to his glass, he glanced at Remus from the corner of his eye; he was watching the smoke rise into nothingness in the same manner Dumbledore had. Were there images in smoke only werewolves, and apparently headmasters, could see? Or was it just a trick of the light from the fire and the stars that were ever so bright on this crisp November night? He decided against pursuing this train of thought for the time being and turned to Sirius, “Where exactly were you when /Prongs/ found you?”

“I was out on guard duty near the Lestrange estate in my Animagus form to see who was coming in and out for the last week. It was my turn in rotation, and we were trying to determine where the Death Eaters have been meeting since July when they moved from Goyle's home. Remus was watching Crabbe's home this last week after his furry friend had ceased his monthly visit. Where were you the week before Remus?” Sirius asked with a wry smile.

Remus' cheeks went into full blush while he quickly downed his drink yet again, in a poor attempt to avoid the question. James' neck nearly snapped as he turned to his other oldest friend, his eyebrows nearly disappearing below his hair, “Moony!” he laughed.

Remus despised being put on the spot like this, he was here to comfort James and inform him of the events of the last two weeks, not to be interrogated like a common thief. “I was, erm, out doing my duties for the Order, of course. Where else could I have possibly been?” he quickly stumbled through his response in the hope it could hold water.

​

Sirius barked with laughter, “Now, now Moony that's not what I heard the other night.” He playfully winked at Remus, all the while James was whipping his head back and forth trying to figure out if Sirius was trying to get a rise out of him or was telling the truth. Sirius continued, "/I/ heard that you and an acquaintance were spotted in Hogsmeade together. Walking arm in arm just a few doors down from Madam Puddifoot's..." his smile nearly reached his ears as he finished poking at the young werewolf.

I have more scenes in my mind to show how Dumbledore (because of course it would be Dumbledore) comes to the conclusion with Snape's help, but also discovers the Horcruxes. Dumbledore always played with people and I think, in my mind, that he would have come up with something like saying he's dead when only he knows that there is much more to destroy before he can well and truly be dead. I'm working on it.

***** I've always viewed the Killing Curse and the Horcrux Ritual as two sides of a coin. The Horcrux Ritual is old, one of the oldest and Darkest Magicks, descended from those who still worshipped the heathen gods of yore. The Killing Curse, in comparison, is a relatively modern invention; Unforgivable for a reason yes, invented by a mass murderer yes, but far less primitive, and thus prone to explosive failure, than the Horcrux. A Horcrux is the manipulation and mutilation of a soul, your own; the Killing Curse is your magic striking forth against someone who you feel nothing but absolute hatred and contempt for.

*** 1. Crossover with Discworld, or invoking aspects of it - for example, the story demands that Voldemort mysteriously 'die' at this point, the narrative imperative was so strong that he just died for no reason. Possible consequence: However, this consumed so much Narrativium that Harry now has anti-Narrativium infused into him, now every trope he touches collapses, releasing pure plot resolution (alternately, he supercharges every trope he encounters).
2. Like a contract nailed to the door in tiny print like "Anyone who crosses this threshold agrees to die in place of any of the inhabitants therein, in perpetuity", or some other ridiculously powerful magic thing that exists with no other consequence for no adequately explored reason.
3. Harry is, for a reason of your choice, literally divine, part-ludicrously-powerful-magical-creature-or-alien, himself from the future, etc.
4. At least one of James or Lily is of the Last Child of Krypton trope, and their house is guarded by Sufficiently Advanced technology or magic.
5. James, Lily, or Harry is the reincarnation of some ridiculously powerful person from another work, and recently started regaining their memories and powers, especially if said person is sufficiently out-of-context that their powers and magic more or less ignore each other (or at crackiest, one completely trumps the other).

*** One word. Fanfiction. If you want canon, read the books. This sub though is dedicated to what ifs, what abouts, and why nots. As long as the author can make it come across in some way that makes sense, it's fine.

**** I totally agree. What I'm pointing out is that a lot more thought needs to go into this fanfiction plot. Perhaps Death is involved in the reason Harry survived. Maybe Dumbledore starts spreading the story of how Harry survived the killing curse to Lily and James' confusion. I just wanted to put out there that when you change one aspect of the story you have to think about how it will effect everything to follow. Personally, I think if you don't get rid of the prophecy all together there's no way Lily and James could think the scar was caused by falling out of the crib for long. As a cute one shot the prompt would be great, but if it's the start of a long fanfiction then the author will need to think about why and how everything will play out. I probably should have explained this in my original comment.

***** And that's where creative writing comes in. The OP didn't write a story, just a prompt he wanted talented writers to turn into a story however they wish. Your comment made it sound like you were hating on the idea, or the OP. You have to remember the difference between a prompt, and a story. If a story doesn't make sense, then review, but this is not it.
