I had a reviewer today told me I was an over-eager author, which basically meant I was updating very frequently.

Which is true, I don't let finished chapters sit on my computer for a week after I finish writing them, and update every week. I've been known to update a chapter everyday for a whole week, most chapters are 4-5K words long, maybe even two chapters a day. Sometimes I just find when I have ideas in my mind I can keep writing and writing, and dish out many chapters at a time. It is just what I do.

Does that make me an "over-eager author?"


** It makes you prolific, which makes those of us posting at 1 chapter or story per season look like lazy turtles. If the reviewer was trying to calm you down without giving you something else to do with your focus - like spelling and grammar checks - it's probably because you're making him/her feel bad.

Post as you feel ready. If you're getting a lot of Beta offers because your readership is wincing at the lack of edits, accept a few and see if they help.

*** No mention of spelling or grammar checks. And no beta offers. My stories have plenty of reviews, and very few grammar and spelling complaints. More canon complaints than spelling and grammar, and even those are few and far in between.

Also, how would you feel if I bounced ideas off you?

******* How do you feel about crossovers? I'm working on a Dresden files/Harry Potter crossover, and I can catch 99% of Dresden canon errors, but not the Potter ones. I'm still working on the first chapter, and want a buffer of 4-5 chapters before I post any.

** There might be an optimum frequency for updating if you want to maximize popularity. Once every six months is too infrequent; once every hour is probably too frequent.

If you don't care so much about maximizing your popularity, go at whatever pace you want.

*** Pretty much this. There are stories that are completed in their entirety, and are really good, but they never see popularity because the author updates far too fast to establish a fan base. This is also the reason many one shots that are incredibly good are so hard to find.

Most people say that if your work is finished before you start publishing, the best thing to do is update once every week, at the same time each week.

**** I don't have to worry about popularity. My current story gets an average 1000 views and 10+ reviews per chapter in the first few days of each chapter published. It is a good following.

***** The internet likes to have time to discuss and mull over things before updates are posted. I think you'll be fine as long as you don't post more than one big chapter or two smaller chapters a day.

** I think as often as you can update, you should. As long as the chapters are polished you're fine. I don't know why someone would say you are over eager. That is a complaint that has never crossed my mind for anyone.

** As long as you are putting out content that you are proud of who the heck cares. I'd love to have more frequent updates on stories, but I don't complain because fanfic authors are providing me service for free.

Besides what is the point of leaving criticisms if they are not useful?
