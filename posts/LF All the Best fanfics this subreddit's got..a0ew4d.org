** You're gonna find some salt posting stuff like this. Not sure if you're new to fanfiction or this sub in general, but, if you're posting here you may want to ask for a specific kind of fic or pairing. Overly broad requests like this get hated on. Unfortunate for newbies but thems the apples.

Here are a couple from memory that I personally really like:

Prince of the Dark kingdom

Harry Potter and the Boy who lived

Methods of Rationality

Delenda Est

Backwards with purpose

A Black Comedy

Magicks of the Arcane

Firebird Trilogy

Emperor

Nightmares of Future Past

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time

Too Young to Die

I wonder how anybody can go back to the original series after reading classics like this one. Bellatrix, for me, can no longer be that psychotic, sadistic, megalomaniac bitch.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** You know, there's a line from Ever After, where the prince takes his love interest to a library, which she's thrilled about, and he invites her to pick a favorite book. And she replies, "I could no sooner choose a favorite star in the heavens."

There are just too many stories (800k+ on ff.net alone), and individual tastes vary too widely, to answer such a broad request. What you'll get is lists of the personal, subjective favorites of the people who respond.

If you're looking for more objective criteria, then you can use tools on sites like ff.net to sort by the number of Favorites, or filter by word count and completeness, for example. The strength of a forum like this, on the other hand, is that you can use criteria that computers can't evaluate, such as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a0ies0/any_magic_loophole_stories/][Any "Magic Loophole" stories?]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a0izf2/looking_for_fanfic_where_harry_goes_back_in_time/][Looking for fanfic where Harry goes back in time and starts a company]]. But "best" is just too nebulous.

** I'm fairly new to fan fic as well though I've read at least a few million words of HP fan fic by now, and I constantly look for these kinds of threads, because I always want to find something someone considers the best. So don't mind the hate.

For me the best are coincidentally the first I ever read. Alexandra Quick by Inverarity and A Black Comedy by nonjon.

Alexandra Quick is completely AU, the only things it shares with Harry Potter is the magic and its rules, and the mention of the name Voldemort once or twice in the series. That's where all the similarities stop. It doesn't even take place at Hogwarts. Don't let that stop you though, it's the best written fic I've ever read and I'm constantly looking for something like it. A lot of people don't like the main character, something like 50% from what I've seen, and for that reason give up on the fic fairly quickly, personally I don't get that though as I love it. So definitely try it and give it at least until book 2 if you don't actually hate it.

A Black Comedy is universally loved. It's not crack(a plus for me, I read the Seventh Horcrux and didn't love it that much). It's just light comedy, but it's well written and has a lot of originality. If you are intrigued by the concept of a Sirius/Harry adventure this is the fic for you.
