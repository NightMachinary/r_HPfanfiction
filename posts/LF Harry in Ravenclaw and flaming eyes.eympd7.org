:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this fic that had Harry in Ravenclaw, I don't think he was op god mode magical badass, but he was strong enough that his eyes glowed with emerald flames. The fic repeatedly mentions and even focuses on the fact that his eyes glowed with emerald flames. It was a longer fic I think.

Oh one scene I remember was that he didn't go down to the halloween feast because he was mourning and Dumbledore sent Flitwik up to get him. Harry gets pissed off (cue magic flame eyes) and goes down to confront Dumbledore. That's about all I remember.

So, Floo eyes. Sounds rather less badass than Killing Curse eyes.

Most of the fic is Dumbledore trying to get control of Harry, and Harry rebuffing him.

He learned how to purposefully flare his magic, which does the glowy flame eyes thing.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
