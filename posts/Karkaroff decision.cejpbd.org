In the book, Karkaroff, an Ex Death Eater who sold his comrades to get out of Azkaban, decided to flee after the resurection of Voldemort because he was afraid of what he would do to him. He was finally found, and killed, a little more than a year later in an abandonned shack.

But I was wondering : Why did he flee?

Even if he was afraid of Voldemort, I don't understand the point of abandonning everything to flee, especially the way he did :

- Durmstrang is one of the 3 biggest magical school of Europe, and nobody except the students know its location (unless this part is full fanon?). Being the Headmaster of this school, Karkaroff was potentially the best protected person as long as he stayed inside this castle.
- Also, being the Headmaster of the school, Karkaroff was a public figure in the country concerned by the school, making his murder a lot harder to organize, especially since Voldemort wanted to keep his return secret (though I guess Karkaroff didn't know about this point).
- His position as the Headmaster also provided Karkaroff an amazing bargaining chip for his life. The castle (with powerfull protection and a potential recrutment ground) for his life. Why throw everything away to flee?
- And if Karkaroff was so afraid of Voldemort that he thought he had to flee, why stay in Britain? Voldemort powerbase was basically inexistant in any other country, why stay in the place he has the best chance to get you? (This point also apply for his position as the Headmaster of Durmstrang, which was already a good reason for him to leave the country).

â€‹

So I am trying to understand why did Karkaroff chose what was basically the worst choice when it came to his continued survival? (I guess one of the reason was that Rowling wanted to close this arc and throw the character, but I was more wondering about why the character did it, inside the story).

Certainly. I think he actually picked the job /because/ of the protections it awarded him. But while strong enough that he felt safe from fellow ex-Death Eaters, I think he knew his Master well enough to know that the protections on Durmstrang weren't beyond Lord Voldemort's ability to break.

That is utter poppycock. Dumbledore is far more of a public figure in Great Britain than Karkaroff could possibly have been in, uh, Durmland. Yet Voldemort still planned his murder inside Hogwarts.

In Durmstrang's case, you are, moreover, overlooking the very strong possibility, given Durmstrang students' Dark Arts leanings, that Voldemort could recruit inside men within the student body. Karkaroff didn't want to stay in a castle filled with hundreds of reckless potential traitors.

Wait, /did/ he stay in Britain? Where does it say so? The Wiki says he was "found dead in the North", though it is sometimes wrong.

While it is true that he had far more power in Britain than anywhere else, what is your source for Voldemort having little to no supporters elsewhere? He spent most of his young adult life traveling the world gathering power and followers (Karkaroff's sheer existence testifies that he did retain allies from those days), and he even spends a significant amount of the books' time-frame in Magical Albania.

*** The phrase "found dead in the North" usually implies in the North of the country/landmass he's on. So, safe to say, Karkaroff died somewhere in northern Scotland.

As for Tom having power on the continent, yeah, he did, but not as much as in Britain. Most of his continent followers weren't mentioned or they were called to the graveyard so it's safe to assume they either stuck around until his defeat or that he didn't have that many that were truly loyal to him on the main land.

Given Karkaroff's ostensibly Slavic origins, I always took that to mean /the/ North. As in, the Arctic Circle.

Or, more simply, he had more unmarked sympathizers than actual marked Death Eaters outside of Britain.

** Because people make horrible choices due to fear. Sometimes it's as simple as that.
