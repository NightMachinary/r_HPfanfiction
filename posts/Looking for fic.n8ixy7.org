:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a harry potter fic, but all that i remember from it, is a scene where Harry turns a memorial in Diagon Ally made after the war into a statue of a figure kneeling in front of a grave with the dark mark. It then goes to describe the statue and how from the back its to show regret and respect for those who died and from the front the figure shows a sad but determined face to symbolize moving forward and learning from our mistakes??


** I remember that one; it's where Harry was sent to Azkaban, and Voldemort attempted a summoning ritual which ended up giving power to Harry instead of him.

/In the center of the plaza, a totally different statue was taking shape. Instead of a standing, triumphant looking man, the stone had shaped into a kneeling figure, huddled at the foot of a tombstone. On the tombstone was a lightly engraved dark mark. Sorrow and pain were evident in the slump of the man's shoulders, but his face was the true work of art. Instead of just a statue that faced one way, Harry seemed to have managed to portray two different meanings with the same statue. From the back of the tavern, to all who entered Diagon Ally there, the back of the slumped man seemed to cry, to mourn at the loss of a beloved friend or relative. Around the circular base of the statue in flowing script was the words 'NEVER FORGET'./

/But it was from the front that the statue truly became what Harry wanted it to be. Facing out and looking over the tombstone was the face of the man, not looking at the tombstone itself, but looking beyond it, towards the street. The face seemed to resonate with sadness and pride, love and longing, but the dominant emotion visible on his stone face was fierce determination. Under that side of the statue, where everyone who exited Diagon Ally would have to see, was the most important message that Harry wanted to impart. 'NEVER AGAIN' was written in bold, almost harsh lettering as if trying to beat its way into the brains of everyone who read it that this tragedy of war and hate must never be allowed to occur again./

/Harry stepped back. "There. That's the way that it should be." His words echoed slightly in the perfect silence that had fallen over the street./

  COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.
