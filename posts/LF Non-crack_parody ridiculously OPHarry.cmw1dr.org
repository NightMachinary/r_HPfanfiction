I'm not in the mood to read fics where Harry (in plot) encounters any real resistance to his goals, be they good or evil. I don't care how he gets his powers or what he does with them as long as it's not some “I'm trying to be funny” lolrandom crack type goal. I'd like minor humor and little to no angst or any real drama thats not just backstory. I just want something over the top written as seriously as possible to e terrain myself with.

Slash, dark!harry and bashing are fine. Please no romance/smut-centric plots, harems, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you


** Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/912889/sakurademonalchemist][sakurademonalchemist]] on ffn is good but gets abandoned real fast and she jumps randoms all over the place so most of her stories are crossovers

** Most of MK ONE's work has an exceedingly overpowered Harry. linkffn(West of Here) is a decent example.

I will say that despite the OPness, the grammar is pretty good and the stories are at least creative in their conception. Cheers

Ninja Edit: It is also worth noting that his fics /are/ actually finished, he just doesn't mark them as such.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

** linkffn(Renegade by 1991Kira)

linkffn(The mind arts) has resistance, but is well-written. The only challenges to Harry at this point are top-tier adults

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** linkffn(8149841)

Harry is pretty much the most powerful wizard alive in this fic. He is Slytherin!Dark!Harry and it is a slash story.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
