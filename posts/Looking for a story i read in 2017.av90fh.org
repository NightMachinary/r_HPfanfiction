It was one about Harry's actor in the movies being a magical (apparently) and that Jk Rowling is a witch who used a time turner to write the harry potter books we all know. Other things to note that at one point (I think) that a child asks Harry for an autograph thinking that he's Daniel Radcliffe but gets disappointed when he gets 'harry potter' instead (I've really been wanting to read this again now that I've remember reading this and liking it)


** Hmm I dunno where that one is, though it sounds fascinating, if you find it! BUT I am going to shameless recommend mine because it is along the same vein. :P

​

It is about Harry and Dan switching places and Dan has magic. Harry also has a moment where he signs autographs. lol. However fair warning, I have changed up their names a bit. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
