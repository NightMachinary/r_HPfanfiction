Saw this fic on a post in this sub previously, and now I can't find it :( any help would be appreciated! I think Harry also hates Peter Pettigrew and wants to become stronger so he can catch him next time.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
