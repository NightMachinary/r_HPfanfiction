I'm definitely in the mood after rereading their excellent fic. (Also if anyone could also conjure me up an ending to James and Me that would be awesome)

Looking for: An ordinary family befriends the Potters, or some other magical family, and have to be kept in the dark as more and more inexplicable things happen. If there is a reveal or a discovery, I'd prefer it to be late in the story.

My preferences are towards non sexual fics, but well written and realistic smut is fine, as long as the story comes first. Slash/het and crossovers are all fine- I'm in it for the story!

Thank you. My sanity would thank you too, if I could find it, but it's getting harder to find. ;)
