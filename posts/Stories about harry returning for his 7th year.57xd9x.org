** A very old popular story of mine that I started writing months after the Deathly Hallows book came out. (Mostly) Canon relationships. For example, I can't remember whether or not Neville and Hannah are. I think it might be Neville/Luna, but I can't recall.

** There are lots of these "8th year" fics around and almost all (or all?) that I've seen are romance-ish fics pairing Harry usually with someone other than Ginny. Do you have a pairing preference? Is slash okay? One of my very favorites is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812/chapters/6748463][Helix by Saras_girl]] which is a Draco/Harry fic.
