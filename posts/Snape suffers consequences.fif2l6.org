Where his horrendous behaviour to students and his past as a death eater and being an elite level asshole in general seriously bites him in the ass... without killing him. Because death has become a really cheap and easy way for redemption.

*** Being turned into a hero by the narrative despite objectively doing very little is too good for him IMO. He somewhat shielded the Hogwarts students in DH, but other than that his work for Dumbledore had very little effect because Dumbledore does not get much done in canon. And Snape was a highly abusive teacher who probably did a lot of damage with his handling of the Potions professorship.

**** Did he actually give any useful information as a spy? All I remember is him taking ages to pass on the Department of Mysteries warning and giving slight variations on "Yeah, Voldemort still wants to kill Harry", but it's been awhile since I read the books.

As an agent of Dumbledore he was useful, passing on those final memories, but as a spy I'm fairly certain you're right about that 'very little'.
