I've read a fair bit of Manipulative! Dumbledore but not one where he doesn't do anything with Harry Potter. I imagine this Dumbledore to be extremely superstitious due to the prophecy seeing a higher power already meddling with the boy-with-/emerald orbs./

So, he shirks away from him and his friends but goes to great lengths to manipulate everyone's lives(for better according to him) just so he can satiate his urge not being able to tamper with Harry's life. This Dumbledore may or may not be evil and his meddling may just benefit everyone at the end. Just like principles of Greater Good.
