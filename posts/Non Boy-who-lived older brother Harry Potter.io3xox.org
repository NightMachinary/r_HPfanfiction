I've seen a lot of wbwl older brother!Harry fan-fictions. But there happen to be a very few in which Harry Potter is the Older brother to a GWL. Is it possible that some could write such a story? It would be best if the Younger sister was possessive of Harry Potter. Whether she is a bro-con is up to you. It would be best if the Dumbledore was good the story. Misguided at worst. Weasly Bashing is fine.

Thank You


** A brother divided , it's not exactly what you want but it's a good read with Harry Neville and Harry's sister all being part of a prophecy, Harry's sister being a spoiled brat , James being a prat and Dumbledore being misguided
