I don't think I've really seen one of these. Plenty of male Harry slash. Some really excellent gay fem!Harry. Inwardtransience has that great fem!Harry that is basically trans-ish with a magical sex change. I've read a dimensional traveler fem!Harry + a Tonks of indeterminate/all gender. But no conventional heterosexual fem!Harry. Surely out a 1M fanfic they exist... right?
