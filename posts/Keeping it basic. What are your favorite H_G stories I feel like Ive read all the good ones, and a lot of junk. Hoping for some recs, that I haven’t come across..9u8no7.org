** Restless Heart Syndrome by Notadryeeye

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128715]]

This is a more obscure one, I think. As far as I know it's only on siye. It's not complete, and it doesn't leave off in the most fulfilling spot, but it's still an enjoyable read. Very well-written and a lot of character depth.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327), is an Epilogue compliant dimensional travel in which a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help. Ginny and Trio once more enter the breach and kick some serious asses.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958-16/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]] is a crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer in which Ginny gains the Slayer power during the Astronomy Battle. Voldemort figured out that good guys had a Slayer among them (but a Witch Slayer), so he raised an additional army of demons and vampires. Ginny led the Trio to fight this new threat and to hunt for horcruxes. It's actually my favorite 'Ginny joining the Trio in Year 7' fic.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is Hermione centric, but Ginny plays a far bigger role in this story than in canon, and she goes on ops with them in Year 7.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), is another Hermione centric fic. Harry and Ginny do play important roles, and this story's specialty is exploration of magical theories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is a pretty fun story, and Ginny does play a major role here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12773559/1/Secret-Love][Secret Love]], linkffn(12773559), is a slight AU with a smarter and more proactive Harry, especially after Year 6.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), remains pretty much the only non-crossover 'wizards in space' fic. It has some great ideas, but suffers from poor execution and a rushed ending.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  It was a surprise. They hadn't noticed a thing after Harry had broken up with Ginny at Dumbledore's funeral. They didn't expect their announcement at all. But then again, they had been quite blind before that time as well. Well, Harry and Ginny didn't let it bother them too much and simply did things their way. Harry / Ginny

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries. #1 of Elder Tales.
