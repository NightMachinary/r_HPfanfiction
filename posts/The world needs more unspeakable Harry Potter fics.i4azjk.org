** Counterpoint:

I really don't like the Unspeakables. Far too often, their magic borders on playing god and half of their fanon work fields are fringe horror, hell half of what we see of them in canon should not exist (brain-eating whatevers for example). Their magic also doesn't fit the rest of the HP universe thematically IMO (which is mostly about "direct effect" spells). It feels just out of place as the thought of Gandalf throwing killing curses around.

*** What's wrong with their magic, there's plenty of enchanted objects that do all sorts of random things, the nebulous defensive spells on Hogwarts, strange magical creatures created by wizards, there's Dumbledore's strange instruments, potions (and possibly rituals though they might actually just be fancy potions), stuff like Dumbledore sensing the magic of the boat etc. Not everything is point wand, shoot jet of light, something happens.

**** But neither is using mustard gas or biological weapons. I don't mind purely combat oriented spells one bit, but a lot of stuff usually associated with the unspeakables is really a case of "has science gone too far"? Stuff like the love room is already weird, but if you think about how prophecies get into the hall, well no possible answer is pleasant since it is total surveillance at best. Like, what are the weird brains for?

***** I get what you mean. First if you wanna discuss about more of combat and team and stuff here is a new and different post from me:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i4ne3v/witches_wizards_magic_and_society/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]]

And I wanna want more combat than science stuff. Maybe more science in the development on stuff for the combat team. Like the brains and stuff is just a distraction for the public?

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.
