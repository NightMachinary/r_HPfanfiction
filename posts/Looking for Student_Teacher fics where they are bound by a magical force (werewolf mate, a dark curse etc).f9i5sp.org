SS/HG and SS/RL are my favorites but I'm open to others. I've read bound to him, tortured hearts and the love you take... more please! The longer the better.

Disclaimer: My yuck may be our yum and vise versa, lets all be kind to each other. No one is ACTUALLY being victimized with fictional characters as long as we all understand it's fiction. Let it be.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/The-Apprentice-and-the-Necromancer][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]] This is a marriage law fic where Snape is tried for his crimes during the war. He's sentenced to life in Azkaban if he doesn't find himself a wife in 3 (I don't remember) years. So Hermione is determined to save him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9438349/1/Clash-of-the-Conjurers][Clash of the Conjurers]] This one is exactly what you described. Hermione is forced into a sexual relationship with Snape because Lucius Malfoy is a ... watcher. And in exchange he provides information for the Order.
