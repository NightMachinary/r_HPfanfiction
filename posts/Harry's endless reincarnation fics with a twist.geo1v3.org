You know the clich√© Harry dies and wakes up in his cupboard over an over again, so he gets a brlliant idea from one of Dudleys vidoegames, why not start speedrunning different aspects of his life? Destruction of Voldemort? Why not. Youngest master of alchemy ever? Sure. Fastest subjugation of the entire world? Sounds good.

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

** Harry was a strange boy, Arthur thought to himself. Whether it was his habbit of yelling "SKIP" at people trying to talk to him, or his strange ability to somehow be in just the right place and time to deal with problems before they escalated. He didn't deserve this though. Being put on trial in front of the entire Wizangamot for defending himself.

‚Äã

Just as they were getting towards the doors to courtroom 10, Harry suddenly made an abrupt turn and sprinted towards the department of mysteries. Arthur was too late to grab him before he'd slipped through the door. Following, he watched in horror as Harry got to a circular room, yelled "DEATH" and threw a bag through the door as it opened. There was a moment of silence, as Harry paused, then there was a horrible screeching sound and several black shadows were drawn through ceilings and... out of Harry's scar? And into what he now knew as the Veil of Death. He stood dumbfounded as Harry proceeded to take out a stopwatch and do some kind of happy dance.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

***** To be fair he gets less scared and less paranoid fairly quickly. I think the author tried to write it as if Harry was an eleven year old who kept getting killed which would fuck him right up rather than a teenaged eleven year old like most fics (if you know what I mean). He gets some people to train him up a bit in first year and toughens up from there.

****** Yeah I know that. And it also makes sense, because which eleven year old would not be scared if this was happening to them, but I still couldn't read all the angst.

Also I don't quite understand her choice in having Harry think that his relationships with some characters (like wood) would be the same after he essentially "reloads" at an earlier time, where he hadn't even met the guy yet and when he did things differently (and more violently) the second time around.

I kinda guessed from the summary, that he might toughen up a bit later on, but as I said, the angst and paranoia just got to me...

******* Stick with the story. It's very worth it and gets more satisfying as it goes on. It's one of those rare fics where Harry's skills do not feel unjustified at all and his behavior does not seem out of character.

Also, we as outsiders can understand that Harry's relationship progress would have reset after a reload, but look at it from an 11-year old boy's perspective who just got hit by this fact that one of his few friends is a complete stranger once again.

******* Yeah, that's fair. If you made it as far as the post-Wood reset and didn't like it then it's not worth carrying on with. TBH I think I read it live update-by-update so it could be much angstier than I remember when read all at once.

I can see why he had a great friendship with a character and would try to rebuild that after a reset only to find out he's too different for them to have the same relationship.

*** I love this one but it definitely needs a follow-up where Harry redeems himself and finally escapes the wheel of samsara.

**** Wouldn't that rather defeat the point? The endless futility is the whole idea of Sisyphus' fate.

That said, I'm not clear why anyone would condemn Harry to such a punishment.

***** Yes, but Sisyphus was being punished by the gods for greed, violence, yadda yadda. I don't think that story ever gave us a reason for Harry's endless looping. It also elided over things in a way that was stylistically appropriate but narratively /really/ unsatisfying - it just tells us that Harry can't escape Hogwarts, for example.

And the thing is, the whole time Harry seems to simply grow more experienced without growing wiser, more mature. He's stuck in a loop, not just of time, but the limits of his own personality, his own ego.

Maybe it's the hopeless optimist in me, but I'd like to think that basically anyone in that kind of situation would slowly develop a depth and wisdom that would help them reach some sort of transcendence - some sort of metaphorical nirvana that gets them to escape the cycle of suffering that is the world.

To me, that story very much feels like the first of what should be a two- or three-part story where Harry finally, /finally/, grows up instead of just growing old. It should end with him finally getting to just... die...

****** That rather reminds me of a scene from the end of the sequel to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], although it doesn't make proper sense (and has spoilers) if you haven't read the whole thing.

** THere's Sisyphus, which is actually kinda scary. Imagine being trapped over and over and over again.

** Forty One Times Dead, linkffn(6511737), does something similar.

It's a oneshot Bleach Crossover fic. Fed up with having to change the timeline after each and every one of Harry's (many) deaths a Shinigami trains him to actually fulfil his destiny.

Quite AU and depending if you like/know Bleach it might not be up to your liking.

  Harry has an annoying habit of dying before his time. After one death too many, the Soul Reaper assigned to the case decides to take matters in hand and train the Boy-Who-Lived up to scratch. Good thing he's already dead; 'cause this just might kill him!
