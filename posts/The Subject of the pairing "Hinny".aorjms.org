** Ah, what the heck. I'll bite.

#+begin_quote
  No. Just. No.
#+end_quote

If this is what counts as an opening statement, then you're not off to a good start.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sorry for those that like the "Hinny" pairing, but I just can't agree to it.
#+end_quote

Right, how dare we actually like canon. I'm sure you know better than Rowling.

#+begin_quote
  For one, there was actually talk in the book about her mother using love potions to snare Ginny's father.
#+end_quote

The scene in question is from /Prisoner of Azkaban/ and reads as follows

- Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a Love Potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.

First, there's no indication whatsoever that this is what led to Molly marrying Arthur. Judging from the giggling that Mrs. Weasley shares with Ginny and Hermione, I'm guessing things didn't end up how she had envisioned them, as a child.

And compare Arthur's interactions with Molly to what we see when Ron swallows a love potion. Arthur is benevolent and kind-hearted and devoted to his wife. Ron became fixated on Romilda, single-mindedly.

To think that Arthur's interactions with Molly are the result of a love potion is, frankly, asinine.

#+begin_quote
  For someone who never even thought of Ginny in such a way to react to her out of the blue? Seems pretty fishy to me.
#+end_quote

There's actually a scene in /Order of the Phoenix,/ where Ginny gives Harry one of the candy Easter eggs and Harry feels very odd. This is likely foreshadowing, albeit not very good foreshadowing.

And besides which, none of Harry's interactions with Ginny, not even the chest monster, match what we see when someone eats a love potion. Harry feels somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that he may be developing feelings for Ginny, and at first tries to convince himself that his feelings are just that of an elder brother.

That is so far removed from the infatuation Ron displays that it's not even funny.

#+begin_quote
  Two, Ginny had a very stalkerish fangirl vibe from the very beginning
#+end_quote

If you're referring to the scenes at the Hogwarts Express--she was ten, and Harry was the savior of the Wizarding World. In any case, it's a far cry from Fred wondering whether Harry remembered what Voldemort looked like.

Ginny realizes that Harry wants to be left alone and doesn't like attention much from near the beginning. As early as the Lockhart Incident in Florish and Blotts, Ginny recognizes that Harry is actively not seeking attention and tells off Malfoy.

Her infatuation at the Burrow--the elbow in the butter dish--read just as much as--if not more than--a little girl who crushes on her big brother's cool friend than a girl whose celebrity crush is staying with her family.

If you're referring to Valentine Incident--I'd like to point out that Ginny had poured her soul into the Diary for months at this point. It may not have been entirely her idea to send Harry a Valentine.

#+begin_quote
  Even at the end, I don't think she saw the true Harry, and as a little girl she wanted to be the wife of the Boy-Who-Lived.
#+end_quote

Is that why Ginny shouts at Harry when he believes himself possessed by Voldemort that he doesn't know what he's talking about?

Why Ginny snaps at Ron and Harry for their rudeness towards Hermione in the days before the Yule Ball?

Why Ginny insisted that she was old enough to accompany them to rescue Sirius, saying that Harry had no right to tell her no, as she was older than he was when he went after the Stone?

Why Ginny--albeit mildly--scoffed at Harry for trying to defend Fleur as "good enough to join the Triwizard"?

These are not the actions of a girl who dreams of marrying the Boy Who Lived.

#+begin_quote
  Three, did no one else notice that they were compared to Harry's late parents?
#+end_quote

This never happened in canon. You read too much fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  That's just really messed up! They make it out as if Harry would have had a thing for his own mother! That's gross!
#+end_quote

Finding a romantic partner that is somewhat similar to a parent is not inherently creepy, but that's not what happened anyway.

In canon--and this is actually what matters, not whatever fanfic you read, but the actual books--Ginny is not much like Lily at all.

Lily's hair is consistently described as dark red and her eyes are emerald green.

Ginny, like all the Weasleys, has flaming red hair. In short, her hair is lighter and brighter. If anything, she's a carrot-top.

Ginny's also consistently described as short and small. At first, this may just be because she's the youngest of the Weasleys but it continues up into Order of the Phoenix when Bellatrix taunts Harry about the Death Eaters torturing "the little girl," (despite Luna and Hermione being present) and Half-Blood Prince, where a vendor offers a medallion to Molly to "[her] little girl" and when Ginny comforts Harry after the battle "a much smaller and warmer hand enclosed his."

We're never given much attention to Lily's height but given that she's never described as much shorter than Severus or James whenever we get a glimpse of them as teenagers, we can reasonably assume she's at least of average height, if not slightly tall.

Then there's their personalities. Ginny takes after Fred and George in appreciating a practical joke and defying authority--though Umbridge being Umbridge, the scale may not be entirely fair. Lily despises the pranks the Marauders and pseudo-Death Eaters pull alike, though she does note that the Marauders don't use Dark Magic.

Ginny is also of a much quicker temper--when she sees someone she cares about get picked on, she's much quicker to intervene and she's not afraid to fight back. She has a well-earned reputation for the Bat-Bogey Hex. She stands up for Luna when classmates call her "Loony." Lily threatens to intervene when James attacks Severus, but we don't see her do so.

Ginny loves Quidditch, and Lily acts disdainfully towards James for thinking he's special because he can do tricks on his broomstick.

So, in short Lily Evans and Ginny Weasley no more resemble each other than, say, Seamus Finnigan and Draco Malfoy, as they both have blonde hair in the books.

So you can forget any idea that Harry and Ginny resemble James and Lily, since there's no foundation for it.

  Like I said, this is just my personal opinion on this pairing and these are only a few of my issues. Hate me if you want but you won't be changing my mind on this.
#+end_quote

Ah, so you've made up your mind completely? Then why even bother posting this?

** I mean... ok. If you're not going to change your mind I don't really see what the point of the post is. You're clearly not open to discussion.

But, as you mentioned my biggest pet peeve, please provide a part from the books, any part, where Ginny is compared to Lily. At all. Any part where anyone remarks on how they are similar will do.

****** Following your edit, I really think most of your post is from too much fanfic, or at least confusing fanon with canon.

There's no evidence that Ginny or Molly used a love potion on Harry. In fact, we have evidence they didn't- we know from canon love potion has to be given regularly, and Harry was separated from Ginny for the entire of Deathly Hallows, and he still very much missed her then. Also, when he realised he liked her, he hadn't just eaten or drank anythibg. I guess it's a fun fanfic plot if you're into that kind of thing, but it's not an argument against their canon relationship.

As for the hero thing, well yeah maybe if you want to think that fine. But I think a crucial aspect that everyone forgets is that Ginny HAS seen Harry as a hero when he rescued her from the chamber. And it wasn't glamorous or romantic. He wasn't a dashing hero, he was covered in grime and blood. All she wanted was her mum. She was embarrassed. She was so embarrassed it was several months before she could talk to him, but it broke the boy who lived myth for her. After that she gradually develops in confidence around him (though you will find very few Hinny supporters who deny it needed more) but she no longer treats him as anything special or legendary.

It's fine if you don't like the pairing. I'm not going to sit here and explain why I think they're a good match. But don't bash other people's preferences based on fanon.

** When were they compared to Harry's parents? And even if that happend. It definitely didn't happen because of the relation between Ginny and Lily. (There is no relation between the two at all. Only because they are redheads doesn't mean that they are the same)

It must have been because they got together so young. Just like Harry's parents.

Right? And remember who is also there when Molly talk about using love potion? */Hermione/*.

Do you think Ginny is able to brew love potion? Heck, if it's easy everyone at Hogwarts would use it everyday. Do you know someone talented in potion, even able brewing Polyjuice in her second year? */Hermione/*.

Do you know a girl that will do anything to get what she need? A girl who confunded Cormac Mclaggen only to get her crush on Quidditch team? */Hermione/*.

Obviously Ginny and Hermione conspire together to put love potion on Harry and Ron so they both end up with their crush. A giggling fangirl will not be able to brew a complicated love potion after all. I mean who doesn't want the Boy-Who-Lived and his best friend?
