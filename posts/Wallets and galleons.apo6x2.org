Has anyone ever noticed that dragonhide wallets seem to be common gifts in fanfics, and yet wizards carry neither cards nor cash. No IDs, no credit cards, no AAA card, and no cash. So what is the purpose of a wallet for a wizard???


** Because fanfic writers love Rule of Cool, and jingly little drawstring coinpurses aren't cool, even though they are the most practical way to carry coins.

Same reason why wrist-mounted wand holsters are common fanfic gifts, even though your average wand (10-13 inches) is longer than an eleven year old kid's forearm. Seriously, put a foot-long ruler next to your arm and you'll realize you wouldn't be able to bend your wrist with a wand strapped to it.

**** We do see something that looks like a wand holster in Hogwarts Mystery, and it's worn on the waist/hip [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/5/53/Rakepick2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180825231556][as seen here.]]

**** I quite liked in The One He Feared, Harry/Dumbledore would put his wand in a pocket dimension when he wasn't using it, then summon it back when needed. So it's like the wand disappears and then he just snaps his fingers to bring it back. I like something like that far more than wand holsters.

And you could even rationalize that it's not super difficult Wandless magic, because when he first puts the wand in the pocket dimension, he's using the wand itself to cast the spell. Then he just builds in the "Snap your fingers to bring it back" when he casts the initial spell, so it's not /truly/ wandless.

I could also see thin pockets being sewn into their robes. Maybe across the chest or at the hip. Or maybe robes have multiple options.

***** In the movies, the costume department sewed wand pockets on the inside of the robes to make it feel more in character. If you watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doxxfXqpKYA][*the PoA Boggart scene*]] carefully, at 2:09, Lupin draws his wand out from the inside of his robes.

Most of the teacher robes have special wand pockets included. If you buy the replica licensed Hogwarts student robes from Universal's Wizarding World, they also have thin pockets sewed on the inside of the chest, to fit the licensed wands. Knockoff eBay robes don't have them, or they're crooked/too small so the wand slips out when you walk around. (I know this from experience.)

This is my headcanon of how wizards carry their wands, instead of the wand holsters. Maybe they would be useful for dragon herders who need their wands at any moment, and don't wear conventional drapey robes, but the average wizard doesn't need them. Especially not an eleven-year-old First Year at Hogwarts.

****** Good pull with that scene. Wand pockets like shown in the clip seem the most practical, at least for every day uses.

I'm sure if you were a dedicated "combat wizard," or a dragon herder as you mentioned, then you would come up with something else.

*** And a fully grown man can't fit in a trunk just like 8 people can't fit in a tent that looks to be two person tent. I'm sold on wand holsters. Wands would be such an integral part of a wizarding society, I doubt it wouldn't be a thing.

Now, wallets? I'll give you that one. İt doesn't make sense most of all because the wizarding society has no paper currency so they would have no need to come up with wallets and with their allergy to the Muggle...

** would the problem of having empty dragon hide wallets be solved by simply making them like the money bags. More stylish and harder to loose as it would weigh significantly more than a silk bag.

Edit: fixed spelling error

*** I don't think so. The problem is that they're designed to hold cards and cash, and wizards use neither. Why would they even have come up with the idea of a folding flat pocket?

** Wallets don't mean JUST a flat folding money holder, that definition only came about due to paper money in the past two centuries(yes, i know countries like china had paper/silk money pver a thousand years ago but i meant widespread usage, not centralized). The etymology of the word comes from small bags or knapsacks. Take a look at a woman's wallet sometime as well.

Also, [[/u/4ecks]], remember, magicals have dimensional pockets. You can store a wand inside a freaking grain of rice if you wanted. Not that hard to have a wand holster built into a watch band or something.

**** My wallet has a pretty big section for different types of coins. It closes with a zipper. I wouldn't want to carry it in my pocket, so I carry it in my backpack. I think of it as a fairly normal wallet.
