can anyone recommend any fics that talk about or use the idea of subtle magic that people think are fairy tails or useless but are not or blatently dont know as their not commonly known about and if they are the mejority of people think like stated are fairy tails:

such as the idea of sleeping with money in a pocket on new years gives you good fortune for the year, catching a falling leaf in autumn gives you luck, making offerings to god and or magic to bolster your favour with them (people think that they are not real and magic is not an entity but something tobe used).

and then the whole misconceptions filling the world is like how i want a fic that has a nockturn alley that is not evil but an extreemly close knit 'family' who have seen to much to care what outsiders think about them.

the idea of wizarding traditions and religions fascinates me and love the idea as well as the aforementioned things that ive already talked about.

i got these ideas from the fic 'harry potter gets smart and takes control - the goblet' (the only one ive read so far of the series and i really like it) which talks about these things so if anybody has read it you will understand what i mean a bit more clearly.

thank you in advance for any sent fics.

Linking to simplify it for others; now I'm off to read it...

The title and summary have me cautiously interested but also wary. I do like Harry says '/no/' to the goblet fics... but well, I might come back to this post to add a 'review' later on... if I remember to.

*edit/review* as of ch16 out of 72: Harry's mistreatment is very through, Ron is Bashed!Ron but does not feature often nor is he concentrated on, Manipulative!Dumbledore seems to be the main antagonist but he too hasn't been a focus. The focus instead has been on Harry&Hermione collecting knowledge/strength and what I would call worldbuilding through listing what's been done to Harry while he works to escape it... right now I'm listening to a standardish helpful!goblins Gringots visit, with Lord-Hadrian-Potter-Slythering-Gryphindor being revealed...

So, while it's filled with tropes that to me indicate a skip... it's *actually good-ish* I think part of it is that it's so long, so while the tropes exist they are somewhat in the background.

  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid and constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up. This is a long and a slow build though, spanning most of the fourth year. There will be no over night changes, trauma recovery takes time, months. He's not going to wake up and start ass kicking the next day.

*** right, i understand. personally i really like the fic especially when it get to the point where he is meant to have the yule ball. wont describe for spoilers but that section is where i grew to adore the story. might not be some peoples thing but some of the ideas and concepts in it especially during said section i love and wish more people used at least a variant of in their works.

hope you have as good of a time reading it as i am having.

*** I remember dropping it because I felt like the author kept adding on to Harry's abuse without any resolution. It probably changed later in the story, or I hope so at least, but the story starting with 4th year Harry being as tall as a first year was already a major red flag for me.

**** nnn, sure i see where your coming from. if im right - because my memory is blanking - he just becomes more and more comfortable with or around people as that was the main external showing from his abuse, how uncomfortable he was with people.

i can understand why people wouldnt like the story but eh, certain sections in the story such as the time of the yule ball or winter break happens or his time in the forest with the dragons are what makes me think i really like this story instead of eh its alright i guess.

** There's a fic I can't currently find that's an AU with the Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel universe that's basically all about subtle magics and weird little beliefs about stuff. I'll repost if I find it. It's not marked as a crossover and I can't find where I bloody put the thing in my hundred-plus HP Fic sort-categories.
