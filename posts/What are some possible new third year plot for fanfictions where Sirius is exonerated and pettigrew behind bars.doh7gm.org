In many fanfictions that I have read, and in the fanfiction I plan to write, Sirius Black is exonerated with Pettigrew gone before the third year starts, and the story has a kind of gap between second and fourth year where nothing much happens. I was trying to think of what kind of events and overarching conflict would work best for an alternate third year, with several subplots if any come to mind. I'll accept either original ideas or ideas from established stories.

  where nothing much happens

That's not necessarily bad, you know. Skim through the year in two or three chapters and be done with it. Maybe Harry gets a date to Hogsmeade, maybe you write AU Quidditch matches, but that can already be it.

It's much more annoying to read through something which obviously is just filler material than to have a short year where not much happens. Especially since authors like to one-up canon and make their challenges much harder, which makes Harry surviving them very unbelievable.

** The main reason Prisoner of Azkaban is important in the larger narrative of the series is that it is the book where Harry connects to his parents in various ways.

He hears his parents in the vicinity of the dementors. He gets the marauders map. He talks with Remus and Sirius who are the best connections to his parents. He gets the closest thing to an adult figure who can assume responsibility for him.

The dementors are also tied in to the Quidditch sub plot.

If Sirius is freed and Peter arrested there is no reason for dementors to be at Hogwarts and no reason for Harry to learn the Patronus. There is probably no reason for his Nimbus to break and him getting the Firebolt. The mystery of Lupin being a werewolf also likely won't be that big a deal either.

So my answer would be what is important for the larger narrative. If dementors are going to be a big enemy then you want Harry to learn that spell. Harry is at his best when he is motivated (Expecto Patronum, Accio, Potions owl, DA, countless examples). If you want to focus more on his connection with his parents then that is what you can focus on.

There are some cool subplots in the book that you can expand upon. Buckbeak's execution subplot is one of those. You can have Harry take different classes like Ancient Runes and Arithmancy and take your narrative in a different direction. You can have Harry focus harder on Quidditch. Sirius can begin teaching Harry to duel.

You can introduce characters like Tonks, Luna, and Rita Skeeter early and expand on characters like Neville and Fudge. Romance is obviously an option but if you're sticking to canon Harry at the time of PoA is one oblivious idiot. Lots of directions you can go depending on what kind of tone and flavour you wish to have in your story.

** If Sirius is exonerated right before the year you can have Harry having to adjust to a vastly different guardian situation. Without worrying about a murderer being after him he may pay more attention to hermione and investigate why she's being weird. I also think living with Sirius would prompt him to try and become an animagus. If Sirius pushes Harry to try his best in school it could also cause drama between the trio.

** I read one like that where Harry was a prodigy with healing (I think it was parselmagic healing) and had accidentally created an antidote for werewolves when he broke the curse on a kid in the hospital. The conflict for that year ended up being against Fenrir Greyback and his pack of radical werewolves. It had the benefit of tying Lupin more closely to the story as well.

** PoA is more about the tragedy of the mauraders than it is about Harry and Voldemort, so if that story is a) much less tragic than it was in canon and b) already resolved, there's not a whole lot to work with there. That said, being that Harry had an encounter with a teenaged Voldemort the previous year, a plot about him seeing just how poorly he measures up and training like hell to try and bridge that gap could make a lot of sense. Basically, the idea behind linkffn(Forging the Sword), except that Harry isn't motivated by Ginny's death, but the trauma of nearly being killed and the realisation of how dangerous Voldemort truly is.

Also, fair warning to anyone who follows that link: the fic is abandoned. I know most people will have known that, since it's pretty commonly recommended on this sub, but I make it a point never to link abandoned fics without warning that they're abandoned.
