** ron calling hermione mudblood after they have been friends for years, because she refuses to date him. I seriously have seen this way too often and almost always drop the fic immediately. I can tolerate some amounts of bashing if the concept of the fic is interesting. but even in his worst moments ron wouldn't hurt a friend like that

There are little sprinkles of even the "blood-traitor" wizards using their abilities against muggles, or being exasperated with the inexperience some muggleborns have.

There's still a huge step between that and tossing what amounts to hateful racial sluts around.

****** The only list I ever made was one about Dumbledore's faults because someone asked. And my opinion on Ron is not as black and white as it may seem. I see that Ron, as a person is not bad. And if things go well he can be a good friend of Harry. But because Harry is anything but normal he and Ron are simply not a good match. Harry, having Voldemort after him, needs friends that would move the world for him, like Hermione who erased herself from her parents' memory to join the hunt. Hermione did not run away while wearing the Horcrux. And I doubt that Luna would have.

But my main problem with Ron is that people either see him as a retarded moron (your generic Weasley bashing fic) or the perfect bro. Ron (and the Weasleys in general) have many faults that are simply looked over because the narrative is a children's book. Let's look at Ron third year. Yes, he stood in front of Harry when Black confronted them. But he also was a giant arse to Hermione in that book. Over a rat he didn't like in the first place. In book four he is not treating Hermione any better. I don't see him as a deserter (although a political commissar might disagree) but as someone who had bully-like tendencies. Having my share of real life experiences with such people I despise that type, fictional or not.

My dislike for Ron is not based on the desertion in book seven, it's based on books three and four (and the flying car idea. That was suicidal). It's the many small things that add up to an ugly big picture and they outweigh the good. And the epilog just rubs salt in that wound.

******* I disagree about Ron not liking Scabbers. He was an 11 year old boy who knew he had a second hand pet, who was nothing special, who was even less desirable than a toad. To walk around displaying how proud he was of the pet was just asking to be mocked.

Kids don't display how they really feel about things very well. Especially when pride becomes involved. I think there was a form of affection between Scabbers and his owners - I know Scabbers wasn't a proper rat, but they're still great pets. Scabbers defended them from Crabbe and Goyle - granted it wasn't much, but it was a sign he felt some sort of protectiveness towards Ron. You don't sleep with a pet in your bed every night without bonding.

Plus, boys aren't supposed to have feelings towards things. They get embarrassed about being kissed goodbye, and having their face wiped of smudges, and having a rat who didn't do anything exciting. Neville was mocking for a)having a toad, and b)obviously caring about him. If Ron walked around with Scabbers and showed how much he thought of him, Malfoy and Snape would target him for sure.

Remember he had a chance to get a new rat. One that was magical and could do tricks and looked cool. He chose to get potions to help sick Scabbers, but wasn't even able to explain properly to the others why he kept him.

Hermione didn't understand, because she was a teenage girl, and was all about cuddling Crookshanks in public. She was out of order, he was out of order. Firstly, she has magic, she should have figured out a way to keep him out of the boys dormitory, gone to a prefect or Head of House to sort it out. She cannot have been the only cat owner in Gryffindor, yet neither Ron nor Percy seemed to have had a problem. Secondly, he owned a small edible pet, he should have had a large cage for Scabbers when he was not around.

********* 1) if Ron did, Percy did it first. This is highly unlikely. I think it's probable that it was an oversight on JK's part, that the editors never caught. And the letter is slightly ambiguous, it's possible that maybe you can't bring both an owl/toad/cat with another pet? So if Harry wanted two owls, or an owl and a cat, he would be told to choose.

Who knows. But Lee had a spider, and Ginny later had a pygmy puff, so I don't think 'well Ron broke the rules by having him anyway' is a good defense as to why his pet should be eaten.

2)Hermione did everything wrong. Granted, she was under a lot of stress, but she was quite insensitive about Lavender's rabbit (it's perfectly natural to worry that something might happen to your brand new baby pet when you have to leave it behind, and your parents/younger sibling might forget to feed it or let it escape), and about the danger Scabbers was in. Her cat attacked another pet in front of her several times and she refused to admit he was wrong, claiming that's what cats do. Despite no one else's cat attacking Scabbers.

Hermione wasn't perfect, and one of her faults was to refuse to admit when she might be wrong. Crookshanks was mostly responsible for Scabber's disappearance. Ron wasn't completely wrong. Hermione was in denial about what her pet did - which is actually fairly natural, it's hard to come to terms with a pet who's killed another pet. But Harry, who was pretty objective on the pet front, both knew that Ron would be very upset when Scabbers would die, and thought that Crooks had eaten Scabbers. No one else thought that Scabbers was hiding under a bed.

Also, she completely ignored him when he pointed out that Crookshanks was not behaving as a normal cat (he heard me say Scabbers was in my bag!), which tbh, I suspect that he WAS trying to make them realise something was wrong. After all, he knew he wasn't supposed to eat him, so there was no point in catching him.

Now, Ron wasn't perfect. There was fault on both sides. But you can't say 'she was right after all therefore she did nothing wrong'. She didn't know that Crookshanks was part Kneazle (though she should have, especially being friends with Hagrid), and she didn't know Scabbers was Peter. She genuinely thought he was just an elderly rat. She actually knew that her cat was chasing this rat. Yet even if Scabbers had been hiding in the walls, that's not the point. The point is, her pet was still responsible for driving her best friends' dying pet away. Scabbers was having a daily potion for goodness sake!

********* 1) I don't think so. The preferred reading of the "cat OR toad OR owl" line is that if you're only allowed to have one of those three, but that you otherwise have free reigh --- as long as you don't have, say, both a cat and an owl, nothing forbids you from having a rat, a snake, an anteater and a Komodo Dragon on top of your owl. Naturally, this is a broken, nonsensical rule, but most ruels in Wizarding Britain are broken and nonsensical and because Voldemort aside, basically any resulting problems can be fixed with magic, it doesn't matter.

******* Firstly, fair enough, it just seems from your vocabulary that you /really/ don't like Ron, but if you say it's more complicated than that, so be it.

Without turning this into too much of an anti/pro-Ron discussion (I've definitely failed there), I do see for sure where you're coming from, but equally so I can see why many people forgive his shortcomings. Ron was undoubtedly an asshole to Hermione for a good portion of Prisoner of Azkaban and for the whole Yule Ball stuff in Goblet of Fire, and any objective person would just tell him to calm down and stop being a dick about everything - conversely, however, Ron isn't objective, and indeed nor is Hermione. I've been in situations where I've taken the place of Ron, and thought that events have revolved around me and that I'm owed apologies or deference from others, and /no/ amount of people telling me that I was being self-centred or otherwise actually made me /understand/ how I was really behaving, and for that I can easily look at Ron's douchebaggery and let it mostly slide. I argued /way/ more with my housemates at university than with my friends when I was at secondary school, and over trivial things, too, so his continuous proximity to his friends, even when he's got issues with them, probably makes it harder to deal with.

I think in another life Ron could've definitely been a bully, but I don't think by his own volition - I think that he'd need to have fallen in with a bully to really compound that kind of behaviour into his personality, since so much of his identity is built around his relationship to others.

Flying car was in a children's book, and can't easily be examined in the context of real people and real life - it was a moment of wonder and also peril for the reader, nothing more and I think if Chamber of Secrets was written with adults in mind that whole part wouldn't have happened.

I think your opinion of the epilogue though is way too severe - the real issue is how Rowling treated muggles, like they're second class citizens to wizards. What Ron did was wrong for sure, but as many others have said the problem is that no one (not even Harry) seem to care. The potential for racism that you describe is true in not just Ron, but the wizarding world in general, and it was made worse through things like Harry /not/ getting with a non-magical character in the end - the whole thing about blood and everything not mattering, and yet all the characters end up married to other witches and wizards, and make light of using spells on muggles for convenience.

******* I think that you're entitled to your own opinion about Ron, no matter how strong it may be.

However, I do think you might be seeing it from only one point of view. To take one of your examples, third years with Scabbers and how he acted towards Hermione. Do you not see that Ron wasn't the only one that was acting like a jerk? If Crookshanks was my cat, I would be freaking horrified that it ate someone else's pet. I would have kept my cat somewhere more secure or at least done /something/. Hermione was a jerk right back at Ron during the whole situation.

No one is perfect but also no one is purely terrible. I believe Ron is a good person who sometimes acts like a bad person. Same as the rest of the world.

Of course, I have a lot more trouble with how these kinds of stuff are done in bad fanfics. What's interesting is the consequences of it. If you're just using it to go 'Ron the death eater', it's indeed completely stupid, but there most likely are other routes that could be interesting.

But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Any "Hermione gets accidentally pregnant" story. You either have to turn her into a ditzy perversion of her original character or it happens for no discernable reason at all - and all that just for silly pregnancy drama. She's the last person that I can imagine this happening to. Even if she doesn't know about an awesome contraception spell/potion, she's still a muggleborn and certainly got the talk from her Dentist parents - who are HEALTH PROFESSIONALS - and if she isn't on the pill knows how to use a condom. NO. just no.

I like to call it the "Ginny-fication of Hermione" trope. There's a neat little one-shot that addresses a different aspect of the same problem: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3292515/1/Duty]]

- B) “a wizard who thinks half-bloods \ muggle-borns are inferior to A)”;
- C) “a wizard who thinks muggles are inferior to A) and\or B)”;
- D) “a wizard who thinks the traditions should be maintained for whatever reason”;
- E) “a wizard who believes muggles are a threat to wizardkind and that something must be done about it”, etc, etc.

I agree that it's not very likely. But I wasn't saying it was /unlikely/ --- I was saying that it wouldn't necessarily be out of character.

Hell, if I replace the too-general “pureblooded Death Eater” in your first comment with “canon version of Lucius Malfoy”, it just turns into something that I'll agree with.

If I rephrase the point I was trying to make as a logical statement, it will look something like this: “In the set of wizards^{1} who are A) and E), there are at least some for whom it would not be out of character to ‘say or understand some muggle culture reference'.”

For instance, imagine a nonconformist pureblood that despises traditionalist views and values, is fascinated with muggle culture and not ashamed of it, /and/ simultaneously finds muggles to be so dangerous that he thinks they all should be eventually exterminated. Would he have a convoluted personality? Yes. Would that be a self-contradicting personality? No. Could this character be making muggle-culture references without getting OoC? Yes.

That's pretty much all I'm saying, though other examples could be made too, of course (e.g. A + E + F:“a traditionalist wizard”).

Whether or not will the story's author manage to insert the cultural references tastefully is another matter entirely --- in many poorly written books there are references to pop culture that are annoying to read even when they're not OoC for the characters making them.

** In Firebird Trilogy Harry has a harem and Luna's his “first wife”.

There's a scene in one of the books where Luna orders a punishment for Hermione because Hermione messed up and sleeped with Harry out of her turn. It's so bizzare and out of nowhere that it gave me-the-reader a whiplash. Pretty much everybody involved in that scene was acting severely out of character. Luna for being so vicious and vindictive, Harry for being ok with it and not speaking up, Hermione for being accepting of the issued punishment --- especially since she was initially forced to join the relationship by the circumstances and didn't really want to be a part of it.

It was like the author wanted to make fun of all the bad BDSM tropes that are a thing in Shades of Grey or some youtube personality controversy, only you suddently realise that the author you're reading is being totally serious.

That story has great worldbuilding, plot, character designs, etc --- but the sexual dynamics in it are so bad I usually avoid recommending it even when it matches an OP's request very well.

The Firebird Trilogy looked to be different though. I read through the first story in fascination -- yeah, the story was a little too dystopian, the female characters a little too villainous and Harry a little too passive, but it was a great depiction of the alternate universe. Finally, I thought, a harem fic that's actually good!

And then the second book started, and everything got STUPID. The final straw for me was when Luna insisted on going naked and calling it "skyclad" -- I was just, nope. I'm done. I don't care of "skyclad" is an actual word, it has absolutely no business being in a Harry Potter fic, and even less business being spoken by a nudist Luna.

Thanks for the correction, it's been a while since I've read that story.

The gist of my criticism still stands, however. The overreaction in that scene was notched up to an apocalyptic eleven, and no one of the characters involved in it reacted the least bit reasonably or in congruence with their pre-established selves.

Luna's reaction was at least a little less incongruent than that of the others (given how she was trained by her parents in the “olde ways“ or whatnot), but the quality of her retaliation was still over-the-top, despotic, insane.

When you see how petty he is towards a teenage how satisfated he can be when he manages to screw him no matter how you look at it it's rather pathetic and unsettling for someone of his age. From an extern POV you could almost say he considers and treats Harry like a nemesis (obviously due to James) which is kind of problematic.

I won't talk about his unrequited love for Lily which crippled him more than anything or about the fact he is a child bully.

So to respond to you, I truly don't see canon Snape in any kind of stable relationship although that is just my opinion.

***** I see. But I want to believe that with the right circumstances, anyone can change. As I said, a present-day, still-Harry-hating Snape won't be very sane at all, but if A) he had this issue worked out and B) he didn't have to work as a spy anymore (the only reason he's a professor, which he hates, hence the child-bullying), then he'd have a shot. You say he has no love experience (aside from his friendship with Lily, where it's arguably just a friendship and nothing more for Lily), and that might be true... but there's a first time for everything, isn't there?

** Harry saying "Oh no you didn't" in a very overly feminine tone. It happens quite a bit, even in Lesser Evils, and it genuinely annoys me, it's the type of thing that can completely destroy immersion. There's also something to be said about Hermione "reading up on Pureblood Law and Etiquette". I've honestly grown to understand that Pureblood Law is another word for "I honestly don't know what I'm doing or how politics works, so I'll just create a patriarchal society". While there's nothing wrong with giving a world flaws, I think that attempting to make Britain seem broken and in need of some Mudblood healing is pretty disingenuous to pretty much every character except Hermione.

** Any Harry or Hermione/ Death Eater stories. Just no. The Death Eaters basically used the Nazi textbook on how to persecute a minority. They are not some misunderstood, tragic figures, they are monsters. Neither Hermione nor Harry would want to have anything to do with them.

Pairings with Snape, well, besides the reason mentioned above Snape seems to have poor personal hygiene. If someone always has greasy hair you probably wouldn't want to touch him with a ten foot pole, much less be intimate.

And Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco won't work either because by third year there's too much water under the bridge.

I think it can work post-Hogwarts, like when they're in their 30s or something. I think Hermione in particular could feel sympathetic towards a guy who showed genuine regret for his youth and tried to make amends in the last decade

*** Don't generalize. Snape and Regulus are proof that some of the DEs were coerced into the whole thing and, while not angels by any means, are quite capable of redemption under the right circumstances. Saying Death Eaters cannot be anything else than monsters is, in fact, bordelrine racist. (That is not to say that I support Harry/ or Hermione/DeathEater pairings. Just that it doesn't mean the Death Eaters are soulless abominations by nature.)

Also, that comment on Snape's greasy hair could be seen as kind of offensive. Aren't ugly people allowed to find love by virtue of being ugly? Not to mention nothing indicates young Severus was already so unkempt, which could take that argument out of a Marauders-era pairing involving him. (Again, not to say I especially /like/ to read Snape shipping. But I don't think it's a jarringly OOC thing.)
