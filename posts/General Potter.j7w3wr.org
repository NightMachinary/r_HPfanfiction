Harry is a reincarnated General from World war ii. He gets his memories in fifth year and he turns Dumbledore's Army into something much more grand


** Harry was stood behind a table in the Room of Requirement as the last person entered and approached. With a flick of his wand he sent a list of offensive spells from the stack in front of him to each of the members of this new study group.

Some looked shocked, some appalled, some even had a green tinge about their face, at what they were reading.

"Cutting... severing...?" "Blasting? Piercing?" "Bone breaker...?"

Their murmuring rose a to a din.

"Whoa I don't want to kill anyone!!" "I just want to protect my home and my family!" "What about defensive warding, or shields?" "I thought we'd be learning to defend ourselves, our homes!" "What about defending the school?"

A loud bang as Harry's fist hit the table silenced everyone. "Defend, defend..." he muttered in the quiet, seemingly to himself. He looked at them then, and his eyes seemed to burn. "Nobody ever defended anything successfully; there is only attack and attack and attack some more. They will come, and your wards will be breached, your shields will break, and your defenses will crumble. You may think to yourself 'at least my defenses gave my friend, my sister, my brother, my parents the time to escape,' but then you die, and that's WRONG! The object of war is not to die for your [cause] but to make the other bastard die for his."

*** Hermione: "I've seen this quote somewhere before. Harry, where did you get it from? You don't strike me as the type who reads up military history."

Harry: "It happens I did! Voldemort's return has completely changed the game. It's war now, and we shall prepare accordingly. A pint of sweat now will save a gallon of blood later! Untutored courage is useless in the face of educated bullets, eh, I mean curses."

*** Then he turns wizarding Britain into his own fascist state, because Rommel apologists always seem to forget that he served the Nazis loyally for many years.

** I'm not sure that would actually be a boon.

A general is an upper command position, which means a lot of experience both on battlefield, with tactics and strategy, and off it, with politics and bureaucracy. Unfortunately, such thing would also include years upon year of dealing with trained, disciplined troops and possibly tarnish his canon charisma (by removing the One Of Us factor). Depends on the degree of bleed through, I guess.
