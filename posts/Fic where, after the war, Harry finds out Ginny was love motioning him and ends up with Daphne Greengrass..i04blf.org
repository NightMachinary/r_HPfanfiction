Edit: Love potioning, not motioning. I can't edit the title, unfortunately.

It was definitely on FFN, as that was the only place I read on back then. I'm pretty sure Harry was being treated after a fight as an Auror when they found Amortentia (or another love potion, maybe) in his system. Somehow or the other (this is where my memory of the fic really gets foggy) he meets Daphne and they end up together. Hope this is enough to go off of.


** It's called “A Blessing In Disguise” and yes you are right, it's on FanFiction.Net
