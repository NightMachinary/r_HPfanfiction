:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I read a fic a while ago, I think it might have been Harry/harem, but I remember Harry and hermione having a big row with Ron in grimould, where It was decided that it was okay for hermione to sleep with Harry while dating Ron as long as she still slept with Ron or something. I think Tonks was there too at some point


** The story is likely "Searching For The Power" by GinnyMyLove. It definitely has this scene.
