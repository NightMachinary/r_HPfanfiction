I've read a couple fics lately that don't have many views or likes, but are still quite entertaining. For example, I just read linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain]]) and was very quickly hooked.

I've been enjoying a lot of darker stories lately, but am open to other recommendations. So, what are your favorite low traffic fics?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort won't kill his Horcrux and Harry can't die any other way. Enter twenty years later and explore the new world. Told from Neville's POV but still very much Harry's story.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431269][Saturdays are for Football (The Rest of the Week is for Everything Else)]] linkao3(431269) is a really unique post-war fic, featuring two less common characters (Dean Thomas and Blaise Zabini).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3366683][the war is over and we are beginning.]] linkao3(3366683) is also a post-war fic, this time with Andromeda.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) is very short, but an excellent Dumbledore character study.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5354324][Reindeer Games]] linkao3(5354324) is a silly James/Lily fic, just in time for Christmas, and I find it hilarious that any fic could get jossed by /The Tales of Beedle the Bard./

** *The Serpensortia Series*

Just an AU where Harry isn't entirely clued up on the houses and doesn't meet Ron quite as quickly as in the books. So he has no qualms when the hat suggests Slytherin. Nothing crazy, just a different sort of life.

I really liked how Harry was wrote, he very much just came across as a clueless child. His reaction to the hat suggesting Slytherin is literally /Um, fine? Anything's fine, really. Um. Thank you?/

** *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][Holly at Hogwarts]]*

It's a next generation series focusing on Dudley's daughter Holly going to Hogwarts in the same year as Albus.

It's one of my top favorite post-canon series of all time, mostly because it manages to stay close enough to canon to feel authentic, while at the same time introducing enough new and original ideas to recapture that feeling of wonder and discovery you get from reading the books for the first time, which is something that is usually missing from stories focusing on the children of any of the canon couples.

It's also currently sitting at just 55 kudos which is positively criminal.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** I definitely have to say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12858961/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] by Red Garden Gnome. It's a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger story about the two of them taking up teaching posts at Hogwarts a year or two after the war (him Care of Magical Creatures and she Defense Against the Dark Arts). This story is different due to the fact Charlie and Hermione hate each other at the beginning of the story. Most stories involving them having them hooking up and having hardcore sex in Chapter 1. But their personalities are more drawn out here and explored. It's told from Charlie's POV. It's my favorite story involving them.

  Ghosts weren't meant to be dangerous, they'd said. Ghosts were kind, friendly creatures who taught you History of Magic or celebrated their Death Day in the Great Hall to much cheering and applause. Ghosts gave you important hints. No witch or wizard ever told their child scary ghost stories, because the idea was less threatening than the idea of doxies in the curtains. The things that people had done to other people in the last decade far outweighed any heightened sense that there might be something more than met the eye. Ghosts were harmless. Benevolent. Typically quite cheerful.Unfortunately, they had gotten it wrong.
