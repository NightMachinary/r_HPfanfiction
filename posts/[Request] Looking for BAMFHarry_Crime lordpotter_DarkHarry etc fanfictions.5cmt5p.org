As an avid fanfiction reader, I read around 6-9 fanfictions within a week depending on the length of them. Because of this, I find myself lacking good things to read.

I'm an extremely picky reader. The story has to have logic, it has to make sense, the characters have to be realistic etc. I can't stand when dark!Harry books go on to say how everybody is against him for seemingly no reason.

Anyway, I'm looking for a Darker Harry (Politician!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Crime Lord!Harry, Abandoned!Harry, Wrong BWL!Harry, Slave!Harry etc) I have a preference for smarter dark!Harry. Twinfics are alright, I don't like how similar they are (And dare I say, cliche?) however, I will read them. I don't mind romance and I have no triggers, so don't hesitate on sending the most messed up stuff I suppose.

I'm looking for stories such as the ones below. All of which I believe are incredible reads. (Third one is nsfw just a warning)

** WBWL!Harry: *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569)

Smarter Dark!Harry: *Broken Chains* and its sequel *The Stars Alone*, linkffn(12040341;7718942)

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning) may be the best Dark!Harry fic in the fandom.

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has the vibes, though they don't show up until the later books and it's never explicitly stated as such - that's actually a good thing here.

And just because I literally just updated my WIP and I'm feeling bold, self-plug: linkffn(Lesser Evils)

*** I read your longer story. While the drama gets a bit too much and your own preference towards wanting Harry to lose shows blatantly at times, it is a fairly decent read, and improves towards the latter half.

**** It's not that I want Harry to lose, it's that he has to lose to learn his limits. Having him score a win after win would turn the story into Divided and Entwined, a borefest where there's no peril to the protagonist.

Okay, so I want him to lose, but it's for a good reason. He'll be losing less the better he gets.

Good point about drama - cliffhangers for example are a regular occurrence and it's been pointed out to me that the saturation of punchy scenes attributes to tiring the reader and the scenes are prone to steal the thunder from each other, but it's the plot I decided on - stuff must always be happening.

***** You're the writer, so what you do is up to you, but I do have a single bit of advice. You can freely ignore it if you want.

Having Harry score loss after loss after loss the way you've done will do more to turn your story into a borefest than a win after win ever will. I encourage pacing out the wins, but just beware of crossing the line of hurting the character just for the sake of it. Right now, you're walking that line. Putting down the character repeatedly with no significant payoff is not only boring, but it can also frustrate your readers.

Good luck with your writing.
