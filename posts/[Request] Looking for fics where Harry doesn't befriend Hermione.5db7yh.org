** *A Cadmean Victory*, linkffn(11446957), feels like a 'Dog ate Dog' world. No character is likable, and [[/spoiler][Fleur killed Hermione in the end]].

*Finding a Place to Call Home*, linkffn(9885609): Abandoned by all his friends, Harry ran away with Astoria before the first task of TWT and never looked back again.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), bashes almost everyone in magical Britain, Hermione included.

*Rise of Wizards*, linkffn(6254783): They fought each other for more than a century after their friendship broke. That Harry was so unlikeable that I hoped Hermione would win in the end.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

*** I don't think we have the same taste :p In Rise of Wizards I liked Harry a lot and couldn't like Hermione (as always)

But thanks a lot for the three other fics, I'm going to try them

** Does it seem relevant that Harry rejects Hermione more often in stories where Harry goes dark? It's like rejecting Hermione is linked to rejecting ethics or morals or something. Also prevalent is fem!Harry.

Try Alexandra Potter by Taure (you'll have to google for his google docs archive, as he recently took down his works in planning for extensive revisions... or a career in politics.

Also the Black Queen series by Silently Watches qualifies.

*** Well I'm not a fan of fem!Harry but I will give a try. And you are right it's an interesting thought.

By the way if you have others but with a male Harry don't hesitate

  At the end of the triwizard tournament, during Voldemort's Cruciatus Harry decides he is tired of being weak. He is tired of being a pawn, he is tired of being used. He doesn't think anything will happen but a voice answers, giving him hope for something different. Hope for power; regardless of how malevolent and dark it is. (Dark/Evil Harry) (Pairings TBD)

There again I suppose it was for the Greater Good
