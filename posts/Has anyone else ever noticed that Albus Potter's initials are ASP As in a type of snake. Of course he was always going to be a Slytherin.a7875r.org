** I personally don't like that he's a Slytherin. He didn't want to be there and I don't see why he would suddenly change his mind. I don't think he has any Slytherin traits at all. (and neither does Scorpius tbh)

I think that Rowling just kinda regretted the way she wrote Slytherin. In the books it's nothing more than the House of the bad guys and the racists and I don't think it was ever intended to be anything more. Even the "good" Slytherins are very morally ambiguous. However, now after the works have already been finished, she supports nonsense like the Cursed Child or that Merlin was a Slytherin in order to convince us that it's a normal House like all others, when in the books it obviously isn't.

*** I was gifted a Slytherin t-shirt, which I wear as a conversation piece, to discuss how poorly the houses, and especially Slytherin, were depicted. House of the cunning and ambitious? Containing /Crabbe and Goyle/?

Dumbledore is and has always been quite a lot more ambitious than Draco Malfoy, who has no real goals, no particular subtlety, and who relies on his father for everything.

On the whole, I think Romilda Vane's stunt with the spiked chocolates demonstrated more actual cunning than the whole six years of bullying from Slytherin.

I recall a fanfic having it's Hermione state that it should really be defined by being the house of social darwinism, which I think kinda works.

*** Rowling is not Tolkien or Martin, she thinks up stuff as she wrote it without the extensive lore that goes into solid worldbuilding. Therefore we get inconsistencies galore. Remember how bent out of shape Harry got that he lost 2 points in his first week?

**** I don't think that's really an inconsistency. Harry was a kid who just arrived to school. Of course he's going to worry about it at first. Have you never worried about what was ok and what wasn't at a new place of work or school? I know I do plenty of things at work I didn't dare to do when I first started.

**** JKR is pant at consistency but sometimes she also lets nice hidden things like Trelawney "divining" that Harry is born in the middle of Winter but in reality more likely detecting Tom's soul shard and getting Tom's birth date.

And that's only one of the many hidden things. Sometime well hidden (Dumbledore first to stand (POA) and to die (HBP) from the table of thirteen), sometime not so much (/cough/ Remus Lupin has something to do with a wolf?).

But yeah consistency isn't really her thing but that's the problem of incremental writing and on the other hand all the missing things let that much possibilities for fanfics writers.

You say this as if it wasn't intended to be very obvious. Remus Lupin is the thing that's supposed to distract you from the actual mystery of the novel, making you think you have it all figured out.

It's not exactly a Red Herring. It is a real mystery, just one that's intended to distract.
