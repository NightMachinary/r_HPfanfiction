This was a fic I read about 5+ years ago where Hermione is captured and slowly turned to the Dark side. She falls in love with Voldemort and is his dark queen. She is beautiful and terrifying, wears long Grecian gowns, and is adored by the Death Eaters, including Severus and Draco. It was at least a trilogy, with the 3rd part in Progress when I lost track of it.

At one point Voldemort tests Hermione by capturing Ginny and someone else (Ron?) and he makes her choose which one to kill (she chooses Ginny). I believe Voldemort technically dies at the end of the second story, and Hermione is hellbent on finding Horcruxes to bring him back. That was the big thing at the start if the 3rd story.

I know this was a rambling mess, but I hope these details help! I believe I found this on fanfiction.net, but I could be wrong.

Any info would be fantastic, thanks in advance!

Sigh... Why does it always have to be this way?

By the sound of it, it's a perfect opportunity to take over the movement and to get to set the agenda for once, but *noooo*, she has to stick by her man. :(

I mean, unless it turns out that she is actually looking for Voldemort's horcruxes in order to Fiendfyre them. That'd be cool.

*** LOL I know :-( I think that's why I loved this guilty pleasure story though. And who knows, maybe she was swayed to the Light in the end?

Who says anything about being swayed to the Light? Destroying Voldemort's horcruxes is just eliminating competition.
