Do you have a fic that leaves you feeling conflicted? Maybe it's a ship you usually hate but the story is so well written you enjoy it anyway, or it's a cliche-ridden story packed with Mary Sues yet you can't stop reading.

I think mine would be A Butterfly Effect by SlyGodess. It's really well written, the characters seem real, the plot is great.

But, all of the characters are very over-sexualised, especially considering they're only just hitting their teenage years. It just gets a bit squicky.

Discuss!


** Think many Dramione stories...somehow I bought into Fanon Draco while overlooking the fact that whether you like him or not in Canon Draco is a huge bigoted asshole. In 'Breath mints and battle scars' Hermione hits him a few times and yet they have a relationship, which left me feeling mixed, and in 'Isolation' she comes across weaker than she is in Canon, but found it quite an engaging read, I'll still read the fics.

Oh yeah and 'Wedlocked,' which is a marriage law one with Hermione/Sirius. It was a fairly engaging read and I enjoyed it but also felt/feel a little conflicted bc Hermione is 17 and Sirius is 37 in it, and also her marrying her friend's parent figure. So she becomes her best friend's godmother.

I don't think that's how godparents work, Harry's godmother, if he has one, would have been decided when he was born, and I don't think the title is conferred to spouses like aunt/uncle is.

But the rest of it I fully agree with, Hermione getting with Sirius in the canon setting is icky.

** Harry Potter and the Method of Rationality. It's not particularly faithful to the books, not particularly well researched, and it's nakedly self-serving propaganda. Harry's personality may as well be a self-insert Mary Sue.

But there's some pretty good humor, a very consistent storyline, and some of the best time-travel internal consistency. I enjoyed my first read-through. Subsequent read-throughs have become a slog.

** Many mass-favourited Honks fics. They tend to follow a similar formula or are very much clich√© filled and have cringe romances and dialogue, but Harry/Tonks is rare enough that you have to take almost anything out there.

** Blood Crest. It's probably one of my favorite stories, and the idea of exploring Dark Magic and Necromancy is appealing, but lately, I have a feeling like the plot is moving at a snail's pace, and Harry's growth seems to be stunted when it comes to his personality.

** Prince of Slytherin is a fic that I find /unbearably/ dull (just to give an idea of how poorly it spends its time, it at one point spends multiple paragraphs detailing the musical tastes of a tertiary character with no relevance to the core plot and no meaningful relationships with any characters who are actually relevant to the story before stopping to explain the history of Paris' magical community, information that, as yet, has had no bearing on or relevance to any of the fic's actual events, for several more paragraphs), but I still read every update as soon as it comes out.

Don't ask me why, 'cause I really don't know . . .
