At this point, I don't even care about the setting as long as they're still witches and wizards. Can be a short crack fic or a serious multi-chapter story as long as it's well-written and not Super!Harry cringe. Don't rec me crossovers, I already looked there.


** One of my readers said my story has a Downton Abbey feel, although I haven't seen the show so I can't confirm.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
