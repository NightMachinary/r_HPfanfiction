I don't remember much about the fic, just that he has the dream, wakes up, and gets the DA to cause huge racket and overall be a distraction so that he can get to grimmauld. Maybe he sneaks into a professor's room to use the Floo or something.

Harry gets to grimmauld and I remember him shouting something like "Sirius! Dumbledore! Remus! Bloody anyone!" He finds Sirius there. At some point Dumbledore arrives, so Harry tells him about the dream. Dumbledore plans to go see if there's anyone at the Department of Mysteries to reverse-ambush, and Harry stuns Sirius so that he can't go along.

Does anybody recognize this fic?

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..
