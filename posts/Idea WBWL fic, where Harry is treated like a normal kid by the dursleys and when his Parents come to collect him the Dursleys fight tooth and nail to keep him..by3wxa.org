Maybe Petunia doesn't care that Harry's a wizard she could feel that he's an outcast in his own family like she was with hers (maybe her parents showered Lilly in praise for her magic and ignored Petunias mundane achievements because of it)

So when the Potters come to collect Harry from the Dursleys instead of finding him abused they find him happy and calling himself Harry or Henry Dursley and he refuses to leave with them.


** I'm pretty sure I've seen this somewhere; I don't remember the rest of the plot, but I recall that James Potter wanted Harry back after he showed signs of magical ability (maybe he was thought to be a squib before? I don't remember), and threatened the Dursleys in some way (false allegations of child abuse, possibly) to get Harry to come with him. Kind of villainous in that fic.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Yeah, but as far as I remember, the Dursleys still abused him in that. I'm not sure though. It's been a month or two since I last read this and I only reached Chapter 12 before getting sidetracked.

  When Harry Potter's brother is thought to be the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry is thought to be a squib and left with the Dursleys. But what happens when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter?
