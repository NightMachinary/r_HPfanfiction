Anne Bishop's Black Jewels series might be my new favorite fandom, so any favorite crossover recs welcome... But specifically, I'd /love/ to read anything about one of the known HP Legilimency experts (like Snape, Dumbledore, or Voldemort) encountering the mental barriers/core self/Twisted Kingdom of the Black Jewels universe.


** Anne Bishop is by far my favorite character with Black Jewels being my favorite setting of hers (did you know a new book is coming in March?). Hope people have recs but I really doubt it sadly.
