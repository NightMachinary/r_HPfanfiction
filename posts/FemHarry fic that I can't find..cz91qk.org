:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I really enjoy Genderbent Harry stories and I've seen a Fem!Harry/Voldemort story by (I think) someone called Nocturne-memory refrenced multiple times, especially in context to "The Historical importance of Runic warding[...]".

And now I'm hoping someone can send me a link because I'm pretty sure it's not on Ao3 or ffn. No one with an account by that name and stories exists there and I know every long Fem!Harry/Voldemort fic on Ao3.
