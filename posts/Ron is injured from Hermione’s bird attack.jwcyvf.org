I've seen so many Ron bashing fanfics where Hermione is a saint and she almost never gets called out for attacking Ron.

*** I think it is because people are sick of seeing the same stories of Ron being Bashed over and over again. In comparision Ginny and Hermione bashing stories are few in number and not as extreme. Harry bashing stories practically do not exist.

**** Do we have to rehash the same thing over and over again though? If someone wants to bash Hermione, they have a lot of other options. Also, maybe it's just me, but although there are only few blatant Hermione bashing stories, she's usually subtly bashed. Like in fanfics where she's obsessed with books and thinks they can never be wrong or where she worships Dumbledore (even though in canon she was the only one who thought what he did in PS was wrong).

***** Yes but the amount of Hermione bashing is still less then the amount of Ron bashing in fanfiction. Furthermore some of the most favorited stories such as RobSt's are full of Ron bashing.

******* I agree with you. The thing is, Rons Character is much more bashable than Hermiones. There isnt many instances of Hermione being the agressor or the one in the wrong except for the bird scene while Ron fucks up at least once in every book. As a result people who bash Hermione get hyperfocused on her sixth year in which she breaks her own rules over and over again due to her crush on Ron.

********* Ron threw Ginny a basic curse: Hermione literally sent a flock of violent birds at Ron

********** The birds are tiny. They're described as "Small" and "Little" twice and they look like a model of the solar system when they fly around Hermione's head. Based on the size of Jupiter (The largest planet obviously) in comparison to the sun, and applying those proportions to the size of the average human head (Lower estimate as she's female), that puts the birds at roughly 1.5cm wide , and 2cm tall (because of a canaries proportions they're probably a little taller than that, likely closer to 3-4 cm) . This also works with the later description of them as "Fat bullets", since bullets are often around the 1cm mark unless your looking at something more heavy duty. Since we don't know the curse he used we can't compare the damage he would have caused, but I feel your use of language is overstating the size of the scratches caused by the birds. Not to say what Hermione did was right of course, but you have also got to think this is after Ron spent weeks being "Grumpy" "Surly" "aggressive" "Indifferent" "Icy" "Sneering" and "as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt", to the point where Hermione is visibly nervous to talk to him. It wasn't just jealousy that prompted the attack, and making out like she nearly blinded him is ridiculous.

********** How do you know it's a "basic curse"? It could be literally anything, from making her vomit up slugs to cutting her all over. The curse's effects are never described, so you cannot say that it's better than Hermione's attack, and you're a liar if you do.

In regards to Hermione's attack on Ron, it was clear that the cuts were all very shallow. Many curses do much worse than that. Heck, after Harry sent Hedwig to attack Ron and Hermione, their cuts were described as extremely deep, so one owl managed to do much more than Hermione's flock of violent birds. It was hardly the worst thing she could do, and she and Ron should be judged the same since they committed the same action.
