So, I've been looking for a decent quality greater good Dumbledore story. One where Dumbledore isn't bashed nor a fool, one where, ultimately, he's actually right, and that good is simply not soft.

​

Anyone have any ideas where to find a story such as this? I've read a dagger and rose, but that's about the only one I've found.

​

It doesn't have to be the main focus of the story or anything, I just want a good story with minimal bashing.

​

​


** I didn't finish it, but I believe linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has this.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
