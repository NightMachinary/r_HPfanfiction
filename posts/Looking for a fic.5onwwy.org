hello! I am looking for a piece of fiction I read a long time ago. I forgot the title and the website I read the story on so, I am a bit lost as to how I begin looking for it. I remember some of the key points in the plot therefore, I am hoping someone would be of help. *** the story starts with harry being attacked at the graveyard during the third task of the triwizard tournament. After the usual confrontation the canon diverges here. Voldemort used a ritual to send harry somewhere he can't come back from. after the sudden dimensional travel, Harry finds himself in a peaceful wizarding world where, there are no muggleborns( they are kiddnapped and given to qualified magical families). The potter family flourished with several branches of the main family exists which, Harry is quickly brought to the fold and gets much needed help(wizarding culture and religion/magical studies) and love from his adopted family. Tom Riddle was given to the Black family and is known as Thomas/Tom Black. He is also the Defense professor at Hogwarts. Thats all I remember. Hopefully it is enough for someone to recognize it.
