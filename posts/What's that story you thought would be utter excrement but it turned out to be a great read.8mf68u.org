** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]'s [[http://lightning.ffstories.net/fanfiction.php][Sacrifices]] series. Thought it was going to be one of those generic Drarry fanfics, but the way they wrote about Dark/Light magic, events (like Samhain), Lords, and pretty much a lot of things had me sticking my face to my phone till I finished all 7 fanfics of the series.

*** I loved that series, but the best 200k words are the ones they left out of book 7.

Especially the year 6 arcs really needed severe hedge trimming and dragged a lot.

On the flip side, the story titles are easily the best on fanfiction... they sound so epic (except "saving Connor"... how that one happened I have no idea). Finding out the subject of the last one (the stress is on the thy rather than brother, which I really wasn't expecting) was a particular highlight.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Harmony and Marriage Law - I thought it would be awful, but was very positively surprised. Its portrayal of Ron is totally different from every Harmony fic I had read up to that point. Percy, Neville, Ginny, and Victor Krum all shined in this story. In fact, these side characters felt more likable than the main ones.

Later, when the main plot finally unfolded, it became awesome.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

**** Yeah it isn't. I didn't really get that too. Try looking past that, and wow the world feels really great.

The main thing there was done really well, that most things don't have any value, as magic can replicate things so easily, you can get usual things for nothing, or nearly so. Knowledge of spells is what is considered expensive.

The magic system is different. The world has an entire different logic to it and it's magic. Read it and see.

This is a Lynchian fever dream with most of the horror bits removed, a kind of asshole-ish talking wand, a title that screams "TROLL FIC," and yet it is bizarrely entertaining.
