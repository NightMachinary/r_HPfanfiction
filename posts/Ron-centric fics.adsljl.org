Any god fics with Ron as the main character. I am very tired with all the Ron bashing fic so can you suggest me some good Ron as the main character or at least Ron playing an important role in the story.


** I created this community, which I think have the best Ron-centric works on ff.net:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fanfiction-Starring-Ron/130651/]]

There are currently 57, and I add good fics when I finish them. Make sure not to sort out M-rated stories, because those are some of the best ones.

Also my story, which is in its early stages:

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** My personal favorite Ron-centric fic is The cost of time travel, an incomplete fic which had some really interesting concepts. I really liked how one could feel what Ron had lost by going back in time (wife and kids, etc.) and how being 34 in a 14 year old's body meant that he could no longer completely relate to Harry.

linkffn(The cost of time travel)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/The-cost-of-time-travel]]

Another good WIP is: the Red Knight linkffn(12141684) This one is another time travel fic which is interesting because Ron comes back to a past that isn't quite the same as the one he originally lived. That and some of his memories of the future are rather hazy. There was quite a bit of witty banter too.

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.
