I am seeking fics like Fate's Fool and The Archeologist, where Harry ends up in his younger body, but isn't interested to redo his childhood. Instead he establish himself as adult and returns to do whatever badassery he was doing before travel.

**** OP asked for "still end up in their younger bodies".

They showed up at Hogwarts for one year in "Reunion", and that was it. Not only did they kill off all their enemies, but also ruined Gringotts, and reformed the Ministry. Then they were off to Australia with Sirius. This fic fit OP's request in every aspect!

In "We are the Golden Trio!", they didn't even bother to show up at Hogwarts, but decided to finish off Voldemort in a speed run like fashion. This fic also fits OP's request perfectly!

Only in "Returning to the Start", you can claim that he indeed played along for a while.

***** Ah my mistake. The only one of them I remember well is Returning to the Start and it's definitely had Harry pretending to be a kid again.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** His 28 Lives/His 28th Life by Lomonaaeran maybe? I can't remember exact title, but harry is the master of death and gets reborn all the time. It's currently a WiP but it's extremely interesting, and it is leaning towards a Tom/Harry fic I believe. Nothing established yet, but definitely getting there. I'm biased because I LOVE Lomonaaeran, so there is that.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
