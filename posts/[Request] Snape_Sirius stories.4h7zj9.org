I posted a similar post about two weeks ago, but I'm looking for more and two weeks is a fair amount of time when on the internet.

Check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/FabulaRasa/pseuds/FabulaRasa/works?fandom_id=136512][FabulaRasa's Snack fics]], which is old-school Snape/Black. I've linked you to her HP page on AO3.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6318457]]) /Warning:/ Death fic.

If you don't mind a very old-school style with a smutty romantic tilt, posted before canon made it clear that Snape wasn't tall or broad-shouldered, you could try Nehalenia's fic on InsaneJournal. She writes Snape as a bottom. Maybe start with this one:

[On the Taming of Wild Creatures](nehalenia.insanejournal.com/5045.html) ETA: I don't know why the formatting doesn't work for this link, but you can copy and paste the url to find the story.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1584137]]) A bantery, smutty little fic that presupposes an AU universe where the mutual hatred isn't so lethal.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1008814]]) - Another old-school fic from 2004, short smutty hate!sex.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/698772/chapters/1286620]]) Potionpen's style is probably an acquired taste - they like to play with language and overwrite exuberantly. I really enjoy it, but not everyone does. They're a Snape fan first and foremost, but pretty affectionate toward everyone else.

  Because, really, it has nothing to do with some secret obsession with the dark side.

  That's what being a dog is like -- it's like you're walking the very edge of the world, where almost all colour has run out, and you know that should you miss a step, you'll fall off that edge... Then again, you already know all about it. The edge and the falling.‚Äù AU of the first war.

  Severus knew that a time would come when he would be unable to improve the potion any further. He knew that he would have no choice but to watch Sirius waste away. Years of knowing hasn't made it any easier. Severus is scared but he is about to learn that love shared is love multiplied.

  Sirius slowly realizes how much of his memory was frozen away in Azkaban, while Remus nobly refuses to tell him anything and Severus swoops around maliciously doing Molly's dishes and sabotaging Sirius's h/c NEWT with surly panache.
