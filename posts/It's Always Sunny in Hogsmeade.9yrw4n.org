I want a hilarious, well-written fic that is basically 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' but set within the Potterverse. Here is how I would see the character counterparts:

Ginny = Dennis

Ron = Dee

Harry = Charlie

Draco = Mac

Mad-eye Moody = Frank

Neville or Colin = Rickety Cricket

Hermione = The Waitress
