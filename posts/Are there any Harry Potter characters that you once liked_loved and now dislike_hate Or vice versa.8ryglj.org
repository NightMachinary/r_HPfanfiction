** I wouldn't say that I disliked or hated Charlie Weasley but I was more indifferent to him. However, after reading many stories with him in it, I pay more attention to the several lines he's given in the books and see him in a more positive light. I have to say that I really disliked Ginny though. I just couldn't stand her in the series, especially in Half-Blood Prince. However, after reading many, many FanFiction stories with Ginny getting bashed on an absurd level of idiocy, I do like her now and upon my last reading of the books, like her even more.

I went through stages reading /Harry Potter/. When I was younger, I always though Harry and Hermione would certainly end up together and whoever didn't see it was clearly blind. When I got a bit older, I really disliked how Rowling didn't match the aforementioned pairing and turned to FanFiction where authors did match the two together. I even dipped my own hand into the batter a couple of times and did my own spin on a Harry/Hermione love story. Now, however, as an adult, I'm completely content with Harry and Hermione being the best of friends. It's weird how some things change with age but it's all part of life, I guess.

** Ron and Hermione

When I was younger, reading the books, I was pretty ambivalent about these two. They are two of the three most important characters in the books, but I just never cared much for them as people or for their role in the story.

Over time though, and reading swaths of fanfiction, I encountered quite a bit of Ron and Hermione bashing in stories. Some deliberate and overt, while others were secondary or perhaps even inadvertent.

As I saw this more and more, I began to realize something about this view of Harry's friends, and to a lesser degree my own previous viewpoint. /That way of seeing Harry's friends is incredibly juvenille and the sort of view an angsty teenager would subscribe too/. If anything, the most flawed and broken person of the three is Harry, but he is meant to be the reader's self-insert into the HP universe (which is why he never learns anything until absolutely necessary).

I realized that much of bashing and dislike of certain characters, both by myself and seemingly others, was often a result of "having an axe to grind." Its a reduction of multi-faceted individuals (you know, like real people...) down to terrible qualities to suit a persons viewpoint. As I grew, I began to understand that is how children, and many teenagers see the world: exemplifying certain qualities and ignoring others to suit a viewpoint.

I'm not trying to insult anybody here. The short of this is that fanfiction made me realize my ambivalence and the reductionist view of characters and people was at best naive and at worst infantile. Ron and Hermione, as a practical matter, are better than the majority of the students in Hogwarts by a wide margin. Their not perfect; Ron has a strong inferiority complex and Hermione has issues with imposition and heavy-handededness. But that is how /people/ are. Their not perfect, and their not just one quality.

** I used to be ambivalent toward Snape. Didn't approve of Albus Severus - in fact I still think the choice is OOC - but I didn't outright /hate/ Snape. Then I started reading fanfiction, where he's either glorified, his actions are OOC, or both. But again, I didn't /really/ care. Then one of my best friends started dating a guy who's a /lot/ like Snape (manipulative, obsessive, possessive, borderline abusive, etc.), and I realized he is less than trash and Lily, like my friend, was better off without him. Growing up made me realize that, unfortunately, there are a lot of Snapes in the world. Now I get a vindictive enjoyment out of Snape-bashing.

As an aside, growing up has also made me realize there are a lot of people like James Potter in the world. Sometimes bullies /can/ mature, and it can even happen within a year, believe it or not.

*** Well, it's not like their canon characterisations make them good people once you look deep enough. Between Lupin's disregard for Harry and him running from his pregnant wife, there is not really much that could be considered a redeeming quality. And Dumbledore with his "ten dark years" isn't much of a kind grandfather either.

** Since I started reading the Series after age 40, my views of characters are pretty much set.

However, my impression of Dumbledore has upgraded from ‘hate' to ‘dislike', since there's not much point to grind axe with a literary plot device.

I do enjoy fics in which certain bad characters are elevated to ‘good', among them Bellatrix, Grindelwald, Lockhart, Petunia, and Tom Riddle.

Speaking of Voldemort, this is my absolutely top hated character, both in a literary sense and his in-story behaviors. This monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain with a hopeless dose of compulsive obsessive stupidity is also primarily responsible for Dumbledore becoming an incompetent plot device, because a slightly more competent Dumbledore would have shot the canon plot instantly, as in “Petrification Proliferation”.

That being said, I really like a somewhat more sane and less evil Voldemort, as “Seventh Horcrux” is by far my top favorite fic. “Prince of Dark Kingdom” would also rank much higher if it was finished.

*** I think that's Rowling's point though. Hermione isn't meant to be this perfect intellectual girl in the very beginning of the story. (I'm listening to Philosopher's Stone rn and I see what you mean) Her character is bossy and annoying and a bit of a know-it-all. However, through the books she becomes more than that and that's the best part; the character arc.

**** Hermione has an arc? I don't know...IMHO character development isn't really happening in HP! Rowling isn't bad at world-building (or at least basic world building, because many fanfictions truly expand on the world she has made in ways she probably never thought of!), but her characters never change much IMHO! Harry still wants to be "just Harry" at the end IMHO!

*** Except that /she/ didn't steal any of Ron's lines as instead screenwriter Steve Kloves (and to a smaller extent Michael Goldenberg) gave them to her. Hermione (like Ron) is a fictional character. She (and he) can only /steal/ within the world/universe they operate within.

** My opinion on the canon characters has remained basically unchanged. I also generally like fanon reinterpretations of characters so long as they're used well - with the exception of Bashed!Pathetic!Ron. I /used/ to like reading that, on occasion, and still do if it's over-the-top and used for comedy, but otherwise I can't stand him and the stories that use him.

*** Agreed.

If you don't like Ron, honestly, just kill him. They use bashing as a way to rid Ron from the story, but it comes across as weak writing. Let him have a hero's fall, or hell, even a misstep that is dumb and takes his life, but it's a better route than the bash.

** My opinion on Sirius and James has changed drastically after I've grown up and taken a new look at them. They are vicious bullies and Sirius tried to kill Snape as a kid by using lupin. There is no way around it.

But the worst thing is how Sirius is portrayed in fanfiction. I gag whenever I see him get Hermione or a super hot super smart blonde bombshell of a woman, who happens to cure him of the depression Azkaban years.

Fanfiction destroyed Luna Lovegood for me. I used to love her, now I hate it whenever I see her. There are very very very few depictions of Luna in FF that are quite good

** Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore!

I first fell for his grandfather image (we after all see the story through Harry's eyes, not to mention that Harry doesn't seem to hate the man despite him being the root of almost all the bad things in Harry's life!) and saw him as kind of Harry Potter's Gandalf, but I read some fanfiction later and it got me thinking! I examined the headmaster - put him under a microscope really - and found out that he truly is IMHO an asshole and shouldn't be an educator at all because frankly he is unfit to care for children and neither should he be a leader or a politician because he's not fit for those positions either! He might do well as an anti-social researcher in some ivory-tower, but that is it!)

All the Hogwarts teachers (from except for Snape, I always hated his guts!)! None of them should IMHO educate anybody either because most of them aren't fit to teach either (rampant bullying for example which the faculty should IMHO STAMP OUT! Same for keeping the kids save! Damned, the robot HK47 from Star Wars would do a better job if his master ordered him to keep the kids save! Hell, he'd probably murder the shit out of the basilisk and any deatheaters :D - for those who don't know: This is an assassin droid who really enjoys killing and hurting people, so not somebody who you would normally want to look after kids!)

Remus "I am a coward - Oh woe is me!" Lupin...I thought him brave dealing with his affliction, but later I understood that it made him a coward who can't deal with outside pressure (and would rather flee than fight! Damned, this man is the antithesis of a werewolf! This is probably why the transformation hurts him more than most!)

Arthur and Molly Weasley (the whipped husband and the overbearing helicopter mother who doesn't allow her kids to make up their own minds, no wounder that Bill, Charlie and the twins left ASAP, as did Percy for that matter!...I did like them once because they were nice to Harry, but I get it now that most people would have been because frankly: Who wouldn't want to keep the young celebrity at their home? Doing so might open previously closed doors after all etc.! Not to mention that they both are idiots for having so many kids! I think parents should have a reasonable number so that they can truly care for them all and give them the love they deserve (so 4 at max, but more like 2-3))

The Order of the Phoenix - thought them competent once, but now I think that most of them are useless and couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag! They can gather information, but in a straight up fight most of them are a hindrance, not an asset!

Hermione - so smart but yet so uncreative and dumb at times and deffinitely not the genius the fandom makes her out to be!

Ron - loved the guy when I was reading the books, but if you critically look at him then he's IMHO a useless waste of space and a bad friend!

As for the other way round?

Sirius Black - I once saw him as childish without a reason, but I forgot that this guy was in solitary (sure he had crazy DEs in the cells around him, but I bet they didn't much talk to him!) for most of his adult life! Not to mention that he grew up during a war and it is IMHO part of his coping mechanism (for both the war and his crappy dark family!), not to mention that you don't grow up when locked up and neither do you if the only things you know are school and prison! As far as we know Sirius migh never have had a real job, he probably never had a girlfriend for long etc.!

I used to hate Percy but I actually like his ambition now. If my family was that less than stellar, I would also want some distance!
