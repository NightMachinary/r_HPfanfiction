Anything that deals with Draco being sorted into Gryfindor, either in first year or later. Preferably long and without Dramoine but I will take anything. :D Him being sorted into Hufflepuff would be welcome as well.


** Yes. Tom Felton joined Pottermore and was sorted into Gryffindor.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] is a pre-Hogwarts fic in which Sirius escapes Azkaban early and takes Harry from Privet Drive.

The sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]] starts Hogwarts and features a Gryffindor Draco.

There is another sequel called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]] which is currently a WIP.

** There is a very good fan fiction where The Twins prank the entire school by messing up the sorting in Harry's (and then later, Ginny's) year.

Resortings include: Crabbe and Goyle in Gryffindor, Draco and Harry in Hufflepuff, Neville and Hermione in Slytherin, and I think Ron in Ravenclaw.

I really wish I remembered the name of the fic though, it's frustrating the hell out of me

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's Boys]] is a really great story that features Gryffindor!Draco. And except for the epliogue there weren't really any pairings between the children iirc, but I haven't read the fic in a while. Time to do it again, it's really worth your time as long as you can live with the concept of "Good Dursleys". ;)

#+begin_quote
  A very AU Severus/Harry mentor fic with Lucius as a friend as well. Petunia dies and the Dursley's flee Privet Drive along with Harry. They end up hiding in an unexpected place when the Hogwarts letter arrives.
