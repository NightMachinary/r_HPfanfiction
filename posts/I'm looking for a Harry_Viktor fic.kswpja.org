I remember that Harry meets Viktor during the Death eater attack at the Quidditch world cup. They become pen pals. Later they become boyfriends. I also remember Harry goes to the yule ball with Viktorand Dobby changes his dress robes to a dress. In the fic, Sirius gets political asylum from Bulgaria.

It was on Ff.net, but now I can't seem to find it, and I can't remember the title. Anyone know this one?
