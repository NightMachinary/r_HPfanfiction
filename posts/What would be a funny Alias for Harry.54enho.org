** Cho Senwan

"OMG is that Harry? It looks exactly like him!"

"No, that's just our neighbour. The reclusive Cho Senwan."

I can't remember what fic it's from, but it's an anagram for Harry James Potter.

** Order is mostly Pureblood, or at least Half-Bloods who hadn't been in Muggle World or received its education. I'd say, open your Dickens and go wild.

Won't help if Hermione is looking too, though.
