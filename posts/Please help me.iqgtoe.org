:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a fanfic where Harry was in the Triwizard tournament and Ron and Hermione betrays him. Overnight most of the Gryffindors betray him except for the Weasley twins. The people who hated him thought he corrupted some of the teachers into helping and beileving him. This is all I remember unfortunately, but if someone knows the fanfic name please comment it.


** That kind of thing happens in a lot of fics.

** Okay so the fic I was looking for was actually surrounding the Parseltongue incident in second year, not the Triwizard Tournament, but the betrayal by Gryffindor house is featured prominantly and is in the summary, so give it a try to see if it's yours. If you can remember any specific details I can help you look further.

#+begin_quote
  AU. The Parseltongue incident in second year caused a more violent explosion in Gryffindor House than anyone could have foreseen. Harry, trying to withdraw from everyone except his two best friends, finds himself helped by people he couldn't have foreseen either, first Snape and then Draco Malfoy. Sometimes, all it takes is one sudden impulsive throwing of a stone for the ripples of change to spread through several lives.

*** Sorry but this is not it. But I remember another detail. There was a anti Harry club and the the Weasley twins had a party to celebrate Harry's performance on a task. The entrance was charmed to have a loud buzzing noise to anyone with ill intentions towards Harry.
