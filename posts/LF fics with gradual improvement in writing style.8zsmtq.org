The more obvious the better. I personally think it's better to learn from other peoples' mistakes.

Personally, I believe DP&SW showed noticeable improvement in writing quality, if nothing else.


** I feel that the writing in my story has improved quite a bit since when I first started the fic.

** If you read all of Robst's stuff in chronological order, I think there's a noticable improvement. Not within a single story though.

** Not a fanfic, but if you want to read something with obvious improvements in writing, go and read Adventurers Wanted. It's very obvious that the main character is a Gary Stu, but he gets better, and the plot also improves. I only read up to the third book, but it's probably improved even further now.

*** Also not a fanfic, but one series where the improvement is clear is the Inheritance Cycle. Book one looks as if it was written by a teen (and it was, Paolini was 17~18 at the time) and book 4 feels like a masterpiece. (I think he was 25 or 26 by then)

**** I cannot agree with you. I read the books and wanted to rip them apart. It was a selfinsert into a bad plot.

Maybe his writing has improved throughout the books and it got lost in translation, the story itself was not worth the money though.

** Definitely the Weasley Twins Series by phantomduck. I posted a whole review of this series [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8vbgoz/recommendation_weasley_twins_series_by_phantomduck/?st=JJUPMPR0&sh=6c22e275][here]].

Basically, the first book is okay, but it is a hilarious read. By book 2, there is a more coherent plot line that really sucked me in throughout the series. I highly recommend it.
