I remember a fic with this. Don't really remember anything else about it, but this should be pretty distinctive, right?

EDIT: It was so distinctive that I got it with a Google Search. Pretty epic fanfic.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

And now, since the search has been resolved, let's discuss... something. Anything?

** That is a great fic. Particularly because the time traveling Harry is from the Cuckolding at Shell Cottage universe.

  PostDH. ONESHOT. Why in the world would Harry name his son by a manipulative old coot and a sallowfaced greasyhaired bastard who got his jollies by wanking off at the image of his mum? Read to find out... OOC warning!

** It was a long time ago, but I remember a humorous one-shot where Albus was basically named after every dead character.

Something like "Albus Severus Regulus Fred Dobby Alastor Hedwig Potter"
