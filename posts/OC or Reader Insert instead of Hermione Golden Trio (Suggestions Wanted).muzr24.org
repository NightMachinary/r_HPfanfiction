I've been looking for a story that has an OC or Reader Insert that completely replaces hermione,hermione can be in a different house. Possibly an X Ron fic, where Krum doesn't ask Hermione to the Yule Ball


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18704896/chapters/44362291][Anaticula]]

In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

In this one the golden trio is Oc/Fred/George known as the triplets who work often with Percy and Cedric to save the school and keep oc's overly stubborn but ignorant cousin Harry from meddling in what he and his friends don't understand to help as â€˜the chosen one'. It has Hermione but she's a side character with just a few times she's in the main plot lines of the yearly drama issues. She does go with Krum but again it's not a huge thing in the story and she and Ron never date. 336k words.

**** It's written In 2nd person but not In y/n style flows better to paint the scenes for me that way
