So looking for a Draco centric fic( Draco as the MC) that focuses on his friendship with Nott Blaise and Pansy ( or any 2 out of those three). I'm not looking for a ship fic I'd prefer it focus on his friendships more than his romance when it comes to important relationships. It's fine if there is romance just not as the main focus. Something plot driven that features their friendship alot also works. As far as ships go I'm not the biggest fan of Draco x Pansy but as long as it meets the other criteria it can be any ship. I am ok with with m/m m/f and f/f. But no fem Draco( or any genderbendt characters) It can be during his time at Hogwarts or after they leave.


** I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12596856/1/The-Other-Side-of-the-War][this]] fanfiction about Draco, Nott, Blaise, and Pansy, and it's not a Draco/Pansy. It's about them dealing with adjusting to life after the war, but it is also very dark and has themes of abuse and such. It also has a young Scorpius.
