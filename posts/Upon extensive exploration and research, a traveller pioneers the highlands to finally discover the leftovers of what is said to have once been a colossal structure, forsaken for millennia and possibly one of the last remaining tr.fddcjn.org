** And promptly turns around because he just remembered leaving the stove on.

Hang on, what's a stove?

No, he definitely knows that he left it on, whatever it is.

He wavers in indecisiveness, the "stove" on his mind, warring with his plan.

Eventually, he decides to go on, stoves be damned. Trekking through a shadowy valley, he continues remembering strange errands and terms he has never heard before, and eventually forms a hypothesis by the nightly campfire; the effect must be artificial. He's read much, and knows that the magics of old could influence the world in many ways, so it's not a stretch to assume they could influence the mind as well.

He reasons with himself, noting that the things he is seemingly recalling must have been from a time long gone. Perhaps that is why he isn't as strongly affected as a human from that era would be. After all, according to his research, the structure is ancient, over three thousand years old. With that last realisation, the effect breaks. He can think clearly again.

In the morning, he wanders on, musing on his research and Finds thus far. The magical era is a very mysterious period in human history, seemingly hiding within other historical periods. He found references to magic in many ancient documents, but wasn't sure if they were fact or fiction.

However, there were two major events, apparent only from his position looking back into the distant past; One is a very peculiar drop in the mentions of magic, wizards and so on at some point in the first dark age, and the second is a very peculiar uprise shortly before the original space age.

The valley he is wandering slowly transitions into a forest. A deep forest, a dark forest, one of the kind not found anymore on Earth, or any of the "civilized" worlds. He pauses to take a sample of DNA from one of the particularily massive trees, then jumps back in fright when it seems to slowly reach toward him in the gloom. Must have been the light.

There is no path through the forest, and in many places he has to use his mobility devices, phasing through or floating over obstacles.

Eventually, the forest begins to clear a little, and then stops sharply. Every nearby tree seems to grow toward the clearer land beyond, but is apparently stopped in midair in a surreal display. He suspects a force-field, and is proven right - as he touches the perimeter, there is a soft ripple in the air in front of him.

Curiously, his Lexicon implant also detects a slight intrusion, and stops it before it can manifest any effects. He makes camp at the edge, and reads the report. He tries a few things, including his phase-shifter, but the barrier is very resilient. Every time he touches it, his Lexicon also nips an intrusion in the bud. Very curious.

A few hours later, he has another theory, this one closely related to the first. If magic could insert things into the mind, in a way his implant would not detect, then it may be able to 'knock' on his mind, for lack of a better word. Still, he makes a backup, fully raises a few mental firewalls and looks on from behind them as his body moves with a slight delay according to his instructions.

He directs it to touch the barrier, and then slowly releases the lockdown on his mind. He feels a tendril of... something enter his mind, feel around and then be rebuffed by one of the raised firewalls. It draws back a little, and goes still.

It's waiting, he realizes.

Very, very cautiously, he releases the firewall preventing sensory access, and questions the strand's presence mentally. There are no words by him, neither real nor imagined, but the message is recieved. The strand shakes itself, and he sees a series of images.

A circle, pulsing softly. There is a small red dot on one side.

An unknown human with a very long, slightly graying black beard and green eyes that seem to sparkle with an unseen light source.

A vista of black nothingness, with some diffuse clouds of blue mist.

A surface of hewn stone, a crater in the middle. There is green fire burning around it.

A quick procession of images, showing a very familiar forest in various stages of growth - as a grassland, shrubbery, small wood, and then the gnarled trees just behind him.

And finally, a large wooden door, open to show whiteness beyond.

Then the strand retreats, and he is gently pushed backwards into a bush.

He reflects. The message is cryptic, as most telepathic communication is, but he can infer some meanings. For example, he knows that the unknown man is important, but how the message did not make clear. However, he did understand the last image, and whoops with joy as he finds that he can now push his hand through the barrier. He passes into the grassland beyond.

He cannot see far, for the grass and shrubs are unnaturally tall and vibrant, but he manages to push through the worst of it without harming any of the plants. There is a very, very large willow tree in the distance, and he moves towards it. It is the only real landmark he can see. As he approaches, the tree seems to... awaken, for lack of a better word. Its branches creak a little, and the leaves shake a little, but then it settles again, silent. Though he thinks he can feel something gently touch the top of his head as he walks away, the tree is as silent and still as before when he whips his head around to look at it.

He eventually ends up at a waterfront. There are many strange critters here, iridescent toads and large insects, but he doesn't have eyes for them. His gaze is captured by what lies beyond the water, upon the cliffside.

At first glance, he is disappointed. What he imagined as grand ruins seems little more than a mossy pile of rubble, but then it flickers, and he sees a very much standing wall, if only for a moment.

Excitedly, he expands his boat and paddles across the water, catching several more flickers of whatever magic is hiding the ruins from his view. Perhaps some sort of magical analogue for holograms? Though those may not have been around at the time.

He discovers an ancient, overgrown pier down by the cliffside, and packs his boat once again. The nanites used to disassemble it move a little erratically, and a quick diagnostic shows that there is a very low-power field of electromagnetic interference in the air, which disturbs the carrier signal guiding them. Curious.

The stairway upwards from the pier has long since crumbled, and he opts to float up where he guesses the original path was located. It leads him straight to the flickering ruins. The closer he gets, the more erratic said flickering becomes, until at a certain moment, there is a flash of light, his ears pop and the illusion collapses.

The ruins are very well preserved, all things considering. Most of the wood has either rotted away or become alike to stone, which causes the large entry door to crumble inwards and noisily impact on the floor as he attempts to push it open. He waits for a second, frozen by the sound, then eases up and shines a flashlight into the dark chamber.

The corridors are relatively dark, a few empty candle-holders being the only thing remaining of any light sources beside the sun outside.

He peeks into a couple of the rooms, confirming his theory that Hogwarts was a school of some sort, as opposed to a military training ground or a research facility. Though much of it has decayed, the furniture that remains signifies classrooms, dorms, the like. More than once, entire passages have collapsed, towers are missing or floors have fallen into rooms where they acted as ceilings.

Everything seems to be very silent, very lifeless. He can't help but get the feeling that the structure should be moving, speaking. There are empty frames everywhere.

He encounters an unusable staircase, all the stairs jutting out into random directions, most of them leading into nothing, walls or similar. He floats up here as well.

In one of the corridors, he encounters something moving, unlike the few sets of armor frozen in strange poses. A flickering door.

It is never the same door, growing and shrinking and changing its state randomly, but it is open. And the room beyond never changes.

There is something in there, something dreadful - he can feel it in his bones, though all he sees is an arch of stone within the flickering room. Nothing that should inspire this amount of terror, even when it is confined by a set of suppressing firewalls.

He moves on, noting the door on his mental map of the ruins.

Eventually, he encounters another strange sight while working to complete the map. A large statue of a bird, no, a gargoyle, fallen on its side. Behind it, an open door, as well as light.

Unnatural light, he realizes.

Up the spiraling stairway, there is another door. Beyond that door is his greatest find yet.

The chamber is nothing special, the same decaying wood everywhere. Though at its center, there lies something different. Something magical.

A gemstone, easily larger than any he has seen before, pulsating gently with an orange light.

As he lays his eyes onto it, he feels the same presence in his toughts as before, but this time, he cannot stop it. His implant hasn't even detected anything, and will not respond.

The brief amount of panic is soothed by the presence, which explains to him a request it has. Their communication cannot be put into words, for it was both deeper and less literal than they are. They come to an agreement, and the presence shows him a series of images, culminating with one he has seen before.

The door.

He gently picks up the stone, noting a slight shuddering in the stonework around him. Then, he begins to run.

The shudder quickly becomes a tremor, and then a shake, and the first pieces of rubble begin to fall from the ceiling.

With the help of his mental map and his mobility devices, he manages to make it to the door on time. He feels the dread attempting to take hold, but something is fighting it. He jumps through the door.

*** Once inside the room, everything seemigly stops. His eyes are fixed to the thing at the center of the room, the archway - which is now apparent is not empty.

No, there is something inside it. As though fluttering with an unseen breeze, the standing surface of water seems unfazed by his astonishment.

He feels a prod by the presence, and realizes it is giving him a choice. A hard choice. The opportunity of a lifetime, but seperation from everything he knows.

He thinks back at his life, at the ridiculing of his theories on magic and a magical world, on the jeering faces of his colleagues as he packs for the expedition.

He makes his choice.

And steps into the arch.

***** I've written something here before, linkffn(beyond the black shield). It's rather short, though. I can't find my old account where I had a few other stories uploaded, sadly.

However, my current main project is an original story on Royalroad, I'll send you a PM if you want.
