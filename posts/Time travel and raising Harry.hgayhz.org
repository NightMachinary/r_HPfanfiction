Any stories where someone time travels either accidentally or on purpose back to 91 and decides to raise Harry? I've read “Telling Time” and recently one where Hermione accidentally traveled back and she called herself Jane Watson.

No Harry raising Harry please or Snape raising Harry. Please please only stories with over 60k wording.
