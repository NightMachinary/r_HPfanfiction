It is a Neville coming of age, over the summer after 5th year when he lives at Grimmuald place with Harry and Remus. Even though it is AU, the way it is written and the plot feels so much like canon. You will fall in love with this Neville - he is so perfectly written. It's also mild Harry/Neville slash but there's a no-slash version on FFN too.
