*** While I get that it was a story about kids, and kids doing cool stuff, (when I was a kid, I loved that) so she had to make adults stupid, or not as into the picture as she could, there are better ways to do it, or hell, even have the adults be the ones to train Harry in a way that makes sense.

I love the books, will always love them, but the more you grow up, the more you realize just how flawed they were. (In more ways than just the adults, too).

**** That's pretty much every children's adventure story, though. You can't have kids be the heroes unless all the adults are /aggressively/ stupid, because competent adults would actually handle things themselves.

Does make it painful to look back on or read again as an adult, though.

***** I mean.. yes, you can. It's just much, much harder to write and requires unlikely circumstances. The good guy adults need to be pitted against the bad guy adults and the two need to be balanced such that the kids make the difference. Combine that with some bipolar luck and adult idiocy does not need to be the driving factor.

******* I've only ever heard of her, and that was on QI where one of the panelists made a joke at Stephen Fry's expense that they forgot he grew up in an Enid Blyton novel. (He had just finished telling an anecdote about how when he was in school they would raid the kitchen for jam and things.)

******** She was my gateway into the world of novels. I was teacher's pet like Hermione and when we were given access to Library once a week I used to take books on GK, math, science and the like.

One day I stumbled upon a book called 'The River of Adventures' (the last book of the series BTW) and thinking it was a book on dangerous rivers around the world took it and immediately got hooked.

I would suggest you give the Adventure series a try as it was really good on the adults not being incompetents. Most of the times it is the adults that finally resolve the situation.

******* The only book in the series that was ever accused of racism or sexism was the original The Island of Adventure in which the the handyman Jo Jo was a black man and his skin color was mentioned over 30 times. In the later editions any reference to his ethnicity has been removed. So The Adventure Series is okay to give a go.

Every time the living in the cupboard under the stairs is brought up, it makes my blood boil. No amount of forgiveness that Dumbledore asks in Book 5 can be given just based on the fact that he KNOWINGLY allowed a child to be returned to an abusive home. It makes me extremely sad.

  After the fiasco of the Chamber, Molly Weasley has no intention of ignoring the debt the family has toward Harry Potter. The question is only how she can satisfy her sense of obligation while not falling afoul of Dumbledore's restrictions.
