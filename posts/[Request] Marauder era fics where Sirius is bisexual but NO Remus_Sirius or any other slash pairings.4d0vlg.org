** Sorry I don't know of any such fics. But I'm curious - why? Does that mean you want him to be attracted to males but not be in a relationship with any male?

****** Does Hermione/Ron disturb you? Does Harry/Hermione disturb you? I don't know why they can't be intimate if they are friends, that's so bizarre.

******* I'm not a fan of Romione or Harmony. But that's not the point. I see Sirius and Remus as bros, and there's nothing wrong with that. And fluffy romance makes me uncomfortable, and so many Wolfstar fics are disgustingly sappy.
