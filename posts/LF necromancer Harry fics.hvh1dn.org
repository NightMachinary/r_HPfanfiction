** Highly recommend this one shot, Dead Things by Eclipse Wing: linkao3(15695769)

And this longer AU if you can tolerate a bit of slash (involving a mashing of generations born at the same time: Grindelwald holds Europe in a coldwar stalemate, Sirius was a prisoner so Harry was raised by Dursleys, Tom Riddle is in the same year as Harry, Ron, and Hermione at Hogwarts) with necromancer Harry, rising dark lord Tom Riddle, and their really fucked up relationship: linkao3(16308554)

Edit to add: minor spoilers for the second one, to whet your curiosity. Lucius Malfoy and Ron Weasley are equally upset about Harry and Tom's relationship, Necromancer Harry's animagus form is a Grim, Tom Riddle brings the basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets to fight Grindelwald

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  Tom and Harry are inevitable in any universe.OR: While Dumbledore and Grindelwald play their chess game across Europe, two young wizards form an unlikely friendship.[That one where Tom and Harry are born in the same generation.]

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  "Every Potter who died on a Potter's Field always returned to the living." The dead are watching. The dead have always been watching. And when their Master jumps through time back to his fourth year and is promptly killed, they answer his call. Time travel! MoD!Harry
