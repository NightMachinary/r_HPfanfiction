I'm looking for fics where Remus and Sirius raise Harry together in some way, similar to the beginning of A Marauder's Plan. Any recommendations?


** Just Remus, not Sirius: linkffn(5142565)

Both of them: linkao3(Moony, Padfoot and Little Prongs)

  Harry Potter AU where Sirius steps in as Harry's godfather and raises him with Remus (and slowly they fall in love together) from the night he was meant to go to Privet Drive to that day at the Platform, 19 years later

** I'll get you some more recs later, as I'm about to go to work, but linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) and its sequels had ought to hold you for a bit. Incomplete, but copperbadge posted the summary of the stuff he didn't write! A staple of the genre, and Remus/Sirius slash--it's a getting together fic for them. The later fics in the series focus on Harry&co at Hogwarts.
