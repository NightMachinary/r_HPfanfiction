So, the impression I got from canon was that everyone gets their letters in the last week of July, and it's just a coincidence that Harry's birthday is a week from then. But, most people seem to think that everyone gets their letter the week before or the day of their eleventh birthday. It can't be the day of because they'd already been arriving for a week before Harry finally got his, and they also can't be the week before because then people who's birthdays fall within the school year, like Hermione and Ron, would be getting their letters for the next year while they were still at school. So then why is this theory so prevalent? It's in nearly every fic I've read.


** I think it's because of some decade old meme, where everyone (HP fans and/or social network butterflies who have seen some of the films) lamented not being invited to Hogwarts on their elleventh birthday.

** Don't know but with Hermione's conversation on the train it sounds like her letter came in July too. Ginny gets her letter when Harry is at the burrow in year 2 doesn't she? And it would make more sense for the muggleborns to get letters in the summer hols when McG is free to visit them.

** J K has said that it's cannon that a magical quill writes names in a book when a magical child is born. I've always assumed that it included their birthdays too, and when the time comes a second magical quill writes the letters and sends them out. It would be triggered to do so in June, once book knows that the student will be eleven years old by the time the Hogwarts Express departs that year. Because it has to write letters for every student, because the upper years need their supply lists and OWL and NEWT results, it takes it about a month of constant day and night writing. The school owls fly in and pick up the letters and deliver them once they are finished.

** Madam Rowling said that it's a week or so before their birthday, up to their birthday, but later she took it back and said that it's always near the end of July.

Suffice to say, some people chose to decide that she didn't really think it through either way and thus whichever version is acceptable for as long as it's internally consistent.

** I've wondered about this too. I've always assumed they came at the end of July and it was a coincidence that it was Harry's birthday, and that authors who said otherwise just hadn't thought about it enough to realise their error.

It could still be that they get their first letter on their 11th birthday though, since it's completely nonsensical, which fits perfectly with both the wizarding world and JKR's propensity for whimsy over realism.

*** I mean you don't get your letter on your 11th bday. Harry just did because the Dursleys are trash. However I do think it's possible that you get your first letter in your birthday month, and subsequent letters in July ?

**** It could be possible, but the only time people are ever shown getting their letters is July, so it's far more likely that the letters are delivered in July.

** While it is canon that letters show up some time during the summer holidays, I think this is something you can safely alter for plots sake if it matters to your story.

** Congratulations, you just discovered the fact that the fandom is wrong about basically everything.
