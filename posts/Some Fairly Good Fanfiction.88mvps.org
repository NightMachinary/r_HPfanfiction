I have been reading fanfiction for about five years now and I have ammassed quite the library of fics across multiple fandoms, I have database consisting of over 150 fics for hp alone, most over 100k words long. The following recomendations are from my "all time favourites" folder. All of them are longer than Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone and are all very well written and worth checking out.

1.  "A Cadmean Victory" by Darkness Enthroned: Pretty damn long, but my personal favourite fic ever. The pairing is Harry/Fleur which is kinda rare, especially when done right, but it is extremely well written and explores a lot of concepts about magic in general as well as realistically portraying how Harry's friends might cease to be his friends. Bit of a dark harry story, but it isn't without reason. Also, if you finish it and have either worked it out and want confirmation or are dead confused by the ending, then check out "a taste of ismenian water" it's a oneshot epilogue by the same author and explains stuff a bit more.

2.  "The Denarian Series" by Shezza: If you like the Dresden files or if you like supernatural fics (the genre not the show) then you'll love this. It is a crossover with Dresden files but you don't need to know anything about it in order to love this fic. It is a trilogy with each entry getting better and better. If you like a baddass harry that is extremely powerful but also realistic, then this is for you. (Unless you get turned off by demonic stuff in which casw you really won't like it)

3.  "The Black Queen Series" by Silently Watches: extremely dark, and not dor the faint of heart. But, if you survive the depravity then you will find the best damn female harry story ever. I say it is fem harry but in reality it is an oc mixed with harry and made into a girl. It is extremely well written and currently in progress with the 4th book in the series. It delves heavily into what are occasionally referenced as "the old ways" while also delving deep into how dark magic works. Again, powerful but not absurd main character. I only have this to say, it is in its 4th book and has yet to stop getting more amazing.

4.  "An Old and New World" by Lens of Sanity: this one has unfortunately been taken down from most sites, but it has been archived by many others and isn't too hard to find. This fic is the perfect combination of crack and epic plot. Harry is more than a bit crazy and it quickly infects everyone else. Not only that but fairly far in this fic contains the best damn time turner sequence ever written (seriously, its wprth reading for that alone). It is extremely funny and also somehow serious at the same time, it is wholly unique and a worthy read for any connoisseur of fanfiction.

5.  "Delenda Est" by Lord Silvere and Clahaim Solais: The best damn Harry/Bellatrix fic ever for a very important reason, time travel. Extremely well written time travel to the time before the first war as Harry desperately tries to stop the war before ot starts. Accidental time travel, amazingly well written Bellatrix and Harry, and the best damn characterization of the generation before the marauder era ever.

6.  "Vengence From The Grave" by MK-ONE: Not your typical hero fic, this neverless has one one of the best portrayals of "Soldier Harry" ive ever encountered. It has a unique and significantly dark premise that is nonetheless incredible and delivers spectacularly. If you are interested in the pairing it is Harry/Susan Bones. Very well written and explpres a lot of dynamics not often seen in fanfiction.

7.  "You're My Density" by robst: One of the best, if not THE best, time travel fics where the protagonists end up in their younger bodies. The plot hinges on the dedication of Hermione to Harry. (spoilers for literally chapter one, H/Hr is the pairing) basic premise: Harry lost his shit in the trial in OoTP and got the full banishment from the wizarding world with memory charms and everything treatment. Much later, voldy decides to go after him now that hes run out of things to do (harry hasn't really been a threat for awhile) and Hermione decides to save harry. She does so and they go back in time to fix what went wrong.

8.  "Harry Potter and The Rune Stone Path" by Temporal Knight: One of the very few well written Harem/Multi relationship fics out there. It has an interesting premise focuses on the use of ancient runes in many more ways that canon, it also has a natural development for the relationships between the characters. It is a quite fun fic, but also can be appropiately serious when needed. Certainly worth a read.

9.  "Harry Potter and The Girl Who Lived" by Agnostics Puppet: the summary of this is as follows. "Harry wakes in a universe where he meets, Rose, his female alternate self." That is the entire summary. It is extemely well written and manages to not be pervy despite the main pairing basically being Harry/Female Harry. (Quite an achievement if you ask me) all in all well written and distinctly cool. It has a set up for a potential sequel at the end, but it was written so that it wasnt technically necessary. Which is very good as the author hasn't gotten around to the sequel yet.

10. "Blindness" by AngelaStarCat: If you are intersted in the science of magic, complex moral dilemmas, discussion of real world issues in fictional settings, H/Hr goodness, powerful characters, cjaracter driven story, or any of the above. Then this is for you. It will most likely take you awhile to read this as it is very thought provoking, I have not in fact finished it yet so I don't know if it is even done. But it is well written and designed so that you can read a single chapter and feel satisfied most of the time. Also, it has some damn long chapters.

All of these are some of my personal favourites and I hardly ever see them being appreciated like they should be. The genres covered by these are varied and many, so there should be something for everyone. (Except for fans of extreme angst, crack, or modern AUs).
