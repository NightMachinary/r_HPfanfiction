Basically, I'm searching for a Harry Potter that is aware that he's doing dark things, but still believes that it doesn't matter in the long run. Things like killing people that aren't just death eaters, manipulating everyone, practicing dark spells, being ruthless, etc. I also don't want a fic that has Harry suddenly turn good and regrets everything he's ever done towards the end.


** Harry's pretty cutthroat but still dedicated to taking down the bad guys in

*** A good one, the title alone gave me goosebumps. While it fits the criteria, I'm not sure if it's what the OP is looking for.

** Linkffn(stages of hope)

doesn't really have a canon setting, though (Harry and a couple others that are from a dimension where they are losing the war dimension travel to a relatively peaceful dimension)

** This is a fun (albeit incomplete) work with a ruthless Harry. It's an interesting dark take on the do-over genre of fics.
