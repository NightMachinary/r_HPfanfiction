Bonus points if the time turner is shared by all teachers in the staff room. Further bonus points if it is explained as the reason Snape is always late for classes since his class is furthest from the staff room.

Instant approval and free-of-cost promotion on all relevant platforms if there is a scene with multiple Snapes turning up within seconds of each other and all deducting points from Gryffindor.

** High workload ? If you run the numbers teachers have only about 2-3 classes a day. That's under the standard in Germany actually

*** There's 7 years and 2 groups per year (classes are usually two houses paired together) so 14 groups of students. There's only 13 teachers. So teachers have to have a higher workload than students just in classes, plus correcting lots of homework essays and tests. And that's ignoring that electives are probably taught in smaller groups, so even more teacher workload. A secondary school where I went to had about 60 teachers for about 100 students per year and 8 years. Hogwarts has at least 40 students per year for 7 years, so they should have 21 teachers for a similar workload distribution. Hogwarts should have at least two teachers per primary subject and one per elective.

**** Not to mention that the Hogwarts teachers not only have their teaching workload, but also a pastoral workload that includes late night patrols around the school, plus the heads of houses also have to deal with all sorts of problems within the common room.

For example, Harry's dormitory mates immediately thought to get McGonagal when he vomited after a nightmare. There's approximately 70 pupils in any given house, all living in close enough quarters for viruses to spread quickly.
