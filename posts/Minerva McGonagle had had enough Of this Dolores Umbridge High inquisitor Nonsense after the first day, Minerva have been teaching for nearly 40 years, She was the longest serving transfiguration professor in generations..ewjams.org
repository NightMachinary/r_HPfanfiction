She had taught Every minister , clerk, Auror And curse breaker to come out of Hogwarts Since Scammander Had been minister. So Minerva did What any seasoned professor would do when dealing with a Misbehaving former pupil. Minerva marched into that little rapscallion Fudge's Office and dragged Him out by his ear, She stood there staring over his shoulder while he signed into law A retraction of the high inquisitor laws, Putting a kibosh on ministry interference at Hogwarts, At least by fudge's administration.

Minerva left a terrified minister in her wake but not before tapping her wand On his desk transforming a paperweight into a cat as a not so subtle stone reminder that she had her eye on him.


** oh god i need this

slughorn cant be the only teacher to still be in touch with former students and while the rest aren't as obvious as him they probably helped student they favoured get jobs or apprenticeships or even just writing them recommendation letters

** Minerva McGonagall had had enough of these trumped up charges against the son of her favourite lion cubs. She decided then and there that gloomy and overcast day that she was going to put a stop to the young and foolish ministers plans. It didn't matter that she wasn't apart of the ministry or that she didn't have the authority. She had been teaching at Hogwarts for nigh on 40 years. Everyone remembers the stern yet fair Professor Mcgonagall, and she remembers each and every single student to walk through her door, from the very first class as new students to the very last class where she wishes them well in their chosen careers.

"CORNELIUS OSWALD FUDGE" thundered the most fearsome lioness to ever grace Hogwarts halls. "How dare you bring up these-...these utterly shameful fabrications about Mr Potter. I have half a mind to give you detention young man. As it is that will be 50 points from Slytherin. Now you will cease this utter farce of a trial, apologize to Mr Potter and you will be giving me a foot long essay on why it is wrong to try and manipulate and lie to people. Am I understood?"

Minerva would then go on to get him to write essays on how to be a better minister, on why taking bribes from people was wrong and dishonest, and why listening to people and finding the facts in their stories worked better than sticking your head in the sand. By the end of the summer holidays Fudge had rooted out all the death eaters and supporters from the ministry. Bolstered the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and crippled Voldemorts army by passing laws giving equal rights to all creatures and halfbloods and muggleborns.

Everyone attested the decisive victory against Voldemort to Minister Fudge. His Order of Merlin Second Class was simply the cherry on top for his accomplishments.

However, what few knew, and even fewer realised later on; was that the biggest reason the war against the worst Dark Lord Britain had ever seen was so quickly and abruptly ended is that Minerva McGonagall was the true force of change behind the Ministers change of heart.

Also if you're swiping you can get some inversing miss takes.

****** Actually, swipe type works better for me than individual letters. But yeah, I'm just very conscious of what I'm writing. I rewrite everything, all the time. Great when I need something to look good, bad when I need something fast.

Example: I revised this comment twice.
