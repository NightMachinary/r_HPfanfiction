****** I was about to say that rather then make the story interesting, it makes the author more interesting - from a clinical point of view.

But no. On second thoughts, that sounds to me more like some fourteen-year old boy writing the vilest thing he can think of, just to shock.

  The summer after his first year at Hogwarts, Harry returns to Privet Drive to learn his uncle has procured him a part time job. That news isn't half as shocking as what the actual job entails.

  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone who has a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be the hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

** I'll get back to this, I'm at work now, but I read one where Hermione gets hit with a spell that turns her into a slut, then another that turns her into a dom, then she gets impregnated by a tentacle monster, then the last chapter literally has her mindfucking Luna. ie, she grows a dick and sticks it in Luna's ear. Magic, bro. It was messed up, but well written smut.
