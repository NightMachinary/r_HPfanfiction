Like I said, I have made a colossal mistake. I have just finished reading one of the best slow-burn relationship-building fics ever. I mean. It has absolutely thrown me into a pit of despair that I will never be that good at slow, sneaky, companionship developing. (Of course I'll rec it to everyone, it's: Snake In The Grass [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13559415/chapters/31115229]] a Snarry fic)

Y'all. I'm absolutely devastated. I'll never be that good. I need to head off this swell of depression and anxiety before it claws into me too deeply.

I know it may come across like a rude request, but I really need to read some fics that we're written solely for the love of the fandom, for the love of writing, even for the love of love and not because the author had the best plotline, the best handle on grammar, realistic cause and effect, or how a mature relationship would actually play out.

Slash is /preferred/, though not absolutely necessary and Snarry is my favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è I'd prefer not troll-level amounts of craziness and misspellings (if it has the word goffick seemingly unironically in it and every character has black hair with colored tips you may have dug too deep...) Crack-treated-seriously is perfect for this... to remember how to have fun. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, have fun. (--is going to be my new mantra) NO dark fics, no DEATH fics, (I cannot overstate my difficulties with depression) but abuse and such are fine especially in a hurt-comfort setting (especially those which are overtly dramatic are fine)

Thank you so much to anyone who responds, I'm not exaggerating about how helpful it will be for me to head off this trigger. Otherwise it could be weeks digging myself out

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M
