** Can vampires be made from corpses? I thought they had to be living first. But I would like a fic with Sirius as a poltergeist preferably as he comes out of the other side of the veil.

*** From the Wikipedia entry on vampires:

#+begin_quote
  The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead.
#+end_quote

Using that, we could say that they were brought back as one when the Potter family cat leapt over their dead body.

** It would make an interesting Snape bashing fic... where he wanted Lily so badly that he stole her body from her grave and found a way to bring her back as a strange Vampire or a Zombie or something similar and Harry finds out and has to find a way to save her. Unfortunately I haven't run across a fic like this.

*** linkffn(Dark Magic by Zireael07) has SS behave... not strictly evil, but more as if he lost his wits after surviving Nagini. He somehow resurrects her, and while she doesn't turn undead or similar, she seems only marginally more in touch with reality, neither of them remaining sane. I found the fic rather disturbing.
