Preferably completed and before the epilogue :D I need to find a way to NOT do school work. Any ideas? Thanks in advance, much love to you all!


** So this is post DH, but is a timetravel back to the Muggle World Wars. It's really long, and pretty well researched and okay okay written. No publication quality writing, but not too bad either. Hope you enjoy! :)

#+end_quote

Well... that seems like a given. Probably my biggest reason for reading any post-DH fics is to forget about the terrible epilogue (EWE).

A few one-shots come to mind concerning that particular topic:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8979274/1/Love-is-a-Many-Splendored-thing]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7318500/1/One-Big-Happy-Weasley-Family]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7336803/1/Wizard-Behind-the-Wheel]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3808497/1/The-Road-Not-Taken]])

Is there a collection of epilogue bashing one-shots somewhere? I *really* enjoy those.

Longer post-DH fics I enjoyed:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]]) (Abandoned though :/)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall]]) A very different continuation. First chapter is probably the strongest.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8693743/1/Senses]]) Fic focuses on the canon relationships and why they wouldn't work out.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3878384/1/A-Wonderful-Caricature-of-Intimacy]]). Post-DH Dramione. Usually not my thing at all (post-DH is probably the only scenario where I could see Dramione happen at all)... very fluffy, but I remember it for some reason. Kinda stuck with me.

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect.

** linkffn(Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard) is an excellent Post-DH oneshot with good humor and spot on characterizations. Similarly, linkffn(The Wendell That Wasn't by opalish) is a humorous oneshot about how Harry's children got their names.

For something longer, I'd recommend linkffn(Lost Time by Amerision) which is an incredible political thriller that not many people know of sadly. It's also abandoned, but the author has been sighted recently, so perhaps we'll get an update one day.

*** I just read this and loved it. I actually think the secondary characters were my favorite part. I was really pleased with how canon compliment everyone was, character wise, especially considering the plot. Neville is the absolute best.

** Detox by CambAngst over on HPFF.com or on Ao3. It's completed on HPFF, not sure if he's finished uploading it on Ao3. It follows Draco post war and before Astoria and it's amazingly written.

HP/NT.
