1) LV or TMR mentors Harry 2) Harry might not be a sycophant of LV but nor does he turn his back on him. (So no The Darkness Within rec, plz) Even if he does, it should be on the much later part of the whole story cuz what I'm looking for is mentor/protege relationship. 3) Harry can be either dark or grey or light, but at least has some saving people thing.

I love HPMoR and PotDK vibe so much. I've already read Ice crux/Dawn crux. Thanks in advance!

Voldemort is in Harry's head (Tom Riddle more specifically) due to the Horcrux and will manipulate Harry. Tom Riddle will be teaching and can also possess Harry for certain periods of time, meaning Harry effectively has a scarier alter-ego.
