hello all, i'm looking for some recommendations for blackinnon fanfics :) i know its a bit of a less mainstream pairing but i do love that couple what can we do.. i'm not opposed to some 5mut and i've already read the rise and fall (which is arguably the cementing piece of the blackinnon stans)

thanks!!
