So I love the anime Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, one of my favorite anime out there. So I was wondering if there were any Harry Potter stories that dealt with alchemy? Perhaps combined with magic or not either way is fine.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.

I do NOT want a crossover, I just want Alchemy used in the Harry Potter story.

I do NOT want Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, I don't like either pairing. But any other pairing is fine.

Would rather see it completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is okay.


** Azoth is a classic potions & alchemy drarry fanfic, and it is completed. Linkao3(1049966)

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** Appears briefly in linkffn(Lady Archimedes), where we see that even after he gave up the Transfiguration Professor position to Minerva McGonagall, Dumbledore kept teaching a NEWT-level Alchemy elective, which Hermione briefly takes before, well, you know how Dumbledore seems to have trouble surviving any fanfics...

** Linkffn(pureblood pretence)

in 3rd part Harry takes an alchemy course with professor Dumbledore. And while the topic is not glossed over it's not main part of the fic either. Awesome read nonetheless.
