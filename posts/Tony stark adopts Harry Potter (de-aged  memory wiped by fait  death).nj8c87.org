:END:
I just came across a fic but lost it again and no matter how hard I look I can't seem to find it back.

The first chapter was about faith and death having pity on harry and he was de-aged to a 3 year old with no memories to have a new / better life. Was found in an abandoned building in a cupboard and was placed in an orphanage. Tony vists because he has to and finds him and adopts him.

Thats as far as I got in the fic before it slipped my computers mind...

Any clues?
