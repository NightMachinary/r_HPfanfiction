Hello all, I'm hoping you can help me find a Lily/James fanfiction I've been wanting to re-read, but read before I started favoriting fics online.

Plot: So it's your typical James/Lily, but Lily dates this abusive jackass in it. At one point they break up, but then they get back together again. There is something with an imperious curse, and her friends have to help her get out of the relationship. Other Helpful Parts: Okay so I know it is (or was) on fanfiction.net, and it is most likely >100K words

I hope someone knows about it! Thanks!
