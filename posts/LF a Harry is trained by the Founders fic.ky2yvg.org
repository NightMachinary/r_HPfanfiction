:END:
From what I remember, those who were considered heirs of the founders were taken back in time to train with them, then given a task they needed to complete. Harry's task is to take down Voldemort who was also an heir, along with Dumbledore. Harry goes under a different name and I think he becomes an apprentice to Snape on Dumbledore's orders? It was also definitely on ffn.

I used to really love this fic so any help would be brilliant.
