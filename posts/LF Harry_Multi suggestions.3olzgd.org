looking for your recommendations and what you think are the must-read for anyone whos trying to get into/or is a fan of "harry's harem" stories. i would also like some fics that focus more on romance than the plot itself as the very few "harry/multi" ones i've read takes the plot /way/ too seriously.


** I'll be blunt: if you are looking for something that is not a train-wreck, you will need quite a lot of plot, even more of it than romance, if you are going for any story with polygamy in a setting where this is not the default state of things. Not necessarily plot as in “things completely unrelated to it”, but polygamistic relationships are generally made of problems and what passes for interpersonal politics, and those do generate a lot of plot.

So really, as far as my opinion on the subject matter goes, there are no recommendations of a fiction that is first and foremost romance and features any “whatever/multi” pairing, including the one you asked for.

That being said, you might want to check the already-existing recommendation threads, both here and on other forums. If there is anything of that sort worth attention, there's bound to be a link to that already, right?

** here's two Harry/Hermione/Ron fics that are believable, romantic and have some nice smut.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951061/chapters/1859733]])

And here's a nice fic from an alternate site that has basicly the same plot and quality (except for when the author does flashback but those don't happen often) but every thing turns out better.

Both of these fics are cannon compliant and features lots and lots of group sex as well as romance. I can't recommend them enough.

When it comes to Harry's/harem stories romance really isn't an option because romance take screen time. You can have a harem or you can have romance, you can't have both.
